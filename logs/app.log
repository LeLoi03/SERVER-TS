The conference brings together information security researchers, practitioners, developers, and users from all over the world to explore cutting-edge ideas and results. CCS 2025 will be held in Taipei, Taiwan from October 13-17, 2025.","callForPapers":"# ACM CCS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy.  The conference will be held in **Taipei, Taiwan from October 13-17, 2025**.\n\n## Review Cycles\n\nCCS has two review cycles in 2025. For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:\n\n*   **Accept:** Papers will be accepted for publication and presentation at the conference, possibly after making minor changes.\n*   **Minor revision:** Papers are considered promising but need some minor additional work. Authors will be given the opportunity to resubmit revised papers.\n*   **Reject:** Papers are declined for inclusion in the conference. Papers rejected from the first review cycle may not be submitted again to the second review cycle.\n\n## Paper Submission Information\n\nAll submissions must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the corresponding deadline. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings. All submissions should be properly anonymized.\n\n## Mandatory Reviewing\n\nAuthors submitting 3 papers or more may be required to submit reviews for other papers at CCS 2025. Authors who fall into this category will be requested to provide information for review matching and complete an attestation for reviewing ethics. Authors failing to provide the requested information may see their paper desk-rejected.\n\n## Withdrawing Policy\n\nA paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper cannot be withdrawn.\n\n## Paper Format\n\nSubmissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format using \"sigconf\" 2-column format, no more than 12 pages long, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.\n\n## Providing Artifacts at Submission Time\n\nSubmissions whose claimed contributions rely on artifacts (e.g., code, models, data sets) are expected to make these accessible to the reviewers, unless there are good reasons not to, in which case these reasons must be mentioned in the submission.\n\n## Optional Artifact Evaluation\n\nA special call for artifacts will follow for all authors of accepted papers (including shepherd approved and minor revisions) who are encouraged to submit artifacts for evaluation.\n\n## Conference Tracks\n\nACM CCS features a multi-track format. Each track operates as a separate mini-conference, with its own Track Chairs and Track Program Committee.  At the time of submission, authors must select one track.\n\n### Program Co-Chairs\n\n*   David Lie (University of Toronto)\n*   Véronique Cortier (CNRS, Loria)\n\n### Track Chairs\n\n*   **Software Security:** Alexandra Dmitrienko (Würzburg University), Yinqian Zhang (Southern University of Science and Technology)\n*   **Web Security:** Yinzhi Cao (Johns Hopkins University)\n*   **Network Security:** Kun Sun (George Mason University)\n*   **Security Usability and Measurement:** Emiliano De Cristofaro (University of California, Riverside), Yixin Zou (Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy)\n*   **Machine Learning and Security:** Neil Gong (Duke University), Elissa Redmiles (Georgetown University), Ben Y.

The MobiCom conference series serves as a highly selective, premier international forum addressing networks, systems, algorithms, and applications that support mobile computers and wireless networks. MobiCom 2025 will be held in Hong Kong, China, from November 4-8, 2025.","callForPapers":"# MobiCom 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design, and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems, and applications.\n\n## MobiCom 2025 Emphasis\n\nMobiCom 2025 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work.\n\n## Special Category: Challenge, Experience, and Verification Papers\n\nMobiCom 2025 will have a separate category for challenge, experience, and verification papers. These are full papers that provide detailed technical insights from real-world deployments, especially in settings that are not easy for most in the community to duplicate (e.g., due to scale).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Summer**\n    *   Abstract Registration: August 29, 2024, 23:59 AoE\n    *   Paper Submission: September 5, 2024, 23:59 AoE\n    *   Early Notification: October 25, 2024\n    *   Final Notifications: December 10, 2024\n*   **Winter**\n    *   Abstract Registration: March 11, 2025, 23:59 AoE\n    *   Paper Submission: March 18, 2025, 23:59 AoE\n    *   Early Notification: May 10, 2025\n    *   Final Notifications: June 24, 2025\n\n## Topics\n\nWe invite submissions on a wide range of mobile computing, mobile systems, mobile applications, and wireless networking research, including but not limited to the following:\n\n*   Edge and cloud computing\n*   Embedded and energy-harvesting systems\n*   Backscatter communication and wireless power\n*   Implantable and wearable computing\n*   Millimeter-wave and terahertz communications\n*   Mobile health\n*   Applications of machine learning\n*   Transfer learning and domain adaptation for mobile applications\n*   Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI for mobile and wireless systems\n*   Next generation of mobile networks (5G, 6G and beyond)\n*   Mobile web, video, virtual reality, augmented reality, and other applications\n*   Novel applications of wireless signals\n*   Practical quantum applications and systems\n*   Vehicular, robotic, and drone-based networking\n*   Communication with reconfigurable and intelligent reflective surfaces, meta materials, and flexible surfaces\n*   Satellite networks and integrated satellite-terrestrial networks\n*   Security and privacy issues/solutions for mobile/wireless systems\n*   Sensing with radio, light, sound, and acoustics\n*   Smart cities and smart spaces\n*   Ubiquitous computing and mobile human-computer interaction\n*   Underwater networking and sensing\n*   Visible light communications\n*   Wireless localization and tracking\n*   Reducing carbon footprint of wireless networks and mobile devices\n\n## Two Deadlines, Early Notification, and One-shot Revision\n\nMobiCom 2025 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews.\n\n## Final Decisions\n\n*   **Accept:** Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be conditionally accepted. The papers that go through a successful anonymous shepherding process will eventually be accepted.\n*   **Reject:** Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to.\n*   **One-Shot-Revision:** Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the next deadline.\n\n## Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers\n\nThe authors of accepted MobiCom 2025 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on the paper’s acceptance, but is strongly encouraged. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive badges printed on the papers themselves.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nAll paper submissions will be handled electronically at the [MobiCom 2025 paper submission website](https://mobicom25.hotcrp.com/).\n\n## ACM Publications Policies\n\nBy submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies including ACM's new Publications Policy on [Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).\n\n## ORCID IDs\n\nPlease ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.

Please refer to each track's page for details.\n\n## Submission Policies\n\nPapers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period.  Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions. To prevent double submissions, the chairs might compare submissions with related conferences. The double submission restriction applies only to refereed journals and conferences, not to unrefereed forums (e.g., arXiv.org). To check for plagiarism issues, the chairs might use external plagiarism detection software. All publications are subject to the ACM Author Representations policy. All authors and co-authors are subject to ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Possible violations will be reported to ACM for further investigation. \n\n## Submission Format\n\nDifferent tracks use different formats; please read carefully below. All submissions must be in English and in PDF format. Papers must not exceed the page limits listed for each call for papers. The ACM styles have changed recently, and all authors should use the official “ACM Primary Article Template”. For Microsoft Word users, please still use the “Interim Template” and not the New Workflow for ACM Publications. This should result in a two-columns format. For LaTeX users, please refer to the `sample-sigconf.tex` example file in the template available on the ACM Proceedings Template page.\n\n## Double-Anonymous Review Process\n\nThe double-anonymous review process is not employed by all tracks. Check in the call for papers whether it is used or not.  The FSE Research Papers Track employs a double-anonymous review process where external reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of external reviewers. Papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission Deadlines:**\n    *   Research Papers: September 12, 2024\n    *   Industry Papers: September 12, 2024\n    *   Ideas, Visions and Reflections Papers: September 12, 2024\n    *   Journal First: September 12, 2024\n    *   Student Research Competition: September 12, 2024\n    *   Demonstrations: September 12, 2024\n    *   Posters: September 12, 2024\n    *   Artifacts: September 12, 2024\n    *   Doctoral Symposium: September 12, 2024\n    *   Workshops: October 15, 2024\n    *   Software Engineering Education: January 24, 2025\n    *   Tutorials: February 3, 2025\n    *   Internetware Research Track: March 1, 2025\n    *   Internetware New Idea Track: April 5, 2025\n    *   Internetware Tool Demonstration Track: March 24, 2025\n*   **Notification Dates:**\n    *   Research Papers: October 27, 2024\n    *   Industry Papers: March 25, 2025\n    *   Ideas, Visions and Reflections Papers: March 14, 2025\n    *   Journal First: April 4, 2025\n    *   Student Research Competition: March 24, 2025\n    *   Demonstrations: March 10, 2025\n    *   Posters: April 10, 2025\n    *   Artifacts: March 24, 2025\n    *   Doctoral Symposium: April 10, 2025\n    *   Workshops: November 19, 2024\n    *   Software Engineering Education: March 25, 2025\n    *   Internetware Research Track: March 30, 2025\n    *   Internetware New Idea Track: April 15, 2025\n    *   Internetware Tool Demonstration Track: April 7, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready Deadlines:**\n    *   Research Papers: February 11, 2025, April 24, 2025\n    *   Industry Papers: April 21, 2025\n    *   Ideas, Visions and Reflections Papers: April 24, 2025\n    *   Posters: April 24, 2025\n    *   Demonstrations: April 24, 2025\n    *   Workshops: April 24, 2025\n    *   Doctoral Symposium: April 24, 2025\n    *   Student Research Competition: April 24, 2025\n    *   Tutorials: April 14, 2025\n    *   Internetware Research Track: May 10, 2025\n    *   Internetware New Idea Track: May 10, 2025\n    *   Internetware Tool Demonstration Track: May 10, 2025\n    *   Software Engineering Education: April 21, 2025\n    *   PROMISE: April 24, 2025\n    *   AI IDE: April 24, 2025","information":"Conference dates: June 23 -

The 2025 conference will be held in **Berlin, Germany**.\n\n## Mission\n\nThe PODS community aims to provide a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques, and solutions for the data management challenges that continually arise in our data-driven society.  Our goal is to develop solutions that ensure high levels of efficiency, scalability, usability, expressiveness, robustness, security, clarity, and privacy, among others.\n\n## Scope\n\nPODS seeks scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application, and system building in the context of data management.  Such articles might be based on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks, providing experimental work, or a rigorous analysis of important industry artifacts.\n\n## Topics\n\nTopics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Database processing\n*   Database design\n*   Database access\n*   Data quality\n*   Data analysis\n*   Uncertainty\n*   Interoperability\n*   Responsible data management\n*   Human-database interaction\n*   Connections between database principles and other disciplines\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025)\n\n## Submission Format\n\n**Important:** The submission format for PODS 2025 is different from that of previous years, for compatibility with the PACMMOD format of the PODS publications.\n\n*   LaTeX users must format their submission using the standard ACM \"acmsmall\" proceedings stylesheet: [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)\n*   They must use the following class declaration: `\\documentclass[acmsmall,review,anonymous]{acmart}`\n*   A submission can be up to 15 pages, not including references, plus unlimited space for references.

Typical, but not exclusive, topics of interest include:\n\n*   Algorithms and data structures\n*   Computational complexity\n*   Randomness in computing\n*   Algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics\n*   Analysis of Boolean functions\n*   Approximation algorithms\n*   Cryptography\n*   Computational learning theory\n*   Continuous and discrete optimization\n*   Economics and computation\n*   Parallel and distributed algorithms\n*   Quantum computing\n*   Algorithmic coding theory\n*   Computational geometry and topology\n*   Computational applications of logic\n*   Algebraic computation\n*   Computational and foundational aspects of areas such as machine learning, fairness, privacy, networks, data management, databases, and computational biology\n\nPapers that extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged. The program committee will make every effort to consider a broad range of areas.\n\n## Submission Format\n\nSubmissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information, and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit, and authors are encouraged to use the \"full version\" of their paper as the submission.\n\nEach submission should contain, within the initial ten pages following the title page, a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.  This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea. Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.\n\nAlthough there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.\n\n## Double-Blind Reviewing\n\nSTOC 2025 will use double-blind reviewing, and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person.\n\n## Conflict of Interest Policy\n\nThe submission process will include a declaration of conflicts of interest (COI), to help manage the double-blind review process. This declared COI information can only be seen by the program committee chair and thus cannot be used by the rest of the program committee to deanonymize authors. STOC 2025 will use the following Conflict of Interest Policy, which combines aspects suggested by SafeToC and the ACM Conflict of Interest policy.  Authors should limit their COI declaration to the following categories:\n\n*   Family member or close friend.\n*   Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years.\n*   Person with the same affiliation.\n*   Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.)\n*   Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter).\n*   Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipients of joint funding (within the last 2 years or reasonably expected within the next year) who you believe cannot objectively review your work.\n\nIf an author believes that they have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, then they can contact the PC chair or any ToC advocate affiliated with this conference directly.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nAuthors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing). The [submission server](https://stoc25.hotcrp.com/) is scheduled to open on October 1, 2024.\n\nIt is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline.\n\n## Prior and Simultaneous Submissions\n\nThe conference will follow SIGACT's policy on prior publication and simultaneous submissions. Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which is scheduled for publication prior to June 2025, will not be considered for acceptance at STOC 2025. The only exception to this policy are prior or simultaneous publications appearing in the Science and Nature journals. SIGACT policy does not allow simultaneous submissions of the same (or essentially the same) material to another conference with published proceedings.\n\n## Presentation of Accepted Papers\n\nOne author of each accepted paper will be expected to register and present the work in the form of a talk at the conference.  Authors are expected to contact the program chair before submission in case it is anticipated that a strong reason (e.g., international travel restrictions) would prevent all authors from attending the conference.  Authors will also be asked to upload a recording of their talk in advance of the conference, to enable it to be viewed by people who cannot attend in person.\n\n## Best Paper Award\n\nThe program committee may designate up to three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best Papers. All submissions are automatically eligible.\n\n## Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award\n\nA prize of $500 will be given to the author(s) of the best student-authored paper (or split between more than one paper if there is a tie).

Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.\n\n## Double-Blind Reviewing\n\nPOPL 2025 will use a full double-blind reviewing process. This means that identities of authors will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted papers.\n\n## Evaluation Process\n\nPOPL 2025 will have five Associate Chairs who will help the PC Chair monitor reviews, solicit external expert reviews for submissions when there is not enough expertise on the committee, and facilitate reviewer discussions.\n\nAs in previous years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to reviews. Responses are optional. A response must be concise, addressing specific points raised in the reviews; in particular, it must not introduce new technical results. Reviewers will write a short reaction to these author responses.\n\n## Submission Site Information\n\nThe submission site is [https://popl25.hotcrp.com](https://popl25.hotcrp.com).\n\nAuthors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline. The submission deadline is **11:59 PM July 11, 2024, anywhere on earth**.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nFor each submission, the authors must make sure that they properly declare all potential conflicts of interest for all of the authors of that submission.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nEach paper should have no more than 25 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the PACMPL format (specifically, the `acmart` LaTeX class with `acmsmall` option). Use of a different format is grounds for summary rejection.  Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper.\n\n## Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers\n\nAuthors of conditionally accepted papers will be invited to formally submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact submission is strongly encouraged but voluntary and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.\n\n## Copyright, Publication, and Presentation\n\nAs a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support libre open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license.\n\n## Distinguished Paper Awards\n\nAt most 10% of the accepted papers of POPL 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are AoE (UTC-12h)\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** July 11, 2024\n*   **Conditional Accept decisions announced:** October 8, 2024\n*   **Beginning of Author Response Period:** September 11, 2024\n*   **End of Author Response:** September 20, 2024\n*   **Authors of conditional accepted papers send their revised versions:** October 25, 2024\n*   **Final acceptance notifications sent to authors:** November 7, 2024\n*   **Camera ready deadline:** November 22, 2024\n*   **Conference:** January 19-25, 2025\n*   **Early registration deadline:** December 20, 2024\n\n## Program Committee Chair\n\nArmando Solar-Lezama, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, United States\n\n## Associate Chairs\n\n*   Zachary Kincaid, Princeton University, United States\n*   Xavier Leroy, Collège de France, France\n*   Ruzica Piskac, Yale University, United States\n*   Nadia Polikarpova, University of California at San Diego, United States\n*   Sharon Shoham, Tel Aviv University, Israel","information":"Conference dates: January 19 -

This applies equally to emerging domains, such as systems of systems, interconnected and embedded systems, distributed data and intelligence, machine learning environments, human-centered computing, non-von Neumann architectures, cloud/edge/fog infrastructures, data streaming, and social networks, and also to traditional domains, such as web-based, data centers, mobile and wireless systems, and real-time systems. As a result, our systems become more complex and, therefore, more difficult to engineer and understand. We need to manage this complexity so that our systems remain reliable, trustworthy, and performant.\n\nICPE brings together researchers and practitioners to report state-of-the-art and in-progress research on performance engineering of software, networks, and systems, including but not limited to performance modeling, analysis, measurement, benchmark design, and run-time performance management.

The correct template for submission is single-column [Word Submission Template](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word) and single-column [LaTeX](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-latex) (using “manuscript” style). You may also use [Overleaf](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/overleaf).\n\nThe length of most accepted technical papers will be 7,500 to 10,000 words (4,000 to 5,000 for short technical papers); note that references do not count towards these word counts.\n\n### Accessible Submissions\n\nYour PDF submission must be accessible. Please refer to the [instructions on creating an accessible ACM conference paper](https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-pdf-author-guide/) on how to accomplish this. Paper submissions that are not accessible will be desk rejected.\n\n### Optional Accessible Video Figures\n\nYou may include an optional video figure as supplementary material (up to five minutes long). Video figures are strongly encouraged for papers that introduce a novel system or interaction technique. Video figures must be accessible (include audio narration and text captions).\n\n### Anonymous Submissions\n\nASSETS will utilize a fully anonymous review process for Technical Papers. Authors must anonymize their paper submissions, all supplemental materials, and video figures. All author names, affiliations, and contact information should be removed. You should not anonymize references to your prior work. Instead, you should refer to all prior work in the third person.\n\n### Review Process\n\nSubmissions that do not meet formatting or accessibility guidelines, are not properly anonymized, are out of the topical scope of the conference, or are otherwise deemed non-competitive by the program chairs may be rejected without review. Otherwise, submissions will be peer-reviewed by an international panel. Authors with sufficiently high review scores will have an opportunity to submit a “Rebuttal” after receiving the reviews.\n\n### How to Submit\n\nThe submission deadline is Wednesday, April 16, 2025, 11:59 P.M. Anywhere on Earth (UTC -12:00). Please submit via the [ASSETS 2025 technical papers submission site](https://new.precisionconference.com/assets).\n\n### Contact\n\nFor further information or any questions regarding technical paper submissions, please contact the Technical Program Chairs, Cynthia Bennett and Martez Mott, at [tpc-assets25@acm.org](mailto:tpc-assets25@acm.org).","information":"Conference dates: October 26 - 29, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: Denver, Colorado\nCity-State-Province: Denver, Colorado\nCountry: United States\nContinent: North America\nType: Offline\n(Technical Papers) Submission Deadline: April 16, 2025\n(Posters and Demos) Submission Deadline: June 25, 2025\n(Workshops) Submission Deadline: June 11, 2025\n(Experience Reports) Submission Deadline: June 11, 2025\n(Mentoring) Late Deadline: March 12, 2025\n(Doctoral Consortium) Student's Cover Letter, Research Project Summary, and CV: June 25, 2025\n(Student Research Competition) Submission Deadline: June 25, 2025\ninitial reviews sent to authors, rebuttal phase opens: May 28, 2025\nrebuttal phase closes: June 4, 2025\nacceptance decisions sent to authors: June 18, 2025\ncamera-ready deadline: July 16, 2025\nvideo presentation: July 23, 2025\nTopics: Computers and Accessibility, Computing for people with disabilities, Older adults, Design, Evaluation, Use, Education\nPublisher: ACM Digital Library"},{"title":"The ACM International System and Storage Conference","acronym":"SYSTOR","determineLinks":{"Call for papers link":"https://www.systor.org/2025/cfp/","Important dates link":"https://www.systor.org/2025/cfp/","Official Website":"https://www.systor.org/2025/"},"link":"https://www.systor.org/2025/","cfpLink":"https://www.systor.org/2025/cfp/","impLink":"https://www.systor.org/2025/cfp/","conferenceDates":"September 8 - 10, 2025","year":"2025","location":"Virtual (September 8-9) & Haifa, Israel (September 10)","cityStateProvince":"","country":"","continent":"","type":"Hybrid","submissionDate":{"(Full and Short Papers Track) Paper Submission":"May 20, 2025","(Posters with Extended Abstract Track) Poster & Abstract Submission":"July 3, 2025"},"notificationDate":{"(Full and Short Papers Track) Acceptance Notification":"July 10, 2025","(Posters with Extended Abstract Track) Acceptance Notification":"July 17, 2025"},"cameraReadyDate":{"(Full and Short Papers Track) Camera-ready":"August 21, 2025","(Posters with Extended Abstract Track) Camera-ready":"August 21, 2025"},"registrationDate":{},"otherDate":{},"topics":"Systems, Storage, Cloud, Distributed Systems, Networking, Systems Security, AI/ML Systems, Sustainability, Big Data Infrastructure, Embedded Systems, Real-time Systems, Fault Tolerance, Reliability, Availability, File Systems, Networked Systems, Mobile Systems, Wireless Systems, Peer-to-peer Systems, Sensor Systems, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Performance Evaluation, Workload Characterization, Runtime Systems, Compiler Support, Programming-language Support, System Deployment, System Usage, System Design, Emerging Storage Technologies, Virtualization, Containers, Storage 3.0, Systems for AI, AI for Systems","publisher":"","summary":"The ACM International Systems and Storage Conference (SYSTOR 2025) is an international forum for interaction across the systems research community.

To maintain ICAIL’s relevance in the larger rapidly-moving field at the intersection of law and artificial intelligence, all papers must make clear their relation to legal information, reasoning, or processes. There should be a statement about the novel scientific contribution. The relation to prior work must be well-developed. The paper ought to report a full and satisfying discussion of its findings.\n\nPapers on generative AI, machine learning or data mining should include discussions of the data, methodology, results, and analysis in sufficient depth beyond merely reporting metrics.\n\nSubmissions focusing on the reproduction, validation, constructive scrutinization, and extension of previously published works, datasets, and benchmarks are strongly encouraged.\n\nPapers proposing formal or computational models should provide examples and/or reproducible simulations.\n\nPapers on applications should describe the motivations, techniques, implementation, and evaluation.\n\nAll papers should include some discussion about the relevance to legal theory, practice, use of legal information, or impact on processes.\n\nIt is highly recommended that code and data be published alongside the papers for all submissions to facilitate reproducibility.\n\nPapers must be formatted using the ACM sigconf template (for LaTeX) or the interim template layout.docx (for Word), both at [http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). All papers should be converted to PDF prior to electronic submission. Please ensure you use the correct ACM sigconf template as indicated above. Note that some platforms may provide templates that are not fully compliant with the official ACM template. Papers that do not adhere to these conditions will be rejected without review.\n\nSubmissions can be made via the conftool platform, in the following link: [https://www.conftool.net/icail2025/](https://www.conftool.net/icail2025/)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Workshop and Tutorial Proposals Submission:** December 20, 2024\n*   **Paper Submission:** January 28, 2025\n*   **Demonstration Submission (including extended abstracts):** January 28, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance for Papers and Demonstrations:** April 14, 2025\n*   **Registration opens:** April 14, 2025 (tentative)\n*   **Camera Ready papers due:** May 5, 2025\n*   **Conference:** June 16-20, 2025\n\n## Organization\n\n*   **Northwestern University (at Pritzker School of Law, Chicago)**\n*   **Program Chair:** Juliano Maranhão\n*   **Local Chair:** Dan Linna\n*   **Local co-Chair:** Kris Hammond\n*   **IAAIL Secretary-Treasurer:** Michał Araszkiewicz\n\n## Contact\n\nIf you have any questions about the submission process, please direct them to [icail2025@conftool.net](mailto:icail2025@conftool.net).","information":"Conference dates: June 16 - 20, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: Northwestern University, Chicago\nCity-State-Province: Chicago\nCountry: United States\nContinent: North America\nType: Offline\nPaper Submission: January 28, 2025\nDemonstration Submission (including extended abstracts): January 28, 2025\nWorkshop and Tutorial Proposals Submission: December 20, 2024\nNotification of acceptance for Papers and Demonstrations: April 14, 2025\nCamera Ready papers due: May 5, 2025\nRegistration opens: April 14, 2025\nTopics: Artificial Intelligence and Law, Argument mining on legal texts, Classification and automatic summarization of legal text, Computational methods for negotiation and contract formation, Computer-assisted dispute resolution, Computable representations of legal rules and domain specific languages for the law, Decision support systems in the legal domain, Deep learning on data and text from the legal domain, Dialog systems in the legal domain, e-discovery and e-disclosure, e-government, e-democracy and e-justice, Empirical research on the use of AI systems in legal practice, Innovative applications in AI and Law, Philosophical and legal-theoretical analysis of the significance and implications of methodologies or technical features of AI systems, Systems and methods designed for compliance checking with respect to normative principles, rules and standards, Methodologies for the technical design in AI systems of compliance with normative principles, rules and standards of trustworthy or responsible AI, Explainable AI for the legal domain, Formal and computational models of legal reasoning, Formal and conceptual modeling of fundamental legal concepts, Formal and computational models of evidential reasoning, Formal models of norms and norm-governed systems, Information extraction from legal databases and texts, Information retrieval, question answering, and literature recommendation in the legal domain, Intelligent legal tutoring systems, Intelligent support systems for forensics, Interdisciplinary applications of legal informatics methods and systems, Knowledge acquisition techniques for the legal domain, Knowledge representation, knowledge engineering, and ontologies in the legal domain, Legal design involving AI techniques, Machine learning and data analytics applied to the legal domain, Natural language processing of legal text, Applications of generative AI systems to the legal domain, Normative reasoning by autonomous agents, Open and linked data in the legal domain, Smart contracts and application of blockchain in the legal domain, Visualization techniques for legal information and data\nPublisher: ACM"}],"msg":"crawlConferences finished successfully."}
