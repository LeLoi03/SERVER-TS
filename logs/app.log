The conference invites submissions of original contributions.","callForPapers":"# Call for Papers for IEEE ICDCS 2025\n\nThe 45th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2025) is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners to present, discuss, and exchange cutting-edge ideas and the latest findings on all aspects of distributed computing systems. The conference will take place from **July 20-23, 2025 in Glasgow, Scotland, UK**.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\n*   Cloud Computing\n*   Distributed Algorithms\n*   Big Data, Models & Systems\n*   Distributed Fault Tolerance\n*   Distributed OS and Middleware\n*   Edge Computing\n*   IoT + CPS\n*   Mobile Computing\n*   Security, Privacy and Trust\n*   Blockchains/Databases\n*   Distributed Systems for AI/ML\n*   AI/ML for Distributed Systems\n*   Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nThe Paper strand provides the opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.\n\n*   Papers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere.\n*   All paper submissions should follow the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template (downloadable by selecting “Conferences” in the IEEE-Template Selector [https://template-selector.ieee.org/](https://template-selector.ieee.org/)).\n*   Each submission can have up to eleven (11) pages (including figures, tables, appendices, and references).\n*   Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review.\n*   The paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent.\n*   While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content.\n*   To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymised GitHub repository with all source code, scripts, and data needed for the reproduction of their results.\n*   For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference in-person to present their work on-site. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.\n*   Authors should adhere to the ethical and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer to the [IEEE Code of Ethics](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/ethics/code.html) and [IEEE Policy on AI-Generated Text](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/#ai-generated-text).\n\n### Publication in IEEE TPDS\n\nA set of highly selected IEEE ICDCS 2025 papers will be considered for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS). The selected papers will undergo an extension process, transforming them from their initial IEEE ICDCS conference format. These extended versions will then be subject to a review by an editor from IEEE TPDS.\n\n## Important Dates (Anywhere on Earth (AoE))\n\n*   **Paper Abstract Registration:** **December 4, 2024 (Extended to December 11, 2024)**\n*   **Paper Submission Due:** **December 11, 2024 (Extended to December 18, 2024)**\n*   **Author Notification:** **April 2, 2025**\n*   **Camera-Ready Submission:** **April 16, 2025**\n\n## Submission Website\n\n*   [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icdcs2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icdcs2025) (Submission portal opens on 1 November 2024)\n\nFor inquiries regarding the Call for Papers, email: [icdcs2025@easychair.org](mailto:icdcs2025@easychair.org)\n"}],"event":"processing_finished_successfully","outputJsonl":"D:\\NEW-SERVER-TS\\src\\api\\v1\\crawl\\data\\final_output.jsonl","outputCsv":"D:\\NEW-SERVER-TS\\src\\api\\v1\\crawl\\data\\evaluate.csv","msg":"Conference processing finished.

The PODS symposium provides a forum for new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management. The conference includes research and industrial talks, tutorials, demos, and workshops.","callForPapers":"# PODS 2025: Call for Research Papers\n\nThe Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management. The 2025 conference will be held in **Berlin, Germany**.\n\n## Mission\n\nThe PODS community provides a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques, and solutions for data management challenges in our data-driven society. It develops new ways of advancing data management to reflect the rich landscape of data requirements in applications nowadays. Our goal is to develop solutions that ensure high levels of efficiency, scalability, usability, expressiveness, robustness, security, clarity, and privacy, among others. The PODS community is an open space where researchers from various areas related to the principles of computer science can discuss, interact, and propose solutions to problems in data management.\n\n## Scope\n\nPODS seeks scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application, and system building in the context of data management. Such articles might be based, among others, on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks, providing experimental work, or a rigorous analysis of important industry artifacts. PODS pays special attention to those papers that help in the urgent process of integrating data management techniques within broader computer science.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Database processing: Query evaluation, query optimization, schema management, distributed data processing, approximate data processing\n*   Database design: Data models, query languages, schemas, constraints\n*   Database access: Data structures, access methods, concurrency, transactions\n*   Data quality: Data consistency, data cleaning, data discovery, data exploration\n*   Data analysis: Data mining, machine learning, information extraction, data streams\n*   Uncertainty: Incomplete data, inconsistent data, probabilistic data\n*   Interoperability: Mappings and views, data integration, data exchange, ontology-based data access\n*   Responsible data management: Access control, privacy, security, verification, ethical aspects of data management\n*   Human-database interaction: data summarization, data visualization, explanation for database queries\n*   Connections between database principles and other disciplines\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025)\n\n## Submission Format\n\n*   The submission format for PODS 2025 is different from that of previous years, for compatibility with the PACMMOD format of the PODS publications.\n*   LaTex users must format their submission using the standard ACM \"acmsmall\" proceedings stylesheet: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template\n*   They must use the following class declaration: \\documentclass[acmsmall,review,anonymous]{acmart}\n*   A submission can be up to **15 pages**, not including references, plus unlimited space for references.\n*   Papers that are longer than 15 pages or do not cohere with the required format style risk rejection without consideration of their merits.\n*   The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere.\n*   Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms and accepted papers will be published in a PODS 2025 issue of the PACMMOD (https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod) journal.\n*   PODS will apply a double-blind reviewing process.\n\n## Double-anonymous reviewing\n\n*   Author names and institutions must be omitted.\n*   References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person.\n*   Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed.\n*   Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would.\n\n## Merit-based acceptance\n\nThe paper selection will be merit-based. The program committee will judge the work based on originality, quality, clarity of presentation, relevance to the field, and technical depth.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n### FIRST SUBMISSION PHASE:\n\n*   **Abstract:** May 31, 2024\n*   **Submission:** June 7, 2024\n*   **Rebuttal:** July 29 - August 1, 2024\n*   **Initial notification:** August 12, 2024\n*   **Revision submission:** August 26, 2024\n*   **Final notification:** September 2, 2024\n\n### SECOND SUBMISSION PHASE:\n\n*   **Abstract:** December 2, 2024\n*   **Submission:** December 9, 2024\n*   **Rebuttal:** February 3-7, 2025\n*   **Initial notification:** February 14, 2025\n*   **Revision submission:** February 28, 2025\n*   **Final notification:** March 7, 2025\n\nAll deadlines end at 5 PM Pacific Time."}],"event":"processing_finished_successfully","outputJsonl":"D:\\NEW-SERVER-TS\\src\\api\\v1\\crawl\\data\\final_output.jsonl","outputCsv":"D:\\NEW-SERVER-TS\\src\\api\\v1\\crawl\\data\\evaluate.csv","msg":"Conference processing finished.
