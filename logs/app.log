As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and by the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.\n\nPapers submitted to ACL 2025, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics.\n\n## Submission Topics\n\nACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas (in alphabetical order):\n\n*   Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics\n*   Dialogue and Interactive Systems\n*   Discourse and Pragmatics\n*   Efficient/Low-Resource Methods for NLP\n*   Ethics, Bias, and Fairness\n*   Generation\n*   Human-Centered NLP\n*   Information Extraction\n*   Information Retrieval and Text Mining\n*   Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP\n*   Language Modeling\n*   Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics\n*   Machine Learning for NLP\n*   Machine Translation\n*   Multilinguality and Language Diversity\n*   Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond\n*   NLP Applications\n*   Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation\n*   Question Answering\n*   Resources and Evaluation\n*   Semantics: Lexical and Sentence-Level\n*   Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining\n*   Speech recognition, text-to-speech and spoken language understanding\n*   Summarization\n*   Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing\n\n### Special Theme: Generalization of NLP Models\n\nACL 2025 will have a new theme with the goal of reflecting and stimulating discussion about the current state of development of the field of NLP: Generalization of NLP Models.\n\nThe possible topics of discussion include (but are not limited to) the following:\n\n*   How can we enhance the generalization of NLP models across various dimensions—compositional, structural, cross-task, cross-lingual, cross-domain, and robustness?\n*   What factors affect the generalization of NLP models?\n*   What are the most effective methods for evaluating the generalization capabilities of NLP models?\n*   While Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhance the generalization of NLP models, what are the key limitations of LLMs in this regard?\n\n## Submission Details\n\n*   Long Papers: (8 pages)\n*   Short Papers: (4 pages)\n*   Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers’ comments.\n\n## Review Process\n\nACL 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference.\n\n## Presentation at the Conference\n\nAll accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline may be subject to desk rejection.\n\n## Contact\n\n*   General Chair: Roberto Navigli\n*   Program Chairs: Wanxiang Che, Joyce Nabende, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar, Ekaterina Shutova\n*   For questions related to paper submission, email: editors@aclrollingreview.org\n*   For all other questions, email: acl2025pcs@gmail.com","information":"Conference dates: July 27 - August 1, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: Vienna, Austria\nCity-State-Province: Vienna\nCountry: Austria\nContinent: Europe\nType: Offline\nSubmission deadline (all papers are submitted to ARR): February 15, 2025\nARR reviews & meta-reviews available to authors of the February cycle: April 15, 2025\nNotification of acceptance: May 15, 2025\nCamera-ready papers due: May 30, 2025\nAuthor response period: March 27 - April 3, 2025\nCommitment deadline for ACL 2025: April 20, 2025\nWithdrawal deadline: May 30, 2025\nTutorials & Welcome Reception: July 27, 2025\nMain Conference Dates: July 28 - 30, 2025\nWorkshops: July 31 - August 1, 2025\nVisa information has been updated: March 31, 2025\nCall for Student Research Workshop is updated: March 16, 2025\nThe list of ACL tutorials is out: February 18, 2025\nThe list of ACL workshops is out: February 18, 2025\nCall for System Demonstrations is out: January 26, 2025\nSecond call for papers is out: January 20, 2025\nCall for Industry Track is out: December 3, 2024\nFirst call for papers is out: October 7, 2024\nThe ACL-NAACL-EMNLP joint call for tutorials is out: September 12, 2024\nTopics: Computational Linguistics, Natural Language Processing, Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics, Dialogue and Interactive Systems, Discourse and Pragmatics, Efficient/Low-Resource Methods for NLP, Ethics, Bias, and Fairness, Generation, Human-Centered NLP, Information Extraction, Information Retrieval and Text Mining, Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP, Language Modeling, Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics, Machine Learning for NLP, Machine Translation, Multilinguality and Language Diversity, Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond, NLP Applications, Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation, Question Answering, Resources and Evaluation, Semantics: Lexical and Sentence-Level, Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining, Speech recognition, text-to-speech and spoken language understanding, Summarization, Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing"},{"title":"International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent","acronym":"ACII","link":"https://acii-conf.net/2025/","cfpLink":"https://acii-conf.net/2025/call-for-papers/","impLink":"https://acii-conf.net/2025/important-dates/","determineLinks":{"Call for papers link":"https://acii-conf.net/2025/call-for-papers/","Important dates link":"https://acii-conf.net/2025/important-dates/","Official Website":"https://acii-conf.net/2025/"},"conferenceDates":"October 8 - 11, 2025","year":"2025","location":"Canberra, Australia","cityStateProvince":"Canberra","country":"Australia","continent":"Oceania","type":"Offline","submissionDate":{"(Main Track) Main track full paper submission deadline":"April 9, 2025","(Tutorials) Tutorial proposal submission deadline":"April 16, 2025","(Workshops and Challenges) Submission deadline for workshop proposals":"February 28, 2025","(Workshops and Challenges) Paper submission deadline for workshops":"June 30, 2025"},"notificationDate":{"(Main Track) Paper notification for the main track":"June 19, 2025","(Tutorials) Tutorial acceptance notification":"June 11, 2025","(Workshops and Challenges) Notification for workshop proposals":"March 14, 2025","(Workshops and Challenges) Workshop papers decision notification":"July 28, 2025"},"cameraReadyDate":{"(Main Track) Camera-ready paper submission deadline":"July 19, 2025","(Workshops and Challenges) Workshop camera-ready deadline":"August 20, 2025"},"registrationDate":{},"otherDate":{"(Main Track) Rebuttal period":"May 31 - June 4, 2025","(Main Track) Tutorials, Workshops, and Doctoral Consortium":"October 11, 2025","(Tutorials) Tutorials, Workshops, and Doctoral Consortium":"October 11, 2025","(Workshops and Challenges) Tutorials, Workshops, and Doctoral Consortium":"October 11, 2025"},"topics":"Affective Computing, Intelligent Interaction, Emotion Recognition, Affective Science, Social Robotics, Virtual Agents, Multimodal Data Fusion, Sentiment Analysis, Human-Computer Interaction","publisher":"IEEE","summary":"The 13th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII 2025) will be held in Canberra, Australia, from October 8-11, 2025.

It comprises two phases: we gather reviews from reviewers, and in the second phase submissions and reviews are re-evaluated by the Meta-reviewing Committee.\n*   Although the Organizers of Special Sessions are responsible for the review process, the final decision regarding acceptance will be made by the ACIIDS Program Committee.\n*   These rules aim to select the best papers and ensure the highest quality of the chosen papers. Our review model ensures that papers from both the Main Track and Special Sessions are held to an equally high standard.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   Special Session proposals: September 30, 2024\n*   Paper submission: January 19, 2025 (hard deadline)\n*   Notification of acceptance: February 10, 2025\n*   Camera-ready papers: February 24, 2025\n*   Registration & payment: February 24, 2025\n*   Conference: April 23-25, 2025\n\n## Special Session Chair\n\n*   Bogumiła Hnatkowska, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, Poland\n*   Krystian Wojtkiewicz, Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, Poland","information":"Conference dates: April 23 - 25, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: Kitakyushu, Japan\nCity-State-Province: Kitakyushu\nCountry: Japan\nContinent: Asia\nType: Offline\nPaper submission: January 19, 2025\nNotification of acceptance: February 10, 2025\nCamera-ready papers: February 24, 2025\nRegistration & payment: February 24, 2025\nSpecial Session proposals: September 30, 2024\nTopics: Intelligent Information Systems, Intelligent Database Systems\nPublisher: Springer"},{"title":"Australasian Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence","acronym":"AI","link":"https://ajcai2025.org/","cfpLink":"None","impLink":"None","determineLinks":{"Call for papers link":"None","Important dates link":"None","Official Website":"https://ajcai2025.org/"},"conferenceDates":"December 1 - 5, 2025","year":"2025","location":"Canberra, Australia","cityStateProvince":"Canberra","country":"Australia","continent":"Oceania","type":"Offline","submissionDate":{},"notificationDate":{},"cameraReadyDate":{},"registrationDate":{},"otherDate":{},"topics":"No topics","publisher":"No publisher","summary":"No summary available","callForPapers":"No call for papers available","information":"Conference dates: December 1 - 5, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: Canberra, Australia\nCity-State-Province: Canberra\nCountry: Australia\nContinent: Oceania\nType: Offline"},{"title":"International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security","acronym":"ACNS","link":"https://acns2025.fordaysec.de/","cfpLink":"http://acns2025.fordaysec.de/call-for-papers/","impLink":"None","determineLinks":{},"conferenceDates":"June 23 - 26, 2025","year":"2025","location":"Munich Urban Co-Lab, Munich, Germany","cityStateProvince":"Munich","country":"Germany","continent":"Europe","type":"Offline","submissionDate":{"(First submission deadline) Submission":"September 9, 2024","(Second submission deadline) Submission":"January 13, 2025"},"notificationDate":{"(First submission deadline) Notification":"November 11, 2024","(Second submission deadline) Notification":"March 17, 2025"},"cameraReadyDate":{"(First submission deadline) Camera-ready":"December 2, 2024","(Second submission deadline) Camera-ready":"April 7, 2025"},"registrationDate":{},"otherDate":{},"topics":"Applied Cryptography, Cyber Security, Network Security, Computer Security, Privacy","publisher":"Springer","summary":"The 23rd International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security (ACNS 2025) will be held in Munich, Germany, on June 23–26, 2025.

The link will be announced shortly before the paper deadline.\n\n*   ACNS 2025 will be an in-person conference. Authors submitting a paper must ensure that one of the authors can present the paper at the conference in person.\n*   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published (other than preprint) or accepted for publication or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings.\n*   ACNS encourages promising students to submit and present their results at the conference.\n\n### Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references.\n*   Each submission must begin with a title, short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader.\n*   All submissions must be submitted in PDF format, following the unmodified LNCS format and typeset using the corresponding LaTeX class file.\n*   They must fit within a page limit of 20 pages, including title and abstract, figures, etc., but excluding references.\n*   Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following the main body of the paper; however, reviewers are not required to read or review any supplementary material, and submissions are expected to be intelligible without it.\n\n## Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)\n\nACNS 2025 solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. We encourage the authors to distinguish SoK submissions by adding the “SoK:” prefix to the title.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and program committee members to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest.\n\n## Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure\n\nWhere research identifies a vulnerability, we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days to 90 days ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nACNS is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our community. If you have suggestions, concerns, or complaints related to biases or sexual harassment, we encourage you to reach out to the Conference Co-Chairs.\n\nWe encourage authors to be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing.\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n*   Marc Fischlin, TU Darmstadt\n*   Veelasha Moonsamy, Ruhr-University Bochum\n\n## Workshop Chair\n\n*   Mark Manulis, University of the Bundeswehr Munich","information":"Conference dates: June 23 - 26, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: Munich Urban Co-Lab, Munich, Germany\nCity-State-Province: Munich\nCountry: Germany\nContinent: Europe\nType: Offline\n(First submission deadline) Submission: September 9, 2024\n(Second submission deadline) Submission: January 13, 2025\n(First submission deadline) Notification: November 11, 2024\n(Second submission deadline) Notification: March 17, 2025\n(First submission deadline) Camera-ready: December 2, 2024\n(Second submission deadline) Camera-ready: April 7, 2025\nTopics: Applied Cryptography, Cyber Security, Network Security, Computer Security, Privacy\nPublisher: Springer"},{"title":"Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations","acronym":"AIAI","link":"https://ifipaiai.org/2025/","cfpLink":"https://ifipaiai.org/2025/call-for-papers/","impLink":"https://ifipaiai.org/2025/important-dates/","determineLinks":{"Call for papers link":"https://ifipaiai.org/2025/call-for-papers/","Important dates link":"https://ifipaiai.org/2025/important-dates/","Official Website":"https://ifipaiai.org/2025/"},"conferenceDates":"June 26 - 29, 2025","year":"2025","location":"Cyprus University of Technology, Limassol, Cyprus","cityStateProvince":"Limassol","country":"Cyprus","continent":"Europe","type":"Hybrid","submissionDate":{"Paper Submission Deadline":"February 27, 2025","Deadline for Workshops/Special Sessions Proposals":"January 10, 2025"},"notificationDate":{"Notification of Acceptance/Rejection":"March 23, 2025"},"cameraReadyDate":{"Camera Ready Submission/Registration":"April 20, 2025"},"registrationDate":{"Early / Author registration by":"April 20, 2025"},"otherDate":{},"topics":"Accessibility and Computers, Affective Computing, Agent and Multi-Agent Systems, AI and Ethical Issues, Artificial Neural Networks, Autonomous and Ubiquitous Computing, Biologically Inspired Neural Networks, Biomedical systems, Collective Computational Intelligence, Computational Intelligence, Computer Vision, Convolutional Neural Networks, Crisis and Risk Management, Cybersecurity and AI, Data Fusion, Data Mining and Information Retrieval, Decision Support Systems, Deep Learning, Distributed AI Systems and Architectures, eBusiness, eCommerce, eHealth, eLearning, Engineering and Industry, Environmental Intelligent Modelling, Evaluation of AI Systems, Evolving Systems – Optimization, Expert Systems, Finance and AI, Fuzzy Logic and Systems, Genetic Algorithms and Programming, Human-Machine Interaction / Presence Information and Optimization, Intelligent Real Time Monitoring and Control, Knowledge Acquisition and Representation, Mathematical Foundations of AI and Intelligent Computational methods, Multimedia, Graphics and Artificial Intelligent Music, Natural Language Processing, Pattern Recognition, Planning and Scheduling, Project Management Recommendation Systems, Recurrent Neural Networks and Reservoir Computing, Robotics and Virtual Reality, Signal and Image Processing, Smart Graphics, Social Impact of AI, Time Series and Forecasting","publisher":"No publisher","summary":"The 21st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations (AIAI 2025) will be held at the Cyprus University of Technology, Limassol, Cyprus, from June 26–29, 2025.

The multimedia community has a tradition of being able to handle big data, has been a pioneer in large-scale evaluations and dataset creations, and is uniquely angled towards novel applications and cutting-edge industrial challenges. As such, the conference openly embraces new intellectual angles from both industry as well as academia and welcomes submissions from related fields, such as data science, HCI, and signal processing.\n\n## Call for Regular Papers\n\nACM Multimedia 2025 calls for research papers presenting novel theoretical and algorithmic solutions to address problems across multimedia and related application fields. The conference also calls for papers presenting novel, thought-provoking ideas, and promising (preliminary) results in realising these ideas, especially surrounding multimodal AI, such as multi-agent, real-time human and machine intelligence working collaboratively.

Participants who are unable to travel for various reasons (health, caring requirements, visa status, costs, etc.) are offered an online channel. With a hybrid format, we aim to increase the accessibility of participating in research communities throughout the workshop.\n\nThe ALTA 2024 workshop is the key local forum for socializing research results in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics (CL). It will feature presentations, posters, and demonstrations from students, industry, and academic researchers. Like previous years, we also encourage submissions and participation from industry and government researchers and developers.\n\n## Topics\n\nALTA invites the submission of papers and presentations on all aspects of NLP and CL, including, but not limited to:\n\n*   Commonsense Reasoning.\n*   Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics.\n*   Dialogue and Interactive Systems.\n*   Discourse and Pragmatics.\n*   Efficient Methods for NLP.\n*   Ethics in NLP.\n*   Information Extraction.\n*   Information Retrieval and Text Mining.\n*   Interpretability, Interactivity and Analysis of Models for NLP.\n*   Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond.\n*   Language Modeling and Analysis of Language Models.\n*   Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics.\n*   Machine Learning for NLP.\n*   Machine Translation.\n*   Multilinguality and Linguistic Diversity.\n*   Natural Language Generation.\n*   NLP Applications.\n*   Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation.\n*   Question Answering.\n*   Resources and Evaluation.\n*   Semantics: Lexical, Sentence level, Document Level, Textual Inference, etc.\n*   Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining.\n*   Speech and Multimodality.\n*   Summarisation.\n*   Syntax, Parsing and their Applications.\n\nWe particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community by considering practical applications of language technology and multidisciplinary research. We also specifically encourage submissions from the industry.\n\n## Format\n\nWe invite submissions of three different formats:\n\n1.  Original Research Papers\n2.  Abstract-based Presentations\n3.  Industry Demonstrations\n\n### 1. Original Research Papers\n\nWe invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of NLP and CL.\n\n*   Long papers should be 7-8 pages, and short papers should be 3-4 pages (see further details below). Accepted papers will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site. In addition to the page count requirements, both short and long papers may include unlimited pages of references.\n*   Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly, submitted papers should not include the identity of the author(s) and the text should be suitably anonymized, e.g. using third-person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your personal website, properly anonymizing public repositories, etc.\n*   Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.\n\n### 2. Abstract-based Presentations\n\nTo encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialization of international results, we invite 1-2 page presentation abstracts. The organizers may offer the opportunity to give an oral or poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site. Submissions should include the presentation title and abstract, the name of the presenter, any publications relating to the work, and any information on collaboration with the local ALTA community. Abstracts will not be published in the proceedings but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent, and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged.\n\n### 3. Industry Demonstrations\n\nTo encourage industry participation and networking opportunities, we are thrilled to announce a track for industry demonstrations, which provides an exciting opportunity for industry researchers to showcase their NLP applications. You should submit a proposal that is 1-2 pages long, containing (1) a description of the software, tools or applications that will be presented and how NLP techniques are used to address a specific problem and (2) a brief introduction of your organization. The proposals will be reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to select demonstrations that best align with the interests of the ALTA community.\n\n## Multiple Submission Policy\n\nOriginal research papers under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We require that you declare at submission that your paper has been submitted to another venue and identify the venue. Should your paper be accepted to ALTA and another venue, we will allow you to decide whether the paper should be published in the ALTA proceedings or treated as a presentation (without archival publication). In this case, you can still present a research talk at the ALTA workshop. This is to encourage more internationally leading research to be presented at the workshop.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Call for Problems for the ALTA 2024 Shared Task closes:** Friday 7 June 2024\n*   **Submission deadline for short/long papers, presentation abstracts and industry demonstrations:** Friday 20 September 2024.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n### Authorization Models and Policies\n\n*   Analysis of Policy and Policy Models\n*   Policy Enforcement\n*   Policy Model and Language Design\n*   Policy Maintenance, Migration, and Mining\n*   Policy Verification\n\n### Mechanisms\n\n*   AI/ML Techniques\n*   Authentication\n*   Cryptographic Techniques\n*   Economic Models and Game Theory\n*   Hardware Security Techniques (e.g., Intel SGX)\n*   Programming Language-based Techniques\n*   Zero Trust Architecture\n\n### Data\n\n*   Big Data\n*   Data Leakage Prevention\n*   Data Privacy\n*   Data Protection\n*   Usage Control\n\n### Systems\n\n*   Cloud, Edge, and Fog Computing\n*   Cyber Physical Systems\n*   Design for Resiliency\n*   Distributed Systems\n*   Embedded Systems\n*   IoT Systems (e.g., Home Automation)\n*   ML-driven, Autonomous Systems (e.g., AI chatbots)\n*   Networks (including Wireless and Satellite)\n*   Operating Systems\n*   Physical Access Control\n*   Web Systems\n\n### Usability and Ethics\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nSubmissions must be in PDF format using ACM’s double-column \"sigconf\" template and no more than 10 pages long, excluding up to 2 pages of bibliography and well-marked appendices. Note that reviewers are not required to read the appendices.\n\nIn addition to the Main Research Track, we invite authors to consider the following special tracks.\n\n*   **BlueSky (up to 8 pages):** Papers that present visionary ideas, long-term challenges, and research opportunities that are outside of the current mainstream topics in the field.\n*   **Dataset/Tool (up to 5 pages):** Papers that present a novel curated dataset, a novel synthetic dataset generation process, or the design and implementation of a novel tool incorporating previously proposed research and technologies.\n*   **Systematization of Knowledge (up to 12 pages):** Papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge in a relevant area to our community.\n*   **Work in Progress (up to 5 pages):** Papers that present early-stage research problems and results that might not be fully developed. This track is ideal for early-stage graduate students to obtain early, constructive feedback on their work.\n\nSubmissions to the above tracks must include subtitle “[TrackName Paper]” in the PDF file.\n\nAll submissions must be anonymous; information that might identify the authors, including author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious self-citations, must be excluded.\n\nAll submissions must contain a significant original contribution. They must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal, conference, or workshop.\n\nAt least one author from each accepted paper must register (with a full registration) for the conference prior to the camera-ready deadline and is expected to present it in person at the conference (remote presentations are possible only in exceptional cases, e.g., a last-minute positive COVID case).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Submission Deadline:** March 31, 2025\n*   **Paper Submission Deadline:** March 31, 2025\n*   **Author Notification:** April 28, 2025\n*   **Conference Dates:** July 8 - 10, 2025\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://sacmat2025.hotcrp.com/](https://sacmat2025.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## General Chairs\n\n*   Scott D.
