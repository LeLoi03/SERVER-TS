The conference explores the interaction of symbolic computation and scientific computing, covering theory, implementation, and applications in natural sciences and engineering.","callForPapers":"# CASC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe CASC 2025 conference will take place in **Dubai, The United Arab Emirates, from November 24-28, 2025.**\n\n## Conference Information\n\nThe tools of Scientific Computing play an important role in the natural sciences and engineering. Computer Algebra Systems and the underlying algorithms for Symbolic Computation play an increasingly important role within Scientific Computation. The CASC workshop series has been running for over two decades to explore the interaction of these topics, their implementation, and their application.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe topics addressed in the workshop cover:\n\n1.  The theory of symbolic computation and its implementation in computer algebra systems. This includes:\n    *   New methods on exact computation\n    *   Symbolic algorithms and their complexity\n    *   Automated reasoning in algebra and geometry\n    *   Parallel symbolic/symbolic-numeric computation\n    *   Symbolic/symbolic-numeric methods for differential, differential-algebraic, and difference equations\n    *   Symbolic/symbolic-numeric methods for polynomial equations and inequalities\n    *   The embedding of computer algebra technology within different software and hardware environments\n2.  All other areas of scientific computing in regards to their benefit from or use of computer algebra methods and software. This includes:\n    *   The use of computer algebra in approximate computation\n    *   Computer algebra methods in big data analytics\n    *   Computer algebra methods for simulation and modeling\n3.  Applications of the above throughout the natural sciences and engineering.\n\nWe welcome papers on both fundamental research and implementation issues. We also accept survey papers, but these MUST BE CLEARLY LABELLED as such in the title.\n\n## Conference Participation Options\n\n1.  **Participation with an accompanying paper in LNCS:** CASC has a long-running relationship with the Springer book series Lecture Notes in Computer Science to publish conference proceedings. Work submitted here should contain an original research result. Submissions should be prepared in the LNCS style and not exceed 20 pages. Survey papers may have up to 25 pages.\n2.  **Participation with abstract only:** Participants may opt to submit an extended abstract instead. These should have at least 2 and at most 4 pages in the LNCS style. They must contain the main results of the talk (without proofs). They will be lightly reviewed and distributed locally at the conference.\n\n## Accompanying Topical Collection of Mathematics in Computer Science\n\nCASC has formed a relationship with the Springer Birkhäuser journal Mathematics in Computer Science (MCS) for an ongoing series of topical collections on topics presented at CASC workshops. Work submitted here must be of journal quality and will be reviewed to the usual standards of MCS. Submission will be opened after the conference for authors of extended abstracts presented at that year’s conference.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** May 18th, 2025\n*   **Notification to Authors:** July 13th, 2025\n*   **Submission of Final Version:** August 10th, 2025\n*   **Conference:** November 24 – 28, 2025","information":"Conference dates: November 24 - 28, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: Dubai, The United Arab Emirates\nCity-State-Province: Dubai\nCountry: United Arab Emirates\nContinent: Asia\nType: Offline\nPaper submission deadline: May 18th, 2025\nNotification to Authors: July 13th, 2025\nSubmission of Final Version: August 10th, 2025\nTopics: Symbolic computation, Computer algebra systems, Exact computation, Symbolic algorithms, Automated reasoning, Parallel symbolic computation, Symbolic-numeric computation, Differential equations, Differential-algebraic equations, Difference equations, Polynomial equations, Polynomial inequalities, Computer algebra technology, Approximate computation, Big data analytics, Simulation, Modeling, Natural sciences, Engineering\nPublisher: Springer"}],"msg":"crawlConferences finished successfully."}
