Anonymous PDF paper with a justification statement\n\nThe participation statement must specify which author(s) will attend upon acceptance/invitation, that all authors will engage in good faith with the feedback given in the review and revision periods, and that all authors will abide by the NSPW code of conduct.  The justification statement briefly explains why the submission is appropriate for NSPW and the chosen submission category. The justification statement will not appear in the final publication. Submissions that do not include both statements risk rejection without review.\n\n## Publication\n\nDepending on publication venue, there may be open access publication fees.  Further details regarding publication will be forthcoming.\n\n## Social Contract and Code of Conduct\n\nThe process for paper submission, revision, presentation, and publication at NSPW is different from many other security conferences. Accepted papers are shepherded and revised before the workshop; this revised version is then presented and discussed in an hour-long session. After the workshop, the final version is produced, incorporating the discussions and feedback. Acceptance to the workshop is conditional on engagement with this process.\n\nAll participants must commit to a “social contract\": no one arrives late, no one leaves early, no electronic distractions (including laptops, tablets, and mobile devices), attend all sessions of the 2.5-day program, share meals in a group setting, and comply with the code of conduct. The workshop is preceded by an evening reception allowing attendees to meet each other beforehand.\n\nNSPW is making arrangements for (some) child care during the event. If any potential attendee wants to take advantage of this or has questions, please email [general-chairs@nspw.org](mailto:general-chairs@nspw.org).\n\nThe submission, review, and workshop phases of NSPW are all governed by the NSPW code of conduct: [https://www.nspw.org/conduct](https://www.nspw.org/conduct).","information":"Conference dates: August 24 - 27, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: Aerzen, Germany\nCity-State-Province: Aerzen\nCountry: Germany\nContinent: Europe\nType: Offline\nSubmissions are due: April 25, 2025\nResponse Date: May 30, 2025\nTopics: Information Security, Computer Security, Trusting, Deepfakes, Misinformation, Threat Modeling, Artificial Intelligence, Audits and Certifications, Authentication and Authorization, Reputation Systems, Anomaly Detection, Formal Verification and Testing, Privacy, Decentralized Trust, Zero Trust Architectures\nPublisher: ACM"},{"title":"Symposium on Networked Systems, Design and Implementation","acronym":"NSDI","determineLinks":{"Call for papers link":"https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi25/call-for-papers","Important dates link":"None","Official Website":"https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi25"},"link":"https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi25","cfpLink":"https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi25/call-for-papers","impLink":"None","conferenceDates":"April 28 - 30, 2025","year":"2025","location":"Philadelphia, PA, USA","cityStateProvince":"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","country":"United States","continent":"North America","type":"Offline","submissionDate":{"(Spring deadline) Paper titles and abstracts due":"April 30, 2024","(Spring deadline) Full paper submissions due":"May 7, 2024","(Fall deadline) Paper titles and abstracts due":"September 12, 2024","(Fall deadline) Full paper submissions due":"September 19, 2024"},"notificationDate":{"(Spring deadline) Notification to authors":"July 24, 2024","(Fall deadline) Notification to authors":"December 10, 2024"},"cameraReadyDate":{"(Spring deadline) Final paper files due":"October 15, 2024","(Fall deadline) Final paper files due":"March 6, 2025"},"registrationDate":{"Early Bird Registration Deadline":"April 7, 2025","Hotel Discount Deadline":"April 7, 2025"},"otherDate":{},"topics":"Networked Systems, Distributed Systems, Highly Available Systems, Reliable Networked Systems, Security and Privacy of Networked Systems, Distributed Storage, Caching, Query Processing Systems, Sustainable Networked Systems, Low-energy Networked Systems, Low-carbon Networked Systems, Cloud Systems, Multi-tenant Systems, Mobile and Embedded Systems, Sensor Applications, Systems Aspects of Networking Hardware, Network and Workload Measurement Systems, Self-organizing Networked Systems, Autonomous Networked Systems, Federated Networked Systems, Managing Networked Systems, Debugging Networked Systems, Diagnosing Networked Systems, Virtualization and Resource Management for Networked Systems, Deployed Networked Systems, Networked Systems for Big Data, Testing and Verification of Networked Systems, Networked Systems for Machine Learning, Machine Learning for Networked Systems","publisher":"","summary":"The 22nd USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI '25) will be held on April 28–30, 2025, in Philadelphia, PA, USA.

We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.\n\n## The Character of Onward! Papers\n\nOnward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.\n\n## Selection Process\n\nOnward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double-blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.\n\nOnward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission.\n\n## Instructions for Authors\n\nFor fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.\n\nAuthors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/](https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Concurrent Submissions\n\nPapers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.\n\n## Policy on Double-Blind Review\n\nOnward! 2025 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:\n\n*   Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc.) from the author block of the first page of the paper.\n*   To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person.\n*   To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements.\n\nAfter submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.\n\n## Policy on Authorship Changes\n\nAny addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.\n\n## Format\n\nSubmissions should use [ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/) and 10-point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.\n\n## Page Limit\n\nTo ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self-contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)\n\n## Publication\n\n**AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:** The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAoE (UTC-12h)\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** April 24, 2025\n*   **First-round notification:** June 6, 2025\n*   **Revised submission deadline:** July 17, 2025\n*   **Final notification:** August 11, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready deadline:** August 25, 2025\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Shigeru Chiba, University of Tokyo, Japan\n*   Clemens Nylandsted Klokmose, Aarhus University, Denmark\n*   Antranig Basman, Raising the Floor - International, United Kingdom\n*   Jacques Carette, McMaster University, Canada\n*   Luke Church, University of Cambridge | Candela Inc, United Kingdom\n*   Siobhán Clarke, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland\n*   Stéphane Ducasse, Inria; University of Lille; CNRS; Centrale Lille; CRIStAL, France\n*   Elisa Gonzalez Boix, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium\n*   Philipp Haller, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden\n*   Reid Holmes, University of British Columbia, Canada\n*   Joel Jakubovic, Charles University in Prague, Czechia\n*   Jun Kato, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan\n*   Raffi Khatchadourian, CUNY Hunter College, United States\n*   Patrick Lam, University of Waterloo\n*   Daan Leijen, Microsoft Research, United States\n*   Sorin Lerner, University of California at San Diego, United States\n*   Magnus Madsen, Aarhus University, Denmark\n*   Ole Lehrmann Madsen, Aarhus University, Denmark\n*   Hidehiko Masuhara, Institute of Science Tokyo, Japan\n*   Steve Oney, University of Michigan\n*   Roly Perera, University of Cambridge/University of Bristol, United Kingdom\n*   Guillermo Polito, Univ.

These initiatives gave rise to an exponential increase in the volume and diversification of data, including nucleotide and protein sequences and annotations, high-throughput experimental data, biomedical literature, among many others. Systems Biology is a related research area that has been replacing the reductionist view that dominated Biology research in the last decades, requiring the coordinated efforts of biological researchers with those related to data analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulation, and optimization. The accumulation and exploitation of large-scale databases prompt for new computational technology and for research into these issues. In this context, many widely successful computational models and tools used by biologists in these initiatives, such as clustering and classification methods for gene expression data, are based on Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence (CS/AI) techniques. In fact, these methods have been helping in tasks related to knowledge discovery, modeling, and optimization tasks, aiming at the development of computational models so that the response of biological complex systems to any perturbation can be predicted.\n\n## Topics\n\nPACBB welcomes contributions reporting substantial, original, and previously unpublished work in all areas of Bioinformatics, Chemoinformatics, and Systems Biology.

Authors are recommended to use the Elsevier article class `elsarticle.cls` (with the 3p document class option) to prepare their manuscript and BibTeX to generate their bibliography. See also the guide for authors: [https://www.elsevier.com/journals/performance-evaluation/0166-5316/guide-for-authors](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/performance-evaluation/0166-5316/guide-for-authors).\n\nAuthors may include an appendix (of unrestricted length) but only to justify the technical correctness of the claims stated in the main paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. However, the appendix should serve as supplementary material only, as reviewers will evaluate the novelty and significance of the submission based on the main content of the paper and are not obligated to review the appendix.\n\n### Format of Short Paper Submissions\n\nShort papers are limited to 10 pages for technical content, including all tables and figures (references are excluded from the page limit). Authors may include an appendix (of unrestricted length) but only to justify the technical correctness of the claims stated in the main paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. However, the appendix should serve as supplementary material only, as reviewers will evaluate the novelty and significance of the submission based on the main content of the paper and are not obligated to review the appendix.\n\nAccepted short papers will be published in a special ACM Performance Evaluation Review (PER) issue. Please find the style files [here](https://performance2025.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/1).\n\n### Instructions for All Submissions\n\nPapers must be submitted through the hotCRP platform ([https://performance2025.hotcrp.com/](https://performance2025.hotcrp.com/)) in printable PDF form. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review.\n\nAll submissions will be reviewed using a double-blind review process. The identity of authors and referees will not be revealed to each other.\n\n## Tracks\n\nIFIP Performance uses “soft” tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions. Regardless of the selected track, all submissions will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element.\n\n*   Learning\n*   Measurement & Applied Modelling\n*   Systems\n*   Theory\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\nPapers describing experiments with users or user data should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence, minimal risk, voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues.\n\n## Diversity & Inclusiveness\n\nAs part of our efforts to foster diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or conference presentation.","information":"Conference dates: November 11 - 14, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), Amsterdam, Netherlands\nCity-State-Province: Amsterdam\nCountry: Netherlands\nContinent: Europe\nType: Offline\nFull paper submission: June 1, 2025\nNotification to authors: July 30, 2025\nSubmission site opens: May 1, 2025\nAbstract submission: May 25, 2025\nTopics: Algorithm design, Mathematical analysis and modeling, Simulation, Measurement techniques, computer systems, communication networks, Analytical modeling techniques, Model validation, Anomaly detection, Problem diagnosis, Troubleshooting, Capacity planning, Resource allocation, Routing, Scheduling, Quality of service, Experimental design, Statistical analysis, Game theory, Network economics, Platform design, Machine learning, Data mining, Graph analysis, Optimization, Performance, Scalability, Power, Reliability analysis, Stochastic modeling, Sustainability analysis, Power management, Complex networks, Sorting, Ranking, System measurement, Performance monitoring, Forecasting, Workload characterization, Benchmarking, Artificial intelligence and machine learning platforms, Blockchains and crypto-currency, Computer architectures and operating systems, Cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, Smart grids, Data centers, Content delivery, Cloud computing, Virtualization, High-performance computing, Internet and web services, Mobile and personal computing systems, Network architectures, protocols, and congestion control, Privacy and algorithmic fairness, Security systems, Storage systems and data centers, Social networks, Multimedia systems, Smart grid, Virtualization, Data centers, Distributed and cloud computing, Fog, Edge computing, Quantum computing and quantum communication, Wireless, ad-hoc, and cellular networks"},{"title":"Pacific Conference on Computer Graphics and Applications","acronym":"PG","determineLinks":{"Call for papers link":"https://pg2025.nccu.edu.tw/#CallForSubmission","Important dates link":"https://pg2025.nccu.edu.tw/#Dates","Official Website":"https://pg2025.nccu.edu.tw/"},"link":"https://pg2025.nccu.edu.tw/","cfpLink":"https://pg2025.nccu.edu.tw/#CallForSubmission","impLink":"https://pg2025.nccu.edu.tw/#Dates","conferenceDates":"October 14 - 17, 2025","year":"2025","location":"Taipei, Taiwan","cityStateProvince":"Taipei","country":"Taiwan","continent":"Asia","type":"Offline","submissionDate":{"Paper abstract due":"May 30, 2025","Paper due":"June 6, 2025","Poster/Demo Submission":"August 15, 2025"},"notificationDate":{"Reviews to Authors":"July 21, 2025","Decision Notification":"August 8, 2025"},"cameraReadyDate":{"Camera-ready":"August 22, 2025"},"registrationDate":{},"otherDate":{"Rebuttal Due":"July 27, 2025"},"topics":"Computer Graphics, Modeling, Rendering, Animation, Imaging, Visualization, Human-Computer Interaction, Graphics Systems","publisher":"","summary":"The 33rd Pacific Conference on Computer Graphics and Applications (Pacific Graphics 2025) will be held in Taipei, Taiwan, from October 14-17, 2025.

PLDI is the premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research.","callForPapers":"# PLDI 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 2025) will be held in **Seoul, South Korea from Monday, June 16 to Friday, June 20, 2025**.\n\nPLDI is the premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research, covering the areas of design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance.\n\n## Scope\n\nPLDI welcomes outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all in scope for PLDI.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria and Process\n\nReviewers will evaluate submissions for accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. The selection of papers will be made in two rounds of reviewing. In the first round, reviewers will assess the papers according to the quality criteria listed above. Authors will be given several days to compose a written response to the reviews received in the first round. At the end of the first round, the Review Committee will conditionally accept a subset of the submissions and all other submissions will be rejected. In the second round, authors of conditionally-accepted papers will be given an opportunity to improve specific aspects of the research and the paper, as identified by the reviewers.  The Review Committee will make final decisions regarding (conditional) acceptance and rejection.\n\n## Double-Blind Reviewing\n\nAuthor names and affiliations must be omitted from submissions. If a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in the third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized.\n\n## Submission Site Information\n\nThe submission site will be at [https://pldi25.hotcrp.com/](https://pldi25.hotcrp.com/). Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no deadline for submitting abstracts.\n\n## Declaring Conflicts\n\nWhen submitting a paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).\n\n## Formatting Requirements\n\nEach paper should have no more than 20 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the ACM Proceedings format. Use of a different format is grounds for summary rejection. PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the [SIGPLAN author information page](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/).\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\nAuthors are welcome to provide supplementary material if that material supports the claims in the paper. Such material may include proofs, experimental results, and/or data sets. This material should be uploaded at the same time as the submission. Reviewers are not required to examine the supplementary material but may refer to it if they would like to find further evidence supporting the claims in the paper.\n\nSupplemental material cannot be included in the main submission text. All appendices must be submitted as supplemental material, not as part of the main submission PDF.\n\n## Plagiarism and Concurrent Work\n\nPapers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere.\n\n## Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers\n\nAuthors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers.\n\n## Open Access and Copyright\n\nAs a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support liberal open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license.\n\n## Publication Date\n\nAll papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library or the first day of the conference, whichever is sooner.\n\n## Presentations\n\nAuthors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work at PLDI. Authors who need financial assistance for travel to the conferences should apply for a grant from the SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (PAC) program.\n\n## Distinguished Paper Awards\n\nUp to 10% of the accepted papers may be designated as Distinguished Papers.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12h)\n\n*   **Submission Deadline:** November 14, 2024\n*   **Author Response Period:** February 18 - 22, 2025\n*   **Notification to Authors:** March 6, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready Deadline:** April 10, 2025\n\n[Submission Link](https://pldi25.hotcrp.com/)","information":"Conference dates: June 16 - 20, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: The Westin Josun Seoul, Seoul, South Korea\nCity-State-Province: Seoul\nCountry: South Korea\nContinent: Asia\nType: Offline\n(PLDI Research Papers) Submission Deadline: November 14, 2024\n(Research Artifacts) Artifact Registration Deadline: March 13, 2025\n(Research Artifacts) Artifact Submission Deadline: March 18, 2025\n(LCTES) Paper Submission (Extended Firm Deadline): March 21, 2025\n(WQS) Submission Deadline: April 1, 2025\n(ARRAY) Submission Deadline: April 1, 2025\n(SOAP) Submission Deadline: March 5, 2025\n(Student Research Competition) Abstract submission deadline: March 14, 2025\n(EGRAPHS) Submission Deadline: April 17, 2025\n(Sparse) Talk Submission Deadline: April 17, 2025\n(PLDI Research Papers) Notification to Authors: March 6, 2025\n(Student Research Competition) Author Notification: April 24, 2025\n(LCTES) Paper Notification: April 21, 2025\n(SOAP) Author Notification: April 25, 2025\n(WQS) Authors Notification: April 27, 2025\n(ARRAY) Acceptance Decisions: April 19, 2025\n(ISMM) Author notification: May 3, 2025\n(PLDI Research Papers) Camera-Ready Deadline: April 10, 2025\n(Student Research Competition) Camera-ready deadline: May 16, 2025\n(LCTES) Camera-Ready Submission: May 12, 2025\n(ISMM) Camera-ready papers due: May 13, 2025\n(SOAP) Camera-Ready Submission Deadline: May 1, 2025\n(ARRAY) Final version: May 3, 2025\n(PLDI Research Papers) Author Response Period: February 18 - 22, 2025\n(Research Artifacts) Response and Communication Period: April 3 - 22, 2025\n(ISMM) Author response period: April 23 - 25, 2025\n(LCTES) Abstract Submission (soft, open until March 21, 2025): March 14, 2025\n(Research Artifacts) Reviewer Self-Nomination Deadline: December 23, 2024\n(Volunteering) Volunteer Application closes: April 15, 2025\nEarly registration deadline: May 17, 2025\n(SOAP) Workshop: June 16, 2025\n(LCTES) Conference Dates: June 16 - 17, 2025\n(ISMM) Conference day: June 17, 2025\n(RPLS) Workshopnew: June 17, 2025\nTopics: Programming Languages, Programming Systems, Design, Implementation, Theory, Applications, Performance"},{"title":"ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing","acronym":"PODC","determineLinks":{},"link":"https://www.podc.org/podc2025/","cfpLink":"https://www.podc.org/podc2025/call-for-papers/","impLink":"https://www.podc.org/podc2025/","conferenceDates":"June 16 - 20, 2025","year":"2025","location":"Huatulco, Mexico","cityStateProvince":"Huatulco","country":"Mexico","continent":"North America","type":"Offline","submissionDate":{"Abstract submission":"February 4, 2025","Full paper submission":"February 8, 2025"},"notificationDate":{"Notification":"April 17, 2025"},"cameraReadyDate":{},"registrationDate":{},"otherDate":{},"topics":"Distributed Systems, Networks, Distributed Algorithms, Distributed Data Structures, Cloud Computing, Distributed Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Fault-Tolerance, Game Theory, Mobile Computing, Autonomous Agents, Peer-to-Peer Systems, Security, Cryptography","publisher":"","summary":"The ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC) is an international forum on the theory, design, analysis, implementation, and application of distributed systems and networks.

The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere, including the formal proceedings of other symposia or workshops.\n\n## Double-anonymous reviewing\n\nPODS 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous reviewing process. This means that submissions must adhere to the following:\n\n*   Author names and institutions must be omitted.\n*   References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person.\n*   Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n**FIRST SUBMISSION PHASE (All Deadlines are 5 PM Pacific Time):**\n\n*   Abstract: May 31, 2024\n*   Submission: June 7, 2024\n*   Rebuttal: July 29 - August 1, 2024\n*   Initial notification: August 12, 2024\n*   Revision submission: August 26, 2024\n*   Final notification: September 2, 2024\n\n**SECOND SUBMISSION PHASE (All Deadlines are 5 PM Pacific Time):**\n\n*   Abstract: December 2, 2024\n*   Submission: December 9, 2024\n*   Rebuttal: February 3-7, 2025\n*   Initial notification: February 14, 2025\n*   Revision submission: February 28, 2025\n*   Final notification: March 7, 2025","information":"Conference dates: June 22 - 27, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: Berlin, Germany\nCity-State-Province: Berlin\nCountry: Germany\nContinent: Europe\nType: Offline\n(FIRST SUBMISSION PHASE) Abstract: May 31, 2024\n(FIRST SUBMISSION PHASE) Submission: June 7, 2024\n(SECOND SUBMISSION PHASE) Abstract: December 2, 2024\n(SECOND SUBMISSION PHASE) Submission: December 9, 2024\n(Industry paper submission) Paper Submission: December 9, 2024\n(FIRST SUBMISSION PHASE) Initial notification: August 12, 2024\n(FIRST SUBMISSION PHASE) Final notification: September 2, 2024\n(SECOND SUBMISSION PHASE) Initial notification: February 14, 2025\n(SECOND SUBMISSION PHASE) Final notification: March 7, 2025\n(Industry paper submission) Notification of Accept/Reject: February 24, 2025\n(FIRST SUBMISSION PHASE) Rebuttal: July 29 - August 1, 2024\n(FIRST SUBMISSION PHASE) Revision submission: August 26, 2024\n(SECOND SUBMISSION PHASE) Rebuttal: February 3-7, 2025\n(SECOND SUBMISSION PHASE) Revision submission: February 28, 2025\nTopics: Data Management, Database Theory, Data Management Challenges, Data Management Techniques, Efficiency, Scalability, Usability, Expressiveness, Robustness, Security, Clarity, Privacy, Database Processing, Query Evaluation, Query Optimization, Schema Management, Distributed Data Processing, Approximate Data Processing, Database Design, Data Models, Query Languages, Schemas, Constraints, Database Access, Data Structures, Access Methods, Concurrency, Transactions, Data Quality, Data Consistency, Data Cleaning, Data Discovery, Data Exploration, Data Analysis, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Information Extraction, Data Streams, Uncertainty, Incomplete Data, Inconsistent Data, Probabilistic Data, Interoperability, Mappings and Views, Data Integration, Data Exchange, Ontology-based Data Access, Responsible Data Management, Access Control, Privacy, Security, Verification, Ethical Aspects of Data Management, Human-Database Interaction, Data Summarization, Data Visualization, Explanation for Database Queries, Connections Between Database Principles and Other Disciplines\nPublisher: ACM"},{"title":"ACM-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages","acronym":"POPL","determineLinks":{"Call for papers link":"https://conf.researchr.org/track/POPL-2025/POPL-2025-popl-research-papers#POPL-2025-Call-for-Papers","Important dates link":"None","Official Website":"https://popl25.sigplan.org"},"link":"https://popl25.sigplan.org/","cfpLink":"https://conf.researchr.org/track/POPL-2025/POPL-2025-popl-research-papers#POPL-2025-Call-for-Papers","impLink":"None","conferenceDates":"January 19 - 25, 2025","year":"2025","location":"Denver, Colorado, United States","cityStateProvince":"Denver, Colorado","country":"United States","continent":"North America","type":"Offline","submissionDate":{"Paper submission deadline":"July 11, 2024"},"notificationDate":{"Conditional Accept decisions announced":"October 8, 2024","Final acceptance notifications sent to authors":"November 7, 2024"},"cameraReadyDate":{"Camera ready deadline":"November 22, 2024"},"registrationDate":{},"otherDate":{"End of Author Response":"September 20, 2024","Beginning of Author Response Period":"September 11, 2024","Authors of conditional accepted papers send their revised versions":"October 25, 2024","Early registration deadline":"December 20, 2024"},"topics":"Programming Languages, Programming Systems","publisher":"","summary":"The 52nd ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL 2025) will take place in Denver, Colorado, from January 19-25, 2025.

Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.\n\n## Double-Blind Reviewing\n\nPOPL 2025 will use a full double-blind reviewing process. This means that identities of authors will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted papers.\n\n## Evaluation Process\n\nPOPL 2025 will have five Associate Chairs who will help the PC Chair monitor reviews, solicit external expert reviews for submissions when there is not enough expertise on the committee, and facilitate reviewer discussions.\n\nAs in previous years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to reviews. Responses are optional. A response must be concise, addressing specific points raised in the reviews; in particular, it must not introduce new technical results. Reviewers will write a short reaction to these author responses.\n\n## Submission Site Information\n\nThe submission site is [https://popl25.hotcrp.com](https://popl25.hotcrp.com).\n\nAuthors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline.\n\nThe submission deadline is **11:59 PM July 11, 2024**, anywhere on earth.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nFor each submission, the authors must make sure that they properly declare all potential conflicts of interest for all of the authors of that submission.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nEach paper should have no more than 25 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the PACMPL format (specifically, the `acmart` LaTeX class with `acmsmall` option).\n\nSubmitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and the ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent paper submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar forums of publication are not allowed.\n\n## Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers\n\nAuthors of conditionally accepted papers will be invited to formally submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process.\n\n## Copyright, Publication, and Presentation\n\nAs a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support libre open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license.\n\n## Distinguished Paper Awards\n\nAt most 10% of the accepted papers of POPL 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** July 11, 2024\n*   **Beginning of Author Response Period:** September 11, 2024\n*   **End of Author Response:** September 20, 2024\n*   **Conditional Accept decisions announced:** October 8, 2024\n*   **Authors of conditional accepted papers send their revised versions:** October 25, 2024\n*   **Final acceptance notifications sent to authors:** November 7, 2024\n*   **Camera ready deadline:** November 22, 2024\n*   **Conference:** January 19 - 25, 2025","information":"Conference dates: January 19 - 25, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: Denver, Colorado, United States\nCity-State-Province: Denver, Colorado\nCountry: United States\nContinent: North America\nType: Offline\nPaper submission deadline: July 11, 2024\nConditional Accept decisions announced: October 8, 2024\nFinal acceptance notifications sent to authors: November 7, 2024\nCamera ready deadline: November 22, 2024\nEnd of Author Response: September 20, 2024\nBeginning of Author Response Period: September 11, 2024\nAuthors of conditional accepted papers send their revised versions: October 25, 2024\nEarly registration deadline: December 20, 2024\nTopics: Programming Languages, Programming Systems"},{"title":"IFIP WG8.1 Working Conference on the Practice of Enterprise Modeling","acronym":"PoEM","determineLinks":{"Call for papers link":"None","Important dates link":"None","Official Website":"https://www.apnoms.org/"},"link":"https://www.apnoms.org/","cfpLink":"None","impLink":"None","conferenceDates":"","year":"","location":"","cityStateProvince":"","country":"","continent":"","type":"","submissionDate":{},"notificationDate":{},"cameraReadyDate":{},"registrationDate":{},"otherDate":{},"topics":"","publisher":"","summary":"","callForPapers":"","information":"Information of PoEM: No information available"}],"msg":"crawlConferences finished successfully."}
