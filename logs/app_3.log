CASC 2025 will be held in **Dubai, The United Arab Emirates, from November 24 – 28, 2025**.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe topics addressed in the workshop cover:\n\n1.  The theory of symbolic computation and its implementation in computer algebra systems.\n2.  All other areas of scientific computing in regards to their benefit from or use of computer algebra methods and software.\n3.  Applications of the above throughout the natural sciences and engineering.\n\nWe welcome papers on both fundamental research and implementation issues. We also accept survey papers but these MUST BE CLEARLY LABELLED as such in the title.\n\n## Conference Participation Options\n\nWe encourage wide participation at the workshop. We offer a variety of participation options:\n\n1.  **Participation with an accompanying paper in LNCS:**\n    *   CASC has a long-running relationship with the Springer book series Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) to publish conference proceedings.\n    *   Work submitted here should contain an original research result.\n    *   Submissions should be prepared in the LNCS style and not exceed 20 pages. Survey papers may have up to 25 pages.\n2.  **Participation with abstract only:**\n    *   Participants may opt to submit an extended abstract instead. These should have at least 2 and at most 4 pages in the LNCS style. They must contain the main results of the talk (without proofs).\n    *   They will be lightly reviewed and distributed locally at the conference.\n    *   We see three main audiences for this option:\n        *   Those who wish to talk on previously published work (in which case that work should be clearly cited in the abstract).\n        *   Those whose work is not yet ready for publication, but wish to receive feedback.\n        *   Those who plan to submit a journal paper on the work shortly.\n\n## Accompanying Topical Collection of Mathematics in Computer Science\n\nCASC has formed a relationship with the Springer Birkhäuser journal Mathematics in Computer Science (MCS) for an ongoing series of topical collections on topics presented at CASC workshops. Work submitted here must be of journal quality and will be reviewed to the usual standards of MCS. Submission will be opened after the conference for authors of extended abstracts presented at that year's conference.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** May 18th, 2025\n*   **Notification to Authors:** July 13th, 2025\n*   **Submission of Final Version:** August 10th, 2025\n*   **Conference:** November 24 – 28, 2025","information":"Conference dates: November 24 - 28, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: Dubai, The United Arab Emirates\nCity-State-Province: Dubai\nCountry: United Arab Emirates\nContinent: Asia\nType: Offline\nPaper submission deadline: May 18, 2025\nNotification to Authors: July 13, 2025\nSubmission of Final Version: August 10, 2025\nTopics: Symbolic Computation, Computer Algebra Systems, Exact Computation, Symbolic Algorithms, Automated Reasoning, Parallel Symbolic Computation, Symbolic-Numeric Computation, Differential Equations, Differential-Algebraic Equations, Difference Equations, Polynomial Equations, Inequalities, Computer Algebra Technology, Software Environments, Hardware Environments, Approximate Computation, Big Data Analytics, Simulation, Modeling, Natural Sciences, Engineering\nPublisher: Springer"},{"title":"International Conference on Compiler Construction","acronym":"CC","determineLinks":{},"link":"https://conf.researchr.org/home/CC-2025","cfpLink":"https://conf.researchr.org/track/CC-2025/CC-2025-main-conference","impLink":"None","conferenceDates":"March 1 - 2, 2025","year":"2025","location":"Las Vegas, Nevada, United States","cityStateProvince":"Las Vegas, Nevada","country":"United States","continent":"North America","type":"Offline","submissionDate":{"Abstract deadline":"November 5, 2024","Submission deadline":"November 12, 2024","Author response":"December 11 - 13, 2024","Artifact Submission Deadline":"January 17, 2025","Camera-Ready Deadline":"January 24, 2025"},"notificationDate":{"Author notification":"December 21, 2024"},"cameraReadyDate":{},"registrationDate":{},"otherDate":{},"topics":"Compiler Construction, Compilation Techniques, Program Analysis, Code Generation, Optimization, Synthesis, Verification, Run-time Techniques, Memory Management, Virtual Machines, Dynamic Compilation, Just-in-Time Compilation, Programming Tools, Refactoring Editors, Checkers, Verifiers, Compilers, Debuggers, Profilers, Programming Languages, Micro-architectural Support, Secure Environments, Parallel Environments, Distributed Environments, Embedded Environments, Mobile Environments, Language Constructs, Programming Models, Domain-Specific Languages, Deep Learning, Quantum Computing, DNA Computing","publisher":"","summary":"The ACM SIGPLAN 2025 International Conference on Compiler Construction (CC 2025) is interested in work on processing programs in the most general sense: analyzing, transforming, or executing input programs that describe how a system operates, including traditional compiler construction as a special case.

We especially encourage submissions that address complexity-theoretic issues in complexity-adjacent areas such as coding theory, cryptography, game theory, learning, logic and privacy.\n\n## Possible Topics\n\n*   Complexity classes\n*   Reducibility and completeness\n*   Circuit complexity\n*   Communication complexity\n*   Algebraic complexity\n*   Proof complexity\n*   Complexity in other concrete computational models\n*   Interactive and probabilistic proof systems\n*   Logic and descriptive complexity\n*   Pseudorandomness and derandomization\n*   Average case complexity\n*   Quantum computation\n*   Parametrized complexity\n*   Fine-grained complexity\n*   Complexity-theoretic aspects of:\n    *   coding theory\n    *   cryptography\n    *   optimization (including inapproximability continuous optimization)\n    *   property testing\n    *   streaming and sublinear computation\n    *   distributed computation\n    *   game theory\n    *   machine learning\n    *   privacy\n\n## Submission\n\n**Submission Deadline:** Friday, February 7, 2025, 23:59 AoE\n\nPapers must be submitted electronically via submission server [here](https://ccc2025.hotcrp.com/). Notification of acceptance will be sent by Friday, May 2, 2025, and final camera-ready copies of accepted papers will be due end of May, 2025.\n\n## Format\n\nSubmissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper and an abstract of 1-2 paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. A submission must contain within its first 10 pages a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including discussion of its importance, prior work, and an outline of key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims (similar to the content of a brief oral presentation). There is no bound on the total length of a submission, but material other than the abstract, references, and the first 10 pages is considered as supplementary and will be read at the committee's discretion.\n\nSubmissions should include proofs of all central claims. The submission should be in single-column format, use at least 11-point font, at least 1-inch margins, and at least single-spacing between lines. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Instructions for formatting camera-ready versions will be communicated to the authors of accepted papers.\n\n## Review Process\n\nThe conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. (Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.)\n\n## Publication\n\n*   **Online posting:** Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the [Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity](http://eccc.hpi-web.de/eccc) or the arXiv.\n*   **Proceedings:** The conference proceedings will be published under a Creative Commons BY license in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series.\n*   **Presentation:** Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the conference. The program committee will determine time allocations for presentations (between 15 and 45 minutes).\n\n## Awards\n\n*   **EATCS Luca Trevisan award for the CCC best student paper:** This award will be given to the best paper written solely by one or more students as judged by the program committee.\n*   **Best paper award:** This award will be given to the best paper submitted to the conference as judged by the program committee.\n*   **Special journal issue:** The program committee will invite full versions of a select number of conference submissions to a special issue of the journal *Computational Complexity*.\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Paul Beame | University of Washington\n*   Anna Gál | University of Texas at Austin\n*   Sumegha Garg | Rutgers University\n*   Joshua Grochow | University of Colorado Boulder\n*   Shuichi Hirahara | National Institute of Informatics\n*   Holger Dell | Goethe-Universität Frankfurt and IT University of Copenhagen\n*   Igor Carboni Oliveira | University of Warwick\n*   Amir Shpilka | Tel Aviv University\n*   Makrand Sinha | University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n*   Srikanth Srinivasan (Chair) | University of Copenhagen and IIT Bombay\n*   Avishay Tal | University of California Berkeley\n*   Madhur Tulsiani | Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago\n\n## Local Arrangements Committee\n\n*   Swastik Kopparty (Chair), University of Toronto\n*   Benjamin Rossman, Duke University\n\n## Contact\n\n[ccc2025chair@gmail.com](mailto:ccc2025chair@gmail.com)","information":"Conference dates: August 5 - 8, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: Fields Institute, Room 230, Toronto, Canada\nCity-State-Province: Toronto\nCountry: Canada\nContinent: North America\nType: Offline\nSubmission Deadline: February 7, 2025\nNotification of acceptance: May 2, 2025\nfinal camera-ready copies of accepted papers will be due: End of May, 2025\nTopics: Computational Complexity Theory, Computational Models, Resource Constraints, Probabilistic and Interactive Proof Systems, Inapproximability, Proof Complexity, Descriptive Complexity, Cryptography, Machine Learning, Coding Theory, Game Theory, Optimization, Property Testing, Streaming and Sublinear Computation, Distributed Computation, Logic, Privacy"},{"title":"ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security","acronym":"CCS","determineLinks":{"Call for papers link":"https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/call-for-papers/","Important dates link":"https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/call-for-papers/#dates","Official Website":"https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/"},"link":"https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/","cfpLink":"https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/call-for-papers/","impLink":"https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/call-for-papers/#dates","conferenceDates":"October 13 - 17, 2025","year":"2025","location":"Taipei, Taiwan","cityStateProvince":"Taipei","country":"Taiwan","continent":"Asia","type":"Offline","submissionDate":{"(First Review Cycle) Abstract submission deadline":"January 2, 2025","(First Review Cycle) Full paper submission deadline":"January 9, 2025","(Second Review Cycle) Abstract submission deadline":"April 7, 2025","(Second Review Cycle) Full paper submission deadline":"April 14, 2025"},"notificationDate":{"(First Review Cycle) Notification of early-rejection papers":"February 10, 2025","(First Review Cycle) Author notification":"March 28, 2025","(Second Review Cycle) Notification of early-rejection papers":"May 16, 2025","(Second Review Cycle) Author notification":"July 1, 2025"},"cameraReadyDate":{},"registrationDate":{},"otherDate":{"(First Review Cycle) Author rebuttal period":"March 3-6, 2025","(First Review Cycle) Rebuttal deadline":"March 6, 2025","(Second Review Cycle) Author rebuttal period":"June 5-10, 2025","(Second Review Cycle) Rebuttal deadline":"June 10, 2025"},"topics":"Computer Security, Privacy","publisher":"","summary":"The ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) is the flagship annual conference of the Special Interest Group on Security, Audit and Control (SIGSAC) of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
