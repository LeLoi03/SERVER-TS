The conference will be held from **July 20-23, 2025, in Glasgow, Scotland, UK**.\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nThe Paper strand provides the opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.\n\nPapers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. All paper submissions should follow the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template ([https://template-selector.ieee.org/](https://template-selector.ieee.org/)). Each submission can have up to eleven (11) pages (including figures, tables, appendices, and references). Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review.\n\nThe paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content. To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymized GitHub repository with all source code, scripts, and data needed for the reproduction of their results.\n\nFor each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference in-person to present their work on-site. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.\n\nNote that the authors should adhere to ethics and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer to IEEE Code of Ethics and IEEE Policy of AI-Generated Text ([https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/#ai-generated-text](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/#ai-generated-text)).\n\n## Paper Deadline Dates\n\n*   Time zone: Anywhere on Earth (AoE)\n*   Paper Submission Website: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icdcs2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icdcs2025) (Submission portal opens on 1 November 2024)\n*   Paper Abstract Registration: December 11, 2024\n*   Paper Submission Due: December 18, 2024\n*   Author Notification: April 2, 2025\n*   Camera-Ready Submission: April 16, 2025\n\n## Tracks\n\nPapers can be submitted to one of the following tracks:\n\n*   Cloud Computing\n*   Distributed Algorithms\n*   Big Data, Models & Systems\n*   Distributed Fault Tolerance\n*   Distributed OS and Middleware\n*   Edge Computing\n*   IoT + CPS\n*   Mobile Computing\n*   Security, Privacy and Trust\n*   Blockchains/Databases\n*   Distributed Systems for AI/ML\n*   AI/ML for Distributed Systems\n*   Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures\n\n## Special Issue\n\nA set of highly selected IEEE ICDCS 2025 papers will be considered for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS).","information":"Conference dates: July 20-23, 2025\nYear: 2025\nLocation: Glasgow, Scotland, UK\nCity-State-Province: Glasgow\nCountry: United Kingdom\nContinent: Europe\nType: Offline\n(Research Papers) Paper Abstract Registration: December 11, 2024\n(Research Papers) Paper Submission Due: December 18, 2024\n(In Conjunction Events) Workshop Proposals: November 27, 2024\n(In Conjunction Events) Doctoral Consortium: February 26, 2025\n(In Conjunction Events) Tutorial Proposals: February 26, 2025\n(In Conjunction Events) Posters Abstracts: January 29, 2025\n(In Conjunction Events) Posters Papers: February 5, 2025\n(In Conjunction Events) Demonstrations: February 5, 2025\n(In Conjunction Events) Industry Events: February 12, 2025\n(Research Papers) Author Notification: April 2, 2025\n(In Conjunction Events) Notification: April 2, 2025\n(Research Papers) Camera-Ready Submission: April 16, 2025\n(In Conjunction Events) Camera-ready: April 16, 2025\nTopics: Distributed Computing Systems, Cloud Computing, Distributed Algorithms, Big Data, Models & Systems, Distributed Fault Tolerance, Distributed OS and Middleware, Edge Computing, IoT + CPS, Mobile Computing, Security, Privacy and Trust, Blockchains/Databases, Distributed Systems for AI/ML, AI/ML for Distributed Systems, Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures"},{"title":"IEEE International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","acronym":"ICDAR","determineLinks":{"Call for papers link":"/submission/call-for-journal-track","Important dates link":"None","Official Website":"https://www.icdar2025.com/"},"link":"https://www.icdar2025.com/","cfpLink":"https://www.icdar2025.com/submission/call-for-journal-track","impLink":"None","conferenceDates":"September 16 - 21, 2025","year":"2025","location":"Wuhan, Hubei, China","cityStateProvince":"Wuhan, Hubei","country":"China","continent":"Asia","type":"Offline","submissionDate":{"Journal track paper submission deadline":"November 15, 2024","Conference title & abstract submission deadline":"February 28, 2025","Conference full paper upload and editing closed":"March 14, 2025","Conference paper supplementary materials deadline":"March 19, 2025","Journal track paper revise submission deadline":"March 14, 2025"},"notificationDate":{"Initial journal track decision announced":"January 10, 2025","Conference paper acceptance notification":"May 24, 2025"},"cameraReadyDate":{"Camera-ready and author registration deadline":"June 20, 2025"},"registrationDate":{},"otherDate":{},"topics":"Document Analysis and Recognition","publisher":"","summary":"The 19th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR 2025) will take place from September 16-21, 2025 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
