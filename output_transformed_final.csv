 ABZ 2025 – 11th International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods  

 Call for papers  
 The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.  
 The name ABZ goes back to the first conference in London in 2008, where the ASM, B and Z conference series were merged into a joint event. In the following years other formal methods were added, e.g. Alloy in 2010 (Orford, Canada), VDM in 2012 (Pisa, Italy), and TLA+ in 2014 (Toulouse, France). After the also successful 2016 conferences in Linz, Austria, and 2018 in Southampton, UK, it was decided to name the conference “ABZ: International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods”, to stress the openness for further state-based formal methods. We hope to continue many fruitful discussions between representatives of the individual methods in the past, which will bring us closer to the common goal of this research community: the creation of reliable and safe software and systems.  
 ABZ 2025 will have a main conference track, a case study track, a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops.

  Caution: there are some FAKE conferences that pretend to be ICFCA or ICCS conferences. The real ICFCA and ICCS conferences do not exist anymore. Fake conferences can be easily recognised because they do not have any FCA researchers on their committees. Furthermore, an internet search for the website domain name and ""scam"" or ""fake"" will provide evidence of the fake nature.

 History  
 ICFCA, CLA and ICCS are three highly relevant conferences in the field of formal concept analysis (FCA) and related areas. All three conferences contribute significantly to advancing the understanding and application of formal concept analysis. In particular:  
 On October 2023, representatives of the three conferences approved the merging of the three conferences  ICFCA,   CLA and ICCS   and creating a new joint event, the  International Joint Conference on Conceptual Knowledge Structures (CONCEPTS).   This merger aimed to create a unified and comprehensive forum for researchers, academics, and professionals from various disciplines interested in formal concept analysis, conceptual structures, and related fields to exchange ideas, present their research, and discuss the latest advancements in these areas. For this purpose, the overall organization of CONCEPTS will follow the existing rules and traditions of the three conferences.

 Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics  
 Robot algorithms are abstractions of computational processes that control or reason about motion and perception in the physical world. Because actions in the physical world are subject to physical laws and geometric constraints, the design and analysis of robot algorithms raises a unique combination of questions in control theory, computational and differential geometry, and computer science. Algorithms serve as a unifying theme in the multi-disciplinary field of robotics.  
 The Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations aims to bring together a group of about sixty researchers to discuss recent trends and important future directions of research on the algorithmic issues related to robotics and automation.

 FedCSIS 2025 Invited speakers and Keynotes   
  
 The mission   of the FedCSIS Conference Series is to provide a presentation, discussion and a reputable publication forum in computer science and intelligence systems. The forum invites researchers and practitioners from around the world to contribute their research results focused on their scientific and professional interests in a chosen area.  
 The FedCSIS conference consists of the Main Track  and Thematic Session  . Papers submitted to the Main Track can be assigned, by their authors, to Topical Areas,  which are managed by Topical Area Curators  . Based on the scope of the contribution, Topical Area Curators select its reviewers from the Main Track Program Committee  . Besides the Main Track, the authors may prefer to submit their papers to Thematic Session, which announce their own Calls for Thematic Session Papers  and are assisted by the FedCSIS Chairs in reaching out to the FedCSIS Community.  
 For all five Topical Areas, situated within a general domain of Computer Science, the continually emerging topic of Intelligence Systems stands as the common denominator. All Thematic Sessions also refer to the Intelligence Systems from different perspectives. They are regarded as a path toward introducing more Intelligence into Computer Science and IT.

 Areas of Interest 
 We welcome the submission of technical papers describing significant and original research on all aspects of the theory and practice of autonomous agents and multiagent systems. If you are new to this community, then we encourage you to consult the proceedings of previous editions of the conference to fully appreciate the scope of AAMAS. At the time of submission, you will be asked to associate your paper with one of the following areas of interest: 
 Learning and Adaptation (LEARN) 
 Game Theory and Economic Paradigms (GTEP) 
 Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms, and Ethics (COINE) 
 Search, Optimization, Planning, and Scheduling (SOPS) 
 Representation, Perception, and Reasoning (RPR)

 Additionally, AAMAS 2025 includes severalspecial tracks. You can find more information about these trackshref=""#special-tracks"" - here
. 
 Learning and Adaptation (LEARN) 
 Area Chairs: Long Tran-Thanh, Bo An, Marc Lanctot, Chongjie Zhang, Jianye Hao, Haifeng Xu, Jakob Foerster 
 Topics: 
 Reasoning and learning under uncertainty 
 Supervised learning 
 Unsupervised and representation learning 
 Reinforcement learning 
 Multiagent learning 
 Evolutionary algorithms 
 Learning agent capabilities 
 Learning agent-to-agent interactions 
 Human-in-the-loop learning 
 Agency and learning in large language models (LLMs) 
 Learning for value alignment and RLHF 
 Modeling and analysis of Generative AI agents 
 Few-shot learning 
 Distributionally-robust learning 
 Adversarial learning 
 Description: Autonomous Agents must sense, deliberate, act and communicate in potentially complex and uncertain environments. In addition, in many cases, they must interact with other agents and/or humans. Anticipating each situation and hardcoding the appropriate agent behavior becomes impossible as the complexity of the environment and interactions increase. As such, adaptivity and learning are key properties that imbue autonomy to agents operating and communicating in the real world. Papers in this area focus on all aspects of single agent and multiagent planning, learning and communication. 
 Game Theory and Economic Paradigms (GTEP) 
 Area Chairs: Reshef Meir, Nisarg Shah, Georgios Piliouras, Vasilis Gkatzelis, Rica Gonen 
 Topics: 
 Auctions and Mechanism Design 
 Bargaining and Negotiation 
 Behavioral Game Theory 
 Evolutionary Game Theory 
 Non-Cooperative Games: Equilibrium Concepts 
 Non-Cooperative Games: Computational Issues 
 Non-Cooperative Games: Theory and Applications 
 Voting and Preference Aggregation 
 Social Choice 
 Preference Aggregation and Value Alignment 
 Matching and Allocation 
 Coalition Formation 
 Cooperative Games 
 Description: This area encompasses research on cooperative and non-cooperative games, social choice, and mechanism design, specifically focusing on computational aspects such as algorithmic and complexity analysis for equilibrium computation and verification. The area also welcomes theoretical explorations and analysis related to game theory, mechanism and market design, and social choice. Submissions showcasing practical applications of game theory are also strongly encouraged. 
 Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms, and Ethics (COINE) 
 Area Chairs: Felipe Meneguzzi, Pradeep Murukannaiah 
 Topics: 
 Coordination and teamwork 
 Social network analysis 
 Norms, normative systems 
 Organizations and institutions 
 Non-strategic coalition/team formation 
 Communication, including using natural language 
 Policy, regulation, and accountability 
 Trust and reputation 
 Ethical considerations, including privacy, safety, security, transparency 
 Agreement Technologies: Negotiation and Argumentations 
 Responsible socio-technical systems 
 Description: Research in agent and multiagent systems has a long history of developing techniques that balance agent autonomy, adaptation, and distributed social reasoning with system-level considerations such as organizational and institutional policy enforcement addressing safety, security and fairness considerations. Teamwork and human-machine cooperation has an increased relevance with the transformation of our societies into socio-technical systems. We need to ensure transparency, foster trust, and ensure social reasoning conforms to societal norms and expectations. We also need to ensure human-machine and machine-machine cooperation is fostered responsibly, within an adequate accountability system and in alignment with the ethical values of individuals concerned. We encourage the submission of papers that highlight the design, development, evaluation, simulation, and analysis of novel, innovative, and impactful research on issues related to the above topics. 
 Search, Optimization, Planning, and Scheduling (SOPS) 
 Area Chairs: William Yeoh, Sven Koenig 
 Topics: 
 Single-agent planning and scheduling 
 Multiagent planning and scheduling 
 Decentralized planning and scheduling 
 Planning under uncertainty 
 Combinatorial optimization 
 Constraint programming 
 Distributed constraint reasoning 
 Resource and task allocation 
 Non-strategic coalition formation 
 Description: This area includes theoretical or experimental contributions to search, optimization, planning, and scheduling in single- and multi-agent systems. Important subfields include decentralized planning, planning under uncertainty, combinatorial optimization, distributed constraint reasoning, resource and task allocation, and non-strategic coalition formation. Machine learning approaches as well as foundation models for planning and scheduling are encouraged. Likewise, all approaches to single- and multi-agent planning, including motion and path planning, and their interplay with other agent components are relevant. 
 Representation, Perception, and Reasoning (RPR) 
 Area Chairs: Natasha Alechina, Aparna Taneja, Alessio Lomuscio 
 Topics: 
 Computer vision 
 Representation learning and generative AI 
 Neurosymbolic approaches 
 Argumentation 
 Agent theories and models 
 Explainability 
 Logics for agent reasoning 
 Ontologies for agents 
 Reasoning about knowledge, beliefs, goals, actions, plans, and change in multiagent systems 
 Reasoning and problem solving in agent-based systems 
 Verification of agents and multiagent systems 
 Description: This area includes theoretical or experimental contributions to knowledge representation and reasoning in single-agent and multi-agent systems. Knowledge representation is to be understood broadly, ranging from theoretical contributions (e.g., epistemic, strategic, description, and other logics) to representation learning. Moreover, representation and reasoning in complex settings often entails reasoning about sensing and perception. Relevant forms of reasoning include, for instance, automated reasoning and theorem proving approaches, verification-based approaches, as well as probabilistic reasoning and neurosymbolic approaches, as long as they are applied to, or motivated by reasoning about agents and/or multiagent systems. 
 Engineering and Analysis of Multiagent Systems (EMAS) 
 Area Chairs:Viviana Mascardi, Daniela Briola 
 Topics:

 Modeling and Simulation of (Artificial) Societies (SIM) 
 Area Chairs: Ana Bazzan, Samarth Swarup 
 Topics: 
 Analysis of agent-based simulations 
 Calibration methods for socio-demographic data 
 Agent-based models & Social Networks 
 Applications of agent-based simulations in social phenomena (polarization, inequality, etc.) 
 Emergent behavior 
 Engineering agent-based simulations 
 Interactive simulation 
 Modeling for agent-based simulation 
 Simulation of complex systems 
 Simulation techniques, tools and platforms 
 Social simulation 
 Validation of social simulation systems 
 Description: Artificial societies are computer simulations or models that are created to emulate and research the behavior of intricate social systems. These societies simulate the interactions and dynamics of people, animals or other organisms to understand how individual behaviors lead to emergent structures and interactions. Agent-based models of artificial society provide a way to analyze the impact of regulations, incentives and other interventions that help to understand the complex dynamics of society as a whole. The area aims to find efficient solutions to model and simulate complex societal systems using agents-based models. Important application areas include ecology, biology, economics, transportation, management, organizational, and social sciences in general. In these areas, agent theories, metaphors, models, analysis, experimental designs, empirical studies, and methodological principles, all converge into simulation as a way of achieving explanations and predictions, exploration and testing of hypotheses, and better system designs. 
 Human-Agent Interaction (HAI) 
 Area Chairs: Michael Goodrich, Birgit Lugrin 
 Topics: 
 Human-agent interaction 
 Agent-based analysis of human interactions 
 Socially interactive agents 
 Trust and explainability in human-agent interactions 
 Human-robot interaction and collaboration 
 Social robotics and social interactions 
 Mixed-initiative and shared autonomy in human-agent interactions 
 Groups of humans and agents 
 Agents models and architectures for interaction with humans 
 Designing for human-agent interaction 
 Virtual humans 
 Description: 
 Human interaction with artificially intelligent agents is becoming more commonplace, as such, developing and evaluating agents that can understand humans’ dynamics to support competent interaction. Significant challenges arise when transitioning from pure multiagent systems to hybrid systems that need to incorporate bi-directional human and agent interactions and sustain different competitive or collaborative situations. Agents need new models and architectures to better address the interaction with humans, including perception and recognition of humans’ internal states and activities at different levels, interaction modalities that support true coordination, and incorporation of human factors and ethics concerns. The design of human-agent interaction needs special concerns that combine requirements from the perspectives of both the agents and the humans. The interactive behavior of such agents can be inspired by human-human interaction and can, additionally, be embodied by virtual agents or robots to scaffold intuitive interaction. 
 Robotics and Control (ROBOT) 
 Area Chairs: Noa Agmon, Christopher Amato 
 Topics: 
 Multi-robot coordination and collaboration 
 Robot planning 
 Robot learning 
 Explainability, trust and ethics for robots

 Networked systems and distributed robotics 
 Robot control 
 Robot perception and vision 
 Robots in adversarial settings 
 Swarm and collective behavior 
 Execution monitoring and failure recovery for robots 
 Description: Robotics is one of the most exciting fields in agent research. We invite papers that advance theory and/or application of single and multiple robots, with particular emphasis on solutions based on realistic assumptions typically encountered in robotic applications. All papers at the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence (and agent research, specifically) are in the scope of the robotics area at AAMAS. 
 Innovative Applications (IA) 
 Area Chairs: Thanh Nguyen, Pradeep Varakantham 
 Topics: 
 Deployed or emerging applications of agent-based systems 
 Realistic agent-based models of human organizations 
 Evaluation of the cognitive capabilities of agent-based systems

 My fourth Australasian Combinatorics Conference 
 2015-12-14 
 maths 
 My first maths conference was The 36th Australasian Conference on Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial Computing. I had just finished my honours thesis,Generalising the Clique-Coclique Bound, and I had travelled to Sydney to present my results to a room full of people much smarter than me. 
 I’m no longer working in graph theory or finite geometry, but every year since 2012 I have attended the ACCMCC. I keep up to date with the research, and I maintain contact with some of the best mathematicians I’ve ever met. So last week I flew to Brisbane for the 39th ACCMCC, held at the gorgeous University of Queensland campus in St. Lucia. 
 As always, the ACCMCC was an expertly run conference. I have to mention the public lecture by Jonathan Jedwab,What is a research mathematician?. The lecture was held on the 150th birthday of Hadamard, and Jedwab used Hadamard matrices to illustrate the development of mathematical theory. Jedwab is one of the best mathematics speakers I’ve ever seen, and certainly the best at communicating maths to a general audience. 
 In a first for me, I decided to attend the conference excursion. It was a boat trip to the St. Helena National Park, used as a prison in the 19th century. The place itself was beautiful, but unfortunately the tour didn’t include a walk around the island. 
 The best part of the conference wasn’t the matroids, or even the “breakfast cheesecake” from the accommodation in which I was staying. You see, I got to spend the week with the mathematicians from my alma mater, The University of Western Australia. These people are passionate about mathematics, and it’s hard to be around them without feeling the same. 
 I got to hang out with Mark (bottom-left), with whom I shared an office while I was studying my honours degree, and who this year won the well-deserved prize for the best student talk. I got to attend a plenary by Gordon Royle (top), who taught me linear algebra and had to always tell me to stop talking in his lectures. And I got to have morning coffee with John Bamberg (middle), my honours supervisor and one of the people who first inspired me to do maths. 
 As I’m preparing to write my thesis and transition out of academia, I know that my conference days are coming to a close. But if all goes well, I hope to squeeze just one last ACCMCC out of my time at university. Next year is the 40th ACCMCC, held in Newcastle, and I’ll do my very best to make it my fifth Australasian combinatorics conference in a row.

The ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems is the premier international conference of Human-Computer Interaction. 
 CHI takes place in Yokohama, Japan, at thePACIFICO Yokohamafrom 26 April to 1 May 2025, while also supporting remote attendance. 
 The conference embraces the theme of Ikigai, a Japanese concept referring to what gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. In today’s world, people are facing a multitude of challenges in climate change, growing inequality, technological disruption, global conflict, and health crises. Ikigai concerns the ability of a person to find their purpose and balance their agency, their passion, their capabilities, and the impact they can have. The CHI community consists of people with many passions and talents, people from different disciplines and walks of life. In harnessing our ‘Ikigai’ into a communal ‘IkiCHI’ we can be greater than the sum of our efforts and offer unique contributions to solving the difficult challenges ahead. 
 The cherry blossom or ‘Sakura’ as depicted in the CHI’25 logo signifies a time of renewal and optimism. The conference takes place in the period of cherry blossom growth and in this environment of optimism and renewal, we wish you will find your IkiCHI.

 ACII 2025 
 The ACII 2025 organising committee is delighted to bring the ACII conference series to Australia for the first time.ACII 2025 will be anin-person eventheld at the Hotel Realm conference venue in Canberra, Australia. 
 The ACII conference series – organized by the Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC, formerly known as Humaine) – is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognise, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena. 
 The theme for ACII 2025 isSocially Responsible Affective Computing. 
 The main conference days will be on 8-10 Oct 2025, while workshops and tutorials will be held on Saturday, 11 Oct 2025. This ‘reverse’ conference schedule forACII 2025 will allow for maximum flexibility for attendees who also want to attend the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (href=""https://icmi.acm.org/2025/"" - ICMI 2025
, 13-17 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling to combine two excellent conferences in one trip. While the organising committees of ACII 2025 and ICMI 2025 are separate, the teams work closely together and investigate registration options that will allow for different combinations of attending the two conferences for those who cannot attend both conferences in full. Further details will be provided in due time. (Sunday, 12 Oct 2025 will be a rest and recovery day for those attending both conferences.)

 DEAR ICMI COMMUNITY, 
 We are thrilledto welcome you in-person in Canberra, Australia. 
 The 27th International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (ICMI 2025) will be held in Canberra, Australia on 13-17 Oct 2025. 
 ICMI is the premier international forum that brings together multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) and social interaction research. Multimodal AI encompasses technical challenges in machine learning and computational modeling such as representations, fusion, data, and systems. The study of social interactions englobes both human-human interactions and human-computer interactions. A unique aspect of ICMI is its multidisciplinary nature which values scientific discoveries and technical modeling achievements equally, with an eye toward impactful applications for the good of people and society. 
 We are keen to showcase novel input and output modalities and interactions to the ICMI community. ICMI 2025 will feature keynote speakers, technical full and short papers (including oral and poster presentations), demonstrations, exhibits, doctoral spotlight papers, and late-breaking papers. The conference will also feature workshops and grand challenges. The proceedings of all ICMI 2025 papers, including Long and Short Papers, will be published by ACM as part of their series of International Conference Proceedings and Digital Library, and the adjunct proceedings will feature the workshop papers.The main conference days will be on 14-16 Oct 2025, while workshops/tutorials and grand challenges will be held on 13 or 17 Oct 2025. This schedule will allow for maximum flexibility for attendees who also want to attend the 2025 13th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (href=""https://acii-conf.net/2025/"" - ACII 2025
, 8-11 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling to combine two excellent conferences in one trip. While the organising committees of ACII 2025 and ICMI 2025 are separate, the teams work closely together and investigate registration options that will allow for different combinations of attending the two conferences for those who cannot attend both conferences in full. Further details will be provided in due time. (Sunday, 12 Oct 2025 will be a rest and recovery day for those attending both conferences.)

 Call for Papers 
 Call for Papers 
 The Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC) invites you to submit your original research for presentation at the 13th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), which will be held as anin-person eventin Canberra, Australia, 8-11 October 2025.Accepted papers must be presented by one of the paper’s authors. 
 ACII 2025 will be held just before the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (href=""https://icmi.acm.org/2025/"" - ICMI 2025
, 13-17 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling the attendees to combine two excellent conferences in one trip. 
 The ACII conference series is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognise, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena. All accepted papers will be included in IEEE Xplore (subject to approval by the IEEE Computer Society) and indexed by EI. A selection of the best articles at ACII 2025 will be invited to submit extended versions to theIEEETransactions on Affective Computing. 
 The theme for ACII 2025 isSocially Responsible Affective Computing. Affective computing, with its ability to recognise and respond to human emotions, holds great potential for enhancing user experiences and fostering more natural interactions between humans and machines. It also has promising applications in fields such as mental health, where this technology can assist psychologists and other clinicians in making more accurate diagnoses by detecting mental states. However, this powerful technology also raises significant ethical concerns that must be addressed to ensure its responsible and transparent use. 
 One of the primary challenges is the potential misuse or exploitation of sensitive emotional data, including for manipulative or discriminatory purposes. Ensuring robust data privacy, clear ethical guidelines, and regulations around the use of emotional data is crucial. Additionally, the lack of transparency of many affective computing algorithms, systems build on limited data, and the potential for biases in emotion inference systems pose risks of perpetuating harmful stereotypes or inaccurate assessments based on factors such as gender, race, or cultural background. Transparency, accountability, and mitigating biases in these systems are essential to build trust with users. 
 Recognising these concerns, regulatory efforts such as the EU AI Act aim to establish legal frameworks and stringent requirements for high-risk AI applications, including those related to emotional state detection, ultimately safeguarding individual rights and upholding ethical principles in the development and deployment of affective computing technologies. A stronger focus needs to be placed on these matters by the affective computing research community. 
 The ACII 2025 (8-11 Oct 2025) and ICMI 2025 (13-17 Oct 2025) conferences will be held in back-to-back mode at the same venue in Canberra, Australia – one trip, two great conferences!

Overview 
 ACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. ACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and by the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals. 
 Papers submitted to ACL 2025, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics. 
 Paper Submission Information 
 Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2025 February cycle. Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2025 February cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to ACL 2025 via thehref=""https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/2025/Conference"" - conference commitment site
.

 Special Theme | : Generalization of NLP Models 
 ACL 2025 Theme Track: Generalization of NLP Models 
 Following the success of the ACL 2020-2024 Theme tracks, we are happy to announce that ACL 2025 will have a new theme with the goal of reflecting and stimulating discussion about the current state of development of the field of NLP. 
 Generalization is crucial for ensuring that models behave robustly, reliably, and fairly when making predictions on data different from their training data. Achieving good generalization is critically important for models used in real-world applications, as they should emulate human-like behavior. Humans are known for their ability to generalize well, and models should aspire to this standard. 
 The theme track invites empirical and theoretical research and position and survey papers reflecting on the Generalization of NLP Models. The possible topics of discussion include (but are not limited to) the following: 
 How can we enhance the generalization of NLP models across various dimensions—compositional, structural, cross-task, cross-lingual, cross-domain, and robustness? 
 What factors affect the generalization of NLP models? 
 What are the most effective methods for evaluating the generalization capabilities of NLP models? 
 While Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhance the generalization of NLP models, what are the key limitations of LLMs in this regard? 
 The theme track submissions can be either long or short. We anticipate having a special session for this theme at the conference and a Thematic Paper Award in addition to other categories of awards. 
 Two-Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to ACL 2025 
 ACL 2025 will usehref=""https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp"" - ACL Rolling Review
(ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via theOpen Reviewplatform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process: 
 Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors; 
 Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., ACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews. 
 ACL 2025 has chosen this approach in coordination with *CL 2024 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, after a paper has been fully reviewed, authors have the option to commit their paper to a conference or revise and resubmit for another round of reviews. 
 The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers, and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible. 
 Mandatory Reviewing Workload 
 As the pace of research in the field continues to increase, we need to strengthen the commitment to reviewing for each paper submission. During the ARR submission process, authors will be required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing in this reviewing cycle. Please see the new ARR policy regarding reviewing workload here. As this is an ARR-wide policy for all *CL conferences, questions or clarifications should be addressed to ARR directly.

 Following thehref=""https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/report-acl-committee-anonymity-policy"" - ACL and ARR policies
, there is no anonymity period requirement. 
 At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., ACL 2025). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected ACL 2025 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to ACL 2025 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than ACL 2025 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to ACL 2025. 
 Presentation at the Conference 
 All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline may be subject to desk rejection. Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.

 What is computational linguistics? 
 Computational linguisticsis the scientific study of language from a computational perspective. Computational linguists are interested in providing computational models of various kinds of linguistic phenomena. These models may be ""knowledge-based"" (""hand-crafted"") or ""data-driven"" (""statistical"" or ""empirical""). Work in computational linguistics is in some cases motivated from a scientific perspective in that one is trying to provide a computational explanation for a particular linguistic or psycholinguistic phenomenon; and in other cases the motivation may be more purely technological in that one wants to provide a working component of a speech or natural language system. Indeed, the work of computational linguists is incorporated into many working systems today, including speech recognition systems, text-to-speech synthesizers, automated voice response systems, web search engines, text editors, language instruction materials, to name just a few. 
 Popular computational linguistics textbooks include: 
 Christopher Manning and Hinrich Schütze (1999) | Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing | , Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. MIT Press. | Also see the book's | supplemental materials website | at Stanford. 
 Daniel Jurafsky and James Martin (2008) | An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition | , Second Edition. Prentice Hall.

 Submission Guidelines 
 All papers for ACM WiSec 2025 must be submitted electronically through the HotCRP conference management system. 
 First Cycle: | href=""https://wisec25.hotcrp.com/"" - HotCRP submission site for Cycle 1 
 Second Cycle: | href=""https://wisec25-cycle2.hotcrp.com"" - HotCRP submission site for Cycle 2 
 Only PDF files will be accepted. Submissions must be prepared using the following ACM proceedings template and must use US Letter page size (215.9 x 279.4 mm / 8.5 x 11 inches): 
 The ACM proceedings template for LaTeX can be found at | Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - SIG Proceedings Template | . 
 Please look at | ACM Primary Article Template | for further information on ACM proceedings templates. 
 Full, short, and SoK papers 
 Full paper submissions must be at most 10 pages in double-column ACM format (use document option “sigconf”), excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for double-blind review. 
 Detailed submission instructions will be made available as the deadline approaches. 
 In addition to regular papers that present novel contributions in the field, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 15 pages overall. They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings. 
 Posters and demos 
 WiSec will solicit the submission of posters and demos. The instructions to submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website. 
 Artifact Evaluation label 
 In the spirit of open science, WiSec encourages authors of accepted papers to make software and data artifacts publicly available to the community. 
 Such artifacts will be evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee and corresponding papers will be granted an artifact evaluation label. While artifacts are optional, their availability will be positively considered during paper evaluation. Should the authors choose to submit their artifacts for evaluation, they should indicate their decision upon paper submission and follow the artifact submission guidelines in order to submit them upon paper acceptance. The detailed guidelines will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website. 
 Double submissions 
 It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions, where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved. Technical reports and pre-prints published online are allowed. 
 Workshops and Tutorial 
 ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorials that are co-organized with the main conference. Details will be made available on the website. 
 Research Ethics 
 The ethical conduct of research is critical to ensuring the public’s trust and support of science. All submitted papers will be reviewed for ethical concerns, and if ethical practices are not followed a paper will be rejected regardless of any other merit. Ethical concerns vary from project to project, so there is no “one size fits all” approach. Rather, researchers should consider ethical analysis to be an integral part of the research, just as evaluation and method design are. Ethics should be considered early in a project, during a project, and as the project is prepared for publication. 
 While every situation is unique, there are principles that researchers should consider and apply during their projects. The Menlo Report provides guidance and examples for network security. Principally, all research should embody the concepts of beneficence, justice, respect for persons, and respect of law and public interest. This is just as true for technical research as human subjects research. For example, if it is possible that a research method could cause harm to systems or users (e.g., testing jamming) researchers should explicitly detail the measures taken to prevent harm. 
 Research ethics is also paramount in any study that could be classified as “human subjects.” For WiSec, “human subject research” is defined as “research that involves interaction with identifiable humans or analysis of datasets containing data from one or more identifiable living humans.” Researchers are expected to follow the laws and common practices regarding human subjects review of their relevant jurisdictions and institutions. For example, researchers in the United States must undergo review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before beginning human subjects research. Authors doing human subjects research should mention the review standards in their jurisdictions and if they were met. 
 Computer security and privacy research often studies and even advanced tools and techniques with the capacity to harm others. In their submission, authors must convince reviewers that appropriate steps were taken to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to appropriate parties 
 Policy for Peer-Review Integrity 
 All SIGSAC-sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities (https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment) and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics). Also, all authors, PC members, and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc). Particularly, we require all reviewers to uphold the integrity of the peer review process and avoid conflict of interest of any form (e.g., reviewer collusion ring). Those who violate these policies will be penalized according to ACM policies (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/penalties-for-publication-violations). If you would like to report a violation, please contact program chairs of your conferences/workshops or SIGSAC officers. We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your communication.

 Please look at ACM Primary Article Template for further information on ACM proceedings templates. 
 Full, short, and SoK papers 
 Full paper submissions to ACM WiSec 2025 can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for double-blind reviewing. 
  
 Detailed submission instructions will be made available as the deadline approaches. 
  
 In addition to regular papers that present novel contributions in the field, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 15 pages overall. They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings. 
  
 Posters and demos 
 WiSec will solicit submission of posters and demos. The instructions to submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website. 
  
 Artifact Evaluation label 
 In the spirit of open science, WiSec encourages authors of accepted papers to make software and data artifacts publicly available to the community. 
  
 Such artifacts will be evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee and corresponding papers will be granted an artifact evaluation label. While artifacts are optional, their availability will be positively considered during paper evaluation. Should the authors choose to submit their artifacts for evaluation, they should indicate their decision upon paper submission and follow the artifact submission guidelines in order to submit them upon paper acceptance. The detailed guidelines will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website. 
  
 Double submissions 
 It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions, where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved. Technical reports and pre-prints published online are allowed. 
  
 Workshops and Tutorial 
 ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorials co-organized with the main conference. Details will be made available on the website.

 Welcome to the 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia! 
 Welcome to ACM Multimedia, the premier international conference dedicated to advancing research and applications across diverse multimedia fields. This conference brings together leading minds from academia and industry to explore cutting-edge developments in areas such as video, haptics, virtual and augmented reality, audio, speech, music, sensor, and social data. With a strong focus on integrating and exchanging information across modalities, ACM Multimedia encourages innovative approaches that have the potential for significant technological breakthroughs and positive real-world impacts. As a community with a rich tradition of leveraging AI and systems research to handle big data and enhance user experiences, we also place a unique emphasis on novel applications and addressing urgent industrial challenges. The conference warmly welcomes new intellectual perspectives and submissions from a wide range of related disciplines, including artificial intelligence, 3D & metaverse, vision and languages, human-computer interaction, and multimedia signal processing. We are particularly excited to see contributions that push the boundaries of multimedia in fields such as healthcare, education, and entertainment. Join us as we explore the future of multimedia innovation through the lens of four major conference themes, and help shape the next generation of groundbreaking multimedia technologies. 
 This year, ACM Multimedia 2025 will be held in Dublin, Ireland, and will be colocated with both CBMI 2025 and MediaEval 2025, both of which immediately precede the conference. At ACM Multimedia 2025, we expect to welcome you all to Dublin for an extensive in-person program consisting of technical sessions covering all aspects of the multimedia field via oral, video and poster presentations, tutorials, panels, exhibits, demonstrations, workshops, doctoral symposium, multimedia grand challenge, brave new ideas on shaping the research landscape, and open source software competition. Welcome to Dublin.

 Welcome to the 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia! 
 Welcome to ACM Multimedia, the premier international conference dedicated to advancing research and applications across diverse multimedia fields. This conference brings together leading minds from academia and industry to explore cutting-edge developments in areas such as video, haptics, virtual and augmented reality, audio, speech, music, sensor, and social data. With a strong focus on integrating and exchanging information across modalities, ACM Multimedia encourages innovative approaches that have the potential for significant technological breakthroughs and positive real-world impacts. As a community with a rich tradition of leveraging AI and systems research to handle big data and enhance user experiences, we also place a unique emphasis on novel applications and addressing urgent industrial challenges. The conference warmly welcomes new intellectual perspectives and submissions from a wide range of related disciplines, including artificial intelligence, 3D & metaverse, vision and languages, human-computer interaction, and multimedia signal processing. We are particularly excited to see contributions that push the boundaries of multimedia in fields such as healthcare, education, and entertainment. Join us as we explore the future of multimedia innovation through the lens of four major conference themes, and help shape the next generation of groundbreaking multimedia technologies. 
 This year, ACM Multimedia 2025 will be held in Dublin, Ireland, and will be colocated with both CBMI 2025 and MediaEval 2025, both of which immediately precede the conference. At ACM Multimedia 2025, we expect to welcome you all to Dublin for an extensive in-person program consisting of technical sessions covering all aspects of the multimedia field via oral, video and poster presentations, tutorials, panels, exhibits, demonstrations, workshops, doctoral symposium, multimedia grand challenge, brave new ideas on shaping the research landscape, and open source software competition.

 Hard Topic Theme:Automated Detection and Patching of Software Vulnerabilities 
 This year's hard topic theme solicits research results and technologies that advance our ability to automatically identify and fix software security vulnerabilities. Security vulnerabilities exist in any domain that relies on software, including the Internet of Things, the Web, and cyber-physical systems. Automatically identifying issues in real-world codebases is becoming increasingly challenging, given the complexity of advanced vulnerabilities and the size of commonly used code.

 ACSAC solicits papers offering novel contributions in any aspect of applied security research. We encourage papers with results that are demonstrably useful for improving cybersecurity and that address lessons learned from practical applications. In particular, we encourage the submission of papers related to our hard topic theme:Automated Detection and Patching of Software Vulnerabilities. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published elsewhere or that have been simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with proceedings and are under review. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to present at the conference in person, with limited exceptions allowed on a case-by-case basis. 
 Reproduction and Replication (R+R) Papers:Security research is often criticized for the poor reproducibility of its results, a situation we aim to address through artifact evaluation. At the same time, reproduction and replication studies are often undervalued in academic publishing. Thus, in addition to regular papers and artifact evaluations, this year we are also soliciting studies that confirm, question, or clarify the results of previous research. These papers must contain the prefix “R+R:” in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form. 
 We encourage submissions to follow the ACM guidelines onreproducibility(different team, same experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-use) andreplicability(different team, different experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-implementation). Note, however, that submissions need to go beyond re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper(s) or re-implementing their approach. We are looking for submissions that not only replicate existing studies but also critically assess, clarify and extend their findings and limitations. This includes, but is not limited to, the verification of existing research results, ensuring their validity and reliability across different contexts, lessons learned when applying research results in real-world (industry) settings, and the adaption of artifacts to contemporary cybersecurity challenges. 
 Reproduction and replication papers will be held to the same scientific standards as original technical papers, will be reviewed by the full program committee, will appear in the proceedings, and will be presented at the conference as part of the technical program. We also particularly encourage these types of papers to provide their artifacts. 
 Review Process:Paper submissions will be judged based on novelty, relevance to the conference topics, technical correctness, quality of the evaluation, and presentation clarity. Papers will undergo a double-blind review process in two rounds. At the end of Round 1, papers for which a strong consensus towards rejection is reached will be notified of the early rejection decision, giving them the opportunity to improve their paper based on the reviewers’ feedback and to resubmit to other venues. Papers that advance to Round 2 will be assigned additional reviewers. At the end of Round 2, the authors of papers that advanced to this stage will have an opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and comments. After the authors' response period, the papers will be further discussed by the Program Committee (PC) to reach a final decision. 
 Three outcomes are possible: Accepted, Minor Revision, and Rejected. The Minor Revision decision is reserved to papers that can be considered as conditionally accepted, assuming improvements required by the reviewers are made within the available revision time window and are approved by the PC. A PC member will be assigned as shepherd for Minor Revision papers, to guide the authors through the revision process and to lead the discussion on the revised paper among the reviewers. The revision requirements may include both presentation improvements and additional experiments that the PC believes are necessary to significantly improve the paper and that should be feasible within a limited time frame. While Minor Revision papers that do not meet the required changes may be rejected, the expectation is that most papers will be able to satisfy the required improvements and be finally accepted into the conference program. Both the author's responses and the discussions around revision requirements for Minor Revision papers will be handled anonymously, via the paper submission system. 
 Paper Artifacts:Authors of accepted papers are expected to submit their software and data artifacts for formal evaluation by theArtifacts Evaluation Committeeand to make them publicly available to the entire community. During submission, authors of papers whose main contributions and experimental results rely primarily on new or reproduced artifacts (e.g., code and/or data) are expected to indicate whether they will separately submit their artifacts for evaluation, if their paper is accepted, and should acknowledge this intention by ticking the related box on the submission platform. This acknowledgement will be visible to the reviewers and may therefore be taken into consideration during the review process. Authors who have justifiable reasons to not submit their artifacts for evaluation (in case their paper is accepted) should add a comment in the corresponding comment box in the submission form. Additionally, during paper submission authors can optionally provide a URL pointing to a repository containing their paper artifacts. While artifacts will be formally evaluated only if the paper is accepted, as explained above, reviewers may also take into account the availability and quality of the paper artifacts during the main paper review process, before making a final decision (please refer to the paper submission form for additional details). 
 Important:When preparing the artifacts repository for inclusion in the paper submission form, please take extra care to not include authors’ information in the repository or artifacts content, so as not to break the anonymity of the paper submission. Additional information and recommendations on anonymizing the artifacts repository can be foundhere. 
 Ethical Considerations:Papers that might raise ethical concerns (e.g., papers that use human subjects, leverage potentially sensitive data, or describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems) must include an Ethical Considerations section that properly describes what procedures have been followed to minimize potential harm. Such papers should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties, whether an institutional ethics committee reviewed the research, or how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software/system vendors or owners before publication. 
 Paper Format:Please ensure that your submission consists of a PDF file of no more than 11 double-column pages, excluding well-marked references and appendices limited to a maximum of 5 pages. The full PDF document must not exceed a total of 16 pages. Please note that PC members are not required to read the appendices and that page limits will be strictly enforced. 
 Papers must be appropriately anonymized to the dual anonymous review process. Author names and affiliations must not be included in the PDF submission. Authors can cite and refer to their own prior work, but must do so in the third person, as if it was written by someone else. In the rare case that citing previous work in the third person is not possible, please anonymize the reference and notify the Program Chairs. 
 Submissions must be generated using the double-column IEEE format (see template available athttps://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). LaTeX submissions must use the IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b template with the \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran} documentclass option. Papers should be formatted for US letter (not A4). All papers must be submitted exclusively through the ACSAC 2024 paper submission system. Note that paper title and abstract registration is not necessary ahead of the paper submission. 
 All formatting guidelines and constraints (e.g., page limits and anonymity) will be strictly enforced. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. The Program Chairs will also desk reject papers that do not include enough content (e.g., are too short) or do not match the conference’s topics of interest below.

 Conflicts of Interest 
 Authors are required to specify their conflicts of interest with Program Committee (PC) members when submitting a paper. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when and only when one or more of the following conditions holds: 
 The PC member is an author of the paper. 
 The PC member has been working at the same institution or company as one of the paper authors in the past two years. 
 The PC member has been a collaborator of one of the paper authors in the past two years. Collaborations include being Co-PI on grants (either funded or pending) and being a coauthor on one of the paper author’s publications (either published or unpublished). Any ongoing collaboration, even if it has not produced a publication or a grant submission yet, counts as a conflict under this policy.The PC member is or was one of the paper author’s primary thesis advisors, no matter how long ago. 
 One of the paper’s authors is or was the PC member’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
 The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of one of the paper’s authors. 
 For any other situation where the authors feel they have a conflict with a PC member, they must explain the nature of the conflict to the PC chairs, who will mark the conflict if appropriate. The program chairs will review declared conflicts. Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection. 
 Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion 
 ACSAC adheres to the IEEE’s Computer Society Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion guidelines. Authors are encouraged to consider DEI issues as they prepare their submissions (e.g., keep in mind thatWords Matter). For any suggestions, concerns, or complaints regarding DEI-related biases or harassment, we encourage you to reach out to the Conference Chairs. All communications regarding DEI will be treated as confidential.

Call for Conference Papers 
 ADBIS conferences provide an international platform for the presentation of research on database theory, development of advanced DBMS technologies, solutions for data engineering and analytics, and their advanced applications. The main objective of the ADBIS series of conferences is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote interaction and collaboration among the database, information systems, data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning communities from European countries and the rest of the world. ADBIS 2024 will consist of regular sessions with technical contributions reviewed and selected by an international program committee, as well as of invited keynote and tutorial talks presented by leading scientists. 
 For the second consecutive time in the ADBIS series, ADBIS 2024 considers a shepherding phase to help authors of borderline papers improve their papers. 
 Topics 
 We invite the submission of original research contributions addressing core data management tasks, as well as techniques and technologies in the following broad areas of data management: 
 Database Management Systems 
 Information Systems Architectures and Data Services 
 Management and Mining of Heterogeneous Data Types 
 Big Data Management and Analytics 
 Scalable Data Science 
 Responsible Data Science 
 Important Dates 
 Abstract submission deadline:April 15,2024 
 Paper submission deadline:April 20,2024 
 Notification of acceptance/shepherding:June 10, 2024 
 Camera-ready papers/end of shepherding:July 05, 2024 
 Paper Submission, Publishing, and Awards 
 The organizers of ADBIS 2024 invite original papers (not submitted elsewhere in parallel) describing results that broadly belong to the aforementioned list of topics. Both short and long paper submissions are accepted. 
 LONG papers can be: 
 Regular research papers, reporting novel, solid research findings within the scope of the conference, typically but not exclusively found in proposing new models, querying or data handling methods, algorithms, data structures, and system architectures for the management of data; 
 Experimental re-evaluation papers, assessing previously published research results in terms of (i) performance evaluation for algorithms and systems, or, (ii) assessment of the application for methodologies, with the contribution of the paper being found (i) in the evaluation findings and (ii) in the discussion of strong and weak aspects of the algorithm/system/method being assessed. 
 SHORT papers can be: 
 Early findings/work-in-progress reports for prompt dissemination and discussion of early research results, that include early experimental findings and implementations, with an emphasis on (i) the description of the early findings, (ii) the possibilities they present, and, (iii) the difficulties being faced towards full fruition; 
 Vision papers, discussing possibilities and challenges in the exploration of radically new system architectures or methodologies for data management in important areas related to the scope of the conference, or areas that are currently considered outside the scope of the conference but hold the potential of becoming relevant. 
 Submission Guidelines and Instructions 
 The page limits are as follows: 
 LONG (research or experimental) papers: 14 LNCS style pages; 
 SHORT (early findings or visionary) papers: up to 10 LNCS style pages. 
 Papers should be submitted in PDF format using thehref=""https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=adbis2024"" - EasyChair
online submission system. 
 Authors should consulthref=""https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines"" - Springer’s authors’ guidelines
and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. 
 Borderline papers will go through a shepherding phase where they will be expected to address the concerns of the reviewers, expressed as a list of required revisions. Failing to properly address them in due time will entail final rejection. 
 Shepherding 
 Borderline papers will go through a shepherding phase where they will be expected to address the concerns of the reviewers, expressed as a list of required revisions. Failing to properly address them in due time will entail final rejection. The shepherding process will involve: authors will be given a list of issues/improvements that have to be addressed within 2 weeks' time; authors improve the paper addressing these concerns; authors submit the revised paper in camera-ready format; the PC chairs ultimately decide whether the revised paper is acceptable as is or not to the final program. 
 The schedule for shepherding is as follows: 
 Notification of shepherding status:June 10, 2024 
 Authors submit revised, camera-ready version:June 25, 2025 
 Notification of acceptance for shepherded papers:June 30, 2023 
 Camera-ready documents and copyright:July 05, 2023 
 Awards 
 ADBIS 2024 will award the Best Conference Paper Award and the Best Doctoral Symposium Paper Award, each receiving a 500 EUR prize sponsored by Springer. 
 Special Issue 
 The best papers of the conference will be invited to special issues in top tier journals (TBA), to be organized after the conference. 
 Diversity and Inclusion 
 GRANTS. In line with previous editions, and to foster a broad inclusion, the conference will provide two participation grants (registration waiving) for two students from East European Countries. To the extent possible, every effort will be made to potentially increase this number. 
 D&I INITIATIVE. The ADBIS community believes that diversity and culture of support encourage retention and attraction of talent, promote diversity of thought and perspective, and help make the scientific community more flexible and responsive in times of change. For these reasons, ADBIS 2024 continues to participate in the Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) initiative of the Database community aiming to guide researchers in our community to adopt a more inclusive mindset in general toward different individuals regardless of their age, gender, gender identity, race, cultural background, religion, physical and mental ability, sexual orientation, parental and marital status, etc. If you have any comments, questions, suggestions, or complaints, please email the ADBIS 2024 Diversity and Inclusion chairs. | Home | New CFP | My CFPs | Watchlist | ADBIS 2024: 28th European Conference on Advances in Databases and Information Systems

 Call for Papers:Shepherding Track 
 Purpose.The Shepherding Track serves as a novel venue for high-quality publications of research conducted by pre/early-PhDs and honours/master students. This track aims to enrich the academic training and experience of junior students by selecting early-career researchers as shepherd mentors to provide actionable instructions on students' preliminary submission and results. If the submission's research contribution and quality meets the expectation, the submission will be accepted into the main conference. 
 Relationship to ADC.Submissions to the track will be part of the main ADC conference, presented alongside the main conference research track papers. Accepted papers will be published in the ADC proceedings. We will maintain a page on the ADC website with all accepted submissions. 
 Presentation.The students will present their accepted papers in the Doctoral Consortium. Mentors and senior researchers will give feedback in-person. 
 Criteria.We are aiming for an equally stringent review as that of the research track but tailored to cater towards a shepherding process. Submissions to this track will be reviewed by the selected shepherd mentors. 
 Relevant Topics.Please refer to those in the CFP of the research track. 
 Instructions 
 Submission format. 
 All submitted papers must be in English and conform to the formatting instructions for the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) including references and figures. 
 The format style files are available at | href=""https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines"" - LNCS Authors Instructions Page | . 
 Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. 
 The length of the initial submission should be | at least 8 pages but not exceed 12 pages (excluding any references), | presenting most of the components (e.g., main ideas, algorithms, experiments) of a research full paper for shepherding. The length of a demo paper should be | at most 4 pages (excluding any references). | Paper format is consistent with the research track. Please refer to the CFP of research track for details on paper format. 
 Shepherd assignment.When a submission to this track is received, two shepherds from the ADC Shepherding Committee will be assigned to the paper. The shepherds will follow up with the corresponding author to provide guidance on improving the paper and to review the paper. Authors will receive email notifications of their delegated shepherds one week after the submission is received. Note that shepherds are not expected to be listed as a co-author of the paper. They act as mentors. 
 Important Dates 
 Submission deadline.Continuous until 30 September, 2024 (23:59AEST UTC+10). The shepherding process will be carried out at any time when a submission is received until the deadline. Authors considering this track are encouraged to submit their preliminary work as early as possible for timely feedback from the delegated mentors/shepherds. 
 Author notification.15 October, 2024 (23:59AEST UTC+10). 
 Camera-ready deadline.27 October, 2024 (23:59AEST UTC+10). When preparing the camera-ready version, authors are required to include a “Shepherding Process” section to describe briefly what has been changed after the shepherding. 
 Submissions 
 The submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one author will attend the conference in person to present the work.

The Advanced Computing and Communication Society (ACCS) in association with The International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIITB) announces the 29th annual International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM 2024) at Bangalore during 18th - 20th December 2024. 
 ADCOM, the flagship Systems Conference of the ACCS, is a major annual international meeting that draws leading scientists and researchers in computational and communications engineering from across industry and academia. ADCOM highlights the growing importance of Large-Scale Systems Engineering and provides the platform to share, discuss and witness leading edge research and trends. 
 ADCOM 2024 seeks to share insights for a ‘Responsible AI’ framework to develop Artificial Intelligence safely and ethically based on the five core principles of fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy and safety. Sustainable, reliable, effective, and human-centered AI systems require responsible AI principles and perspectives not only from technological but also from ethical, legal, and socio-economic domains. This edition of ADCOM will also explore as a sub theme the democratization of access to AI with a need for Trust, Risk and Security Management (TRiSM) to enhance positive performance and societal gains that AI enables. 
 ADCOM 2024 calls for original, high impact research papers on Responsible AI Frameworks and related technologies while seeking novel contributions that help define Trust and Security Management in large AI systems.

 Submission Guidelines 
 CMT Acknowledgment 
 The Microsoft CMT service was used for managing the peer-reviewing process for this conference. This service was provided for free by Microsoft and they bore all expenses, including costs for Azure cloud services as well as for software development and support. 
 Submission Site 
 href=""https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADMA2025"" - https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADMA2025
Formatting Guidelines 
 The paper should be in English and contain unpublished contributions to the data mining and related fields. 
 Manuscripts must be prepared in accordance with the LNAI (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence) format. For the template and details on the LNCS style, seehref=""https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines"" - Springer's Author Instructions 
 The paper should NOT exceed 15 pages in LNAI format. 
 Submissions are reviewed in adouble-blindmanner. For ADMA2025 the double-blind means that: 
 Author identities and affiliations are not disclosed to reviewers during the review process. 
 Authors should prepare and submit suitably blinded manuscripts that do not reveal author and affiliation information. Specific requirements to this end are detailed below. 
 Authors and reviewers alike make an honest effort to avoid accidentally de-blinding any submission. 
 The list of authors at the time of submission is final and cannot be changed. 
 ""Submitted papers"" must comply with all of the rules below. Any violation may result in an""desk reject"". 
 Manuscript Preparation 
 Authors must submit PDFs without author names and affiliations. Submitted PDFs must also not contain any metadata that could reveal author identities or affiliations. 
 Authors should aim to avoid copy&pasting substantial amounts of text from their own prior publications, as such text blocks may be readily recognized by experts familiar with the state of the art and recent papers in the area. 
 Similarly, authors should not directly reuse figures from their own prior publications without attribution. Ideally, “fresh” figures should be prepared and used whenever possible. If that is not a viable option, that is, if a figure must be reused, then a citation should be included giving credit to the original paper from which the illustration has been adapted. 
 Authors must refrain from using any specific formatting tricks linguistic mannerisms, figure styles, or other stylistic idioms that could hint at or disclose the author identity or affiliation. 
 Submitted papers should not include an acknowledgements section or funding acknowledgements (even when blinded) since it can indicate the country of residence of (some of) the authors. (Such acknowledgements of course may be added to the camera-ready version.) 
 Authors who seek to refer to an online appendix or to supplemental materials (e.g., source code, videos, etc.) may still do so. However, instead of directly providing a URL or tech report number, authors should include a note that the appendices and/or supplemental materials in question are available from the track chair upon request. 
 Authors must provide all supplemental materials and/or appendices that a submission refers to in blinded form and sent them to the PC chair by email (or other approaches appointed by the PC chair) before the submission deadline. 
 The track chair will retain a copy of all submitted materials for the duration of the reviewing process. Any such provided appendices or supplemental materials are not subject to review and may be consulted by the reviewers at their own discretion. 
 It is imperative to acknowledge the contributions of AI models in the generation of textual content. Authors utilizing AI-generated text in their manuscripts are required to assume full responsibility for the accuracy, integrity, and originality of the material presented. Furthermore, any section of the paper employing AI-generated text should include clear documentation and description of the AI system utilized. This transparency ensures that readers can discern between human-authored content and text generated by AI, fostering a culture of accountability and integrity within the scholarly community. 
 Own Prior Work, Well-Known Projects, and Research Artifacts 
 Authors should not upload their manuscript to preprint servers (such as arXiv) or their personal websites while the paper is under review, or otherwise publicly reveal their authorship of the manuscript under review. 
 As an exception to the previous rule, if a prior version of the manuscript has already been uploaded to a public preprint server prior to submission (e.g., if the paper is a re-submission of a paper previously rejected at another single-blind conference), then the paper may still be submitted to ADMA2025. However, such papers must be blinded when submitted to ADMA2025. 
 In exceptional circumstances that force a violation of the above two rules (e.g., a technical report or thesis must be filed in order for a student to graduate), the authors should contact the Program Chair prior to publicizing their manuscript content to avoid misunderstandings. 
 When submitting or extending a prior workshop publication, the workshop paper is treated as an online preprint for the purpose of the double-blind peer-review process. However, authors must proactively disclose the existence of a prior workshop version of a submitted paper. Such information should be emailed to the Program Chair. Failure to disclose a prior workshop publication is considered self-plagiarism. 
 After communicating with the Program Chair, submissions with conditions 2., 3., or 4. above are recommended to add a headline (or footer) on the first page with the following information: “This submission is based on Preprints, Paper Announcements, and Prior Workshop Papers. The information has been communicated with the Program Chair. The author(s) and the Program Chair request the reviewers not to actively search for the author names to ensure fairness of the double-blind review process.” Please contact the Program Chair at least 24 hours before the submission deadline if this applies to your submission. If the paper is accepted, the above text should be removed and appropriate citations if any should be added (e.g., citation for prior workshop paper, technical report or thesis and its relation to the accepted paper). 
 If your submission is an extended version of a workshop paper with DOI, you will be asked to provide a blinded version of the workshop paper as supplementary material. This will be used by the reviewers to verify that there is sufficient amount of new material in the extended version to warrant a publication at ADMA2025. 
 Conflicts of Interest 
 We use CMT’s conflict management system, through which authors should flag conflicts with members of the Program Committee. X and Y have a conflict of interest if any of the following applies: 
 X and Y have worked in the same university or company in the past two years, or will be doing so in the next six months on account of an accepted job offer. Different campuses within the same university system do not count as the same university for this purpose - UC Berkeley does not have a conflict with UC Santa Barbara. 
 X has been a co-author of a paper with Y in the last three years. 
 X has been a collaborator within the past two years, as evidenced in a joint publication (subsumed by the stricter rule on co-authorship above), joint research project, or co-organizing events (e.g., co-chairs of conferences), or are collaborating now (including co-authorship on papers not resulted in final publication yet). 
 X is the master’s/PhD thesis advisor of Y or vice versa, irrespective of how long ago this was. 
 X is a relative or close personal friend of Y. 
 It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify and declare all COIs with members of the Program Committee (reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs) prior to the submission deadline. Submissions with undeclared conflicts or spurious conflicts will be desk-rejected.

 Update to the AIAI Community from the Organisers 
 Dear Colleagues, 
 On behalf of the 21stAIAI (Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations) 2025 Organizing and Scientific Committee, it is a real honor and pleasure to welcome all Artificial Intelligence scholars who are looking for a well-established and prestigious forum to communicate and disseminate the innovative advances of their research. It is a fact that AI is continuously digging its way in a vast number of diverse scientific domains. AIAI aims to provide a forum for delegates from both academia and industry, who wish to share pioneer ideas, to get to know each other better and to present their research. Moreover, it aims to offer a deep glimpse into the future and to examine important AI ethical aspects. 
 TheArtificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations(AIAI) Conference has been held continuously since 2005, under the auspices of the IFIP WG12.5. Through the years, it has evolved to a well-respected and mature event, under the technical and scientific co-sponsorship of the AIAI community. This community comprises of an extended Group of leading scientists, not only from Europe but from all over the globe. 
 The h-index of the AIAI event is as high as39. This proves the novelty and quality of the presented-published research and its important contribution to the promotion of scientific ideas, algorithms and methods, globally. The fact that the conference Springer Proceedings, have been downloadedmore than 2,800,000times so far, supports the robust impact of the event among the scholars of AI internationally..href=""https://ifipaiai.org/2025/message-of-the-organizers/"" - …[read more]

 NIST researcher leaders Edward Griffor, Tao Zhang, and Abdella Battou addressed the 21stInternational ACS/IEEE International Conference on Computer Systems and Applications (href=""https://aiccsa.net/AICCSA2024/"" - AICCSA 2024
(link is external)) in Sousse, Tunisia, held on 22-26 October 2024. The conference sessions included presentations on Ubiquitous, Parallel and Distributed Computing (including cloud, IoT, network, sensors, and blockchain technologies); Security, Privacy, and Trust; Data Science, Knowledge Engineering, and Ontologies (including Information Retrieval, Big Data, Databases, and Knowledge Systems); Artificial Intelligence & Cognitive Systems; Natural Language Processing; and Multimedia, Computer Vision, and Image Processing. 
 Dr. Griffor’s keynote on using Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) to assess autonomous system performance described current progress on developing performance metrics for these systems. Griffor plotted the evolution of system energy/processing usage as an AI-equipped system reasons, and learns, about its operating environment, and he explained how the system reduces the “informational dimension” of its operating environment, improving its overall performance. Griffor pointed to how the system’s rules emerge and make action progressively more energy/processing efficient. As action patterns emerge, these rules can be “exported” as structure in the environment, resulting in autonomous systems that can manage tradeoffs between the limited resources of time and energy to meet quality objectives. 
 Dr. Zhang’s keynote on edge AI and 6G discussed the essential roles of edge AI in 6G and beyond networks. Zhang described how edge computing has evolved to edge AI, and how edge AI is further evolving toward an AI continuum that seamlessly spans from the user to the cloud. He discussed how edge AI and the AI continuum are becoming increasingly important for future AI and 6G networks. He further discussed possible initial steps toward an AI-native 6G network architecture that will be enabled by edge AI and the AI continuum. 
 Dr. Battou’s keynote on quantum networking described current work on the Multiverse platform for quantum networks and experiments management. He explained the choice of microservices for the architecture and the Vert.x framework for its implementation. He then detailed services such as Topology, Configuration, Fault, and Security and how they are currently used in the NIST testbed and the Washington Metropolitan Quantum Network Research Consortium (DC-QNet).

 Mitigating AI Risk through Ethical Data Science, a Workshop at the 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME 2024) 
 Mitigating AI Risk through Ethical Data Science, a Workshop at the 22nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME 2024)Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes, yet AI technologies 
 can also pose risks to individuals, communities, and society. The burgeoning field of ethical data 
 science provides a venue for exploring the causes of bias in AI, and how to correct them, 
 rendering AI output as true, realistic, and fair to all demographic and socio-economic groups. 
 This workshop will focus on several major facets of mitigating AI risks, drawing from legal, 
 machine learning, statistical, mathematical, and clinical perspectives. It will include (a) a panel 
 discussion where experts will present challenges and latest advances on the topics of public trust, 
 transparency, statistical insight, and parity related to AI; (b) a poster session, including lightning 
 talks; and (c) subgroup discussions, where attendees may add their knowledge and ideas to the 
 dialogue on bias in AI, in use cases, legal and policy issues, and computational approaches to 
 improve data quality and prediction parity. We will conclude with a wrap-up of the workshop’s 
 findings and potential steps going forward, for both individual attendees, and for the overall 
 mitigation of bias in AI.

 The Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence 

Download the Brochure in 
 EN/FR/ES/AR/TR/CA 
 The Council of EuropeFramework Convention on Artificial Intelligenceand human rights, democracy and the rule of law is thefirst-ever international legally binding treatyin this field. Opened for signature on 5 September 2024, it aims to ensure that activities within the lifecycle of artificial intelligence systems are fully consistent with human rights, democracy and the rule of law, while being conducive to technological progress and innovation. 
 Framework Conventionand itsExplanatory Report 
 The Framework Convention complements existing international standards on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, andaims to fill any legal gaps that may result from rapid technological advances. In order to stand the test of time, the Framework Convention does not regulate technology and is essentiallytechnology-neutral.

 How was it elaborated?What does it require states to do?Who is covered?How is the implementation monitored?How was the Framework Convention elaborated?Work was initiated in 2019, when the ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI) was tasked with examining the feasibility of such an instrument. Following its mandate, it was succeeded in 2022 by the Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAI) which drafted and negotiated the text. 
 The Framework Convention was drafted by the 46 member states of the Council of Europe, with the participation of all observer states: Canada, Japan, Mexico, the Holy See and the United States of America, as well as the European Union, and a significant number of non-member states: Australia, Argentina, Costa Rica, Israel, Peru and Uruguay. 
 In line with the Council of Europe’s practice of multi-stakeholder engagement, 68 international representatives from civil society, academia and industry, as well as several other international organisations were also actively involved in the development of the Framework Convention. 
 What does the Framework Convention require states to do? 
 Fundamental principles 
 Activities within the lifecycle of AI systems must comply with the following fundamental principles: 
 Human dignity and individual autonomy 
 Equality and non-discrimination 
 Respect for privacy and personal data protection 
 Transparency and oversight 
 Accountability and responsibility 
 Reliability 
 Safe innovation 
 Remedies, procedural rights and safeguards 
 Document the relevant information regarding AI systems and their usage and to make it available to affected persons; 
 The information must be sufficient to enable people concerned to challenge the decision(s) made through the use of the system or based substantially on it, and to challenge the use of the system itself; 
 Effective possibility to lodge a complaint to competent authorities; 
 Provide effective procedural guarantees, safeguards and rights to affected persons in connection with the application of an artificial intelligence system where an artificial intelligence system significantly impacts upon the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
 Provision of notice that one is interacting with an artificial intelligence system and not with a human being. 
 Risk and impact management requirements 
 Carry out risk and impact assessments in respect of actual and potential impacts on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, in an iterative manner; 
 Establishment of sufficient prevention and mitigation measures as a result of the implementation of these assessments; 
 Possibility for the authorities to introduce ban or moratoria on certain application of AI systems (“red lines”). 
 Who is covered by the Framework Convention?The Framework Convention covers the use of AI systems bypublic authorities– includingprivate actorsacting on their behalf – andprivate actors. 
 The Convention offers Parties two modalities to comply with its principles and obligations when regulating the private sector: Parties may opt to be directly obliged by the relevant Convention provisions or, as an alternative, take other measures to comply with the treaty’s provisions while fully respecting their international obligations regarding human rights, democracy and the rule of law. 
 Parties to the Framework Convention are not required to apply the provisions of the treaty to activities related to the protection of their national security interests but must ensure that such activities respect international law and democratic institutions and processes. The Framework Convention does not apply to national defence matters nor to research and development activities, except when the testing of AI systems may have the potential to interfere with human rights, democracy, or the rule of law. 
 How is the implementation of the Framework Convention monitored?The Framework Convention establishes a follow-up mechanism, the Conference of the Parties, composed of official representatives of the Parties to the Convention to determine the extent to which its provisions are being implemented. Their findings and recommendations help to ensure States’ compliance with the Framework Convention and guarantee its long-term effectiveness. The Conference of the Parties shall also facilitate co-operation with relevant stakeholders, including through public hearings concerning pertinent aspects of the implementation of the Framework Convention.

 About the Conference 
 The aim of ALENEX is to provide a forum for the presentation of original research in the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. 
 Typical submissions will include an extensive experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. 
 Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering. 
 Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to high-performance and cloud computing. 
 Proceedings will be posted online in January 2025. ALENEX is supported by SIAM. 
 Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect that interesting synergies will develop between the co-located conferences. 
 ALENEX will be held jointly with: 
 ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) 
 SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA)

 CALL FOR PAPERS 
  
 Conference Website: https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/alenex25 
 Submission Link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alenex25 
 Submission Deadline: July 18, 2024 (AoE) 

+-------- 
 | About the Conference 
 +-------- 
  
 The aim of ALENEX is to provide a forum for the presentation of original 
 research in the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of 
 algorithms and data structures. Typical submissions will include an extensive 
 experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the 
 gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address 
 methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of 
 algorithms and data structures. 
  
 Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to 
 databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; 
 operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and 
 computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering. 
  
 Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for 
 advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel 
 computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to 
 high-performance and cloud computing. 
  
 Proceedings will be posted online in January 2025. ALENEX is supported by SIAM. 
  
 Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning 
 detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect 
 that interesting synergies will develop between the co-located conferences. 
  
 The following conferences will be held jointly: 
 - ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) 
 ) https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda25 
 - SIAM Symposium on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX)

+-------- 
 | How to Participate 
 +-------- 
  
 == Format == 
 Submissions must be PDF, formatted according to the double column macro posted 
 here. (Note that there is also a single column macro, but ALENEX uses the 
 double-column one.) Submissions must not exceed 10 pages, excluding front 
 matter (title and abstract), references, and a clearly marked appendix (further 
 described below). 
  
 == Content == 
 Papers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract, which begins 
 with the title of the paper as well as a short abstract. This should be 
 followed by the main body of the paper that begins with a precise statement of 
 the problem considered, a succinct summary of the results obtained (emphasizing 
 the significance, novelty, and potential impact of the research), and a clear 
 comparison with related work. The remainder of the extended abstract should 
 provide sufficient details to allow the program committee to evaluate the 
 validity, quality, and relevance of the contribution. Clarity of presentation 
 is very important; the entire extended abstract should be written carefully, 
 taking into consideration that it will be read and evaluated by both experts 
 and non-experts, often under tight time constraints. 
  
 == Appendix and Additional data == 
 All details needed to verify the results must be provided. Supporting 
 materials, including proofs of theoretical claims and experimental details, 
 that do not fit in the 10 page limit should be given in an appendix. If more 
 appropriate, the full version may be given as the appendix. In both cases, 
 however, the authors should include in the main part specific pointers to the 
 relevant locations in the appendix. The appendix will be read by the program 
 committee members and subreviewers at their discretion and will not be 
 published as part of the proceedings. Thus, the paper without the appendix 
 should be able to stand on its own. Experimental and implementation results 
 (independent of paper type) must be reproducible and verifiable. Authors are 
 encouraged to put accompanying software and relevant data, in a repository 
 accessible to the reviewers. Authors are asked to indicate which of the 
 supporting materials will remain publicly available if their papers are 
 accepted. 
  
 == Double-blind == 
 ALENEX will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions 
 should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, 
 authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the 
 beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any 
 references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not ""We 
 build on our previous work ..."" but rather ""We build on the work of ...""). 
 Particular care needs to be taken with accompanying software or data, which 
 need to be linked anonymously (for example, via a DropBox folder or the like). 
 Upon registering a submission, the authors will declare conflicts of interest 
 with PC members. The purpose of lightweight double-blind reviewing is to help 
 PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper 
 without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if 
 they were to try. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft 
 versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post 
 drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on 
 their research ideas. We encourage authors with further questions on 
 double-blind reviewing to contact the PC chairs. 
  
 == Previous or Simultaneous Submissions == 
 Results previously published or accepted for publication in the proceedings of 
 another conference cannot be submitted. Simultaneous submissions of the results 
 to another conference with published proceedings are not allowed. Exempted are 
 workshops and conferences without formal proceedings, but possibly with 
 handouts containing short abstracts. Results that have already been accepted 
 (with or without revision) for publication in a journal at the time of their 
 submission to the symposium are not allowed. A paper submitted to a journal but 
 not yet accepted for publication can be submitted to the symposium. In such 
 cases, the authors must mention this on the front page of the submission and 
 clearly identify the status of the journal submission at the date of the full 
 paper submission deadline. 
  
 == Accepted Papers == 
 Final proceedings versions of accepted papers must use the same double column 
 formatting macro as the submissions. Title, abstract, and body of the paper 
 altogether must not exceed 12 pages, followed by unlimited references. If any 
 supporting material (including complete proofs of theoretical claims and 
 experimental details) does not fit in the specified limit, then the full 
 version of the paper containing this information must be referenced in the 
 conference version and made available at a public repository, such as arXiv, by 
 the time the final version is submitted. Where applicable, we encourage the 
 authors to make accompanying software and/or data publicly accessible, with 
 proper references in the paper. 
  
 == Artifact Evaluation == 
 To verify and facilitate reproducibility of the results described in ALENEX 
 papers, we encourage authors of accepted papers to submit their artifacts (e.g. 
 code and data) for Artifact Evaluation (AE). The artifact submission deadline 
 for accepted papers will be Sep. 9. A separate committee will examine the 
 artifacts, with notification by Oct. 13. Participation in artifact evaluation 
 is not mandatory and will not influence paper acceptance. However, AE results 
 will be considered when inviting top papers for journal publication. Papers 
 that pass Artifact Evaluation will be awarded SIAM badges for availability and 
 reproducibility, which will be printed directly on the papers giving the 
 readers greater confidence in the results presented in them. Participation in 
 the AE phase will not be made public except for the papers that receive badges.

 Abstract 
 Thepeaceable queens problemasks to determine the maximum number\(a(n)\)such that there is a placement of\(a(n)\)white queens and\(a(n)\)black queens on an\(n\times n\)chessboard so that no queen can capture any queen of the opposite color. 
 In this paper, we consider the peaceable queens problem and its variant on the toroidal board. For the regular board, we show that\(a(n)\le 0.1716n^{2}\), for all sufficiently large\(n\). This improves on the bound\(a(n)\le 0.25n^{2}\)of van Bommel and MacEachern [16]. 
 For the toroidal board, we provide new upper and lower bounds. Somewhat surprisingly, our bounds show that there is a sharp contrast in behaviour between the odd torus and the even torus. Our lower bounds are given by explicit constructions. For the upper bounds, we formulate the problem as a non-linear optimization problem with at most 100 variables, regardless of the size of the board. We solve our non-linear program exactly using modern optimization software. 
 We also provide a local search algorithm and a software implementation which converges very rapidly to solutions which appear optimal. Our algorithm is sufficiently robust that it works on both the regular and toroidal boards. For example, for the regular board, the algorithm quickly finds the so-calledAinley construction. Thus, our work provides some further evidence that the Ainley construction is indeed optimal.

 ABOUT THE CONFERENCE 
 The annual conference on Artificial Life - ALIFE 2025 - will take place in the heart of Kyoto, Japan from 6-10 October 2025. 
  
 This year’s theme is Ciphers of Life, encouraging participants to explore the many ways that life encodes information, creates internal languages, and interacts in encrypted ways with its environment. 
  
 Artificial life research focuses on understanding, replicating, and extending the fundamental principles of life. Much of this research involves creating artificial systems that exhibit life-like behaviors.

Call for Special Sessions 
 CALL FOR SPECIAL SESSIONS 
 Extended Deadline: 28 February 2025— PASSED 
 ‍ 
 Original Deadline: 21 February 2025 
 Special sessions will be specially-themed tracks in the main conference. The idea is to attract high-quality submissions on topics of particular interest to our community. We are particularly interested in sessions that will set new directions for future research and bring new voices into our community. These sessions will be part of the main conference and will run alongside other conference sessions. 
  
 Organizing a special session provides an opportunity to explore in depth a particular topic within the main conference, and to bring new ideas and new people into the ALife community. We are open to any ideas you might have that might create a buzz around your topic or the conference in general, such as advertising the session outside of the usual ALife community or holding panel or group discussions as part of the session. 
  
 Submissions to your session will go through the main conference review system. As a session organizer, you would set the topic of the session, attract submissions through whatever means you wish, and chair the session at the conference. 
  
 Please note that special sessions are different from workshops. The main difference is that special sessions are part of the main conference - they share its review process and accepted submissions will appear in the proceedings. There will also be workshop sessions at ALIFE 2025, and a call for workshop proposals will be sent out separately. 
 ‍ 
 We welcome session proposals on any topic. 
 Submission Process 
 Every special session proposal should include: 
 Title of the special session 
 Name(s) and affiliation(s) of the organizer(s) with contact details 
 Short bio or CV of the organizer(s) 
 Description of the session theme, including why tis session theme deserves special attention from the ALife community (about 250 words) 
 What you propose to do to support the session, such as advertising it or in terms of organisation (about 150 words) 
 List of 3-5 senior reviewers suggestions relevant for your session 
 All proposals must should be submitted through followingform 
 Call for Workshop & Tutorial Proposals 
 CALL FOR WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS 
 Deadline:7 March 2025— PASSED 
 Workshops aim to promote and discuss new ideas and topics in the field of artificial life in a more informal context. Workshops might be organised as invited talks, panel discussions, or contributed talks. Each workshop slot will be 1.5 hours long. 
  
 ALIFE will provide the on-site logistics and links from the main conference website. The tutorial and workshop organisers are responsible for all other organisational issues. 
 Submission Process 
 Every workshop proposal should include: 
 Title of the workshop 
 Name(s) and affiliation(s) of the organizer(s) with contact details 
 Short bio or CV of the organizer(s) 
 A proposal describing the content and its importance for the ALIFE community (150-250 words)) 
 Roughly approximated number of participants 
 Planned duration: one or two 90-minutes slots. 
 All proposals must be sent to:href=""mailto:program2025@alife.org"" - program2025@alife.org
Call for Papers & Summaries 
 CALL FOR PAPERS 
 Deadline: 4 May 2025 
 Note that the following submission types differ significantly from previous years: 
 Full Papers [Deadline May 4th] 
 Full Papers are 3 to 8 pages long (not including references) and should report on new, unpublished work. Full Papers will be reviewed as self-contained work, and will undergo a double-blind review process, with the same review criteria as a journal paper. Accepted papers will be published by MIT press as open access conference proceedings. Accepted submissions will be assigned an oral or poster presentation. 
 Summaries [Deadline May 4th]: 
 Summariessummarize a previously published work. These are limited to a maximum of 2 pages (not including references).Summaries must report on work that has been peer reviewed and published already, e.g. in another conference or a journal. If the work has only been published as a preprint it should be submitted as a full paper.Summaries will not be included in the proceedings.They will be made publicly available but will not receive DOIs. Summaries will be reviewed for relevance to the conference, and will undergo a double-blind review process. Accepted submissions will be assigned an oral or poster presentation, but full papers will be given priority for oral presentations. 
 Late Breaking Abstracts [Deadline July 4th]: 
 Late Breaking Abstracts are limited to a maximum of 2-pages (not including references). They can report on new ideas and work in progress. Late Breaking Abstracts will be reviewed for relevance to the conference and quality, and will undergo a double-blind review process. Late breaking abstracts will not be included in the proceedings. Accepted Late Breaking Abstracts will be presented as posters during the conference. 
 REMINDER: Papers accepted into theArtifical LifeJournal (MIT Press)are automatically accepted into the ALIFE 2025 program as oral presentations. Regular registration is still required for in-person attendance, however online participants can attend their session for free. 
 ‍ 
 IMPORTANT: All the submission are meant to undergo double-blinded review process. Please do not write authors' names until paper is accepted, furthermore redact any identifying information, such as the authors, their institutions, and acknowledgements from the uploaded PDF.

 ALIFE 2024: The 2024 Conference on Artificial Life 
 IT University of Copenhagen 
 Copenhagen, Denmark, July 22-26, 2024 
  
 Conference website | href=""https://2024.alife.org/"" - https://2024.alife.org/ 
 Submission link | href=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alife2024"" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alife2024 
 Submission deadline | April 3, 2024 
 Topics:href=""/cfp/topic.cgi?tid=8983"" - artificial life
The International Conference for Artificial Life (ALife) will be held at IT University of Copenhagen, July 22-26, 2024. 
 The theme of this year isExploring new frontiers: Building on the ancient traditions of the Vikings to travel to new and strange lands and discover new cultures and traditions, we want to dedicate ALIFE 2024 to the weird and wacky of ALIFE. In particular in a time where academic research is under pressure to be more applied, we will instead dedicate ALIFE 2024 to celebrate the fundamental science of artificial life. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 There are two options for submission:full paperorextended abstract. The format is exactly the same for both options. The difference resides in the number of pages and type of contents: 
 full papers have an 8-page maximum length (not including references) and should report on new, unpublished work; 
 extended abstracts are limited to a 2-page length (not including references) and can report on previously published work or preliminary results. 
 Please see the author guidelines on the conference website for detailed instructions and manuscript templates. 
 All submissions will undergo a detailed peer review process. Full papers will be reviewed for timeliness, novelty, scientific quality, sound methodology, and use of appropriate analysis techniques. Extended abstracts will be reviewed for timeliness, novelty, and quality. 
 Accepted submissions will be considered for oral or poster presentation, without distinction between full papers and extended abstracts. 
 Accepted submissions (both full papers and extended abstracts) will be published by MIT Press as open-access electronic proceedings. 
 List of Topics 
 ALIFE 2024 will showcase a wide range of topics in Artificial Life, bringing together world-leading researchers to discuss the latest advances in the synthesis and simulation of living systems. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following aspects of Artificial Life: 
 Complex dynamical systems and networks 
 Artificial chemistry, origins of life, computational biology 
 Synthetic biology, protocells, and wet artificial life 
 Ecology and evolution 
 Bio-inspired, cognitive and evolutionary robotics, swarms 
 Artificial intelligence and machine learning 
 Perception, cognition, behavior 
 Social systems, artificial and alternative societies 
 Evolution of language, computational linguistics 
 Artificial Life-based art 
 Artificial Life in education

Association for Algorithmic Learning Theory 
 The Association for Algorithmic Learning Theory (AALT) is an international organization created in 2018 to promote learning theory, primarily through the organization of the annual conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT) and other related events. 
 Learning theory is the field in computer science and mathematics that studies all theoretical aspects of machine learning, including its algorithmic and statistical aspects. 
 The AALT organization consists of asteering committee, which includes the current program committee chairs of ALT, as well as other elected members. Among other things, the organization selects the future ALT PC chairs and local organizers, determines the conference location and dates, and makes a number of decisions to help promote the conference including sponsorships, publications, co-locations, and journal publications. 
 AALT has a sister organization, theAssociation for Computational Learning(ACL), with similar goals and mission, and a similar conference, the Conference on Learning Theory (COLT).

 Present CFP : 2024 
 The Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT) 2024 conference will be held in San Diego, CA on February 25-28th 2024. The conference is dedicated to all theoretical and algorithmic aspects of machine learning. We invite submissions with contributions to new or existing learning problems including, but not limited to: 
  
 Design and analysis of learning algorithms. 
 Statistical and computational learning theory. 
 Online learning algorithms and theory. 
 Optimization methods for learning. 
 Unsupervised, semi-supervised, and active learning. 
 Interactive learning, planning and control, and reinforcement learning. 
 Privacy-preserving data analysis. 
 Learning with additional societal and strategic considerations: e.g., fairness, economics. 
 Robustness of learning algorithms to adversarial agents. 
 Artificial neural networks, including deep learning. 
 High-dimensional and non-parametric statistics. 
 Adaptive data analysis and selective inference. 
 Learning with algebraic or combinatorial structure. 
 Bayesian methods in learning. 
 Learning in distributed and streaming settings. 
 Game theory and learning. 
 Learning from complex data: e.g., networks, time series. 
 Theoretical analysis of probabilistic graphical models. 
  
 While the primary focus of the conference is theoretical, authors are welcome to support their analysis by including relevant experimental results. 
  
 Accepted papers will be published electronically in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR), and will be presented at the conference as a full-length talk. Authors of accepted papers will have the option of opting out of the proceedings in favor of a 1-page extended abstract, which will point to an open access archival version of the full paper reviewed for ALT. 

Important dates 
  
 Paper submission deadline: September 26, 2023, Anywhere On Earth 
 Author feedback: Nov 11-17, 2023 
 Author notification: Mid-December, 2023 

Conference format 
  
 The conference will be in-person and will not be hybrid. At least one author of each accepted paper will be required to present their paper in-person at the conference. When travel is not possible, we encourage authors to find alternative presenters in the community attending the conference. 

Dual submission policy 
  
 Conferences: In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings may not be submitted to ALT. 
  
 Journals: Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that are already published in a journal at the time of submission may not be submitted to ALT. 
 Rebuttal phase 
  
 This year there will be a rebuttal phase during the review process. Authors will have an opportunity to provide a short response to the initial reviews.

 The Role of Research in Language Technology 
 The cutting-edge nature of Language Technology means that research is particularly important: there are many unsolved problems in the automated processing of spoken and written language, and in many cases we have only begun to scratch the surface. Research in Language Technology, which for our purposes covers a space that also includes Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, draws on work in a diverse array of disciplines, including linguistics, psychology, philosophy and computer science, and now, with the increasing role played by statistical methods also mathematics. 
 Research Activity in Australasia 
 Given the wide range of contributing disciplines, research in Language Technology in Australia and New Zealand is carried out in many different contexts. The listing below provides pointers to clusters of activity that involve more than one or two individual researchers.

 Association for Machine Translations in the Americas 
 First Call for Proposals for 
 Emerging AI Breakthroughs and Challenges 
 in Translation Automation 
 A virtual one-day event under the auspices of AMTA 
 Thursday, 25 September 2025 
 The Board of Directors of AMTA (the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas) is pleased to announce the first call for proposals forEmerging AI Breakthroughs and Challenges in Translation Automation, a one-day virtual event to be held on Thursday, 25 September 2025. 
 While the demand for accurate, nuanced, and scalable multilingual communication continues to increase, the language services industry is scrambling to adopt technology that is advancing at such a rate that today’s solutions are quickly outdated. At the heart of this evolution lies a technological revolution:Generative AI, Agentic AI, and Reasoning-enabled Large Language Models (LLMs). These technologies are not only reshaping the landscape of translation automation—they are also redefining what’s possible in cross-lingual understanding and interaction. 
 The event will focus on advances in technologies and processes that leverage generative AI, agentic AI, Large Language Models, reasoning LLMs, Machine Translation, and any combination of them, that address challenges in multilingual communication and the provisioning of high-quality translation or interpretation. Moving beyond the explosion of hype that began with the general availability of ChatGPT in November 2022, this event is intended as a forum for a thoughtful exchange of ideas informed by successes and failures in applying these technologies to the challenges of cross-lingual communication and data processing. 
 We invite researchers, developers, and practitioners to contribute to a substantive dialogue at the intersection ofAI innovation and multilingual challenges. This conference will explore cutting-edge approaches leveraging the power of generative and agentic AI models to tackle real-world translation issues, enhance automation pipelines, and build smarter, context-aware, and culturally sensitive systems. From low-resource language solutions to adaptive workflows and autonomous reasoning in translation tasks, this conference is a chance to exchange bold ideas, explore novel methodologies, and present impactful case studies. 
 Like all AMTA conferences, this event will bring together researchers, practitioners, and providers of cross-lingual technology from academia, industry, and government and will include a keynote talk, an expert panel discussion, individual presentations, succinct tutorials, and demonstrations from technology providers. 
 The organizing committee is seeking proposals for presentations and tutorials on all topics related to research, development, application, and evaluation of these technologies as they apply to cross- and multilingual technology(ies). Our goal is to have a program that brings real value to the various constituents of the MT community (researchers, developers, users, and language professionals). We welcome not only proposals on technical research and development topics but also on, for instance, the collection and curation of training data, best practices in training models, human/computer interaction among translators, interpreters, and the evolution of translation automation in the commercial translation production pipeline. 
 Developers, practitioners, and analysts from the R&D community, language services industry, and public sector are encouraged to submit proposals that cover leading-edge R&D and practical applications of MT, LLMs, and agentic AI as they relate to the creation or processing of cross- and multilingual content. 
 Members of the research community are encouraged to submit proposals to this non-archival event that address recent research directions, trends and concerns about the use of generative AI or suggestions for research projects. 
 We seek submissions for: 
 20-minute talks (15 minute presentations, plus 5 minutes for questions), 
 40-minute tutorials (practical descriptions or exercises concerning the use of generative AI, agentic AI, Machine Translation, and/or related tools, processes and technologies for cross- and multilingual tasks. 
 Topics of interest might include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 The use of Large Language Models for Translation, Transcreation, and other cross- and multilingual tasks: | development, deployment, and adaptation to specific use-cases. 
 Application of agentic and reasoning LLMs to translation automation: | case studies and experiments describing the application of agentive and reasoning LLMs to the generation and execution of dynamic translation workflows that optimize translation quality and/or other objectives. 
 Adaptation and customization of large language models for cross- and multilingual use cases: | case studies on applying few-shot learning, RAG, prompt-tuning and fine-tuning, comparison of methodologies used to adapt and customize foundation models for specific tasks with respect to business, technical and linguistic requirements. 
 Combining narrow and large models to improve performance of specific tasks, | such as translation, OCR, ASR and others. 
 Augmenting MT systems and other Human Language Technologies (HLT) with AI: | including approaches to leveraging TM and end-user feedback, classification, context awareness, content moderation, sentiment analysis, domain-specificity, geolocation, summarization. 
 Integrating MT into AI-powered TRS workflows: | transcription translation and optimization, domain-specific processing, multilingual entity intelligence, summarization and roundup, etc. 
 Training Data: | data sources, data preparation, terminology, knowledge graphs, data augmentation, multimodal data, etc. 
 Output quality and confidence scoring for cross- and multilingual tasks: | tools, methods and metrics, such as human evaluations, automatic scoring, reference-based and source-only scoring. 
 Challenges to adopting AI in cross- and multilingual use cases: | Responsible deployment and regulatory considerations of generative AI (such as technical, ethical, social, legal, and environmental challenges). 
 Generative and agentive AI use for professional translation: | Approaches, success and failure stories, fair pricing models, and cognitive load. 
 Business Cases: | making the business case for or against adopting AI to drive business requirements. 
 Future research directions: | open problems that researchers are/should be considering in this area. 
 Important dates 
 Submission deadline: 23 June 2025 
 Notification of acceptance: 21 July 2025 
 Submission Instructions 
 Proposals should be submitted in PDF format by23 June 2025, tohref=""mailto:submissions@amtaweb.org"" - submissions@amtaweb.org
and include: 
 Title of proposed session 
 Type of proposed session (20-minute presentation or 40-minute tutorial) 
 A 250-500 word description of the proposed session 
 Name and e-mail address of the person who is submitting the proposal 
 Name(s) and e-mail address(es) of proposed speakers 
 A short (<100 words) biographical introduction to the proposed presenter(s) 
 Any special technical requirements you may have 
 Publication and recording 
 Presentation proposals will be reviewed and selected by an AMTA-selected program committee based on submitted, non-anonymous abstracts. Accepted abstracts will be available to conference attendees on the conference platform and will otherwise not be published. Any research papers submitted for presentation will also follow this same process and will not follow a double-blind peer review process. Video recordings will be made of each presentation and will be made available to association members on the AMTA website. Submission of a proposal will be understood by the Organizing Committee as your tacit permission for AMTA to create an audio and video recording of your presentation and make it available to conference attendees and, through archiving, to members of AMTA, EAMT, and AAMT. 
 Background 
 AMTA, the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas, is well known for its biennial conferences, held since 1994, and for its sponsorship and organization of the MT Summit in 1991, 1997, 2003, 2009, 2015, and 2021. Although the next in-person AMTA conference will not be held until 2026, the board of directors unanimously agreed that the pace of development in and rapid adoption of AI warranted the organizing and hosting of our second one-day virtual event. 
 We look forward to receiving your proposal!

 The 16th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies (ANT 2025) is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies related areas. ANT 2025 will be held in conjunction withthe 8th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40). 
 Ambient systems can be viewed as interconnected systems that exist anywhere and everywhere in the environment. These systems are able to work together in the network collaboratively or competitively to provide human users with their daily technological needs, during which these systems remain invisible. This concept has emerged as a major research area with many potential applications. This is because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the themes required such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, networks and communications, data science, Internet of Things, Smart Entities, etc. 
 ANT will be held in Patra Greece. Patra is Greece's third largest, and the regional capital and largest city of western Greece, in the northern Peloponnese, 215 km west of Athens. As of the 2021 census, the municipality of Patras has a population of 215,922, while the urban population is 173.600. Patras and its region are home to various Ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine Monuments including the Roman Odeon, the Fortress of Rio, and the Castle of Patras. Patras is a relatively newly built city, as its medieval buildings were destroyed in the Greek War of Independence. The Patras Carnival is the largest event of its kind in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe, with a heritage reaching back 160 years. 
 Patras is an important educational center in Greece, home to several institutions of higher education, including the prestigious University of Patras, which is the third largest university in Greece with the respect to the size of the student body, the staff, and the number of departments. and most respected universities. The university of Patras is considered one of the top-ranked universities in Greece and has been placed in the top 200 universities in subject areas. In 2019, the student population was more than 33,000 (29,901 at the undergraduate level and 3,931 at the postgraduate level). 
 All ANT 2025 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series on-line. Procedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), and will be freely available worldwide. All papers in Procedia will be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and by Thomson Reuters' Conference Proceeding Citation Index (https://thomsonreuters.com/conference-proceedings-citation-index/).

 2025 International Conference on Probabilistic, Combinatorial and Asymptotic Methods for the Analysis of Algorithms (AofA 2025)  
 May 5 - 9, 2025  , The Fields Institute Location:  Fields Institute, Room 230  

 Description  
 Analysis of Algorithms (AofA) is a field at the boundary of computer science and mathematics. The goal is to obtain a precise understanding of the asymptotic, average-case characteristics of algorithms and data structures. A unifying theme is the use of probabilistic, combinatorial, and analytic methods. The objects to be studied include random branching processes, graphs, permutations, trees, and strings.  
 The area of Analysis of Algorithms is frequently traced to 27 July 1963, when Donald E. Knuth wrote ""Notes on Open Addressing"". His fundamental books, The Art of Computer Programming, established ties between areas of study that include discrete mathematics, combinatorics, probability theory, analytic number theory, asymptotic analysis, and complexity theory.  
 Thirty years after Knuth's pioneering paper, the first seminar entirely devoted to the Analysis of Algorithms was held at Dagstuhl, Germany, in 1993. Since 1993, several series of seminars related to the analysis of algorithms have been established. These take place on an annual schedule. The rich history of meetings in this research area can be seen at https://www.math.aau.at/AofA/meetings/ This is the 36th edition of the conference and just the second one in Canada (the 23rd AofA was in Montreal in 2012). The organizing committee has selected the Fields Institute as the best place in Canada to welcome these worldwide experts and showcase the Canadian research environment.  
 In this research area we aim at studying discrete objects that appear as data structures or algorithms (including graphs, networks, and so on) by mathematical methods, in particular by probabilistic, combinatorial and asymptotic methods. The topics include but are not limited to:  
 • Properties of large random data structures  
  • Probabilistic methods for the analysis of algorithms  
  • Combinatorial methods for the analysis of algorithms  
  • Analytic tools for the analysis of algorithms  
  • Average case analysis of classical or new algorithms  
  • Analytic and enumerative combinatorics  
  • Random trees and graphs  
  • Branching processes  
  • Stochastic processes in relation with random discrete structures  
  • Random walks  
  • Discrete probabilities  
  • Random generation of combinatorial structures  
  • Performance evaluation, and more.  
 We will encourage participation from students and early-career researchers – both domestic and international – and expect that the topics presented in this workshop will positively influence their future careers, both in terms of opening new scientific avenues and also providing them with exposure to top-level research and professors in these areas.

 Mission  
 The Asia-Pacific Conference on Conceptual Modelling provides an annual forum for disseminating the results of innovative research in information modelling and related areas. Topics of conference vary from conceptual modeling research and practice to all related areas that are mentioned in prime essay and scientific journals.  
 The amount, complexity and diversity of information held in computer systems are constantly on the increase, and so are the requirements and challenges to be met for useful access and manipulation of this information. Conceptual modelling is fundamental to the development of up-to-date information and knowledge-based systems. The conference series aims on bringing together experts from all areas of computer science and information systems with a common interest in the subject.  
 Upcoming Conference  
 The Tenth Asia-Pacific Conference on Conceptual Modelling (APCCM 2014) will take place in Auckland, New Zealand from January 20th to 23rd, 2014.  
 The 2014 conference will be held as part of the Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW 2014).

 Applying ontologies is the most promising approach to semantically enrich Web services. To facilitate this, two efforts contributed the most in enabling the creation of ontologies: OWL-S from the US and WSMO in Europe. These two compete and promote their ontologies from the design perspective, reflecting their inventors’ bias but not offering much help to Web service developers using them. To bypass existing biases and enable evaluation of ontologies expressed in these two languages, this paper provides a study of the two important facilitators, OWL-S and WSMO, surveying their usage in several SWS Projects and identifying their respective and outstanding gaps. The paper then proposes a set of evaluation criteria for usage measurement on the two prominent SWS ontologies.

 View PDFHTML (experimental)Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in numerous benchmarks, advancing AI applications in both linguistic and non-linguistic tasks. However, this has primarily benefited well-resourced languages, leaving less-resourced ones (LRLs) at a disadvantage. In this paper, we highlight the current state of the NLP field in the specific LRL: kyrgyz tili. 
 Human evaluation, including annotated datasets created by native speakers, remains an irreplaceable component of reliable NLP performance, especially for LRLs where automatic evaluations can fall short. In recent assessments of the resources for Turkic languages, Kyrgyz is labeled with the status 'Scraping By', a severely under-resourced language spoken by millions. This is concerning given the growing importance of the language, not only in Kyrgyzstan but also among diaspora communities where it holds no official status. 
 We review prior efforts in the field, noting that many of the publicly available resources have only recently been developed, with few exceptions beyond dictionaries (the processed data used for the analysis is presented atthis https URL). While recent papers have made some headway, much more remains to be done. Despite interest and support from both business and government sectors in the Kyrgyz Republic, the situation for Kyrgyz language resources remains challenging. We stress the importance of community-driven efforts to build these resources, ensuring the future advancement sustainability. We then share our view of the most pressing challenges in Kyrgyz NLP. Finally, we propose a roadmap for future development in terms of research topics and language resources.

 Present CFP : 2024 
 APLAS 2024 aims to bring together programming language researchers, 
 practitioners and implementors *worldwide*, to present and discuss the 
 latest results and exchange ideas in all areas of programming 
 languages and systems. APLAS 2024 is co-located with the 
 22nd International Symposium on Automated Technology for Verification 
 and Analysis (ATVA). 
  
 We solicit submissions in the form of regular research papers 
 describing original scientific research results, including system 
 development and case studies. Among others, solicited topics include: 
 programming paradigms and styles; methods and tools to specify and 
 reason about programs and languages; programming language foundations; 
 methods and tools for implementation; concurrency and distribution; 
 applications, case studies and emerging topics. 
  
 Submissions should not exceed 17 pages, excluding bibliography, in the 
 Springer LNCS format. The reviewing process is light double-blind, 
 with a rebuttal phase to address factual errors and minor 
 misunderstandings. 
  
 Proceedings of APLAS 2024 will be published by Springer as part of 
 Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). 
 https://link.springer.com/conference/aplas 
  
 APLAS 2024 continues the tradition of the best paper award.

 Where does humanity come from? The Human Intelligence Evolved from Cis-regulatory Saltations  
 The divergence rate between the alignable genomes of humans and chimpanzees is as little as 1.23%. This raises a fundamental question: what genetic changes account for their dramatic phenotypical difference. Researchers from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science (AMSS) at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have discovered that the saltation (jump change) of cis-regulatory element frequency (CREF) modules can explain the cognition and intelligence unique to humans.  

 AMSS Events   

 Prof. Yu-Hong Dai nominated and elected as Vice President of the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS)  
 The 14th Triennial Conference of the Association of Asia-Pacific Operations Research Societies (APORS 2024) was held in Hangzhou from November 15 to 18, 2024. More than 200 delegates from APORS member societies including China, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Nepal, and the Philippines participated in the conference. During the event, the APORS council meeting was called and Professor Yu-Hong Dai, the current President of the Operations Research Society of China and serving APORS President, was nominated and elected as Vice President of the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS) for the 2025–2027 term.

 Welcome to ASONAM 2025 
 The 17th International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining -ASONAM-2025 
  
 The study of social networks originated in social and business communities. In recent years, social network research has advanced significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine learning techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social medium that fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences and knowledge, group activities, community formation and evolution. This has led to a rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics homeland security and business. This follows the pattern of known entities of our society that have evolved into networks in which actors are increasingly dependent on their structural embedding. 
 The international conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2025) will primarily provide an interdisciplinary venue that will bring together practitioners and researchers from a variety of SNAM fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices. ASONAM 2025 is intended to address important aspects with a specific focus on the emerging trends and industry needs associated with social networking analysis and mining. The conference solicits experimental and theoretical works on social network analysis and mining along with their application to real life situations. 
 Full papers will be reviewed and assessed by the program committee and a ""Best Paper Award"" ceremony will be organized at the banquet. 
 News 
 - Good news: ASONAM is now included in the prestigious CORE Conference Portal in Australia.

 The 17th International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining -ASONAM-2025 
  
 The study of social networks originated in social and business communities. In recent years, social network research has advanced significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine learning techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social medium that fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences and knowledge, group activities, community formation and evolution. This has led to a rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics, homeland security and business. This follows the pattern of known entities of our society that have evolved into networks in which actors are increasingly dependent on their structural embedding. 
  
 The international conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2025) will primarily provide an interdisciplinary venue that will bring together practitioners and researchers from a variety of SNAM fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices. ASONAM 2025 is intended to address important aspects with a specific focus on the emerging trends and industry needs associated with social networking analysis and mining. The conference solicits experimental and theoretical works on social network analysis and mining along with their application to real life situations. 
  
 Full papers will be reviewed and assessed by the program committee and a ""Best Paper Award"" ceremony will be organized at the banquet.

 ASOR Conferences 
 APORS 2022 
 ASOR is a member of the Asia-Pacific Operations Research Societies (APORS), and the APORS 2022 conference is being held Nov 9-12 in Manila, Philippines. APORS is an abstract-only conference. This means that to attend the conference as a speaker you need to submit an abstract of up to 500 words, and the program committee then invites you to give a presentation (in person or virtual) based on an assessment of your abstract and its relevance to Operations Research. 
 The abstract submission date was recently extended to 17 July 2022. To submit your abstract visithttps://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=apors2022, and visithttp://apors.orgfor more information. 
 ASOR 2022 
 Due to the proximity of APORS 2022 and MODSIM/ASOR 2023, ASOR will be holding a workshop-style conference in late 2022, rather than a conference made up of presentations. More information to come. 
 MODSIM/ASOR 2023 
 ASOR is very pleased to announce that we will once again be holding an annual national conference joint with the Modelling and Simulation Society of Australia and New Zealand (MSSANZ) - this time, atMODSIM 2023 in Darwin. This is much earlier in the year than usual for MODSIM, but allows us all to be in Darwin at the best possible time of year. The conference organising committee has opened the conference up to early registrations. This is prior to 30 June 2022 so as to assist intending participants to commit 2021-2022 financial year funding if this suits their present financial situation. There are several more months until the full paper or extended abstract submission due dates. 
 Past Conferences 
 ASOR National Conference 2021 - ASOR at MODSIM 2021 
 The MODSIM Conference in 2021 was held at U. Sydney and ASOR was again a partner in the conference. It was our national conference for 2021. 
 IFORS 2021 - South Korea 
 The IFORS 2020 conference has been postponed until August 2021. See theIFORS websitefor more information. 
 ASOR is a member of IFORS, through the Asia-Pacific OR Societies (APORS). 
 ASOR National Conference 2019 - ASOR and DORS at MODSIM 2019 
 We are very grateful to MSSANZ for inviting us to once again be part of their major event, MODSIM, in Canberra from 1-6 December 2019. The call for papers has closed. Visithttps://mssanz.org.au/modsim2019/index.htmlfor information and registration. 
 ASOR's plenary speaker and special guest is Jerry Brown:Gerald G.

He has been awarded the Barchi, Mennekin, Rist, and Thomas prizes for military operations research, is credited with guiding investments of more than a trillion dollars, and has earned the INFORMS President and Steinhardt Prizes for lifetime achievements. He has designed and implemented decision support software used by the majority of the Fortune 50, in areas ranging from vehicle routing to supply chain optimization. His research has earned patents and appears in scores of open-literature publications and classified reports, some of which are seminal references. Brown is an elected member of the National Academy of Engineering, a recipient of two US Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Medals, and an INFORMS Fellow. 
  
 ASOR will once again offer a Student Presentation Prize for the ASOR/DORS stream at the conference. Students, please do make sure we know you are in contention, by emailinghref=""mailto:info@asor.org"" - info@asor.org
before the conference. We are good, but not perfect, at identifying who is and isn't a student based on the conference program. Three aspects with equal weight - presentation style, presentation structure, and presentation scientific/technical content - will form the basis of our selection of prize winner.

 Dr Sondoss Elsawah - 2016 Recipient 
 Sondoss Elsawah has had an academic career and passionate interest in OR which has progressed through a BSc, MSc and PhDin OR and Decision Science. Her PhD was recognized by the Australian Water Association (AWA) Award for best postgraduate water research. Sondoss' research focuses on the development of multi-method OR methodologies, and the application of these methodologies in new decision contexts where the potential of OR has not been fully exploited yet. For example, in her postdoc at the ANU, Sondoss has expanded on her PhD work in an ARC-funded project to develop a multi-method OR methodology which combines the use of cognitive mapping, software engineering tools, and agent-based modelling to incorporate stakeholder's views into planning water and groundwater systems. Sondoss was invited to present this work at a number of national events, such as the keynote speech at the National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training Summer School. In her current post at the Capability Systems Centre at UNSW Canberra, Sondoss' work involves the integration of multiple modelling methods to provide robust, client-oriented decision support tools, and conducting experimental studies to examine ways to improve model-based learning and teaching. Sondoss is a chief investigator in an international research grant by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) to identify core modelling practices to teach the next generation of modellers. Sondoss teaches various courses that are related to OR, such as simulation-based modelling, systems thinking, and system dynamics modelling. She has delivered training courses on systems thinking and complex problem solving for organisations such as the Australian Department of Defence. Since 2015, Sondoss has been a member of the executive committee of the ASOR-ACT Chapter. Sondoss introduced the ASOR-ACT Chapter Student Award, an annual tradition to promote research excellence in OR and provide a forum for students to share their research projects. She is a member of the executive committee of the Australian/NZ Modelling and Simulation Society (MSSANZ).

 Authors must submit full-length, double-columned, original papers, with a maximum of 6 pages in PDF format (including the abstract, figures and tables) and are recommended to format their papers based on the ACM template. One page of references is allowed, which does not count towards the 6-page limitation. ASP-DAC does not allow double and/or parallel submissions of similar work to any other conferences, symposia, and journals. The submission must not include information that serves to identify the authors of the manuscript, such as name(s) or affiliation(s) of the author(s), anywhere in the manuscript, abstract, references and bibliographic citations. While research papers with open-source software are highly encouraged where the software will be made publicly available (via GitHub or similar), the authors’ identities need to be anonymized in the submitted paper for the double-blind review process. Issuing the paper as a technical report, posting the paper on a website, or presenting the paper at a workshop that does not publish formally reviewed proceedings, does not disqualify it from appearing in the proceedings. Submissions of pre-print papers, e.g., published on arXiv, are also allowed in ASP-DAC 2025. However, that the authors are expected to follow all reasonable efforts to ensure that the submission is compliant with the double-blind review process. Note that each paper shall be accompanied by at least one different conference registration at the speaker’s registration rate. ACM and IEEE reserve the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference by any author.

 Welcome to the ASP-DAC 2024  
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee, I would like to invite all of the engineers on the LSI design and design automation areas to the 29th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC 2024). ASP-DAC 2024 will be held from January 22 (Mon.) to January 25 (Thur.), 2024 at Songdo Convention Center, Incheon, Korea.  
 ASP-DAC is a high-quality and premium conference on Electronic Design Automation (EDA) area like other sister conferences such as Design Automation Conference (DAC), Design, Automation & Test in Europe (DATE), International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), and Embedded Systems Week (ESWEEK). ASP-DAC started in 1995 and has continuously offered opportunity to know the recent advanced technologies on LSI design and design automation areas, and to communicate each other for researchers and designers around Asia and South Pacific regions.  
 The conference site is Songdo Convensia, which is an international convention center, and is located at Westside in Incheon, Korea. Songdo Convensia is close to central Seoul, about 40 minutes by bus, and Incheon International airport, about 20 minutes by bus. Joining the conference and participating in technological discussions, you can also enjoy many attractions in Seoul area, such as Gang-Nam (modern restaurants and K-pop), Myung-Dong (shopping), and Buk-Chon/Nam-Dae-Mon (traditional architecture and traditional food market), etc.  
 ASP-DAC 2024 received 482 submissions, which is ever the highest submission record, from all over the world. Based on rigorous and thorough reviews and a full-day face-to-face meeting by the Technical Program Committee in early September at Taiwan, 139 papers have been accepted and 36 technical sessions have been organized. Five Special Sessions have also been organized based on invited talks by the Technical Program Committee.  
 We have arranged four Keynote sessions at the beginning of each day to know the future directions of this area. The first keynote address in the morning on January 23 is ‘Advanced Technology and Design Enablement’ by Dr. Sei-Seung Yoon of Samsung Foundry, Korea. The second one in the morning on January 24 is ‘Present and Future Challenges of High Bandwidth Memory’ by Dr. Myeong-Jae Park of SK Hynix, Korea. The third keynote address during the banquet in the evening on January 24 is ‘ALM and EDA: Current Status and Prospectives on the Future’ by Prof. Andrew B. Kahng of University of California San Diego, USA. The fourth keynote address in the morning on January 25 is ‘Unleashing the Future of IC Design with AI Innovation’ by Dr. Erick Chao of Cadence Design Systems, Taiwan.  
 The Designers’ Forum is a unique program that will share design experience and solutions of actual product designs of the industries, which will be held in the afternoon of January 23 and 24. The topics discussed in this forum include Next Generation AI Semiconductor Design, Heterogeneous Integration and Chiplet Design, and AI/ML for Chip Design and EDA — Current Status and Future Perspectives from Diverse Views. Additionally, a joint short workshop of AI-EDA and Tilos projects in two-session format will be held in the last of the conference.  
 The University Design Contest is also an important annual event of ASP-DAC where 11 high-quality designs all including actual silicon proof were selected for presentation at Tuesday, January 23.  
 Eight tutorials have been arranged on Monday, January 22nd. Each tutorial has 3-hour presentation. Registrants can choose one topic from the morning session including 4 topics and another one from the afternoon session including 4 topics depending on their interests and can obtain wider perspective on the recent hot topics with the reduced tutorial fee.  
 ASP-DAC 2024 offers you an ideal opportunity to touch the recent technologies and the future directions on the LSI design and design automation areas. You will be able to meet and discuss with a lot of researchers and designers on this area, so please do not miss ASP-DAC 2024. Finally, we would like to express our sincere appreciation to authors, speakers, reviewers, session organizers, session chairs, sponsors, supporters, and committee members.

 Scope and Expectations 
 The scope of ASPLOS 2026 covers all practical aspects related to the three main ASPLOS disciplines: computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems, as well as closely-related associated areas. ASPLOS construessystemsbroadly, and areas of interest include, but are not limited to: operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, and virtualization. 
 We seek original, high-quality research submissions that improve and further the knowledge of applied computer systems, with emphasis on theintersection between the main ASPLOS disciplines: Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Computer Architecture and Emerging Hardware. 
 Research submission may be applicable to computer systems of any scale, ranging from small, ultra-low power wearable devices to large scale parallel computers and data centers. We embrace research that directly targets new problems in innovative ways. The research may target diverse goals, such as throughput, latency, energy, and security. Non-traditional topics are encouraged, and the review process will be sensitive to the challenges of multidisciplinary work in emerging areas. We welcome submission of “experience papers” that have a novel component and that clearly articulate the lessons learned. We likewise welcome submissions whereby novelty lies in furthering our understandings of existing systems, e.g., by uncovering previously unknown, valuable insights or by convincingly refuting prior published results and common wisdom. We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches. 
 Alphabetically sorted areas of interest related to practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems include but are not limited to: 
 Existing, emerging, and nontraditional compute platforms at all scales 
 Heterogeneous architectures and accelerators 
 Internet services, cloud computing, and datacenters 
 Memory, storage, networking, and I/O 
 Power, energy, and thermal management 
 Profiling, debugging, and testing 
 Security, reliability, and availability 
 Systems for enabling parallelism and computation on big data 
 Virtualization and virtualized systems 
 A good submission will typically: motivate a significant problem; propose a practical solution or approach that makes sense; demonstrate not just the pros but also the cons of the proposal using sound experimental methods; explicitly disclose what has and has not been implemented; articulate the new contributions beyond previous work; and refrain from overclaiming, focusing the abstract and introduction sections primarily on the difference between the new proposal and what is already available. The latter statement should be interpreted broadly to also encompass studies that broaden our understanding of existing systems (rather than suggest new ones), which may constitute a significant problem in its own right. Submissions will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, clarity. Submissions are expected to adhere to SIGPLAN’sEmpirical Evaluation Guidelinesand all the policies specified below. 
 Explicit assessment of interdisciplinary research 
 This interdisciplinary nature of the paper will serve a significant factor when considering paper acceptance. At the time of the submission we will ask the authors to identify and briefly justify the core disciplines the paper contributes the most. Papers with a single specified discipline are less likely to appear in the conference. In addition, reviewers will be asked to assess the paper relevance to the declared disciplines and low relevance scores will affect the chances of acceptance. If the PC decides that the paper does not fit the selected disciplines at all, it will be rejected without review.

. 
  
 ATMOS 2025 accepts two types of submissions, both of which will be reviewed with the same quality standards by the Program Committee. 
  
 Regular paper submissions: A regular paper submission should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state its key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main results. A regular paper submission should consist of a main body plus an optional and clearly marked appendix. The target length for the main body (excluding the bibliography, the front page(s) (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, …)) is 12-15 pages. The total paper, including the bibliography, the front page(s) (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, …) and the optional appendix, may not exceed 20 pages. Authors should include all necessary details in their submission so that the Program Committee can judge the correctness, importance and originality of their work. Any material (e.g., proofs or experimental results) omitted (from the main part of 15 pages) due to space limitations can be put into the optional appendix, which will be read at the Program Committee’s discretion. Regular papers will be allotted up to 20 pages in the proceedings. 
  
 Short papersubmissions: A short paper submission may present preliminary results or work-in-progress on a specific topic. Authors should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A short paper submission should have at least 4 and at most 6 pages. Authors should provide sufficient details in their submission so that the Program Committee can judge the correctness, importance and originality of their work. Short papers will be allotted up to 6 pages in the proceedings.

 Since 1992, AVI has been a biennial appointment for a vast international community of experts with a broad range of backgrounds. Throughout three decades, the Conference has attracted leading researchers of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) from all over the world, offering a forum to present and disseminate new technological results, paradigms, and visions for HCI and user interfaces. 
 Because of advanced technology and new possibilities for user interaction, AVI has broadened the topics it covers, still keeping its primary focus on the conception, design, implementation, and evaluation of novel visual interfaces. 
 The maintopicscan be seen in thehref=""/calls/paper-submission"" - Call for Papers
. 
 While rooted in Italy, AVI is an actual international conference concerning the nationality of participants, authors of papers, and program committee members. The mixture of carefully selected research contributions paired with cordial Italian hospitality creates a unique conference atmosphere, which has made AVI an internationally recognized brand.

 International Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces (AVI) 
  
 Since 1992, AVI has been a biennial appointment for a vast international community of experts with a broad range of backgrounds. Throughout three decades, the Conference has attracted leading researchers of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) from all over the world, offering a forum to present and disseminate new technological results, paradigms, and visions for HCI and user interfaces. 
 Because of advanced technology and new possibilities for user interaction, AVI has broadened the topics it covers, still keeping its primary focus on the conception, design, implementation, and evaluation of novel visual interfaces. 
 While rooted in Italy, AVI is an actual international conference concerning the nationality of participants, authors of papers, and program committee members. The mixture of carefully selected research contributions paired with cordial Italian hospitality creates a unique conference atmosphere, which has made AVI an internationally recognized brand. 
 AVI 2024 is under the patronage of University of Genoa, Department of Informatics, Bioengineering, Robotics and Systems Engineering, Italy. 
  
 We look forward to your participation in AVI 2024!

 On behalf of the organizing committee, we warmly welcome you to the 20th edition of the IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal-Based Surveillance (AVSS), taking place in the beautiful city of Niagara Falls, ON, Canada. 
  
 The IEEE AVSS Conference aims to provide a transformative and interdisciplinary forum that brings together experts from academia, industry, and government to advance the frontiers of theory, methods, systems, and applications. This year, we place a special emphasis on the recent trends in generative AI and large language models, which are revolutionizing the fields of video and signal-based surveillance. 
  
 Our program features three oral sessions, three keynotes, one tutorial, two workshops, and two poster sessions. Out of the 74 submissions, 44 papers have been accepted to the main track of the conference, resulting in an acceptance rate of 59.4%. Each submission underwent a rigorous review process, with a minimum of three reviews per paper. Authors had the opportunity to provide feedback on the reviews before the program chairs diligently curated the final conference program. 
  
 On the second day of the conference, we have two specialized workshops that highlight the impact of generative AI: (1) Workshop on New Trends in AI-Generated Media and Security (AIMS 2024), and (2) Intelligent Visual Computing Systems and Security Concerns (IVCSSC 2024). The AIMS Workshop features five keynotes, each with its own in-depth topic. The selection of papers for these workshops was conducted separately from the main conference track. AVSS 2024 features one Tutorial session, where Peter Tu and his team will offer an excellent tutorial on cutting-edge developments in social analytics. 
  
 AVSS 2024 features three distinguished keynote speakers: Prof. Xin Li from SUNY Albany, Prof. Xiaoming Liu from Michigan State University, and Prof. Pramod Varshney from Syracuse University. They will share their insights on aerial video analysis, biometric recognition and distributed inference in human-sensor networks, respectively. We hope you will find their talks both inspiring and enriching. 
  
 With the contributions of our authors, presenters, keynote speakers, and organizers, we are proud to present a strong program that covers a variety of state-of-the-art research. The success of AVSS 2024 would not be possible without the dedication, effort, and hard work of many individuals. We take this opportunity to thank all the authors for their submissions and participation in this conference. 
  
 We gratefully acknowledge the mentorship provided by our Honorary Chair Prof. Venu Govindaraju. We express our sincere gratitude to the Technical Program Committee members and external referees for their diligent work in reviewing the submitted papers, as well as their invaluable contributions and support. Special thanks go to the Area Chairs: Dr. Feng Ding, Dr. Ting Liu, Dr. Dylan Campbell, Dr. Chinwe Ekenna, and Dr. Shu Hu. We also thank the Workshop Chairs: Dr. Ifeoma Nwogu and Dr. Pradeep Atrey, Industry Chairs: Dr. Arslan Basharat and Dr. Lipeng Ke, Tutorial Chair: Dr. Chaker Larabi, Publication Chair: Dr. Shan Jia, Finance Chair: Dr. Hui Guo, Registration Chair: Dr. Xin Wang, Publicity Chair: Dr. Zhedong Zheng, and Website and Local Chairs: Dr. Chengzhe Sun and Dr. Jialing Cai. Additionally, we appreciate the efforts of our local student assistants: Riky Zhou, Yu Cai, and Zhaofeng Si. 
  
 We extend our deepest appreciation to the organizers of the workshops and the tutorial session. Our sincere gratitude also goes to our distinguished keynote speakers, Prof. Xin Li, Prof. Xiaoming Liu, and Prof. Pramod Varshney, for sharing their vision, insights, and experiences. 
  
 We hope you will enjoy the technical program, the opportunity to interact with each other, and the intellectual and social opportunities that AVSS 2024 provides.

 Call For Papers 
 Recent years witnessed significant interest in the use of Machine Learning and AI-based techniques to support large data analysis, with research and implementation of systems specifically focused on supporting different phases of the data processing lifecycle. These have ranged from in-memory systems and distributed environments (e.g., MapReduce/Hadoop, Spark) to specialist environments for stream processing of data and events (e.g., Flink, Kinesis) and Serverless (e.g., OpenWhisk, AWS Lambda). On the other hand, we also realise the importance of computational systems required to process small data volumes, but which involve interdependencies and relationships that are hard to capture and derive.

IEEE/ACM Int’l Conf. on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT) 
 We are pleased to inform you that the “11th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT 2024)” will be held in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates between 16 and and 19 December, 2024. 
 Recent years witnessed significant interest in the use of Machine Learning and AI-based techniques to support large data analysis, with research and implementation of systems specifically focused on supporting different phases of the data processing lifecycle. These have ranged from in-memory systems and distributed environments (e.g., MapReduce/Hadoop, Spark) to specialist environments for stream processing of data and events (e.g., Flink, Kinesis) and Serverless (e.g., OpenWhisk, AWS Lambda). On the other hand, we also realise the importance of computational systems required to process small data volumes, but which involve interdependencies and relationships that are hard to capture and derive. 
 The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT) is a premier annual conference series aiming to provide a platform for researchers from both academia and industry to present new discoveries in the broad area of big data computing and applications. Previous events were held in London, UK (BDCAT 2014), Limassol, Cyprus (BDCAT 2015), Shanghai, China (BDCAT 2016), Austin, USA (BDCAT 2017), Zurich, Switzerland (BDCAT 2018), Auckland, New Zealand (BDCAT 2019), Leicester, UK (BDCAT 2020), Leicester, UK (BDCAT 2021), Vancouver, USA (BDCAT 2022), and Taormina, Italy (BDCAT 2023). The BDCAT 2024 will be held in conjunction with the 17th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC 2024) in Sharjah, UAE.

 Introduction 
 Big data is an emerging paradigm applied to datasets whose size is beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, manage, and process the data within a tolerable elapsed time. Such datasets are often from various sources (Variety) yet unstructured such as social media, sensors, scientific applications, surveillance, video and image archives, Internet texts and documents, Internet search indexing, medical records, business transactions and web logs; and are of large size (Volume) with fast data in/out (Velocity). More importantly, big data has to be of high value (Value) and establish trust in it for business decision making (Veracity). Various technologies are being discussed to support the handling of big data such as massively parallel processing databases, scalable storage systems, cloud/stream computing platforms, and high performance/parallel computing platforms.  
   
  The 18th IEEE International Conference on Big Data Science and Engineering (BigDataSE-2024) is going to provide a prime international forum for researchers, industry practitioners and environment experts to exchange the latest fundamental advances in the state of the art and practice of Big Data and broadly related areas. The goal of this conference is to promote community-wide discussion for identifying advanced applications, technologies and theories for big data. We seek submissions of papers that invent novel techniques, investigate new applications, introduce advanced methodologies, propose promising research directions and discuss approaches for unsolved issues.

 The British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC)  

 BMVC 2024  : We are pleased to announce that BMVC will be held from 25th - 28th November 2024 in Glasgow.

 Call for Volunteers for hosting and organsing BMVC!  
 We are seeking volunteers to host and form the organising team for BMVC.  
 BMVC is a flagship conference and important conference for the global computer vision community; as such it is a priorty for the BMVA. The conference can only run with support of the vision community; the organisational teams include junior and senior researchers across both academia and industry from the UK and around the world.  
 The vision community, and the size of the conference, has expanded over recent years and we currently plan for around 500 attendees. This places a strain on the old model of hosting within a university with a team entirely from the same university. Instead, BMVC has moved to a model where the conference is split with general chairs comprising a local chair and a programme chair. The local chair is responsible for overseeing the physical hosting of the conference and the programme chair for the selection of the papers (appointing area chairs and reviewers, etc…). These chairs lead teams of volunteers who do not need to be at the same institution and we encourage forming a diverse team from across the global vision community.  
 The BMVA committee can assist with finding and securing venues if this is required (the scale of BMVC can now make it difficult to host within a university lecture theatre for example) and we can provide assistance with putting together the budget and sponsorship.  
 Proposals to Host a Future BMVC  
 If you would like to host BMVC, proposals are solicited in June of each year for the BMVC two years later. Please contact the Chair for further details.

The format is designed for easy on-screen reading, and to print well at one or two pages per sheet. Additional features include: pop-up annotations for citations~\cite{Authors06,Mermin89}; a margin ruler for reviewing; and a greatly simplified way of entering multiple authors and institutions. {\bf All authors are encouraged to read this document}, even if you have written many papers before. As well as a description of the format, the document contains many instructions relating to formatting problems and errors that are common even in the work of authors who {\em have} written many papers before. \end{abstract} %------------------------------------------------------------------------- \section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro} The proceedings of BMVC are published only in electronic form, but it is still assumed that readers of the papers may wish to print the paper. This document illustrates the required paper format, which is designed to read well either printed with two pages per sheet (``2-up''), or on screen. Note that printing with one page per sheet will produce a ``large print'' version, which in many cases is not what is desired. To approximate the old BMVC format, print at one page per sheet, but do not choose the option to ``scale to fit paper''. \LaTeX\ users should use this template in order to prepare their paper. Users of other packages should emulate the style and layout of this example. Note that best results will be achieved using {\tt pdflatex}, which is available in most modern distributions. \subsection{Paper length: nine pages plus bibliography} Paper length should not exceed 9~pages, {\em not counting} the bibliography. {\bf Papers which are overlength will not be reviewed}. This includes papers where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those laid down by this style guide. The reason such papers will not be reviewed is that there is no provision for supervised revisions of manuscripts. The reviewing process cannot determine the suitability of the paper for presentation in nine pages if it is reviewed in twelve. The bibliography should begin immediately after the paper text. It may be of any length, within reason. It should {\em not} include annotations, figures, or any other paraphernalia intended to subvert the paper length requirement. \begin{figure} \begin{tabular}{ccc} \bmvaHangBox{\fbox{\parbox{2.7cm}{~\\[2.8mm] \rule{0pt}{1ex}\hspace{2.24mm}\includegraphics[width=2.33cm]{images/eg1_largeprint.png}\\[-0.1pt]}}}& \bmvaHangBox{\fbox{\includegraphics[width=2.8cm]{images/eg1_largeprint.png}}}& \bmvaHangBox{\fbox{\includegraphics[width=5.6cm]{images/eg1_2up.png}}}\\ (a)&(b)&(c) \end{tabular} \caption{It is often a good idea for the first figure to attempt to encapsulate the article, complementing the abstract. This figure illustrates the various print and on-screen layouts for which this paper format has been optimized: (a) traditional BMVC print format; (b) on-screen single-column format, or large-print paper; (c) full-screen two column, or 2-up printing. } \label{fig:teaser} \end{figure} \subsection{Citations} When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``{\em et alia}'', shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.) The provided \verb'\etal' macro is a useful {\em aide memoire} in this regard. However, use it only when there are three or more authors. Thus, the following is correct: `` Frobnication has been trendy lately. It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.'' This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...'' because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors. If you use the \verb'\etal' macro, then you need not worry about double periods when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal. %For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not %chronological) order, so prefer We use {\tt natbib}, so citations in random order are nicely sorted: \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors06b,Authors06}. However, we don't use the compress option, as we want each reference to have its own hyperlink and popup window. %------------------------------------------------------------------------- \subsection{Footnotes} Please use footnotes\footnote {This is what a footnote looks like. It often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly. Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence). If you wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on which it is referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced. \begin{figure*} \begin{center} \fbox{\rule{0pt}{2in} \rule{.9\linewidth}{0pt}} \end{center} \caption{Example of a short caption, which should be centered.} \label{fig:short} \end{figure*} \begin{table} \begin{center} \begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Method & Frobnability \\ \hline\hline Theirs & Frumpy \\ Yours & Frobbly \\ Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\ \hline \end{tabular} \end{center} \caption{Results. Ours is better.} \end{table} \subsection{Mathematics} Please number all of your sections and displayed equations. It is important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation. Just because you didn't refer to it in the text doesn't mean some future reader might not need to refer to it. It is cumbersome to have to use circumlocutions like ``the equation second from the top of page 3 column 1''. (Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not an alternative to equation numbers). All authors will benefit from reading Mermin's description~\cite{Mermin89} of how to write mathematics. %------------------------------------------------------------------------- \subsection{References} List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text enclose the citation number in square brackets, for example~\cite{Authors06}. Where appropriate, include the name(s) of editors of referenced books. %------------------------------------------------------------------------ \subsection{Color} Color is valuable, and will be visible to readers of the electronic copy. However ensure that, when printed on a monochrome printer, no important information is lost by the conversion to grayscale. \bibliography{egbib} \end{document}

 Call For Papers 
 The British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) is one of the major international conferences on computer vision and related areas. It is organised by the British Machine Vision Association (BMVA). The 36th BMVC will now be an in-person event from 24th—27th November 2025 in Sheffield, UK. 
  
 Authors are invited to submit high-quality papers in image processing, computer vision, machine learning and related areas for BMVC 2025. Submitted papers will be refereed on originality, presentation, empirical results, and evaluation quality. Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings published and DOI-indexed by BMVA. Past proceedings are online at the BMVA proceedings website. 
  
 Please note that BMVC is a single-track meeting with oral and poster presentations. The paper submission deadline will be on the 16th of May 2025. Submitted papers should not exceed NINE pages (references are excluded), and appendices should be submitted via the supplementary information. You can find further information in the Author Guidelines and Submit your Paper pages. 
  
 The submission portal will be available from late-April, 2025. 
  
 Topics include, but are not limited to: 
  
 3D from X 
 3D Shape modeling and processing 
 Action and event understanding 
 Adversarial attack and defense 
 Architecture and Space Design

 Papers submitted under the “Brave new ideas” subject area are expected to move away from incremental benchmark gains. Proposed ideas should radically differ from the current research strand or propose a novel problem. 
 Reviewing Process for BMVC 2025 
  
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. The Area Chair will provide a meta-review, summarising the reviewers’ points and recommending paper decisions. 
  
 Please Note: Due to the anticipated volume of papers for BMVC 2025 (based on recent year’s experience), there will be NO extension granted to the submission deadline. In keeping with conferences in the field (e.g., NeurIPS, CVPR) and to cope with the increasing number of submissions, we ask that all authors be prepared to review papers. The submission site will ask authors to acknowledge this commitment, and failure to engage with the reviewing process might be grounds for rejection. 
  
 Further information about the reviewing process can be found at the Reviewing policies. 
  
 Any queries to the Programme Chairs should be sent to pc_email.

 Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion  
 The BPM community is committed to the promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in all aspects of our professional activities. We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience. We encourage all participants to consider DEI in their writing, reviews, presentations, and all interactions related to the BPM conference. The BPM community has a tradition of researching and experimenting with real-world applications and, as such, needs to find the balance between research and societal events that shape our lives as a liberal society that supports DEI principles. Therefore, the conference participants should feel free to express themselves on all topics within and beyond our interests as a research community and to do so in a non-aggravating and respectful manner, being considerate to those who are the possible victims of, a.o., violence, war, or political oppression and making use of this special opportunity to gather in an international setting to better understand multiple view points in a safe and inclusive environment.

 About BPMDS    
  
 The BPMDS working conference, sponsored by IFIP WG8.1, has been a fertile ground for influential research and a catalyst for pioneering developments in business process modeling and support. This year, we reaffirm our commitment to fostering cutting-edge research and facilitating robust discussions that shape the future of business processes.   
 Recognizing the evolving nature of our field, we introduce innovations to the submission process designed to enhance participation and engagement. We invite contributions ranging from completed research papers to idea papers. We encourage submissions that not only reflect on the established foundations of BPMDS, but also explore new paradigms, methodologies, and applications. Whether through the lens of AI and machine learning, process mining, human-centric approaches, or the implications of digital assistants such as ChatGPT, we seek to reflect the dynamic and diverse nature of our community.   

 Topics    
  
 BPMDS welcomes submissions on a broad range of topics, that include, but are not limited to:   
 Process Mining and Data-Driven BPM:  Discussing techniques and tools to obtain process-related information from event logs, including process discovery, conformance checking, and enhancement. 
  AI and Machine Learning in BPM:  How are artificial intelligence and machine learning being used to improve any facet of the BPM? 
  Assistants and BPM:  Exploring how assistants such as ChatGPT impact BPM. 
  Advancements in Business Process Modeling:  Exploring the latest developments, including new symbols, semantics, and modeling approaches. 
  Platforms and BPM:  Joining innovation and transaction with business process management. 
  Case Studies on BPM in Different Industries:  Sharing practical experiences and insights from applying BPM in sectors such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and services. 
  Human-centric BPM:  Focusing on the role of human judgment and interaction in BPM and how to better integrate human factors. 
  BPM for Sustainability:  Leveraging BPM to support sustainable business practices and the development of green business processes. 
  Regulatory Compliance and BPM:  Addressing how business process modeling or BPM in general can aid in achieving and maintaining regulatory compliance. 
  Future Trends in BPM:  Predicting future directions of BPM research, including potential disruptive technologies and methodologies. 
  BPM Education and Training:  Best practices for teaching and training professionals in business process modeling, development, and support. 
  Evaluation and Benchmarking of BPM Tools:  Providing insights into the evaluation of BPM tools and methodologies, including comparative studies and benchmarking. 

 Submissions    
  
 We invite two kinds of submissions:   
 ●    Completed research papers  (14 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references) that report on research with evaluated results.   
 ●    Idea papers  (7 pages,  plus up to 2 pages for references  ) that present innovative concepts or directions to inspire discussion.   
 Submissions should adhere to the LNBIP formatting instructions at  https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines.  Page limits are defined excluding the reference list, but including all text, figures, and appendices. BPMDS uses a single-blind review system, so author details can be included in the submission. Submissions not conforming to the formatting instructions, the page limitations, or that are obviously out of the scope of the conference, will be rejected without review. The results described in the submitted paper must be unpublished and must not be under review elsewhere.   
 Submissions should be made through the CAISE 2025 EasyChair (select BPMDS 2025 as the track):  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=caise2025   

 Special Collection    
  
 From the accepted completed research papers, a selection will be invited to submit an extended version to a special collection of the  Process Science Journal  .   

 Open Science Principles    
  
 BPMDS encourages authors of research papers to follow the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. In particular, the conference supports the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourages authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data in order to increase reproducibility and replicability.   
 Authors are encouraged to make research artefacts (e.g., prototypes, interview protocols, questionnaires) or the datasets (used in, or produced by, the empirical evaluation) reported in the paper available in a suitable form. To facilitate this, we kindly ask authors to include links in their manuscripts to private or public repositories where reviewers can access the associated research artefacts. This information may be presented in a dedicated section, such as “Data availability” or “Reproducibility”. This requirement does not apply to papers that neither involve an empirical study nor a prototype implementation.   
 Authors who are unable or choose not to share their research artefacts and datasets with the program committee are encouraged to provide an explanation within their submitted manuscript, detailing the reasons behind their decision. This statement may be removed from the final version of the paper if it gets accepted. Possible reasons may involve privacy restrictions or non-disclosure agreements.   
 To enhance the accessibility of research artefacts and datasets, authors are advised to make them accessible via public repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, GitHub, or institutional archives) under an open data license such as the CC0 dedication or the CC-BY 4.0 license. Making research artefacts and datasets available via cloud services such as Dropbox or Google Docs is discouraged due to the volatility of the links associated with these services.   
 Finally, authors are encouraged to self-archive their pre- and post-prints in open, preserved repositories, such as their institutional preprint repository, arXiv or other non-profit services, in line with Springer’s copyright agreement (see “License to Publish form for LNCS, CCIS or LNBIP”, §3, available at  https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines  ).   

 Important Dates

 Notes on the Early History of CADE 
 The 1968 meeting was organized by the mathematician Marcel-Paul Schützenberger, one of the founders of formal language theory, the logician Daniel Lacombe and the computer scientist Louis Nolin. It occurred at the just created IRIA (Institut de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique) in Rocquencourt, near Versailles. This was actually the first scientific meeting organized at IRIA (to become INRIA in 1984 when it became a national institute). Schützenberger was the father of the Parisian school of theoretical computer science, and one of the founding scientific directors of IRIA. G. Kreisel came, probably invited by D. Lacombe, a specialist of recursive functions theory, and Jean-Louis Krivine, who had been working with him on axiomatic set theory. de Bruijn gave one of the first presentations of Automath. D. Scott discussed a notion of constructive validity. Several pioneers of automated theorem-proving participated, such as Hao Wang, R. Kowalski, D. Loveland, D. Luckham and L. Wos. 
 Peter Andrews provided many details of the early CADEs. He noted … “Evidently the conference at Versailles, France, in 1968 was not considered part of the CADE sequence of conferences by the early CADE organizers (one of whom was Wolfgang Bibel).” Gérard Huet recalls … “CADE was created probably at the 1977 meeting. Retroactively, the meetings of Argonne and Oberworlfach were christened CADE-1 and CADE-2, consistently with the fact that they were organized by the automated deduction community (Wos, Robinson, Bledsoe, Loveland, Andrews, Bibel, etc).” Wolfgang Bibel confirmed … “The term CADE was used for the very first time for CADE-1980, the Fifth International Conference on Automated Deduction (the numbering added after the reconstruction of the history), held in Les Arcs, Frankreich Juli 1980. Its Program Chairs were Wolfgang Bibel and Robert Kowalski. And it was me who suggested to introduce the term in - still existing - letters to Woody Bledsoe, Bob Kowalsky and others.”. Reiner Hähnle kindly went to the TU Darmstadt archive and took photos of some of the original correspondence between Wolfgang and Bob Kowaski which are provided here with permission from Wolfgang. They area letter from Wolfgang to Bob dated 4/4/79regarding the arrangements for the 1979 conference,Wolfgang’s draft CFPfor the conference, anda letter from Bob to Wolfgang dated 20/4/79in which Bob agrees to Wolfgang’s suggestion of the CADE acronym.

 CAiSE'25 | 37th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering | Theme: Bridging Silos | Vienna, Austria  June 16-20, 2025 | Open Calls 

 Theme: Bridging Silos   
 Engineering real-world information systems requires a coherent design encompassing human, organizational, economic, societal, and technological aspects. Information systems are applied in diverse contexts such as business process management, geographical information systems, and digital twins. The discipline continually evolves with trends in data science, machine learning, process mining, blockchain, mobile computing, sustainability, new regulations, cyber warfare, and military conflicts, all influencing its development. Each application context and emerging trend can lead to specializations within information systems engineering, necessitating various research traditions and needs. While beneficial, these specializations risk creating silos. Thus, the CAiSE conference, the premier event for this discipline, aims to prevent such fragmentation.  
  Therefore, the theme for this year’s CAiSE conference is ""Bridging Silos."" We encourage submissions that consider information systems engineering as a cohesive design involving multiple aspects. Submissions focused on specific specializations should explicitly position their results within the broader context to engage researchers across different areas and avoid silo formation.

 CALCO 
 Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer science. From data types to development techniques and specification formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from the large body of research proposed and implemented since the pioneering works of the 1960s. TheConference on Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science(CALCO) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science. CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques). 
 Usually, CALCO is co-located withMFPS.

 CALL FOR PAPERS: CALCO 2023 
  
 10th International Conference on 
 Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science 
  
 June 19-22, 2023 
  
 Bloomington, Indiana (USA) and online 
  
 Co-located with MFPS XXXIX 
  
 https://coalg.org/calco-mfps-2023/ 
  
 ========================================================== 
 Paper submission: March 8, 2023 (AoE) 
 Author notification: Apr 28, 2023 (AoE) 
 Final version due: May 19, 2023 
 ========================================================== 

Scope 
 ----- 
 Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer 
 science. From data types to development techniques and specification 
 formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from 
 the large body of research proposed and implemented since the 
 pioneering works of the 1960s. 
  
 CALCO aims to bring together researchers with interests in both 
 foundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in 
 computer science, traditional as well as emerging ones 
  
 CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the 
 forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on 
 Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on 
 Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place 
 in Salzburg (Austria, 2021), London (UK, 2019), Ljubljana 
 (Slovenia,2017), Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015), Warsaw (Poland, 
 2013), Winchester (UK, 2011), Udine (Italy, 2009), Bergen (Norway, 
 2007), Swansea (Wales, 2005). 
  
 The 10th edition will be held in Bloomington, Indiana, co-located with 
 MFPS XXXIX. It is planned as a physical, in-person event, with 
 support for remote presence, both for speakers and for other 
 participants who are unable or unwilling to travel. 

Submission Categories 
 --------------------- 
 CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and 
 coalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four 
 categories of submissions. 
  
 1. Regular papers that report 
 * results on theoretical foundations 
 * novel methods and techniques for software development 
 * experiences with technology transfer to industry. 
  
 2. (Co)Algebraic Pearls papers that 
 * present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way. 
  
 3. Early ideas abstracts that lead to 
 * presentations of work in progress 
 * proposals for original venues of research. 
  
 4. Tool presentation papers that 
 * report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools. 

Topics of Interests 
 ------------------- 
 All topics relating to algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications 
 are of interest for CALCO, and among them 
  
 * Models and logics 
 - Automata and languages 
 - Graph transformations and term rewriting 
 - Modal logics 
 - Proof systems 
 - Relational systems

 and context-aware computational paradigms 
 - Systems theory and computational models (chemical, biological, etc.) 
  
 * System specification and verification 
 - Formal testing and quality assurance 
 - Generative programming and model-driven development 
 - Integration of formal specification techniques 
 - Model-driven development 
 - Specification languages, methods, and environments 
  
 * Tools supporting algebraic and coalgebraic methods for 
 - Advances in automated verification 
 - Model checking 
 - Theorem proving 
 - Testing 
  
 * String diagrams and network theory 
 - Theory of PROPs and operads 
 - Rewriting problems and higher-dimensional approaches 
 - Automated reasoning with string diagrams 
 - Applications of string diagrams 
  
 * Quantum computing 
 - Categorical semantics for quantum computing 
 - Quantum calculi and programming languages 
 - Foundational structures for quantum computing 
 - Applications of quantum algebra 

Submissions Guidelines 
 ---------------------- 
 All submissions will be handled via EasyChair: 
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco2023 
  
 The format for all submissions is specified by LIPIcs. Please use the 
 latest version of the style: 
 http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/ 
  
 It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length. 
 Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. 

Regular papers 
 -------------- 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English 
 presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and 
 not submitted for publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be 
 maximum 15 pages long, excluding references. Proofs omitted due to space 
 limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix. 
  
 Proceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs Leibniz 
 International Proceedings in Informatics series. 
  
 A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in Computer 
 Science (http://www.lmcs-online.org), containing extended versions of 
 selected papers, is planned. 

(Co)algebraic pearls 
 -------------------- 
 This is a recent submission category. Explaining a known idea in a new 
 way may make as strong a contribution as inventing a new idea. We 
 encourage the submission of pearls: elegant essays that illustrate an 
 idea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing 
 an application. Pearls are typically short and concise and so should 
 not be longer than regular papers in the format specified by 
 LIPIcs. Authors who feel they need a bit more space should consult 
 with the PC co-chairs. The accepted papers will be included in the 
 final proceedings of the conference. Each submission will be evaluated 
 by at least two reviewers. 

Early ideas abstracts 
 --------------------- 
 Submissions should not exceed 2 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. 
 The volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on 
 the CALCO pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged 
 to disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere. Each 
 submission will be evaluated by at least two reviewers. 

Tool papers 
 ----------- 
 Submissions should not exceed 5 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. 
 The accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of 
 the conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the 
 time of submission for download and evaluation. Each submission will be 
 evaluated by at least three reviewers, and one or more of the reviewers 
 will be asked to download and use the tool. 

Best Paper and Best Presentation Awards 
 --------------------------------------- 
 This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose 
 recipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a 
 Best Presentation Award, elected by the participants.

About the conference 
  
 The International Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS) 
 is a premier forum for presenting research in the field of cryptology 
 and network security. The conference seeks academic, industry, and 
 government submissions on all theoretical and practical aspects of 
 cryptology and network security. This year marks the 24th iteration of 
 the conference and will be held at Osaka, Japan. Proceedings of this 
 year's conference will be published by Springer LNCS; proceedings of 
 previous iterations of the conference can be found online. 
  
 Submission guidelines 
  
 High quality papers on unpublished research and implementation 
 experiences may be submitted. All papers must be original and not 
 substantially duplicate work that has been published at, or is 
 simultaneously submitted to, a journal or another conference or workshop 
 with proceedings. All submissions must be written in English and span no 
 more than 20 pages in the Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science 
 (LNCS) format, including title, abstract, and bibliography. The 
 introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level 
 understandable by a non-expert reader and explain the context to related 
 work. 
 Submitted papers may contain supplementary material in the form of 
 well-marked appendices or a separate file archive (particularly for 
 source code, data files, etc.). Note that supplementary material will 
 not be included in the proceedings. Moreover, the main paper should be 
 intelligible without requiring the reader to consult the supplementary 
 material; the reviewers may optionally refer to the supplementary 
 material, but are also permitted to base their assessment on the main 
 paper alone. 
  
 Submissions must be anonymous (no author names, affiliations, 
 acknowledgments, or obvious references). The conference will also 
 consider short papers of up to eight pages in the LNCS format, excluding 
 the bibliography (max 2 pages), for results that are not yet fully 
 fleshed out or that simply require fewer pages to describe but still 
 make a significant contribution. 
 All submissions must be processed with LaTeX2e according to the 
 instructions given by Springer. Submitted manuscripts must be typeset in 
 plain Springer LNCS format, in particular without changing the font 
 size, margins or line spacing. Submissions not meeting these guidelines 
 may be rejected without consideration of their merits. 
 Papers must be submitted via EasyChair. The deadline for submissions is 
 17 April anywhere on earth (AoE). 
  
 Important dates 
 Submission: 17 April AoE. Papers must be submitted via EasyChair. 
 Notification: 10 July 
 Camera-ready: 14 August 
 Conference: 17–20 November 
  
 Presentation requirements 
 At least one author of every accepted paper must register and pay the 
 full registration fee (non-student) for the conference by the early 
 registration deadline indicated by the organizers. Papers without a 
 registered author will be removed from the sessions. Authors must 
 present their own paper(s). Session proceedings, including all accepted 
 papers, will be published in LNCS and will be available at the 
 conference.

 CARDIS has been the venue for security experts from industry and academia to exchange on 
 security of smart cards and related applications since 1994. Smart cards play an increasingly 
 important role in our day-to-day life through their use in banking cards, SIM cards, electronic 
 passports, and IoT devices. It is thus naturally of utmost importance to understand their security 
 features and to develop sound protocols and countermeasures while keeping reasonable 
 performance. In this respect, CARDIS aims to gather security experts from industry, academia, and 
 standardization bodies to make steps forward in the field of embedded security. 
 The 21st edition of CARDIS is organized by the Centre for Cyber Security and Privacy of the 
 University of Birmingham, UK. CARDIS 2022 will be accompanied by a one-day Fall School event, 
 with more details to be announced.

 Conference Information 
 The tools of Scientific Computing play an important role in the natural sciences and engineering. Computer Algebra Systems and the underlying algorithms for Symbolic Computation play an increasingly important role within Scientific Computation. The CASC workshop series has been running for over two decades to explore the interaction of these topics, their implementation, and their application. 
 Scope 
 The topics addressed in the workshop cover 
 1. The theory of symbolic computation and its implementation in computer algebra systems. 
 This includes, but is not limited to: 
 new methods on exact computation; 
 symbolic algorithms and their complexity; 
 automated reasoning in algebra and geometry; 
 parallel symbolic / symbolic-numeric computation; 
 symbolic / symbolic-numeric methods for differential, differential-algebraic and difference equations; 
 symbolic / symbolic-numeric methods for polynomial equations and inequalities; 
 the embedding of computer algebra technology within different software and hardware environments; 
 2. All other areas of scientific computing in regards to their benefit from or use of computer algebra methods and software. 
 This includes, but is not limited to: 
 the use of computer algebra in approximate computation; 
 computer algebra methods in big data analytics; 
 computer algebra methods for simulation and modeling; 
 3. Applications of the above throughout the natural sciences and engineering. 
 We welcome papers on both fundamental research and implementation issues. We also accept survey papers but these MUST BE CLEARLY LABELLED as such in the title. 
 Conference Participation Options 
 We encourage wide participation at the workshop. In light of this, and that the conference scope spans computer science and mathematics (with their different publication traditions), we offer a variety of participation options. 
 1. Participation with an accompanying paper inhref=""https://link.springer.com/conference/casc"" - LNCS:

CASC has a long running relationship with the Springer book series Lecture Notes in Computer Science to publish conference proceedings. Work submitted here should contain an original research result. Submissions should be prepared in theLNCS styleand not exceed 20 pages. Survey papers may have up to 25 pages. Click on the below logo to see the list of CASC proceedings published by Springer. 
 href=""https://link.springer.com/conference/casc"" - 
2. Participation with abstract only: 
  
 Participants may opt to submit an extended abstract instead. These should have at least 2 and at most 4 pages in theLNCS style.They must contain the main results of the talk (without proofs). They will be lightly reviewed and distributed locally at the conference. We see three main audiences for this option: 
 Those who wish to talk on previously published work (in which case that work should be clearly cited in the abstract). 
 Those whose work is not yet ready for publication, but wish to receive feedback. 
 Those who plan to submit a journal paper on the work shortly. 
 For the second group, there will be a subsequent journal topical collection call after the conference (see below). 
 Accompanying Topical Collection of Mathematics in Computer ScienceCASC has formed a relationship with the Springer Birkhäuser journal Mathematics in Computer Science (MCS)for an ongoing series of topical collections on topics presented at CASC workshops. Work submitted here must be of journal quality and will be reviewed to the usual standards of MCS. Submission will be opened after the conference for authors of extended abstracts presented at that years conference. There is no a priori page limit, but the length must be justified by the contents of the paper. At notification authors may be asked to revise their paper for a secondary deadline. 
 Submission Link 
 All submissions should be done via EasyChair: 
 SUBMIT:href=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=casc2025"" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=casc2025
In the EasyChair title field please prefix the paper title in the EasyChair metadata with either LNCS or EA to indicate which of the participation options is being used.

 About 
 CAV is the premier international conference on computer-aided verification. It provides a forum for a broad range of advanced research in areas ranging model checking and automated theorem proving to testing, synthesis and related fields. Research reported in CAV includes the application of formal methods to many kinds of systems,including hardware, software and communication protocols. It covers many system models, including finite-state and infinite state systems, hybrid systems and probabilistic systems. It encompasses both theory and industrial case studies. The common thread is the use of automation to help designers build more reliable systems. 
 CAV is held each year in July, and usually alternates between North America and Europe. It began as a workshop held in 1989 in Grenoble France. Subsequently, CAV was organized as a conference by Edmund Clarke, Robert Kurshan, Amir Pnueli and Joseph Sifakis. It has been held each year since 1990. A list of past and planned CAV conferences by year can be found below. 
 The current steering committee of CAV consists of: 
 Orna Grumberg, The Technion 
 Aarti Gupta, Princeton University 
 Daniel Kröning, University of Oxford 
 Ken McMillan, UT Austin

Twenty-Second International Conference on Computability and Complexity in Analysis 
 September 24-26, 2025,Kyoto, Japan 

Scope 
 The conference is concerned with the theory of computability and complexity over real-valued data. 
 Computability and complexity theory are two central areas of research in mathematical logic and theoretical computer science. Computability theory is the study of the limitations and abilities of computers in principle. Computational complexity theory provides a framework for understanding the cost of solving computational problems, as measured by the requirement for resources such as time and space. The classical approach in these areas is to consider algorithms as operating on finite strings of symbols from a finite alphabet. Such strings may represent various discrete objects such as integers or algebraic expressions, but cannot represent general real or complex numbers, unless they are rounded. 
 Most mathematical models in physics and engineering, however are based on the real number concept. Thus, a computability theory and a complexity theory over the real numbers and over more general continuous data structures is needed. Despite remarkable progress in recent years many important fundamental problems have not yet been studied, and presumably numerous unexpected and surprising results are waiting to be detected. 
 Scientists working in the area of computation on real-valued data come from different fields, such as theoretical computer science, domain theory, logic, constructive mathematics computer arithmetic, numerical mathematics and all branches of analysis. The conference provides a unique opportunity for people from such diverse areas to meet, present work in progress and exchange ideas and knowledge. 
 The topics of interest include foundational work on various models and approaches for describing computability and complexity over the real numbers. They also include complexity-theoretic investigations, both foundational and with respect to concrete problems, and new implementations of exact real arithmetic, as well as further developments of already existing software packages. We hope to gain new insights into computability-theoretic aspects of various computational questions from physics and from other fields involving computations over the real numbers.

 Computable analysis 
 Complexity on real numbers 
 Computable numbers, subsets and functions 
 Theory of representations

 Call for Papers 
 (Please helpnominate PC members) 
 The 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice. Authors are encouraged to write the abstract and introduction of their paper in a way that makes the results accessible and compelling to a general computer-security researcher. In particular, authors should bear in mind that anyone on the program committee may be asked to review any paper. 
 CCS has two review cycles in 2025. For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made: 
 Accept: Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference, possibly after making minor changes with the oversight of a shepherd. 
 Minor revision: Papers in this category are considered to be promising but need some minor additional work (e.g., minor experiments, proofs to minor lemmas). Authors will be given the opportunity to resubmit such papers, with appropriate revisions, in which case they should clearly explain in a separate note how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers. The revised paper will then be re-evaluated, and either accepted or rejected. 
 Reject: Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Papers rejected from the first review cycle may not be submitted again (even in revised form) to the second review cycle. 
 Authors of each accepted paper must ensure that at least one author registers for the conference, and that their paper is presented in-person at the conference if at all possible. 
 Paper Submission Information 
 All submissions must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the corresponding deadline. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings. All submissions should be properly anonymized. 
 Papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. In the unusual case in which a third-person reference is infeasible, authors can blind the reference itself. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.Authors may submit up to a maximum of 7 papers for Cycle B. 
 All submitted papers will be evaluated based on their merits, particularly their importance to practical aspects of computer and communications security and privacy, novelty, quality of execution, and presentation. For papers that might raise ethical concerns, authors are expected to convince reviewers that proper procedures (such as IRB approval or responsible disclosure) have been followed, and due diligence has been made to minimize potential harm. 
 Submitted papers may be rejected for being out of scope, at the discretion of the PC chairs. Authors who have questions about whether their paper is in scope are encouraged to ask the PC chairs in advance. No modifications to the author list on a paper may be made after submission. 
 Mandatory Reviewing (New!) 
 Authors submitting 3 papers or more may be required to submit reviews for other papers at CCS 2025. Authors who fall into this category will be requested to provide information for review matching and complete an attestation for reviewing ethics. 
 Authors failing to provide the requested information may see their paper desk-rejected. 
 It is expected that reviewers will submit fair and thoughtful reviews on time. Reviews that do not meet this standard, such as exceptionally short reviews, reviews generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), reviews not relevant to the paper or that miss a substantial portion of the paper will be flagged and may be grounds for desk rejection of the reviewer’s papers at the discretion of the PC chairs. 
 Withdrawing Policy (New!) 
 A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper can not be withdrawn. 
 Paper Format 
 Submissions must be a PDF file in double-columnACM formatusing""sigconf""2-column format, no more than 12 pages long, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Note that reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material. Authors should not change the font or the margins of the ACM format. The CCS information such as concepts, keywords, or rights management information (e.g., DOI and ISBN) must be retained. The teaser figure is optional. Please refer to the sample-sigconf.tex and sample-sigconf.pdf in the ACM package (also mirroredhere) as an example. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review. 
 Providing Artifacts at Submission Time 
 Submissions whose claimed contributions rely on artifacts (e.g., code, models, data sets) are expected to make these accessible to the reviewers, unless there are good reasons not to, in which case these reasons must be mentioned in the submission. Submissions whose claimed contributions do not rely on artifacts do not need to submit artifacts. An anonymous link to a resource on the web is acceptable, provided the contents in the resource are also anonymized. 
 Optional Artifact Evaluation 
 A published scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond the document itself: software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on. To emphasize the importance of such artifacts, the benefits to the authors and the community as a whole, and promote the reproducibility of experimental results, ACM CCS will, for the second time, introduce an optional artifact evaluation (AE) process, inspired by similar efforts at several other conferences. All authors of accepted papers (including shepherd approved and minor revisions) are encouraged to submit artifacts for AE. Each artifact submitted will be reviewed by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC); a special call for artifacts will follow. 
 Conference Tracks 
 Like last year, the ACM CCS Conference features a multi-track format. Each track operates as a separate mini-conference, with its own Track Chairs and Track Program Committee. The overall process is managed by the Program Chairs (David Lie and Véronique Cortier). At the time of submission, authors must select one track, which should be the most relevant to the topic of the paper. We understand that some papers might span multiple topics. In specific cases, PC members might be asked to provide reviews for papers outside their track, in an effort to provide the best possible reviews to the authors. The chairs may decide to move a paper to another track. 
 This is the list of tracks and their Track Chairs:

 Conflicts of Interest 
 The conference requires cooperation from both authors and program-committee members to ensure a fair review process. For this purpose, authors must report all program-committee members who, in their opinion, have a conflict of interest and therefore may not be able to provide an unbiased review. Mandatory declared conflicts of interest include current or former doctoral advisor/advisee, members of the same institution, close family members, and recent co-authors (within the past 2 years). For any other declared conflict, authors are required to explain the nature of the conflict at the time of paper submission, which will be reviewed by the Program Chairs and the Track Chairs. The chairs reserve the right to request further explanation and can remove non-mandatory conflicts at their discretion. 
 Track Chairs are allowed to submit papers, and those papers will be handled by the Program Chairs. They are only allowed to submit two papers in their own track, and any number in other tracks. 
 Program-committee members who have a genuine conflict of interest with a paper, including the Program Chairs and the Track Chairs, will be excluded from evaluation and discussion of that paper. When a Track Program Chair has a conflict, the paper will be handled by the Program Chairs. When a Program Chair is conflicted, the other Co-Chair will be responsible for managing that paper. When both Program Chairs are in conflict, a committee member will be appointed to handle the paper. Program Chairs are not allowed to be authors or co-authors of any submissions. 
 Policy for Peer-Review Integrity 
 All SIGSAC sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities (https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment) and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics). Also all authors, PC members and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc). Particularly, we require all reviewers to uphold the integrity of the peer review process and avoid conflict of interest of any form (e.g., reviewer collusion ring). Those who violate these policies will be penalized according to ACM policies (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/penalties-for-publication-violations). If you would like to report a violation, please contact program chairs of your conferences/workshops or SIGSAC officers. We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your communication.

 ARES Conference 
 About CD-MAKE 
 The International Cross Domain Conference for Machine Learning & Knowledge Extraction CD-MAKEwas a joint effort of IFIPTC 5 (Information Technology Applictions),TC 12 (Artificial Intelligence), IFIPhref=""https://ifip.org/tc/?tc=tc8"" - WG 8.4 (E-Business: Multi-disciplinary research and practice)
, IFIP WG8.9 (Enterprise Information Systems)and IFIP WG12.9 (Computational Intelligence)and was held in conjunction with the International Conference onAvailability, Reliability and Security (ARES). 
 CDstands forCross-Domain and means the integration and appraisal of different fields and application domains (e.g. health AI, Industry 4.0, etc.) to provide an atmosphere to foster different perspectives and opinions. The conference was dedicated to offer an international platform for novel ideas and a fresh look on the methodologies to put crazy ideas into Business for the benefit of the human. Serendipity is a desired effect, and shall cross-fertilize methodologies and transfer of algorithmic developments. 
 MAKEstands forMAchine Learning &KnowledgeExtraction. 
 Machine learningdeals with understanding intelligence for the design and development of algorithms that can learn from data and improve over time. The original definition was“the artificial generation of knowledge from experience”.The challenge is to discover relevantstructuralpatterns and/ortemporalpatterns (“knowledge”) in such data, which are often hidden and not accessible to a human. Today, machine learning is the fastest growing technical field, having many application domains, e.g. health, Industry 4.0, recommender systems, speech recognition, autonomous driving, etc. The challenge is in decision making under uncertainty, and probabilistic inference enormously influenced artificial intelligence and statistical learning. The inverse probability allows to infer unknowns, learn from data and make predictions to support decision making. Whether in social networks, recommender systems, health or Industry 4.0 applications, the increasingly complex data sets require efficient, useful and useable solutions for knowledge discovery andknowledge extraction.A synergistic combination of methodologies and approaches of two domains offer ideal conditions towards unraveling these challenges and to foster new, efficient and user-friendly machine learning algorithms and knowledge extraction tools: Human-Computer Interaction(HCI)and Knowledge Discovery/Data Mining(KDD), aiming at augmentinghuman intelligence with computational intelligenceand vice versa toward ahuman-centered AIapproach. 
 Consequently, successful Machine Learning & Knowledge extraction needs a concerted international effort without boundaries, supporting collaborative and integrative cross-disciplinary research between experts from 7 (the magical number seven +/- 0) fields. Holzinger, A., 2017. Introduction to MAchine Learning & Knowledge Extraction (MAKE).Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction, 1(1), p.1. Available at:http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/make1010001. 
 TOPICS CD-MAKE 
 ❶ DATA – Data science (data fusion, preprocessing, mapping, knowledge representation, …), 
 ❷ LEARNING – algorithms, contextual adaptation, causal reasoning, transfer learning … 
 ❸ VISUALIZATION – intelligent interfaces, human-AI interaction, dialogue systems, … 
 ❹ PRIVACY – data protection, safety, security, ethics, acceptance and social issues of ML, … 
 ❺ NETWORK – graphical models, graph-based ML, Bayesian inference, … 
 ❻ TOPOLOGY – geometrical machine learning, topological and manifold learning, … 
 ❼ ENTROPY – time and machine learning, entropy-based learning, … 
 The goal of theCD-MAKE conferencewas to act as aCatalysatorto bring together researchers from these seven areas in an cross-disciplinary manner, to stimulate fresh ideas and to encourage multi-disciplinary problem solving.

 CGI 2025 
 CGI is one of the oldest annual international conferences on Computer Graphics in the world. Half centuries of influence, we are dedicated to making CGI as a top conference on graphics and media. Researchers are invited to share their experiences and novel achievements in various fields of Computer Graphics, Media, and Virtual Reality. Previous recent CGI conferences have been held in Sydney, Australia (2014), Strasbourg, France (2015), Heraklion, Greece (2016), Yokohama, Japan (2017), Bintan, Indonesia (2018), Calgary, Canada (2019), and Shanghai, China (2023). CGI has been virtual between 2020 and 2022 due to the COVID pandemic, and has been held last year in Geneva, Switzerland (2024).

 CGI is one of the oldest annual international conferences on Computer Graphics in the world. Half centuries of influence, we are dedicated to making CGI as a top conference on graphics and media. Researchers are invited to share their experiences and novel achievements in various fields of Computer Graphics, Media, and Virtual Reality. Previous recent CGI conferences have been held in Sydney, Australia (2014), Strasbourg, France (2015), Heraklion, Greece (2016), Yokohama, Japan (2017), Bintan, Indonesia (2018), Calgary, Canada (2019), and Shanghai, China (2023). CGI has been virtual between 2020 and 2022 due to the COVID pandemic, and has been held last year in Geneva, Switzerland (2024). 
  
 This year, CGI 2025 is organized by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and supported by the Computer Graphics Society (CGS). The Visual Computer Journal, published by Springer Nature, is the official journal of the Computer Graphics Society. 
  
 You are invited to submit your full papers to CGI 2025 via EasyChair. As in previous years, CGI 2025 papers can be submitted for possible publication in The Visual Computer journal, the CAVW journal, VRIH journal, and CGI Conference Proceedings (LNCS, Springer).

 The scientific program of the conference will include accepted papers from the first Call for Papers and these accepted papers will be published in The Visual Computer Journal (IF: 3.0) by Springer Nature. 
  
 The accepted papers from the second Call for Papers will be included either in the CGI Conference Proceedings published by LNCS, Springer, or in the VRIH Journal (Virtual Reality and Intelligent Hardware) published by Science Press, or in the CAVW Journal (Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds, SCI-indexed) published by Wiley, or in TVC Journal (The Visual Computer, SCI-indexed, JCR: Q1, IF: 3.0) published by Springer Nature. 
  
 Note that for ALL submissions, the review process is double blind, which requires the paper and all supplemental materials to be anonymous. Ensure that self-referencing is anonymous (refer to your full name rather than “I” or “we”). Avoid providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgements (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs) and in the supplemental material (e.g., titles in the movies, or attached papers). Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. Violation of any of these guidelines will lead to rejection without review.

 Aim and Scope of the Journal 
 Since 1999, the annualhref=""https://ches.iacr.org/"" - CHES conference
highlights new results in the design and analysis of cryptographic hardware and software implementations and builds a valuable bridge between the research and cryptographic engineering communities and attracts participants from industry, academia, and government organizations. Topics suitable for CHES include, but are not limited to cryptographic implementations, attacks against implementations and countermeasures, cryptographic tools and methodologies, cryptographic implementation issues and applications. To be considered for publication, they must provide an added value beyond prior work, such as novel insights or reasonably questioning previous assumptions.

The ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems is the premier international conference of Human-Computer Interaction. 
 CHI takes place in Yokohama, Japan, at thePACIFICO Yokohamafrom 26 April to 1 May 2025, while also supporting remote attendance. 
 The conference embraces the theme of Ikigai, a Japanese concept referring to what gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. In today’s world, people are facing a multitude of challenges in climate change, growing inequality, technological disruption, global conflict, and health crises. Ikigai concerns the ability of a person to find their purpose and balance their agency, their passion, their capabilities, and the impact they can have. The CHI community consists of people with many passions and talents, people from different disciplines and walks of life. In harnessing our ‘Ikigai’ into a communal ‘IkiCHI’ we can be greater than the sum of our efforts and offer unique contributions to solving the difficult challenges ahead. 
 The cherry blossom or ‘Sakura’ as depicted in the CHI’25 logo signifies a time of renewal and optimism. The conference takes place in the period of cherry blossom growth and in this environment of optimism and renewal, we wish you will find your IkiCHI.

The ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems is the premier international conference of Human-Computer Interaction. 
 CHI takes place in Yokohama, Japan, at thePACIFICO Yokohamafrom 26 April to 1 May 2025, while also supporting remote attendance. 
 The conference embraces the theme of Ikigai, a Japanese concept referring to what gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. In today’s world, people are facing a multitude of challenges in climate change, growing inequality, technological disruption, global conflict, and health crises. Ikigai concerns the ability of a person to find their purpose and balance their agency, their passion, their capabilities, and the impact they can have. The CHI community consists of people with many passions and talents, people from different disciplines and walks of life. In harnessing our ‘Ikigai’ into a communal ‘IkiCHI’ we can be greater than the sum of our efforts and offer unique contributions to solving the difficult challenges ahead. 
 The cherry blossom or ‘Sakura’ as depicted in the CHI’25 logo signifies a time of renewal and optimism. The conference takes place in the period of cherry blossom growth and in this environment of optimism and renewal, we wish you will find your IkiCHI.

 Open search barSearch for:Search for:SearchClose search barThe Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI PLAY) is the international and interdisciplinary conference (by ACM SIGCHI) for researchers and professionals across all areas of play, games and human-computer interaction (HCI). We call this area “player-computer interaction”. 
 October 13-16 2025 
 The goal of CHI PLAY is to highlight and foster discussion of current high quality research in games and HCI as foundation for the future of digital play. To this end, the conference features streams that blend academic research papers, masterclasses, interactive play demos, student game design competition, poster session and industry insights. 
 CHI PLAY grew out of the increasing work around games and play emerging from the ACM annual conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) as well as smaller conferences such as Fun and Games and Gamification. CHI PLAY is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group for Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI). All accepted submissions will be distributed in the CHI PLAY Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.

 Mission Statement and Topics 
 Automata theory is the foundation of computer science. Its applications have spread to almost all areas of computer science and many other disciplines. In addition, there is a growing number of software systems designed to manipulate automata, regular expressions, grammars, and related structures; examples include AGL, AMORE, Automate, FADELA, FinITE, FireLite, FLAP, FSM, Grail, INR, Intex, ASTL, MONA, and Turing's World. 
 The purpose of these conferences is to bring together members of the academic, research and industrial community who have an interest in implementation and application of automata to demonstrate and analyze their work and to explain the problems they have been solving.

 CIAC 2025: 14th International Conference on Algorithms and Complexity 
 LUISS Guido Carli 
 Rome, Italy, June 10-12, 2025 
  
 Submission link | href=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025"" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025 
 Submission deadline | November 22, 2024 
 Topics:href=""/cfp/topic.cgi?tid=10089"" - data structures
href=""/cfp/topic.cgi?tid=28344"" - algorithm design and analysis
href=""/cfp/topic.cgi?tid=9568"" - computational and structural complexity
The 14th International Symposium on Algorithms and Complexity (CIAC 2025) is scheduled to take place from June 3 to June 5, 2025, at LUISS University, Rome, Italy. 
 Important Dates 
 Deadline for submissions: November 22, 2024 (AoE) 
 Author notification: January 31, 2025 
 Camera-ready due: February 14, 2025 
 Submission Guidelines 
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper with at most 15 pages, excluding the title page and the references. The title page consists of the title of the paper and the abstract. The first section of the paper should start on the next page. 
 The usage of the LNCS style file is mandatory. No changes to font size, page geometry, etc. are permitted. Late submissions and submissions not in the correct format will not be considered. 
 Submissions will be through EasyChair (href=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025"" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025
) 
 The paper should contain a succinct statement of the issues and their motivation, a summary of the results, a brief explanation of their significance, and a comparison to related work, accessible to non-specialists. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be put into an appendix, to be read by the PC members at their discretion. 
 Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed. 
 At least one author of each accepted paper will have to register for the conference. For authors who cannot present their paper in person for a significant reason, the possibility of remote presentation may be offered. 
 Double-Blind Reviewing 
 CIAC 2025 will implement a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way; in particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. 
 The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would (e.g., making early drafts available on their webpage, or through pre-print dissemination websites such as arXiv). 
 When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members. 
 PC submissions 
 Submissions authored or co-authored by (non-chair) members of the program committee are allowed. 
 List of Topics 
 Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished research on algorithms and complexity. Typical areas include:

 Aim 
 Many complex computational tasks in the bio-medical disciplines (e.g., Bioinformatics, Bioengineering, Systems Biology, Synthetic Biology, and Computational Biology) can be reformulated in terms of optimization problems, that is, the identification of the global minima (or maxima) of a given function (or multiple functions) inside a multi-dimensional search space. In global optimization techniques, which denote the algorithms leveraged to solve such problems, the data structures used to represent thecandidate solutionscan sometimes bedirectly decodedandinterpreted. Consequently, the best-fitting individuals immediately provide an explicit andhuman-readabledescription of the optimal solution. The researchers, who mainly focused on the creation of novel strategies, often aim to propose solutions able to balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the optimization algorithms. 
 Although this well-established research line is very prolific—paving the way for the design of efficient algorithms, even for large-scale problems—there is another promising direction that should be investigated, consisting in theanalysis and modification of the fitness landscape, that is the hyper-surface induced by the evaluation of the objective function for each point of the search space. Indeed, the analysis of the fitness landscape might help in the choice of the optimization algorithm to use and the choice of the space transformations to use, such as dilate, shrink, stretch, collapse, smooth, or remap the fitness landscape, leading to alternative or simplified formulations of the original optimization problem. 
 In discrete domains, a similar approach can be performed by embedding implicitor explicit assumptionsinto the structure of the candidate solutions. In such a way, the genetic operators can explore the feasible search space in a “smarter” way, reducing the overall computational effort. Examples of this technique include generative representations, techniques based on grammar, single parent techniques where example genes are incorporated, and other structured representations that starkly limit the portion of the search domain examined. 
 This special session aims to gather the researchers investigating new directions and ideas in the field ofcandidate solution representations, its dual notion offitness landscape manipulationandits analysisto tackle complex tasks, especially problems related to Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. 
 Scope 
 This Special Session welcomes any paper considering allnon-conventional candidate solution representations, including the dual perspective offitness landscape manipulation, andits analysis. 
 Examples include but are not limited to: 
 Non-conventional representations of candidate solutions 
 Dilation functions and other functions that reshape the fitness landscape 
 Generative automata 
 Alternative semantics for candidate solutions 
 Fitness landscape modification, simplification, and restriction 
 Novel closed variation/evolutionary operators 
 Implicit/relative representations 
 Generative or developmental representations 
 Self-adaptive representations 
 Parameterized manifolds of representations 
 State-conditioned representations 
 Procedural representations 
 Surrogate models

 The 18th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM 2025) 
 Objectives 
 Digital and computational solutions are the prevalent means for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of mathematical information. Separate communities have developed to investigate and build computer based systems for automated deduction, computer algebra, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user interfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their integration can lead to synergies offering significant added value. The Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM) offers a venue for discussing and developing solutions to the great challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas. 
 The conference addresses research from these areas, and it usually adds workshops and a doctoral programme.

Today (22 January) marks the final day of this systems-focused conference, which emphasizes a systems architecture perspective and attracts practitioners from both academia and industry. Among the authors presenting their best systems research were Peter Boncz (leader of the DA group and general co-chair of CIDR) and Hannes Mühleisen (CWI & DuckDB Labs)*. 
 Peter BonczWorking with vast amounts of data 
 href=""https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2025/keynotes.html"" - Keynote speaker Thea Klaeboe Aarrestad
(ETH) discussed the immense challenges of managing the vast amounts of data produced by the CERN Large Hadron Collider, where researchers study high-energy proton collisions to uncover fundamental particles and forces in physics. These collisions generate 10,000 exabytes of raw data annually. To handle this enormous data flow, real-time event filtering systems process millions of collisions per second, equivalent to 5% of global internet traffic, combined with unprecedented complexity. 
 Maintaining data integrity for meaningful physics analyses requires highly optimized machine learning (ML) algorithms. Klaeboe Aarrestad explained how real-time ML techniques enhance data filtering and improve the acceptance of physics signals. 
 Thea Klaeboe AarrestadEnergy trade-offs 
 href=""https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2025/keynotes.html"" - Keynote speaker Christos Kozyrakis
(Stanford University) explored the limits of semiconductor technology and emerging trends in AI training and inference that are reshaping hardware architecture. He highlighted the energy trade-offs in compute and memory, offering insights into how AI systems and chips can also accelerate other data-intensive workloads and influence the development of future hardware technology. 
 Pushing boundaries 
 In addition to keynotes, the program included an evening programme, paper and demo presentations. CIDR values bold and innovative approaches to data management system architecture, real-world systems-building experience, insightful experimental studies, and provocative position papers. The conference fosters discussions around visionary ideas that push the boundaries of what is possible in data systems.

 Scope of the Workshop 
 The International Workshop on Computational Intelligence for Multimedia Understanding (IWCIM) is the annual workshop organized by the working group Multimedia Understanding through Semantics, Computation and Learning (MUSCLE) of the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM). This year, IWCIM takes place as a special session in IEEE ISCAS 2025, to be held in London on May 25 - 28, 2025. 
 Multimedia understanding is an essential part of many intelligent applications in our social life, be it in our households, or in commercial, industrial, service, and scientific environments. Analyzing raw data to provide them with semantics is essential to exploit their full potential and help us manage our everyday tasks. Nowadays raw data usually come from a host of different sensors and other sources, and are different in nature, format reliability and information content. Multimodal and cross-modal analysis are the only ways to use them at their best. Besides data analysis, this problem is also relevant to data description intended to help storage and mining. Interoperability and exchangeability of heterogeneous and distributed data is a need for any practical application. Semantics is information at the highest level, and inferring it from raw data (that is from information at the lowest level) entails exploiting both data and prior information to extract structure and meaning. Computation, machine learning, statistical and Bayesian methods are tools to achieve this goal at various levels. 
 The scope of IWCIM 2025 includes, but is not limited to the following topics: 
 Multisensor systems 
 Multimodal analysis 
 Crossmodal data analysis and clustering 
 Mixed-reality applications 
 Activity and object detection and recognition 
 Text and speech recognition 
 Multimedia labeling, semantic annotation and metadata 
 Multimodal indexing and searching in very large data-bases

 INTRODUCTION 
 ============= 
 CIT-2024 is the 23rd edition of the highly successful International Conference on Computer and Information Technology. The goal of the conference is to provide a forum for scientists, engineers and researchers to discuss and exchange novel ideas, results, experiences and work-in-process on all aspects of computer and information technology. CIT has become a major platform for researchers and industry practitioners from different fields of computer and information technology. Each year, CIT attendees appreciate and benefit from multidisciplinary exchanges in computer and information technology. In previous years, CIT has attracted many high quality research papers spanning over the various aspects of information technology, computing science and computer engineering. These papers highlight foundational work that strives to push beyond limits of existing computer technologies, including experimental efforts, innovative systems, and investigations that identify weaknesses in existing IT services. 
 CIT-2024 is planned to be hosted in Chengdu, China, the capital of southwestern China's Sichuan province. The city is also home to the famous Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, a conservation center where visitors can view endangered giant pandas in a natural habitat. All accepted papers are expected to be included in IEEE Xplore and will be indexed by Engineering Index (EI). The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.

 View PDFHTML (experimental)Abstract:mdx II is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud platform designed to accelerate data science research and foster cross-disciplinary collaborations among universities and research institutions in Japan. Unlike traditional high-performance computing systems, mdx II leverages OpenStack to provide customizable and isolated computing environments consisting of virtual machines, virtual networks, and advanced storage. This paper presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of mdx II, including a comparison to Amazon Web Services (AWS). We evaluated the performance of a 16-vCPU VM from multiple aspects including floating-point computing performance, memory throughput, network throughput, file system and object storage performance, and real-world application performance. Compared to an AWS 16-vCPU instance, the results indicated that mdx II outperforms AWS in many aspects and demonstrated that mdx II holds significant promise for high-performance data analytics (HPDA) workloads. We also evaluated the virtualization overhead using a 224-vCPU VM occupying an entire host. The results suggested that the virtualization overhead is minimal for compute-intensive benchmarks, while memory-intensive benchmarks experienced larger overheads. These findings are expected to help users of mdx II to obtain high performance for their data science workloads and offer insights to the designers of future data-centric cloud platforms.
