  "callForPapers": "# Call for Papers\n\nThe 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) invites submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy. Theoretical papers must demonstrate the relevance of their results to practice. Authors should write the abstract and introduction to be accessible to a general computer-security researcher.\n\nCCS has two review cycles in 2025. Decisions include:\n\n1.  **Accept:** Accepted for publication and presentation.\n2.  **Minor revision:** Requires minor improvements before potential acceptance.\n3.  **Reject:** Declined for inclusion.\n\nAuthors of accepted papers must register for the conference and present their work in person if possible.\n\n## Paper Submission Information\n\n*   All submissions must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the deadline.\n*   Submissions must not overlap with previously published or concurrently submitted work.\n*   All submissions should be properly anonymized.\n*   Authors may submit a maximum of 7 papers for Cycle B.\n*   Papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. In the unusual case in which a third-person reference is infeasible, authors can blind the reference itself. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.\n\n*   Authors submitting 3 papers or more may be required to submit reviews for other papers at CCS 2025. Authors who fall into this category will be requested to provide information for review matching and complete an attestation for reviewing ethics.\n*   Authors failing to provide the requested information may see their paper desk-rejected.\n*   It is expected that reviewers will submit fair and thoughtful reviews on time. Reviews that do not meet this standard, such as exceptionally short reviews, reviews generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), reviews not relevant to the paper or that miss a substantial portion of the paper will be flagged and may be grounds for desk rejection of the reviewer’s papers at the discretion of the PC chairs.\n\n*   A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper can not be withdrawn.\n\n## Paper Format\n\n*   Submissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format using \"sigconf\" 2-column format, no more than 12 pages long, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material.\n*   Authors should not change the font or the margins of the ACM format. The CCS information such as concepts, keywords, or rights management information (e.g., DOI and ISBN) must be retained.\n*   The teaser figure is optional.\n*   Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.\n\n## Providing Artifacts at Submission Time\n\n*   Submissions whose claimed contributions rely on artifacts (e.g., code, models, data sets) are expected to make these accessible to the reviewers, unless there are good reasons not to, in which case these reasons must be mentioned in the submission. Submissions whose claimed contributions do not rely on artifacts do not need to submit artifacts.\n*   An anonymous link to a resource on the web is acceptable, provided the contents in the resource are also anonymized.\n\n## Optional Artifact Evaluation\n\nACM CCS will, for the second time, introduce an optional artifact evaluation (AE) process. All authors of accepted papers (including shepherd approved and minor revisions) are encouraged to submit artifacts for AE.\n\n## Conference Tracks\n\nThe ACM CCS Conference features a multi-track format. Authors must select one track during submission.\n\n### Program Co-Chairs\n*   [✉️ccs25-pc-chairs@acm.org](mailto:ccs25-pc-chairs@acm.org)\n    *   David Lie (University of Toronto)\n    *   Véronique Cortier (CNRS, Loria)\n\n### Track Chairs\n\n*   **Software Security**: [✉️ccs25-software-track@acm.org](mailto:ccs25-software-track@acm.org)\n    *   Alexandra Dmitrienko (Würzburg University)\n    *   Yinqian Zhang (Southern University of Science and Technology)\n*   **Web Security**: [✉️ccs25-web-track@acm.org](mailto:ccs25-web-track@acm.org)\n    *   Yinzhi Cao (Johns Hopkins University)\n*   **Network Security**: [✉️ccs25-netsec-track@acm.org](mailto:ccs25-netsec-track@acm.org)\n    *   Kun Sun (George Mason University)\n*   **Security Usability and Measurement**: [✉️ccs25-usablesec-track@acm.org](mailto:ccs25-usablesec-track@acm.org)\n    *   Emiliano De Cristofaro (University of California, Riverside)\n    *   Yixin Zou (Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy)\n*   **Machine Learning and Security**: [✉️ccs25-mlsec-track@acm.org](mailto:ccs25-mlsec-track@acm.org)\n    *   Neil Gong (Duke University)\n    *   Elissa Redmiles (Georgetown University)\n    *   Ben Y.
