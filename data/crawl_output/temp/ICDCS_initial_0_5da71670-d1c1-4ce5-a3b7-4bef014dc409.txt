 Welcome to IEEE ICDCS 2025 
 The 45th IEEE ICDCS 2025 will be held in person, and we are looking forward to seeing you in Glasgow, Scotland! 
 The annual IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS) is a premier international forum for researchers, developers and users to present, discuss and exchange the cutting edge ideas and latest findings on topics related to any aspects of Distributed Computing Systems. ICDCS 2025 is held in the vibrant and compact city of Glasgow, Scotland. 
 The 45th IEEE ICDCS 2025 will run from July 20-23, 2025, culminating with our prestigious grand finalehref="https://icdcs2025.icdcs.org/social-events/" - Civic Reception and Closing Ceremony on 23rd of July
at the historic City Chambers. We strongly encourage all delegates to attend the full conference to maximize networking opportunities, gain comprehensive insights into distributed computing advances, and experience Glasgow's renowned hospitality through our carefully curated social events. 
 Don't forget our Clydeside Distillery Tour on both pre-conference (July 19) and post-conference (July 24) dates. 
 IEEE Glasgow Tartan 
 Here's a neat fact: IEEE has its very own tartan! Thehref="https://icdcs2025.icdcs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IEEE-tartan-poster.pdf" - IEEE Glasgow Tartan
came to life in 2019 as a special way to celebrate Glasgow's fantastic 30-year track record of hosting IEEE conferences. This tartan, representing the whole IEEE 'family', was made in Scotland using traditional methods. It cleverly combinesIEEE's bluefor knowledge and integrity, andwhitefor safety and purity — with the colors of the Scottish flag.
