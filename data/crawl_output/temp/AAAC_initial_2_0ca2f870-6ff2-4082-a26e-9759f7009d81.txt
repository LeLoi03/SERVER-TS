 AAAC 2025 Call for Papers 
 AAAC 2025 
 The 16th Annual Meeting of Asian Association for Algorithms and Computation (http://www.aa-ac.org/) will take place on May 31 and June 1, 2025, at the City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. We invite submissions of abstracts presenting original research or surveys of existing results in theoretical computer science. The meeting is a face-to-face event, and at least one author of each submission is expected to register and give the talk at the venue. 
 Topics 
 All areas of theoretical computer science, especially design and analysis of algorithms and complexity theory. 
 Submissions 
 Authors are invited to submit one-page (A4) abstracts (in pdf format) that can be based on original results or surveys of existing results of authors. Informal working notes including the one-page abstracts will be distributed at the meeting, which does not prevent any form of future publication of the same work. All submissions should be made electronically through the EasyChair Conference System:

. 
 Important Dates 
 Submission due: February 28 (Fri), 2025 (AoE) 
 Notification: March 28 (Fri), 2025 
 Camera-ready version due: April 18 (Fri), 2025 
 Early Registration due: April 25 (Fri), 2025 
 Conference Dates: May 31(Sat)- June 1(Sun), 2025 
 Best Student Presentation Award 
 The Best Student Presentation will be awarded. A paper presentation is eligible for the Best Student Presentation if the author who presents the paper is a full-time student. Best student presentation award will be selected at the meeting by AAAC board members.
