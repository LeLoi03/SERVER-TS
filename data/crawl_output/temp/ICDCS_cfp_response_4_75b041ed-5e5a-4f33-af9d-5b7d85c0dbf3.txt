  "callForPapers": "# Call for Papers\n\n## Scope\nThe 45th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (IEEE ICDCS 2025) is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners to present, discuss, and exchange cutting-edge ideas and the latest findings on topics related to all aspects of distributed computing systems. The conference will be held from July 20-23, 2025, in Glasgow, Scotland, UK. We invite you to submit original contributions to IEEE ICDCS 2025.\n\n## Topics of Interest\nPapers can be submitted to one of the following tracks:\n\n-   Cloud Computing\n-   Distributed Algorithms\n-   Big Data, Models & Systems\n-   Distributed Fault Tolerance\n-   Distributed OS and Middleware\n-   Edge Computing\n-   IoT + CPS\n-   Mobile Computing\n-   Security, Privacy and Trust\n-   Blockchains/Databases\n-   Distributed Systems for AI/ML\n-   AI/ML for Distributed Systems\n-   Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures\n\n## Paper Submission\nThe Paper strand provides the opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.\n\nPapers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. All paper submissions should follow the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template (downloadable by selecting “Conferences” in the IEEE-Template Selector [https://template-selector.ieee.org/](https://template-selector.ieee.org/)). Each submission can have up to eleven (11) pages (including figures, tables, appendices, and references). Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review.\n\nThe paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content. To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymised GitHub repository with all source code, scripts, and data needed for the reproduction of their results.\n\nFor each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference in-person to present their work on-site. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.\n\nNote that the authors should adhere to ethic and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer to [IEEE Code of Ethics](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/#ai-generated-text) and [IEEE Policy of AI-Generated Text](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/#ai-generated-text).\n\nNote: A set of highly selected IEEE ICDCS 2025 papers will be considered for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS). The selected papers will undergo an extension process, transforming them from their initial IEEE ICDCS conference format. These extended versions will then be subject to a review by an editor from IEEE TPDS.\n\n## Important Dates (Time zone: Anywhere on Earth (AoE))\n\n1.  Paper Abstract Registration: **December 4, 2024** (Extended to **December 11, 2024**)\n2.  Paper Submission Due: **December 11, 2024** (Extended to **December 18, 2024**)\n3.  Author Notification: **April 2, 2025**\n4.  Camera-Ready Submission: **April 16, 2025**\n\n## Submission\n\n*   Paper Submission Website: [https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Feasychair.org%2Fconferences%2F%3Fconf%3Dicdcs2025&data=05%7C02%7CChristos.Anagnostopoulos%40glasgow.ac.uk%7C6772c2b874c4403e9f2b08dcc354d5c2%7C6e725c29763a4f5081f22e254f0133c8%7C1%7C0%7C638600016320696355%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=NIhmRmg1GRSGaXJDn%2BKBvS%2FUOy17Qwi9zPNQP1p1jVg%3D&reserved=0](https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Feasychair.org%2Fconferences%2F%3Fconf%3Dicdcs2025&data=05%7C02%7CChristos.Anagnostopoulos%40glasgow.ac.uk%7C6772c2b874c4403e9f2b08dcc354d5c2%7C6e725c29763a4f5081f22e254f0133c8%7C1%7C0%7C638600016320696355%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=NIhmRmg1GRSGaXJDn%2BKBvS%2FUOy17Qwi9zPNQP1p1jVg%3D&reserved=0) (Submission portal opens on 1 November 2024)\n\n## Contact Information\n\nFor inquiries regarding the Call for Papers, email: [icdcs2025@easychair.org](mailto:icdcs2025@easychair.org)\n",
