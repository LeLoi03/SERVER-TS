About the Conference 
 SCA is the premier forum for presenting innovations on the theory, software, and technology of computer animation. The conference is a focused and intimate gathering of researchers and practitioners working on all aspects of time-based phenomena. Its single track program features paper sessions, poster presentations, panel discussions, and keynote talks. Plus its emphasis on community interaction makes SCA the best venue to exchange research results, get inspired, and initiate collaborations. 
 We invite submissions of original, high-quality papers on computer animation, broadlydefined as computation dealing with time-varying phenomena. Papers will be submitted to theProceedings of the ACM in Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques(PACMCGIT) journal and undergo two rounds of review. Accepted papers will appear in the PACMCGIT issue on SCA 2025, and authors of accepted papers will present their work at the conference. 
 Topics of Interest 
 We invite original work on a broad range of topics, including but not limited to: 
 2D, 3D, and N-D animation systems 
 Autonomous agents 
 Clothing animation and simulation 
 Computational design of animated systems 
 Expressive motion / communication 
 Generative and morphable models 
 3D and 4D motion modeling 
 Learned character control 
 Facial animation 
 Feature learning of motions, faces, body shapes and hand gestures 
 Foundation models for animation 
 Group and crowd behavior 
 Interactive computer graphics 
 Intuitive interfaces for creating and editing animations 
 Mathematical foundations of animation 
 Methods of control and artistic direction of simulations 
 Machine learning techniques for animation 
 Multimodal techniques for animation 
 Modeling and simulation of natural phenomena 
 Nature in motion (natural phenomena, plants, clouds, etc.) 
 New time-based art forms on the computer 
 Novel time-varying phenomena 
 Perceptual metrics of animation 
 Physical realism / measuring the real world for animation 
 Physical simulation 
 Fluid animation and simulation 
 Planning / learning / optimization for animation 
 Real-time and interactive methods 
 Camera control methods for computer animation 
 Sound and speech for animation 
 ... as well as related problems in robotics game development, human-computer interaction, simulation visualization, and computer vision. SCA welcomes all kinds of contributions that advance the field of computer animation. This includes new and improved algorithms, but also: 
 New datasets, or carefully and thoughtfully designed (collections of) datasets based on previously available data 
 Advanced practices in data collection and curation 
 Benchmarks and benchmarking tools 
 Perceptual studies 
 Experimental studies 
 Material measurements 
 Systems 
 Hardware 
 Theoretical foundations 
 New promising approaches that do not yet achieve state-of-the-art performance 
 Technical Papers 
 We invite you to submit high-quality work on animation and simulation broadly defined as computation dealing with time-varying phenomena. Each submission will be reviewed by an international program committee for technical quality, novelty, significance, and clarity. 
 Papers should be written and presented in English. There is no strict maximum length for submitted papers. However, we recommend that research papers be up to16 pages(excluding references), and longer papers should make a very significant contribution. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content. A paper submission should describe an original work of the authors. Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources. Optional supplemental material does not count towards this suggested limit. 
 Supplementary material such as videos may also be submitted electronically and will be made available to reviewers (size up to 500MB). Videos are required for techniques involving motion or animation. 
 Submitted articles will receive two rounds of reviewing by at least three (3) expert reviewers. Technical papers conditionally accepted in the first round will undergo a second round of revision and review and, conditional on final acceptance, will be published in thePACMCGITissue on SCA 2025. There is no rebuttal process. 
 Papers can be submitted via thehref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sca2025" - EasyChair
website. 
 Paper Format 
 Research papers should be inhref="https://www.siggraph.org/preparing-your-content/author-instructions/" - ACM article format
using theACM small trimjournal size (“acmsmall”). For the review version, please use the command:\documentclass[acmsmall, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart} 
 Anonymous Submissions 
 Paper submissions must be anonymous and include the unique paper ID that will be assigned upon creating a submission using the online system. The review process isdouble-anonymous, so please remove all personal data, such as author names and affiliation from all your submission files. 
 Papers should not have previously appeared in, or be currently submitted to, any other conference or journal. SCA follows the samehref="https://s2025.siggraph.org/anonymity-policy/" - anonymity policy as SIGGRAPH
. Any case of violation will be determined by the chairs and could result in a desk rejection. 
 Awards 
 Best Paper Awards will be given to exceptional submissions on the cutting edge of computer animation. 
 Presentations 
 The author(s) of accepted papers must also attend the conference and present their work in-person. At least one (1) author from each accepted paper must register for the conference.
