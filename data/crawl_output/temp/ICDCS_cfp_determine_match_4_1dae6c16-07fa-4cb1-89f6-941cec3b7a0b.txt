Call for Papers 
 ScopeThe 45thIEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (IEEE ICDCS 2025) is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners to present, discuss and exchange cutting edge ideas as well as the latest findings on topics related to all aspects of distributed computing systems. The conference will be held over July 20-23rd, 2025 in Glasgow, Scotland, UK. We invite you to submit original contributions to IEEE ICDCS 2025. 
 Papers can be submitted to one of the following tracks: 
 Cloud Computing 
 Distributed Algorithms 
 Big Data, Models & Systems 
 Distributed Fault Tolerance 
 Distributed OS and Middleware 
 Edge Computing 
 IoT + CPS 
 Mobile Computing 
 Security, Privacy and Trust 
 Blockchains/Databases 
 Distributed Systems for AI/ML 
 AI/ML for Distributed Systems 
 Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures 
 Paper SubmissionThePaper strand providesthe opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field. 
 Papers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. All paper submissions should follow the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template (downloadable by selecting “Conferences” in the IEEE-Template Selectorhttps://template-selector.ieee.org/). Each submission can haveup to eleven (11) pages(including figures, tables, appendices, and references). Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review. 
 The paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content. To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymised GitHub repository with all source code, scripts and data needed for the reproduction of their results. 
 For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference in-person to present their work on-site. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper. 
 Note that the authors should adhere to ethic and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer toIEEE Code of Ethicsandhref="https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/#ai-generated-text" - IEEE Policy of AI-Generated Text.
Note: A set of highly selected IEEE ICDCS 2025 papers will be considered for publication in theIEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS). The selected papers will undergo an extension process, transforming them from their initial IEEE ICDCS conference format. These extended versions will then be subject to a review by an editor from IEEE TPDS.
