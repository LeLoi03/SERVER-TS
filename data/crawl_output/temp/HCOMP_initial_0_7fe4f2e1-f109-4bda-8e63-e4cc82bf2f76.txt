Welcome to HCOMP 2024! 
 The 12th AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2024) will be held October 16-19th in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and will particularly focus on the theme of ''Responsible Crowd Work for Better AI.'' 
 HCOMP is the premier venue for disseminating the latest research findings on human computation and crowdsourcing. While artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) represent traditional mainstays of the conference, HCOMP believes strongly in fostering and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research. Our field is particularly unique in the diversity of disciplines it draws upon and contributes to including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. We promote the exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing not only among researchers but also engineers and practitioners to encourage dialogue across disciplines and communities of practice. 
 HCOMP 2024 is colocated withACM UIST 2024(October 13-16, 2024). 
 HCOMP 2024 builds on a successful history ofpast meetings: eleven HCOMP conferences (2013–2023) and four earlier workshops, held at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2011–2012), and the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (2009–2010).
