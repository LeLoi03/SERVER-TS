 The 12th AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2024) was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from October 16-19, 2024. HCOMP 2024 focused on focused on the theme of “Responsible Crowd Work for Better AI” and was colocated with ACM UIST 2024. 
 HCOMP serves as an invaluable platform and believes in fostering and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research in human computation and crowdsourcing. Though artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) have been conventional cornerstones of the conference, HCOMP draws upon and contributes to various fields including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence, economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. It unites a diverse community of researchers, engineers, and practitioners, encouraging collaborative progress and innovation in this evolving discipline.
