 SCA 2025 
 The 24th annual Symposium on Computer Animation (SCA) will take place in Vancouver, Canada, from August 8 to August 10, 2025. 
 SCA is the premier forum for innovations in the software and technology of computer animation. It unites researchers and practitioners working on all aspects of time-based phenomena. Our focused, intimate gathering, with a single track program and emphasis on community interaction, makes SCA the best venue to exchange research results, get inspired, and set up collaborations. 
 We invite submission of original, high-quality papers and posters on computer animation, broadly defined as computation dealing with time-varying phenomena. Accepted full papers will be published in the journalProceedings of the ACM in Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques (PACMCGIT). Best Paper Awards will be given to excellent submissions that push the leading edge. Please refer to ourhref="instructions.html" - call-for-paper
page for paper submission information.
