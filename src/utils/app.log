  The 30th International Symposium on Artificial Life and Robotics (AROB 30th 2025) will be held in Beppu, Japan, and online from January 22-24, 2025. This symposium aims to bring together researchers to discuss new technologies and developments in artificial life and robotics, based on computer simulations and hardware designs. The symposium will explore the applications of these technologies in fields such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and computer science.
  AROB 30th 2025 invites submissions presenting original research and discussions on the development of new technologies in artificial life and robotics. Key details include:
  *   **Abstract Submission Deadline:** October 28, 2024 (24:00 UTC)
  *   **OS Proposal Deadline:** October 21, 2024 (24:00 UTC)
  *   **Topics of Interest:** A wide range of topics are welcomed, including adaptation, agent-based modeling, artificial intelligence, bio-inspired robotics, brain science, cognitive science, data mining, evolutionary computations, machine learning, molecular biology, neural networks, quantum computing, robot vision, swarm intelligence, and more.
  *   **Publication:** Accepted papers will be published in the Proceedings of the AROB. Extended versions of selected papers will be published in the International Journal of "Artificial Life and Robotics" (Springer Japan).
  *   **Journal Track:** Authors have the opportunity to publish a full paper in a peer-reviewed journal and present the same paper at AROB 30th 2025. Full paper submission deadline for the journal track is August 31, 2024.
  *   **In-person Participation:** If the symposium paper is accepted, in-person participation and presentation are required.
