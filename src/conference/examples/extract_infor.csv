 Home Authors  Reviewers Attendees Committee Archive   

 Call for participation  

 We warmly invite you to submit a research or practitioner paper to the 27th annual Australasian Computing Education Conference (ACE'2025). ACE is a high-quality international conference, run in-cooperation with SIGCSE, that provides a forum for educators and researchers to share innovations and insights in computing education.  
 ACE2025 will run in parallel with several other events as part of Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW), held 10th - 14th February, 2025 at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.  
 In addition to publishing research from leading computing education researchers, the ACE community is very welcoming and supportive of researchers who are new to computing education research, and practitioners who wish to discuss and develop good computing education practice. Topics of interest for the conference include, but are not limited to:  
  
 the use of technology in computing education; 
  course content; 
  curriculum structure; 
  methods of assessment and evaluation; 
  pedagogy and learning theories; 
  mobile, flexible, online learning, and 
  valuations of alternative approaches 
   
 The Program Committee will select the papers to appear based on their potential to enhance learning outcomes in computing courses. Both research papers and practitioner papers must be between 5 and 10 pages in length (inclusive of any references). To illustrate the variety of work presented at ACE, you may wish to view recent conference proceedings which are available on the ACM Digital Library:

 SUBMISSIONS   
 Submissions should be made via EasyChair at href=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acsw2025"" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acsw2025
. Note: When starting a submission, you will need to begin by selecting a track. Be sure to select Australasian Computing Education Conference 2025.  
 Submissions should be in two-column format (i.e. use ""sigconf"" style in the documentclass for Latex) and should use the ACM SIG Proceedings template (available in Latex and Word). Submissions should be made to EasyChair in PDF format:  
  
 LaTeX template 
  href=""https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word"" - MS Word template 
   
 RESEARCH PAPERS   
 Papers on research and innovations may be in the context of formal courses or self-directed learning; they may involve, for example, introductory programming, service courses, capstone courses, specialist undergraduate or postgraduate topics, or industry-related short courses. We welcome submissions directed at issues of current and local importance, as well as topics of international interest. Such topics may include the transition from school to university, articulation between vocational and university education, quality management in teaching, teaching people from other cultures, globalisation, attracting and retaining female students, online, mobile and blended learning. Research papers would typically describe research questions, and address these through the careful presentation of methods, results, and limitations, while clearly stating the contribution of the work.  
 PRACTITIONER PAPERS   
 In addition to research papers, ACE provides the opportunity for teachers to demonstrate new educational tools, and to share interesting teaching resources, assignments, and techniques that may be of broad interest to the community. We encourage the submission of papers that present interesting ways to teach challenging concepts, engaging activities that promote student learning, and compelling assignments. Practitioner papers would typically describe a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use, and present a rich reflection on how it worked in practice.  
 REVIEW PROCESS   
 All research and practitioner papers will be fully refereed, using a double-blind reviewing process, by a minimum of three members of the Program Committee.  
 PUBLICATION COST   
 As the proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library, all authors need to be aware of the new cost structure for ICPS conferences (which include ACE). The basic cost of publication used to be borne by the conference, with authors able to pay extra to have a paper made open access, but now the full cost has reverted to the authors – unless they work in an institution that is a member of the ACM Open program or in a country classified as low-income. Note that this fee is to be paid only once for each paper, not each author.  
 Please look carefully at the guidance ( href=""https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance"" - https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance
) to determine whether you will be required to pay the publishing cost, and if so, how much. It ranges from $US350 to $US1000. Please note that any cost must be paid 45 days before the start of the conference and that there are serious consequences for non-payment. Given the potential for delays and absences over the holiday period, please ensure that payments are made no later than 28 December 2024. We can confirm that most Australian universities are members of ACM Open, but we have not checked the situation for each submission.  
 CHAIRS   
 To contact the chairs, please use the conference EasyChair email address: href=""mailto:ACE_2025@easychair.org"" - ace_2025@easychair.org

 Guidelines for authors  

 Papers must be in English and must be original contributions that have not been published previously, nor submitted to other conferences or journals in parallel with this conference.  
 Papers must be between 5 and 10 pages long (inclusive of any references). Papers are required to conform to the formatting guidelines of the ACM Conference paper guides. Authors should use the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) – SIG Proceedings Template:  
  
 LaTeX template 
  MS Word template 
   
 If you are using Latex, use the “sigconf” style in documentclass (which is the default if you create a project using the LaTeX link above). Page length includes references. The accepted format for submissions is Portable Document Format (PDF). Microsoft Word and LaTeX template files are available at the website link above. We recommend using the LaTeX template where possible, but if you choose to use MS Word, then please use the Interim Template listed on the ACM conference proceedings page listed above.  
 By submitting to the conference, authors accept that they are aware of the Guidelines on Research Practice in Computer Science by the Computer Research and Education Association (CORE). In particular, authors are encouraged to review the points on authorship.  
 Please review the Guidelines for authors on this site, before submitting.  
 Double-blind reviewing requirements:  It is standard practice that identities of reviewers are not made known to authors. The double-blind review process extends this principle so that reviewers do not know the identity of authors. This process requires authors to refrain from identifying themselves in their own paper. Below are some guidelines for anonymising your paper.  
  
 If you are using the ACM template correctly, you can tell it to create an anonymous version of the pdf; this will take care of explicit mentions of the author names. 
  If you are not yet using the template (you should be!), in place of the usual author and address details, put “Author details suppressed” or something equivalent. Where there are more than three authors contributing to a paper, limit the number of author spaces to three in the anonymised version. 
  Refrain from references to your university or campus by name. If you feel that a description of your university is in some way salient to the paper, use generalities. For example, use ""our University"" instead of ""Maintown University of Technology"". 
  Avoid expressions like “In earlier work we …” followed by a citation of a paper authored by yourself. 
  If you have an acknowledgements section, omit it for the blind submission. 
  Do not link to webpages in your anonymised paper. 
  Once you have a pdf copy of your paper, see how well it is blinded. Some PDF creation software includes document properties such as the author name or institution. Some operating systems will show such document properties when the cursor hovers over the file name. Be especially careful to disguise or remove these properties. 
   
 In general, apply good judgement when preparing your submission, to maintain the integrity of the double-blind process. Submissions that allow the author to be identified may be returned to you for editing at short notice, or may be rejected outright.  
 Registration for ACSW:  At least one author of an accepted paper must register to attend ACSW. When submitting a paper, you will be asked to nominate who will be attending ACE and presenting the paper if it is accepted. Papers not presented at ACE will be withdrawn from the proceedings. Please see the ACSW site for registration.

 ACHI 2025: Call for Papers   
 Onsite and Online Options: In order to accommodate various situations, we are offering the option for either physical presence or virtual participation (pdf slides or pre-recorded videos).   
 The Eighteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interaction, ACHI 2025  , was proposed as a result of a paradigm shift in the most recent achievements and future trends in human interactions with increasingly complex systems. Adaptive and knowledge-based user interfaces, universal accessibility, human-robot interaction, agent-driven human computer interaction, and sharable mobile devices are a few of these trends. ACHI 2025  also brings a suite of specific domain applications, such as gaming, e-learning, social, medicine, teleconferencing and engineering.  
 ACHI 2025 continues  a series of events targeting traditional and advanced paradigms for computer-human interaction in multi-technology environments. The conference covers also fundamentals on interfaces and models, and highlights new challenging industrial applications and research topics.  
 We solicit both academic, research, and industrial contributions. We welcome technical papers presenting research and practical results, position papers addressing the pros and cons of specific proposals, such as those being discussed in the standard fora or in industry consortia, survey papers addressing the key problems and solutions on any of the above topics short papers on work in progress, and panel proposals.  
 Industrial presentations are not subject to the format and content constraints of regular submissions. We expect short and long presentations that express industrial position and status.  
 Tutorials on specific related topics and panels on challenging areas are encouraged.  
 The topics suggested by the conference can be discussed in term of concepts, state of the art, research, standards, implementations, running experiments, applications, and industrial case studies. Authors are invited to submit complete unpublished papers, which are not under review in any other conference or journal in the following, but not limited to, topic areas.  
  
 All topics and submission formats are open to both research and industry contributions.

 Overview  
 ACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. ACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and by the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.  
 Papers submitted to ACL 2025, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics.  
 Paper Submission Information  
 Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2025 February cycle. Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2025 February cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to ACL 2025 via the conference commitment site (TBA).  
 Submission Topics  
 ACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas (in alphabetical order):  
 Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics 
  Dialogue and Interactive Systems 
  Discourse and Pragmatics 
  Efficient/Low-Resource Methods for NLP 
  Ethics, Bias, and Fairness 
  Generation 
  Human-Centered NLP 
  Information Extraction 
  Information Retrieval and Text Mining 
  Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP 
  Language Modeling

  Special Theme | : Generalization of NLP Models 
  ACL 2025 Theme Track: Generalization of NLP Models  
 Following the success of the ACL 2020-2024 Theme tracks, we are happy to announce that ACL 2025 will have a new theme with the goal of reflecting and stimulating discussion about the current state of development of the field of NLP.  
 Generalization is crucial for ensuring that models behave robustly, reliably, and fairly when making predictions on data different from their training data. Achieving good generalization is critically important for models used in real-world applications, as they should emulate human-like behavior. Humans are known for their ability to generalize well, and models should aspire to this standard.  
 The theme track invites empirical and theoretical research and position and survey papers reflecting on the Generalization of NLP Models. The possible topics of discussion include (but are not limited to) the following:  
 How can we enhance the generalization of NLP models across various dimensions—compositional, structural, cross-task, cross-lingual, cross-domain, and robustness? 
  What factors affect the generalization of NLP models? 
  What are the most effective methods for evaluating the generalization capabilities of NLP models? 
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhance the generalization of NLP models, what are the key limitations of LLMs in this regard? 
  The theme track submissions can be either long or short. We anticipate having a special session for this theme at the conference and a Thematic Paper Award in addition to other categories of awards.  
 Two-Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to ACL 2025  
 ACL 2025 will use href=""https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp"" - ACL Rolling Review
(ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the Open Review platform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:  
 Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors; 
  Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., ACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews. 
  ACL 2025 has chosen this approach in coordination with *CL 2024 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, after a paper has been fully reviewed, authors have the option to commit their paper to a conference or revise and resubmit for another round of reviews.  
 The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers, and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.  
 Mandatory Reviewing Workload  
 As the pace of research in the field continues to increase, we need to strengthen the commitment to reviewing for each paper submission. During the ARR submission process, authors will be required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing in this reviewing cycle. Please see the new ARR policy regarding reviewing workload here. As this is an ARR-wide policy for all *CL conferences, questions or clarifications should be addressed to ARR directly.

, there is no anonymity period requirement.   
 At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., ACL 2025). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected ACL 2025 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to ACL 2025 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than ACL 2025 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to ACL 2025.  
 Presentation at the Conference  
 All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline may be subject to desk rejection. Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.

 ACII 2025  

 The ACII 2025 organising committee is delighted to bring the ACII conference series to Australia for the first time. ACII 2025 will be an in-person event  held at the Hotel Realm conference venue in Canberra, Australia.   
 The ACII conference series – organized by the Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing ( AAAC , formerly known as Humaine) – is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognise, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena.  
 The theme for ACII 2025 is Socially Responsible Affective Computing   .  
 The main conference days will be on 8-10 Oct 2025, while workshops and tutorials will be held on Saturday, 11 Oct 2025. This ‘reverse’ conference schedule for  ACII 2025 will allow for maximum flexibility for attendees who also want to attend the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (  href=""https://icmi.acm.org/2025/"" - ICMI 2025
, 13-17 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling to combine two excellent conferences in one trip. While the organising committees of ACII 2025 and ICMI 2025 are separate, the teams work closely together and investigate registration options that will allow for different combinations of attending the two conferences for those who cannot attend both conferences in full. Further details will be provided in due time. (Sunday, 12 Oct 2025 will be a rest and recovery day for those attending both conferences.)

 Call for Papers  
   
 Call for Papers   
 The Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC) invites you to submit your original research for presentation at the 13th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), which will be held as an in-person event  in Canberra, Australia, 8-11 October 2025. Accepted papers must be presented by one of the paper’s authors.    
 ACII 2025 will be held just before the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction ( href=""https://icmi.acm.org/2025/"" - ICMI 2025
, 13-17 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling the attendees to combine two excellent conferences in one trip.   
 The ACII conference series is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognise, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena. All accepted papers will be included in IEEE Xplore (subject to approval by the IEEE Computer Society) and indexed by EI. A selection of the best articles at ACII 2025 will be invited to submit extended versions to the IEEE   Transactions on Affective Computing   .   
 The theme for ACII 2025 is Socially Responsible Affective Computing  . Affective computing, with its ability to recognise and respond to human emotions, holds great potential for enhancing user experiences and fostering more natural interactions between humans and machines. It also has promising applications in fields such as mental health, where this technology can assist psychologists and other clinicians in making more accurate diagnoses by detecting mental states. However, this powerful technology also raises significant ethical concerns that must be addressed to ensure its responsible and transparent use.   
 One of the primary challenges is the potential misuse or exploitation of sensitive emotional data, including for manipulative or discriminatory purposes. Ensuring robust data privacy, clear ethical guidelines, and regulations around the use of emotional data is crucial. Additionally, the lack of transparency of many affective computing algorithms, systems build on limited data, and the potential for biases in emotion inference systems pose risks of perpetuating harmful stereotypes or inaccurate assessments based on factors such as gender, race, or cultural background. Transparency, accountability, and mitigating biases in these systems are essential to build trust with users.   
 Recognising these concerns, regulatory efforts such as the EU AI Act aim to establish legal frameworks and stringent requirements for high-risk AI applications, including those related to emotional state detection, ultimately safeguarding individual rights and upholding ethical principles in the development and deployment of affective computing technologies. A stronger focus needs to be placed on these matters by the affective computing research community.   
 The ACII 2025 (8-11 Oct 2025) and ICMI 2025 (13-17 Oct 2025) conferences will be held in back-to-back mode at the same venue in Canberra, Australia – one trip, two great conferences!

  Submission Guidelines  
 All papers for ACM WiSec 2025 must be submitted electronically through the HotCRP conference management system.  
 First Cycle: | href=""https://wisec25.hotcrp.com/"" - HotCRP submission site for Cycle 1 
  Second Cycle: | href=""https://wisec25-cycle2.hotcrp.com"" - HotCRP submission site for Cycle 2 
  Only PDF files will be accepted. Submissions must be prepared using the following ACM proceedings template and must use US Letter page size (215.9 x 279.4 mm / 8.5 x 11 inches):  
 The ACM proceedings template for LaTeX can be found at | Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - SIG Proceedings Template | . 
  Please look at | ACM Primary Article Template | for further information on ACM proceedings templates. 
  Full, short, and SoK papers  
 Full paper submissions must be at most 10 pages in double-column ACM format (use document option “sigconf”), excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for double-blind review.  
 Detailed submission instructions will be made available as the deadline approaches.  
 In addition to regular papers that present novel contributions in the field, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 15 pages overall. They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  
 Posters and demos  
 WiSec will solicit the submission of posters and demos. The instructions to submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  
 Artifact Evaluation label  
 In the spirit of open science, WiSec encourages authors of accepted papers to make software and data artifacts publicly available to the community.  
 Such artifacts will be evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee and corresponding papers will be granted an artifact evaluation label. While artifacts are optional, their availability will be positively considered during paper evaluation. Should the authors choose to submit their artifacts for evaluation, they should indicate their decision upon paper submission and follow the artifact submission guidelines in order to submit them upon paper acceptance. The detailed guidelines will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  
 Double submissions  
 It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions, where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved. Technical reports and pre-prints published online are allowed.  
 Workshops and Tutorial  
 ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorials that are co-organized with the main conference. Details will be made available on the website.  
 Research Ethics  
 The ethical conduct of research is critical to ensuring the public’s trust and support of science. All submitted papers will be reviewed for ethical concerns, and if ethical practices are not followed a paper will be rejected regardless of any other merit. Ethical concerns vary from project to project, so there is no “one size fits all” approach. Rather, researchers should consider ethical analysis to be an integral part of the research, just as evaluation and method design are. Ethics should be considered early in a project, during a project, and as the project is prepared for publication.  
 While every situation is unique, there are principles that researchers should consider and apply during their projects. The Menlo Report provides guidance and examples for network security. Principally, all research should embody the concepts of beneficence, justice, respect for persons, and respect of law and public interest. This is just as true for technical research as human subjects research. For example, if it is possible that a research method could cause harm to systems or users (e.g., testing jamming) researchers should explicitly detail the measures taken to prevent harm.  
 Research ethics is also paramount in any study that could be classified as “human subjects.” For WiSec, “human subject research” is defined as “research that involves interaction with identifiable humans or analysis of datasets containing data from one or more identifiable living humans.” Researchers are expected to follow the laws and common practices regarding human subjects review of their relevant jurisdictions and institutions. For example, researchers in the United States must undergo review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before beginning human subjects research. Authors doing human subjects research should mention the review standards in their jurisdictions and if they were met.  
 Computer security and privacy research often studies and even advanced tools and techniques with the capacity to harm others. In their submission, authors must convince reviewers that appropriate steps were taken to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to appropriate parties  
 Policy for Peer-Review Integrity

 Call for Regular Papers  
  
 ACM Multimedia is the premier conference in multimedia, a research field that discusses emerging computing methods from a perspective in which each medium — e.g. images, text, audio — is a strong component of the complete, integrated exchange of information. The multimedia community has a tradition of being able to handle big data, has been a pioneer in large-scale evaluations and dataset creations, and is uniquely angled towards novel applications and cutting-edge industrial challenges. As such the conference openly embraces new intellectual angles from both industry as well as academia and welcomes submissions from related fields, such as data science, HCI, and signal processing.  
 ACM Multimedia 2025 calls for research papers presenting novel theoretical and algorithmic solutions to address problems across multimedia and related application fields. The conference also calls for papers presenting novel, thought-provoking ideas, and promising (preliminary) results in realising these ideas, especially surrounding multimodal AI, such as multi-agent, real-time human and machine intelligence working collaboratively. The conference invites papers in five major themes of multimedia: Generative AI, Engagement, Experience, Systems and Understanding, as described href=""https://acmmm2025.org/research-topics/"" - here
.  
 The conference invites research papers of varying lengths from 6 to 8 pages, plus additional pages for the reference pages; i.e., the reference page(s) are not counted towards the page limit of 6 to 8 pages. Please note that there is no longer a distinction between long and short papers, but the authors may themselves decide on the appropriate length of the paper. All papers will undergo the same review process and review period.  
  
 Submission Deadlines  
 Abstract submission: 04.04.2025  
 Regular paper submission: 11.04.2025 (including supplementary materials, if applicable)   
 Please note: The submission deadline is at 23:59 of the stated deadline date Anywhere on Earth. See the full list of  href=""https://acmmm2025.org/important-dates/"" - Important Dates
 .  
  
 Submission Instructions  
 Submit your href=""https://openreview.net/group?id=acmmm.org/ACMMM/2025/Conference"" - Regular Paper via OpenReview
.  
 Submission system:    
 ACM MM’25 uses OpenReview for paper submission and peer review. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.   
 All listed authors must have an up-to-date  OpenReview profile. The following page contains information on  how to create   an OpenReview profile. Note OpenReview’s moderation policy for newly created profiles:   
 New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks. 
  New profiles created with an institutional email will (normally) be activated automatically. 
  The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflicts of interest and paper matching. An incomplete OpenReview profile of any co-author is sufficient ground for desk rejection.   
 To be considered complete, each author profile must be properly attributed with the following mandatory fields: current and past institutional affiliation (going back at least 5 years), homepage, DBLP (if there is prior publication), ORCID, Advisors and Recent Publications (if any). In addition, other fields such as Google Scholar, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar, Advisees and Other Relations should be entered wherever applicable.   
 Please note that we may ask any author to also serve as a reviewer. Authors who are also serving as reviewers will not be able to see the reviews on their own paper until they complete the reviews assigned to them in a proper and timely manner.   
 For any question or inquiry, please contact <  href=""mailto:tpc@acmmm2025.org"" - tpc@acmmm2025.org
>   
  
 Multimedia/multimodality Policy for Paper Submissions  
 As the volume of submissions to the MM conference continues to grow annually, the SIGMM community seeks to distinguish itself from other communities such as NeurIPS, CVPR, and ECCV. Our focus lies in promoting research that is inherently multimedia or multimodal in nature. While papers that involve unimedia/unimodal processing will not necessarily be rejected, papers that make multimedia/multimodal research contributions will be preferred for publication in the conference proceedings. Out-of-scope submissions may be desk-rejected.   
   
 Paper Format  
 Submitted papers (.pdf format) must use the ACM Article Template (  https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template ). Please remember to add Concepts and Keywords. Please use the template in traditional double-column format to prepare your submissions. For example, word users should use Word Interim Template, and LaTeX users should use sample-sigconf-authordraft template. When using sample-sigconf-authordraft template, for submission and review of manuscript you could use the following documentclass command instead of the example provided in the template:   \documentclass[sigconf, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart}   
  Please ensure that you submit your papers subscribing to this format for full consideration during the review process.   
  
 Policy on Authorship and Generative AI Tools  
 Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. If generative AI language tools generate inappropriate language, plagiarized content, errors, mistakes, incorrect references, or misleading content, and that output is included in scientific works, author(s) will take full responsibility for the same. For details and more polices, please see here.  
  
 Length  
 Submitted papers may consist of up to 8 pages. Up to two additional pages may be added for references. The reference pages must only contain references. Overlength papers will be rejected without review. Optionally, you may upload supplementary material that complements your submission (50Mb limit).  
  All the content other than that in the main paper should be written in the separate supplementary material. We do not allow appendix that follow right after the main paper in the main submission file.  
  
 Blinding  
 Paper submissions must conform with the “double-blind” review policy. This means that the authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the names of the authors. Please prepare your paper in a way that preserves anonymity of the authors. For reviewer assignment, the technical program chairs may employ local LLM instances or similar technologies to process your submissions. No information will be shared with third parties.   
 Do not put the authors’ names under the title. 
  Avoid using phrases such as “our previous work” when referring to earlier publications by the authors. 
  Remove information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs). 
  Check supplemental material (e.g., titles in the video clips, or supplementary documents) for information that may identify the authors’ identities. 
  Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. 
  Papers without appropriate blinding will be rejected without review. 
   
 Originality  
 Papers submitted to ACM Multimedia must be the original work of the authors. The may not be simultaneously under review elsewhere. Publications that have been peer-reviewed and have appeared at other conferences or workshops may not be submitted to ACM Multimedia (see also the arXiv/Archive policy below). Authors should be aware that ACM has a strict policy with regard to plagiarism and self-plagiarism (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism). The authors’ prior work must be cited appropriately.  
  
 Author List  
 Please ensure that you submit your papers with the full and final list of authors in the correct order. The author list registered for each submission is not allowed to change in any way after the full paper submission deadline. (Note that this rule regards the identity of authors, e.g., typos are correctable.)  
  
 Paper Title  
 As per MM Policy, paper titles should remain the same between the camera-ready version and submission.  
  
 Proofreading  
 Please proofread your submission carefully. It is essential that the language used in the paper is clear and correct so that it is easily understandable. (Either US English or UK English spelling conventions are acceptable.)  
  
 ArXiv/Archive Policy  
 In accordance with ACM guidelines, all SIGMM-sponsored conferences adhere to the following policy regarding arXiv papers:  
 We define a publication as a written piece documenting scientific work that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, has been accepted.  Documentation of scientific work that is published in a not-for-profit archive without any form of peer-review (departmental Technical Report, arXiv.org, etc.) is not considered a publication.  However, this definition of publication does include peer-reviewed workshop papers, even if they do not appear in formal proceedings. Any submission to ACM Multimedia must not have substantial overlap with prior publications or other work currently undergoing peer review anywhere.  Note that documents published on website archives are subject to change. Citing such documents is discouraged. Furthermore, ACM Multimedia will review the documents formally submitted and any additional information in a web archive version will not affect the review.   
   
 Rebuttal Policies  
 After receiving the reviews, the authors may optionally submit a rebuttal to address the reviewers’ comments. The rebuttal is limited to a One page PDF file using the rebuttal template. Responses longer than one page will simply not be reviewed. This includes responses where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those specified by the style guide (deleting the title to get some space is acceptable).  
  The rebuttal must maintain anonymity. It cannot include links to external material such as code, videos, etc.  
  Authors may optionally contact the Author’s Advocate, whose role is to listen to the authors, and to help them if reviews are clearly below average quality. The Author’s Advocate operates independently from the Technical Program Committee.

  ""Call for Papers"": ""# ACM Multimedia 2025: Call for Regular Papers\n\nACM Multimedia is the premier conference in multimedia, a research field that discusses emerging computing methods from a perspective in which each medium — e.g. images, text, audio — is a strong component of the complete, integrated exchange of information.\n\nACM Multimedia 2025 calls for research papers presenting novel theoretical and algorithmic solutions to address problems across multimedia and related application fields. The conference also calls for papers presenting novel, thought-provoking ideas, and promising (preliminary) results in realising these ideas, especially surrounding multimodal AI, such as multi-agent, real-time human and machine intelligence working collaboratively.\n\n## Submission Deadlines\n\n*   **Abstract submission:** 04.04.2025\n*   **Regular paper submission (including supplementary materials, if applicable):** 11.04.2025\n\nPlease note: The submission deadline is at 23:59 of the stated deadline date Anywhere on Earth.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nSubmit your Regular Paper via OpenReview: [https://openreview.net/group?id=acmmm.org/ACMMM/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=acmmm.org/ACMMM/2025/Conference)\n\n## Multimedia/Multimodality Policy for Paper Submissions\n\nThe SIGMM community seeks to distinguish itself from other communities such as NeurIPS, CVPR, and ECCV. Our focus lies in promoting research that is inherently multimedia or multimodal in nature. While papers that involve unimedia/unimodal processing will not necessarily be rejected, papers that make multimedia/multimodal research contributions will be preferred for publication in the conference proceedings. Out-of-scope submissions may be desk-rejected.\n\n## Paper Format\n\nSubmitted papers (.pdf format) must use the ACM Article Template ([https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)).\n\nPlease ensure that you submit your papers subscribing to this format for full consideration during the review process.\n\n## Policy on Authorship and Generative AI Tools\n\nGenerative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. If generative AI language tools generate inappropriate language, plagiarized content, errors, mistakes, incorrect references, or misleading content, and that output is included in scientific works, author(s) will take full responsibility for the same.\n\n## Length\n\nSubmitted papers may consist of up to 8 pages. Up to two additional pages may be added for references. The reference pages must only contain references. Overlength papers will be rejected without review. Optionally, you may upload supplementary material that complements your submission (50Mb limit).\n\nAll the content other than that in the main paper should be written in the separate supplementary material. We do not allow appendix that follow right after the main paper in the main submission file.\n\n## Blinding\n\nPaper submissions must conform with the “double-blind” review policy. This means that the authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the names of the authors.\n\nPapers without appropriate blinding will be rejected without review.\n\n## Originality\n\nPapers submitted to ACM Multimedia must be the original work of the authors. The may not be simultaneously under review elsewhere.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor any questions, please contact the Technical Program Chairs: [tpc@acmmm2025.org](mailto:tpc@acmmm2025.org)\n\n*   Luca Rossetto (Dublin City University, Ireland)\n*   Stevan Rudinac (University of Amsterdam)\n*   Duc-Tien Dang Nguyen (University of Bergen)\n*   Wen-Huang Cheng (National Taiwan University)\n*   Phoebe Chen (La Trobe University)\n*   Jenny Benois-Pineau (University of Bordeaux)""

 Update to the AIAI Community from the Organisers  
 Dear Colleagues,  
 On behalf of the 21 st  AIAI (Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations) 2025 Organizing and Scientific Committee, it is a real honor and pleasure to welcome all Artificial Intelligence scholars who are looking for a well-established and prestigious forum to communicate and disseminate the innovative advances of their research. It is a fact that AI is continuously digging its way in a vast number of diverse scientific domains. AIAI aims to provide a forum for delegates from both academia and industry, who wish to share pioneer ideas, to get to know each other better and to present their research. Moreover, it aims to offer a deep glimpse into the future and to examine important AI ethical aspects.  
 The Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations  (AIAI) Conference has been held continuously since 2005, under the auspices of the IFIP WG12.5. Through the years, it has evolved to a well-respected and mature event, under the technical and scientific co-sponsorship of the AIAI community. This community comprises of an extended Group of leading scientists, not only from Europe but from all over the globe.  
 The h-index of the AIAI event is as high as 39  . This proves the novelty and quality of the presented-published research and its important contribution to the promotion of scientific ideas, algorithms and methods, globally. The fact that the conference Springer Proceedings, have been downloaded more than 2,800,000  times so far, supports the robust impact of the event among the scholars of AI internationally.. href=""https://ifipaiai.org/2025/message-of-the-organizers/"" - …[read more]

  Paper Submission  
 ADBIS 2025 invites original papers (not submitted elsewhere in parallel) describing results that broadly belong to the aforementioned list of topics. Accepted long papers will be published in a Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volume and accepted short papers are published in Springer's Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) series. The program committee may decide to accept a submission as a short paper if it reports interesting results but does not justify publication of a full paper.  
 LONG papers can be:   
 Regular research papers, reporting novel, solid research findings within the scope of the conference, typically but not exclusively found in proposing new models, querying or data handling methods, algorithms, data structures, and system architectures for the management of data. 
  Experimental re-evaluation papers, assessing previously published research results in terms of (i) performance evaluation for algorithms and systems, or, (ii) assessment of the application for methodologies, with the contribution of the paper being found (i) in the evaluation findings and (ii) in the discussion of strong and weak aspects of the algorithm/system/method being assessed. 
  SHORT papers can be:   
 Early findings/work-in-progress reports for prompt dissemination and discussion of early research results, that include early experimental findings and implementations, with an emphasis on (i) the description of the early findings, (ii) the possibilities they present, and, (iii) the difficulties being faced towards full fruition. 
  Vision papers, discussing possibilities and challenges in the exploration of radically new system architectures or methodologies for data management in important areas related to the scope of the conference, or areas that are currently considered outside the scope of the conference but hold the potential of becoming relevant. 
  Submission Guidelines  
 The page limits are as follows:  
 LONG (research or experimental) papers: 16 LNCS style pages, including references 
  SHORT (early findings or visionary) papers: up to 10 LNCS style pages, including references 
  Papers should be submitted in PDF format using the CMT  online submission system at: href=""https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADBIS2025"" - https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADBIS2025
.  
 Authors should consult href=""https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines"" - Springer’s authors’ guidelines
and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Licence-to-Publish agreement. The corresponding author, who must match the corresponding author marked on the paper, must have the full right, power, and authority to sign the agreement on behalf of all of the authors of a particular paper, and accepts responsibility for releasing this material on their behalf. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. An author of an accepted paper must register to ADBIS 2025 in order to have the paper published, and accepted papers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors.  
 Shepherding  
 Borderline papers will go through a shepherding phase where they will be expected to address the concerns of the reviewers, expressed as a list of required revisions. Failing to properly address them in due time will entail final rejection. The shepherding process will involve: authors will be given a list of issues/improvements that have to be addressed within 3 weeks’ time; authors improve the paper addressing these concerns; authors submit the revised paper in camera-ready format; the PC chairs ultimately decide whether the revised paper is acceptable as is or not to the final program.  
 Shepherding Schedule  
 The schedule for shepherding is as follows (All deadlines are 11:59 PM AoE):  
 Notification of shepherding status: | June 4, 2025 
  Authors submit revised, camera-ready version: | June 24, 2024 
  Notification of acceptance for shepherded papers: | July 1, 2024 
  Camera-ready documents and copyright: | July 15, 2024 
  Awards  
 Springer will sponsor the ADBIS 2025 Best Paper Award, Best PhD Symposium Paper Award, Best Demonstration and Best Short Paper, which will be announced during the ADBIS 2025 Banquet.  
 Special Issue  
 The best papers of the conference will be invited to submit an extended and revised version of their paper to a special issue in the Information Systems journal of Elsevier ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-systems ).  
 Inclusion and Diversity in Writing and Presentation  
 Authors are strongly encouraged to be inclusive in writing and presentation of their work.  
  Please visit the subsection ""D&I materials"" at https://dbdni.github.io/ for details.  
 Use of Generative AI  
 Authors should explicitly disclose the use of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in their manuscripts when these tools are employed for more than just editing the author’s text. This disclosure can be made through a statement placed at the end of the manuscript, preceding the References section.  
 If it comes to our notice that a submission utilized large language models (LLMs) without clear disclosure, such papers will be subject to immediate desk rejection. However, if there is no usage of such technologies, no disclosure statement is required.

  href=""https://acns25-cycle2.hotcrp.com/"" - PAPER SUBMISSION

  Instructions for Authors  
 Submissions must be done via the HotCRP website. The link will be announced shortly before the paper deadline.  
 ACNS 2025 will be an in-person  conference. Since remote presentations or videos will not be accepted, authors submitting a paper must ensure that one of the authors can present the paper at the conference in person.  
 Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published (other than preprint) or accepted for publication or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings. Information about submissions may be shared with program chairs of other conferences for that purpose.  
 ACNS encourages promising students to submit and present their results at the conference. ACNS gives a best student paper award, with a 1500 EUR prize sponsored by Springer, to encourage promising students to publish their best results at this venue. To be eligible, the paper must be co- authored by at least one full-time student who will present the paper at the conference.  
 Systematization of Knowledge   
 ACNS 2025 solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable to help our community to clarify and put into context complex research problems.  
 It is important to stress that SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research (like in a survey) but also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.  
 We encourage the authors to distinguish SoK submissions by adding the “SoK:” prefix to the title. SoK submissions will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, but they will be accepted based on their treatment of existing work and value to the community, and not based on any new research results they may contain. Accepted papers will be presented at the conference and included in the proceedings.  
  Submission Guidelines  
 Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. Each submission must begin with a title, short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non- specialist reader.  
 All submissions must be submitted in PDF format, following the unmodified LNCS format (accessible on the href=""https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines"" - Springer LCNS author guidelines
 webpage) and typeset using the corresponding LaTeX class file. They must fit within a page limit of 20 pages, including title and abstract, figures, etc., but excluding references. Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following the main body of the paper; however, reviewers are not required to read or review any supplementary material, and submissions are expected to be intelligible without it. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. To accommodate for changes requested in reviews, the page limit for the camera-ready proceedings versions is 30 pages, including references and appendices.  
 For papers that might raise ethical concerns, authors are expected to convince reviewers that proper procedures (such as Institutional Review Board approval) have been followed and due diligence has been made to minimize potential harm.  
 ACNS 2025 has two submission deadlines (in September and January) that authors may choose to submit their papers to. Papers rejected after the September round cannot be resubmitted at the January round.  
 We will publish our proceedings with Springer as a volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  
  Conflicts of Interest  
 The program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and program committee members to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest. During the submission process, we will ask authors to identify members of the program committee with whom they share a conflict of interest.  
 We regard the following relationships as conflicts of interest:  
 1. Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission (including secondary affiliations and consulting work),  
 2. Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past,  
 3. Anyone the author has collaborated or published within the prior two years,  
 4. Anyone who is serving as the sponsor or administrator of a grant that funds your research, or  
 5. Close personal or family ties.  
 If authors want to specify a conflict of another type than those listed above, they must contact the chairs and explain the perceived conflict. Program committee members who are in a conflict of interest with a paper, including program co-chairs, will be excluded from the evaluation and discussion of the paper by default.  
  Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure (adapted from IEEE S&P)  
 Where research identifies a vulnerability (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program, design weaknesses in a hardware system, or any other kind of vulnerability in deployed systems), we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. In nearly every case, disclosing the vulnerability to vendors of affected systems, and other stakeholders, will help protect users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days  to 90 days  ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.  
 Longer disclosure windows (which may keep vulnerabilities from the public for extended periods of time) should only be considered in exceptional situations, e.g., if the affected parties have provided convincing evidence the vulnerabilities were previously unknown and the full rollout of mitigations requires additional time. The authors are encouraged to consult with the PC chairs in case of questions or concerns.  
 The version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities; but, consistent with the timelines above, the authors do not have to disclose vulnerabilities ahead of submission. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
  Diversity and Inclusion  
 ACNS is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our community. If you have suggestions, concerns, or complaints related to biases or sexual harassment, we encourage you to reach out to the Conference Co-Chairs. We are committed to protecting the anonymity of such reports and helping to address your concerns. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community.  
 We encourage authors to be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions.

 Jump to Detailed Instructions   

 Plagiarism & Use of ChatGPT or similar LLMs Policy  
 Plagiarism and the Use of ChatGPT or similar LLMs Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. Note that this policy does not prohibit authors from using LLMs for editing or polishing author-written text.  
 AAAI’2025 furthermore follows AAAI policy that any AI system, including Generative Models such as Chat-GPT, BARD, or DALL-E, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers published by AAAI and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in papers published by AAAI. Authors assume full responsibility for content, including checking for plagiarism and veracity of all text.  
 Any allegation of plagiarism, whether the result of the use of an LLM or otherwise, which comes to AAAI’s attention will be thoroughly investigated. If substantiated, the matter will be dealt with very seriously. Possible sanctions include rejection/retraction of the work, notification to all the authors’ institutions or employers and any other relevant bodies, and denial of service for and access to all AAAI-sponsored meetings.  
 Summary  
 Three technical tracks (Main Track; AI for Social Impact; AI Alignment) 
  Two-phase reviewing: two reviews in Phase 1, additional reviews in Phase 2 for papers not rejected in Phase 1. Author response after Phase 2, only for papers not rejected in Phase 1. 
  Three kinds of supplementary material may be submitted alongside all papers: (1) technical appendix; (2) multimedia; (3) code and data. Supplementary material deadline is 3 days after the paper submission deadline. 
  Additional pages for references only. 
  All authors must complete a reproducibility checklist, which facilitates replication of the reported research. 
  All authors are expected to be available to review (light load), unless extenuating circumstances apply. 
  Note that the NeurIPS fast track from previous years will not be included this year. The submission deadline is after NeurIPS initial reviews are released, and authors must withdraw the paper from consideration at NeurIPS if they wish to submit to AAAI. 
  The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-25 is the Thirty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. As with AAAI-24, the theme of this conference is to create collaborative bridges  within and beyond AI. In addition to the bridge theme, we emphasize the importance of AI for social impact and responsible AI. Like AAAI 2024 conference, AAAI-25 will feature technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibition programs, and two other activities: a Bridge Program and a Lab Program. Many of these activities are tailored to the theme of bridges and are selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers.  
 AAAI-25 is an in-person conference.  
 Timetable for Authors  
 Please see the timetable in the sidebar .  
 ​Collaborative Bridge Theme  
 Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today, both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating collaboration between two or more communities directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridges is broad and encompasses disciplines within and outside of AI. Hence, the communities that our Bridge Program is intended to bring together could be distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities.  
 Topics  
 AAAI-25 welcomes submissions reporting research that advances artificial intelligence, broadly conceived. The conference scope includes machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, multiagent systems, knowledge representation, human-in-the-loop AI, search, planning, reasoning, robotics and perception, and ethics. In addition to fundamental work focused on any one of these areas, we expressly encourage work that cuts across technical areas of AI (e.g., machine learning and computer vision; computer vision and natural language processing; or machine learning and planning), bridges between AI and a related research area (e.g., neuroscience; cognitive science), or develops AI techniques in the context of important application domains, such as healthcare, sustainability, transportation, and commerce.  
 The set of AAAI-25 keywords is available on the href=""https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/aaai-25-keywords/"" - AAAI-25 keywords page
. href=""https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/aaai-25-keywords/#authors-guide"" - The author’s guide for choosing the best keywords
describes important considerations in selecting keywords for a paper.  
 Most papers in AAAI-25 will be part of the main track. All main track papers will be reviewed according to the same criteria and via the same process. This conference has two special tracks, which focus on AI for Social Impact  , and AI Alignment  . Papers in the special tracks will be reviewed according to a different evaluation rubric than papers in the main track. The same reviewing schedule will be followed for all papers.  
 Special Track on AI for Social Impact  
 As in past years, AAAI-25 will include a special track on AI for Social Impact (AISI). Submissions to this track will be reviewed according to a rubric that emphasizes the fit between the techniques used and a problem of social importance, rather than simply rewarding technical novelty. In particular, reviewers will assess the significance of the addressed problem; the paper’s engagement with previous literature on the application problem (whether in the AI literature or elsewhere); both novelty of and justification for the proposed AI-based approach; quality of evaluation; facilitation of follow-up work; and overall scope and promise for social impact. Further details are available at the href=""https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/aisi-call/"" - AISI page
.  
 Special Track on AI Alignment  
 This year we are introducing a special track on AI alignment. This track is motivated by the fact that as we begin to build more and more capable AI systems, it becomes crucial to ensure that the goals and actions of such systems are aligned with human values. To accomplish this, we need to understand the risks of these systems and research methods to mitigate these risks. Further details are available on the AIA page, including review criteria specific to this track.  
 Review Criteria  
 AAAI is a highly selective conference. Prospective authors are therefore strongly encouraged to submit only their very best work to AAAI.  
 All submissions will be rigorously evaluated by expert reviewers to assess whether the contributions of the paper are substantive enough to warrant publication in AAAI.  
 The contributions may be theoretical, methodological, algorithmic, empirical, integrative (connecting ideas and methods across disparate subfields of AI), or critical (e.g., principled analyses and arguments that draw attention to fundamentally wrong choice of goals, assumptions, or approaches). Evaluation of submissions to the AI for Social Impact track should emphasize demonstrated or potential impact of the research in addressing pressing societal challenges, e.g., health, food, environment, education, governance, among others. Evaluation of submissions to the AI Alignment track will be evaluated using similar but slightly different from the criteria used for main track submissions. See the AI Alignment track CFP for more details.  
 All submissions will be evaluated and scored for the significance and novelty of the contributions (research problems or questions addressed, methods, experiments, analyses), theoretical and/or empirical soundness of the claims, their relevance to the AAAI community, and clarity of exposition.  
 Additional considerations include adherence to responsible research practices (e.g., with respect to human subject studies, use of sensitive data, as well as data and algorithmic bias), and of steps to ensure reproducibility of research results (e.g., by providing detailed proofs, documenting experiments, sharing data, and sharing code).  
 Solid, technical papers that explore new territory or point out new directions for research, or introduce new problems, address research questions, or introduce methods that are of interest beyond a single sub-area of AI are preferred to papers that advance the state of the art, but only incrementally, or only within a narrow sub-area of AI.

 Hard Topic Theme: Security Applications of Generative AI   
 This year's hard topic theme solicits research results and technologies that advance our understanding of the applicability of Generative AI and Large Language Models to computer security. These transformative new technologies can have a significant impact in addressing traditional security problems, such as vulnerability detection, fraud detection, reverse engineering, threat intelligence, and many others. At the same time, the complexity of these systems also exposes new potential vulnerabilities that are still not well understood by the research community.

 ACSAC solicits papers offering novel contributions in any aspect of applied security research. We encourage papers with results that are demonstrably useful for improving cybersecurity and that address lessons learned from practical applications. In particular, we encourage the submission of papers related to our hard topic theme: Security Applications of Generative AI . Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published elsewhere or that have been simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with proceedings and are under review.  
   
 href=""https://papers.submit.acsac.org/"" - Make Submission
 
 ** New this year **  Reproduction and Replication (R+R) Papers:  Security research is often criticized for the poor reproducibility of its results, a situation we aim to address through artifact evaluation. At the same time, reproduction and replication studies are often undervalued in academic publishing. Thus, in addition to regular papers and artifact evaluations, this year we are also soliciting studies that confirm, question, or clarify the results of previous research. These papers must contain the prefix “R+R:” in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.  
 We encourage submissions to follow the ACM guidelines on reproducibility (different team, same experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-use) and replicability (different team, different experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-implementation). Note, however, that submissions need to go beyond re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper(s) or re-implementing their approach. We are looking for submissions that not only replicate existing studies but also critically assess, clarify and extend their findings and limitations. This includes, but is not limited to, the verification of existing research results, ensuring their validity and reliability across different contexts, lessons learned when applying research results in real-world (industry) settings, and the adaption of artifacts to contemporary cybersecurity challenges.  
 Reproduction and replication papers will be held to the same scientific standards as original technical papers, will be reviewed by the full program committee, will appear in the proceedings, and will be presented at the conference as part of the technical program. We also particularly encourage these types of papers to provide their artifacts.  
 Review Process:  Paper submissions will be judged based on novelty, relevance to the conference topics, technical correctness, quality of the evaluation, and presentation clarity. Papers will undergo a double-blind review process in two rounds. At the end of Round 1, papers for which a strong consensus towards rejection is reached will be notified of the early rejection decision, giving them the opportunity to improve their paper based on the reviewers’ feedback and to resubmit to other venues. Papers that advance to Round 2 will be assigned additional reviewers. At the end of Round 2, the authors of papers that advanced to this stage will have an opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and comments. After the authors' response period, the papers will be further discussed by the Program Committee (PC) to reach a final decision.  
 Three outcomes are possible: Accepted, Minor Revision, and Rejected. The Minor Revision decision is reserved to papers that can be considered as conditionally accepted, assuming improvements required by the reviewers are made within the available revision time window and are approved by the PC. A PC member will be assigned as shepherd for Minor Revision papers, to guide the authors through the revision process and to lead the discussion on the revised paper among the reviewers. The revision requirements may include both presentation improvements and additional experiments that the PC believes are necessary to significantly improve the paper and that should be feasible within a limited time frame. While Minor Revision papers that do not meet the required changes may be rejected, the expectation is that most papers will be able to satisfy the required improvements and be finally accepted into the conference program. Both the author's responses and the discussions around revision requirements for Minor Revision papers will be handled anonymously, via the paper submission system.  
 Paper Artifacts:  Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to submit their software and data artifacts for formal evaluation by the Artifacts Evaluation Committee and to make them publicly available to the entire community. During submission, authors of papers whose main contributions and experimental results rely primarily on new or reproduced artifacts (e.g., code and/or data) should indicate whether they will separately submit their artifacts for evaluation, if their paper is accepted. This acknowledgement will be visible to the reviewers and may therefore be taken into consideration during the review process. Authors who have justifiable reasons to not submit their artifacts for evaluation (in case their paper is accepted) should add a comment in the corresponding comment box in the submission form. Additionally, during paper submission authors can optionally provide a URL pointing to a repository containing their paper artifacts. While artifacts will be formally evaluated only if the paper is accepted, as explained above, reviewers may also take into account the availability and quality of the paper artifacts during the main paper review process, before making a final decision (please refer to the paper submission form for additional details).  
 Important:  When preparing the artifacts repository for inclusion in the paper submission form, please take extra care to not include authors’ information in the repository or artifacts content, so as not to break the anonymity of the paper submission. Additional information and recommendations on anonymizing the artifacts repository can be found here .  
 Ethical Considerations:  Papers that might raise ethical concerns (e.g., papers that use human subjects, leverage potentially sensitive data, or describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems) must include an Ethical Considerations section that properly describes what procedures have been followed to minimize potential harm. Such papers should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties, whether an institutional ethics committee reviewed the research, or how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software/system vendors or owners before publication.  
 Paper Format:  Please ensure that your submission consists of a PDF file of no more than 10 double-column pages, excluding well-marked references and appendices limited to a maximum of 5 pages. The full PDF document must not exceed a total of 15 pages. Please note that PC members are not required to read the appendices and that page limits will be strictly enforced.  
 Papers must be appropriately anonymized to the dual anonymous review process. Author names and affiliations must not be included in the PDF submission. Authors can cite and refer to their own prior work, but must do so in the third person, as if it was written by someone else. In the rare case that citing previous work in the third person is not possible, please anonymize the reference and notify the Program Chairs.  
 Submission Process:  Submissions must be generated using the double-column ACM format (see template available at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template ) using the [sigconf, anonymous]  options. Submissions should not use older ACM templates (e.g., sig-alternate). All papers must be submitted exclusively through the ACSAC 2024 paper submission system. Note that paper title and abstract registration is not necessary ahead of the paper submission.  
 All formatting guidelines and constraints (e.g., page limits and anonymity) will be strictly enforced. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

 General call for paper  
 The 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025) will take place between July 22-26, 2025 in Palermo, Italy.  
  THE AIED 2025 THEME   
 “AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future”   

 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is progressing at an unprecedented rate, with generative AI and related technologies leading this transformative shift. These advancements are set to reshape education in significant ways, offering novel opportunities to enhance both teaching and learning processes. At the same time, more ‘traditional’ AI techniques continue to be developed, bringing in new insights. AI is expanding the horizons of what is achievable in education, enabling the creation of personalised and dynamic learning experiences. As these technologies continue to evolve, they equip educators with powerful tools to gain deeper insights into student needs, tailor instruction and resources to individual learning paths, and promote greater student engagement. AI is no longer merely an auxiliary tool — it is fundamentally transforming the core of educational practices, making learning environments more adaptive, accessible, and impactful.  
 The AIED 2025 conference, themed “AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future,”  centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education. By harnessing AI’s capacity to personalise learning experiences, educators can address the diverse needs of students and mitigate educational disparities, particularly among underserved and marginalised communities. This year’s theme also underscores the critical importance of ethical AI integration, ensuring that these advanced technologies are deployed responsibly to uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and privacy. We welcome submissions that investigate how AI can act as a catalyst for cultivating a more equitable and inclusive educational environment, ultimately empowering both teachers and students in the pursuit of a more just and accessible future.  
 AIED 2025 will be the 26th edition of this conference series. The AIED Society, organiser of the AIED conference, aims at advancing science and engineering of intelligent human-technology ecosystems that support learning. The conference will be the latest of a longstanding series of international conferences, known for high quality and innovative research on AI-assisted systems and cognitive science approaches for educational computing applications. AIED is ranked A in CORE (top 16% of all 783 ranked venues)  , the well-known ranking of computer science conferences. AIED is a venue for researchers, decision makers, stakeholders and practitioners in the areas of AI in Education, and especially welcomes teachers and industry, particularly SMEs involved in AIED. Due to the growth of this important area, AIED 2025 is implementing for the first time a track-based system.  
 Discover the Tracks  
 We are excited that this year’s conference is moving to a new track-based system! To help potential authors in selecting what track to submit to, we will be hosting two recorded information sessions:  
 one on | Monday February 3rd | at 8AM Eastern Standard Time | / 1PM Greenwich Mean Time / 9PM China Standard Time 
  and one on | Tuesday February 4th at 8AM EST | / 1PM GMT / 9PM CST. 
  Register for the information sessions here: https://pitt.zoom.us/meeting/register/y7reWqgRRmCR1QnZPlwjmg  
 Please consider attending if you have questions about what track to submit to.  
 Thus, for its main paper submissions, AIED 2025 solicits empirical and theoretical papers relating to both AI and education in the following lines of research and application, which represent our research tracks:  
 Track 1 – AIED architectures and tools   
 Papers submitted to this track should describe novel advances related to the engineering and development of AIED systems. Papers may be concerned with describing proof-of-concepts that demonstrate the feasibility of novel techniques, as well as real- world implementations that show the potential for reuse or adaptation by other researchers. Example research areas with applications in education include, but are not limited to, multi-agent architectures; tangible interfaces, wearables; speech technologies; virtual and augmented reality; A/B experimentation platforms. Innovative, domain-specific learning application architectures and tools also find a home in this track, for example, language, science, engineering, mathematics, medicine, military, industry, sports; scaling up and large-scale deployment of AIED systems. While papers may describe an evaluation of the system or tool with end-users, the primary scientific contribution of papers submitted to this track should be technical and systems-oriented.  
 Sample Keywords:  AI system (e.g., tutoring systems, conversational agents, assessment systems, learning management systems, simulations), AI devices and tools, newly developed, proof-of-concept, feasibility studies  
  Track 2 – Machine learning and Generative AI   
 Papers submitted to this track should describe advances in or applications of AI-based techniques within education, involving knowledge representation and machine learning. Generative AI-based techniques are also welcome within this track. Data-driven processing techniques (including educational data mining, deep learning, machine learning) in education will constitute the main focus of this track. Example areas are natural language processing for education, video data mining for education, etc. Papers will likely address novel contributions related to modeling learner, teacher, and other stakeholder processes and outcomes, or contributions to representing learning domains. Evaluation techniques in this track rely on computational analyses related, for example, to the accuracy, validity, or reliability of predictive or generative models. While papers will likely describe evaluations on previous datasets or newly collected data, the primary scientific contribution of these papers will be to AI and its application.  
 Sample Keywords:  classifiers, predictive models, learner modeling, learning analytics, LLMs, clustering, data mining, process data, deep learning, feature engineering/extraction  
  Track 3 – Learning, teaching and pedagogy   
 Papers submitted to this track should describe approaches to teaching, learning and evaluations of AIED systems and environments that relate to pedagogical techniques, learning processes, and outcomes, conceived broadly. Both quantitative (survey, correlational, comparative, experimental etc.) and qualitative (case study, ethnography, phenomenology, grounded theory, action research etc.) analysis, as well as mixed-methods approaches are encouraged under this paper category. AIED systems targeted here include, but are not limited, to: AI-assisted tutoring and scaffolding; Motivational diagnosis and feedback; Learner engagement/presence; Interactive pedagogical agents and learning companions; Agents that promote cognition, metacognition, self-regulation, co-regulation, motivation and positive affect; Adaptive question-answering and dialogue, Data-driven modeling (educational data mining, deep learning, machine learning,…); Learning analytics and teaching support, Learning with simulations; Explainability of models for teaching and learning. Learning targeted here refers to both formal and informal learning, including game-based learning; digital collaborative/cooperative and group learning; social networks; inquiry learning; social dimensions of learning; communities of practice; ubiquitous learning environments; learning through construction and making; learning grid; lifelong learning; learning in informal settings (museum, workplace, etc.); learning in the physical space; learning of motor skills. Evaluations here include studies on human learning. Learning spaces include massive open online courses; remote learning at any learning level including k-12 schools, higher education; synchronous, asynchronous, blended learning; mobile learning; active learning in virtual settings; video-based learning; mixed reality and learning. Papers may involve a novel system or a previously existing system, but the primary scientific contribution should be towards understanding the effects of the system and its features on learners, teachers, or other stakeholders. Studies where the focus of the research is fundamentally on the constructs of learning are suitable for this track.  
 Sample Keywords:  Cognitive, behavioral, affective states of learners, pedagogy, effects on learner  
  Track 4 – Human-centered design and design-based research   
 Papers submitted to this track should address design principles for AIED systems or methods for designing such systems, as well as broadening understanding of contextual and individual factors that might inform users’ interactions with these systems  . Papers submitted to this track can explore the design, use, and evaluation of human-AI hybrid systems for learning: research that explores the potential of human-AI interaction in educational contexts; systems and approaches in which educational stakeholders and AI tools build upon each other’s complementary strengths to achieve educational outcomes and/or improve mutually. Solutions explored in this track include human-AI partnership  : shared decision making between systems and users that promote agency and improve learning. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis user-centered design methods are encouraged under this paper category. Papers may involve the study of systems or prototypes that do not currently contain AI, as long as the primary purpose of the paper is to inform the design of AIED systems, putting the user (human) in the center. Evaluations in this track should focus on human-centeredness, or be a means to support human-centred design; or focus on the design and formative studies of AIED systems; in this context, they may include other aspects of the human side of human-AI interaction, such as on human cognition, affect, motivation, engagement, and attitudes. While these papers may also involve the development of a mockup for a new system, the primary scientific contribution should be towards human-centred design, or principles for the design of features of similar systems in similar contexts (as opposed to focusing on the technical implementation of a specific system).  
 Sample Keywords:  human in the centre AI, human-AI partnership, human-in-the-loop, augmented or hybrid systems, humans in the decision-making/ design process, usability with human involvement  
  Track 5 – Teaching AI    
 Papers submitted to this track should involve methods, principles, or technologies for teaching AI or supporting the development of AI literacy. This includes studies on skills and knowledge that enable individuals to understand, use, and critically evaluate AI; definitions of AI literacy; learning to use AI; developing a basic understanding of how AI works; learning to communicate and collaborate with AI; learning to live with AI, understanding limitations and problems of AI. This track especially welcomes work done by or in collaboration with teachers at all levels, from primary to university education. Papers in this track should preferably be based on empirical studies, including small-scale, classroom sized studies; although larger scale studies and theoretical contributions around the topic of teaching AI are also welcomed. Thus, the primary scientific contribution should be towards analysing or improving methods of teaching AI and development of AI literacy.  
 Sample Keywords:  education about AI, teaching AI, AI literacy, critical reflection on AI applications, data literacy  
  Track 6 – Ethics, Equity, and AIED in Society     
 Papers submitted to this track should take a perspective on AIED as it relates to society at different levels, more broadly, including the ethics of AIED, or designing AIED systems for a more equitable and just future. This includes AIED equity and inclusion-related theoretical or practical studies on socio-economic, gender, and racial issues; AI-assisted techniques to support students from under-resourced schools and communities; sponsorship, scientific validity, participant’s rights and responsibilities, data collection, management and dissemination. Additionally, it includes papers on ethics of AI in education, such as papers on explainability, transparency, accountability, and responsible AIED; learner consent and opt out; surveillance and privacy; the impact of AIED on teachers, learners and classrooms from an ethics perspective; teacher empowerment and student agency; the community’s responsibility for commercial applications; AIED ethical frameworks and principles for application. This track also includes AIED for development themes, such as leveraging AI technology to address and improve various aspects of development in societies and education, particularly in low and middle-income countries; AIED divide; AIED unplugged; Low-cost solutions; low-tech solutions; frugal Innovation; Jugaad Innovation. These papers may include systematic reviews of the literature or position papers on a particular issue. Both empirical results and theory are welcome in this track, with the primary contribution towards ethics, equity and society.  
 Sample Keywords:  Bias, algorithmic fairness, privacy, transparency, data collection and reuse-analysis, ethics, population groups (gender, racial/ethnic groups, minorities, cultural differences), the generalizability of models, measurement issues and biases, equity, inclusion  
  Track 7 – Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modelling for Education     
 Papers submitted to this track should include conceptual or theoretical models, methods, knowledge representation, reasoning related to AIED research and AIED systems. Papers will likely address novel contributions related to theoretical aspects of modelling learners (including open learner models), teachers, and other stakeholders, contributions to representing learning domains or modelling the processes involved in AIED systems. Other areas include, but are not limited, to theoretical contributions and modelling of: facilitators, tasks and problem-solving processes; models of groups and communities for learning; modeling motivation, metacognition, and affective aspects of learning; ontological modeling; computational thinking and model-building; representing and analysing activity flow and discourse during learning; representing and modeling psychomotor learning. Expanding and evaluating cognitive, motivational and affective theories within AIED context also constitutes a target of this track. Papers in this track can further be using bottom-up and top-down approaches to analyse data, in order to inform motivational, learning, and cognitive theories, and gain better understanding of the socio-cognitive nature of learning. The primary contribution of these papers can be of empirical results analysing theoretical aspects, or direct contributions to theories and theoretical models applicable to AIED.  
 Sample Keywords:  knowledge discovery, theory confirmation, theory modification about learning science, cognition, motivation, gathering empirical evidence with a heavy focus on theory, learner models, user models, domain models  

 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion   
 The AIED Society values diversity, equity, and inclusion (and related principles under this broad umbrella) as essential and fundamental values for the AIED community to uphold. Thus, in AIED 2025, we encourage authors to:  
 Write with care toward inclusive language (e.g., understanding identify-first vs. person-first language, gender neutral language, appropriate demographic categories and terminology, and avoiding the conflation of distinct dimensions such as race and ethnicity, or sex and gender). 
  Report methodology including descriptions of sample characteristics (e.g., demographic data), any procedures for inclusive and representative sampling, any barriers to inclusive and representative sampling, and the ethical issues addressed both in the research methodology and the AIED approaches or tools being researched. For example, it is important to report the strategies used to control or reduce bias against populations of any kind (e.g. benefit or bring prejudice to a particular gender, race, or people with different economic status) when collecting, using, or aggregating data both for the research and for the AIED approach or tool being researched. 
  Consider how their theoretical frameworks and findings are related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. For example, authors may discuss how these issues influence key assumptions, hypotheses, and methods. 
  Address implications or appropriate interpretations of their findings with respect to diversity, inclusion and equity. 

 Submission Instructions   
 We invite the following main submissions to the conference, to be submitted directly to one of the above research tracks :   
 Full paper submission: | Full papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Full papers will be presented as long oral talks. Papers submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper. 
  Short paper submission: | Short papers are expected to describe novel and interesting results to the overall community at large. The goal is to give novel but not necessarily mature work a chance to be seen by other researchers and practitioners and to be discussed at the conference. Short papers will be presented as short oral talks. 
  Submissions must follow Springer policies on publication (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process): https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v .   
 Please note that presenters of papers accepted to the main conference are expected to be on-site to give their presentations and to interact with the audience  . An online streaming option will be set-up for remote observers. Scholarships are available for researchers who lack funding to present at the conference, see website for more information. Workshops may however run hybrid, at the discretion of their organisers (for further information, see their websites).  
 Papers accepted to be published in the conference proceedings must have a unique onsite author registration (i.e., one registration per paper).  
 Authors should note that following AIED 2024, there will be NO downgrade path from main submissions to posters  . Authors whose papers submitted as main submissions are not accepted either as full or short paper are encouraged to revise and consider other submission types such as the late-breaking results or workshops. Note that due to the nature of the submission type, posters are to be presented physically at the conference; no remote presentation of posters will be allowed  .  
 We will announce further details for other submission types within AIED 2025 including:  
 Blue Sky: position papers envisioning the future of AIED 
  WideAIED: papers on research and ideas toward widening participation in AIED (e.g. by social scientists, share experiences in the area, …). 
  Invited papers from the International Journal of AIED 
  Late-breaking results 
  Practitioners and Industry 
  Doctoral Consortium 
  Interactive events (e.g. demos) 
   Review Process   
 All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the program committee, followed by a metareview conducted by a senior member of the program committee (all double-masked) to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation. It is important to note that the work presented should not have been published previously or be under consideration in other conferences of journals. Any paper caught in double submission will be rejected without review.  
 Anonymity   
 The review process will be double-masked, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous. To this end, authors should:  
 Eliminate all information that could lead to their identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, projects and/or systems) 
  Cite own prior work (if needed) in the third person 
  Eliminate acknowledgments and references to funding sources 
  Data collection, reporting, and analysis   
 Authors should be clear and specific about the composition of human-sourced data. Who were the participants? What was the distribution of gender, race, ethnicity, or related variables? If corpus data or training data were sourced from humans, a similar description could be offered.  
 Skewed or non-representative samples would not necessarily trigger a “reject” decision, but authors should acknowledge the demographic imbalances and discuss the potential impact on data, results, or conclusions. A more compelling paper would describe steps taken to generate an inclusive and representative sample (this is basic science, but often overlooked for convenience).  
 Authors are encouraged to discuss/justify how demographic variables are included in the analyses. If they are not included or “covaried out” please justify. If they are included, what are the assumptions? Are there “categorical effects”? Are the effects of different demographic variables independent, interdependent, or intersectional? What valid conclusions can be drawn? What erroneous conclusions need to be avoided or tempered?  
 Ethics   
 Authors should demonstrate some awareness of how ethical issues (including but not limited to equity, inclusion, accessibility) impact their data, methods, tools, approaches, products, and findings. How are different demographic groups or communities differentially connected to the work? People who are developing educational technologies need to think about access and use, for example. Corpus analyses need to address the impact of skewed/exclusive datasets and potential outcomes (e.g., algorithmic bias).  

 Submission Procedure and Publication of Accepted Contributions   
 All submissions must be in Springer format. Papers that do not use the required format may be rejected without review. Authors should consult Springer’s  authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers.

  ""Call for Papers"": ""# AIED 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025) will take place between **July 22-26, 2025 in Palermo, Italy**.\n\n## Theme\n\n“AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future”\n\nThe AIED 2025 conference centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education. By harnessing AI’s capacity to personalize learning experiences, educators can address the diverse needs of students and mitigate educational disparities, particularly among underserved and marginalized communities. This year’s theme also underscores the critical importance of ethical AI integration, ensuring that these advanced technologies are deployed responsibly to uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and privacy.\n\n## Tracks\n\nFor its main paper submissions, AIED 2025 solicits empirical and theoretical papers relating to both AI and education in the following lines of research and application, which represent our research tracks:\n\n*   Track 1 – AIED architectures and tools\n*   Track 2 – Machine learning and Generative AI\n*   Track 3 – Learning, teaching and pedagogy\n*   Track 4 – Human-centered design and design-based research\n*   Track 5 – Teaching AI\n*   Track 6 – Ethics, Equity, and AIED in Society\n*   Track 7 – Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modelling for Education\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nWe invite the following main submissions to the conference, to be submitted directly to one of the above research tracks:\n\n*   **Full paper submission:** Full papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Full papers will be presented as long oral talks. Papers submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper.\n*   **Short paper submission:** Short papers are expected to describe novel and interesting results to the overall community at large. The goal is to give novel but not necessarily mature work a chance to be seen by other researchers and practitioners and to be discussed at the conference. Short papers will be presented as short oral talks.\n\nSubmissions must follow Springer policies on publication (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process): [https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v](https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v).\n\n## Review Process\n\nAll submissions will be reviewed by three members of the program committee, followed by a metareview conducted by a senior member of the program committee (all double-masked) to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation.\n\n## Anonymity\n\nThe review process will be double-masked, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous. To this end, authors should:\n\n*   Eliminate all information that could lead to their identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, projects and/or systems)\n*   Cite own prior work (if needed) in the third person\n*   Eliminate acknowledgments and references to funding sources\n\n## Important Dates (full and short papers, main submission)\n\n*   **Submissions open:** December 20, 2024\n*   **Abstracts due:** February 12, 2025\n*   **Papers due:** February 19, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance to authors:** April 2, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready paper due:** May 2, 2025""

 ABZ 2025 – 11th International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods  

 Call for papers  
 The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.  
 The name ABZ goes back to the first conference in London in 2008, where the ASM, B and Z conference series were merged into a joint event. In the following years other formal methods were added, e.g. Alloy in 2010 (Orford, Canada), VDM in 2012 (Pisa, Italy), and TLA+ in 2014 (Toulouse, France). After the also successful 2016 conferences in Linz, Austria, and 2018 in Southampton, UK, it was decided to name the conference “ABZ: International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods”, to stress the openness for further state-based formal methods. We hope to continue many fruitful discussions between representatives of the individual methods in the past, which will bring us closer to the common goal of this research community: the creation of reliable and safe software and systems.  
 ABZ 2025 will have a main conference track, a case study track, a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops.
