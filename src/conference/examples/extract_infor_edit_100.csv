 SUBMISSIONS   
 Submissions should be made via EasyChair at href=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acsw2025"" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acsw2025
. Note: When starting a submission, you will need to begin by selecting a track. Be sure to select Australasian Computing Education Conference 2025.  
 Submissions should be in two-column format (i.e. use ""sigconf"" style in the documentclass for Latex) and should use the ACM SIG Proceedings template (available in Latex and Word). Submissions should be made to EasyChair in PDF format:  
  
 LaTeX template 
  href=""https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word"" - MS Word template 
   
 RESEARCH PAPERS   
 Papers on research and innovations may be in the context of formal courses or self-directed learning; they may involve, for example, introductory programming, service courses, capstone courses, specialist undergraduate or postgraduate topics, or industry-related short courses. We welcome submissions directed at issues of current and local importance, as well as topics of international interest. Such topics may include the transition from school to university, articulation between vocational and university education, quality management in teaching, teaching people from other cultures, globalisation, attracting and retaining female students, online, mobile and blended learning. Research papers would typically describe research questions, and address these through the careful presentation of methods, results, and limitations, while clearly stating the contribution of the work.  
 PRACTITIONER PAPERS   
 In addition to research papers, ACE provides the opportunity for teachers to demonstrate new educational tools, and to share interesting teaching resources, assignments, and techniques that may be of broad interest to the community. We encourage the submission of papers that present interesting ways to teach challenging concepts, engaging activities that promote student learning, and compelling assignments. Practitioner papers would typically describe a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use, and present a rich reflection on how it worked in practice.  
 REVIEW PROCESS   
 All research and practitioner papers will be fully refereed, using a double-blind reviewing process, by a minimum of three members of the Program Committee.  
 PUBLICATION COST   
 As the proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library, all authors need to be aware of the new cost structure for ICPS conferences (which include ACE). The basic cost of publication used to be borne by the conference, with authors able to pay extra to have a paper made open access, but now the full cost has reverted to the authors – unless they work in an institution that is a member of the ACM Open program or in a country classified as low-income. Note that this fee is to be paid only once for each paper, not each author.  
 Please look carefully at the guidance ( href=""https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance"" - https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance
) to determine whether you will be required to pay the publishing cost, and if so, how much. It ranges from $US350 to $US1000. Please note that any cost must be paid 45 days before the start of the conference and that there are serious consequences for non-payment. Given the potential for delays and absences over the holiday period, please ensure that payments are made no later than 28 December 2024. We can confirm that most Australian universities are members of ACM Open, but we have not checked the situation for each submission.  
 CHAIRS   
 To contact the chairs, please use the conference EasyChair email address: href=""mailto:ACE_2025@easychair.org"" - ace_2025@easychair.org
. If you send an email to this address, you are likely to receive a bounce reply indicating that it could not be forwarded. Please ignore that reply. All emails sent to that address are forwarded correctly to the chairs. Alternatively, you can contact them directly:

 Guidelines for authors  

 Papers must be in English and must be original contributions that have not been published previously, nor submitted to other conferences or journals in parallel with this conference.  
 Papers must be between 5 and 10 pages long (inclusive of any references). Papers are required to conform to the formatting guidelines of the ACM Conference paper guides. Authors should use the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) – SIG Proceedings Template:  
  
 LaTeX template 
  MS Word template 
   
 If you are using Latex, use the “sigconf” style in documentclass (which is the default if you create a project using the LaTeX link above). Page length includes references. The accepted format for submissions is Portable Document Format (PDF). Microsoft Word and LaTeX template files are available at the website link above. We recommend using the LaTeX template where possible, but if you choose to use MS Word, then please use the Interim Template listed on the ACM conference proceedings page listed above.  
 By submitting to the conference, authors accept that they are aware of the Guidelines on Research Practice in Computer Science by the Computer Research and Education Association (CORE). In particular, authors are encouraged to review the points on authorship.  
 Please review the Guidelines for authors on this site, before submitting.  
 Double-blind reviewing requirements:  It is standard practice that identities of reviewers are not made known to authors. The double-blind review process extends this principle so that reviewers do not know the identity of authors. This process requires authors to refrain from identifying themselves in their own paper. Below are some guidelines for anonymising your paper.  
  
 If you are using the ACM template correctly, you can tell it to create an anonymous version of the pdf; this will take care of explicit mentions of the author names. 
  If you are not yet using the template (you should be!), in place of the usual author and address details, put “Author details suppressed” or something equivalent. Where there are more than three authors contributing to a paper, limit the number of author spaces to three in the anonymised version. 
  Refrain from references to your university or campus by name. If you feel that a description of your university is in some way salient to the paper, use generalities. For example, use ""our University"" instead of ""Maintown University of Technology"". 
  Avoid expressions like “In earlier work we …” followed by a citation of a paper authored by yourself. 
  If you have an acknowledgements section, omit it for the blind submission. 
  Do not link to webpages in your anonymised paper. 
  Once you have a pdf copy of your paper, see how well it is blinded. Some PDF creation software includes document properties such as the author name or institution. Some operating systems will show such document properties when the cursor hovers over the file name. Be especially careful to disguise or remove these properties. 
   
 In general, apply good judgement when preparing your submission, to maintain the integrity of the double-blind process. Submissions that allow the author to be identified may be returned to you for editing at short notice, or may be rejected outright.  
 Registration for ACSW:  At least one author of an accepted paper must register to attend ACSW. When submitting a paper, you will be asked to nominate who will be attending ACE and presenting the paper if it is accepted. Papers not presented at ACE will be withdrawn from the proceedings. Please see the ACSW site for registration.

 ACHI 2025: Call for Papers   
 Onsite and Online Options: In order to accommodate various situations, we are offering the option for either physical presence or virtual participation (pdf slides or pre-recorded videos).   
 The Eighteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interaction, ACHI 2025  , was proposed as a result of a paradigm shift in the most recent achievements and future trends in human interactions with increasingly complex systems. Adaptive and knowledge-based user interfaces, universal accessibility, human-robot interaction, agent-driven human computer interaction, and sharable mobile devices are a few of these trends. ACHI 2025  also brings a suite of specific domain applications, such as gaming, e-learning, social, medicine, teleconferencing and engineering.  
 ACHI 2025 continues  a series of events targeting traditional and advanced paradigms for computer-human interaction in multi-technology environments. The conference covers also fundamentals on interfaces and models, and highlights new challenging industrial applications and research topics.  
 We solicit both academic, research, and industrial contributions. We welcome technical papers presenting research and practical results, position papers addressing the pros and cons of specific proposals, such as those being discussed in the standard fora or in industry consortia, survey papers addressing the key problems and solutions on any of the above topics short papers on work in progress, and panel proposals.  
 Industrial presentations are not subject to the format and content constraints of regular submissions. We expect short and long presentations that express industrial position and status.

 Overview  
 ACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. ACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and by the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.  
 Papers submitted to ACL 2025, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics.  
 Paper Submission Information  
 Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2025 February cycle. Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2025 February cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to ACL 2025 via the conference commitment site (TBA).  
 Submission Topics  
 ACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas (in alphabetical order):  
 Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics 
  Dialogue and Interactive Systems 
  Discourse and Pragmatics 
  Efficient/Low-Resource Methods for NLP 
  Ethics, Bias, and Fairness 
  Generation 
  Human-Centered NLP 
  Information Extraction 
  Information Retrieval and Text Mining 
  Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP 
  Language Modeling 
  Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics

  Special Theme | : Generalization of NLP Models 
  ACL 2025 Theme Track: Generalization of NLP Models  
 Following the success of the ACL 2020-2024 Theme tracks, we are happy to announce that ACL 2025 will have a new theme with the goal of reflecting and stimulating discussion about the current state of development of the field of NLP.  
 Generalization is crucial for ensuring that models behave robustly, reliably, and fairly when making predictions on data different from their training data. Achieving good generalization is critically important for models used in real-world applications, as they should emulate human-like behavior. Humans are known for their ability to generalize well, and models should aspire to this standard.  
 The theme track invites empirical and theoretical research and position and survey papers reflecting on the Generalization of NLP Models. The possible topics of discussion include (but are not limited to) the following:  
 How can we enhance the generalization of NLP models across various dimensions—compositional, structural, cross-task, cross-lingual, cross-domain, and robustness? 
  What factors affect the generalization of NLP models? 
  What are the most effective methods for evaluating the generalization capabilities of NLP models? 
  While Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhance the generalization of NLP models, what are the key limitations of LLMs in this regard? 
  The theme track submissions can be either long or short. We anticipate having a special session for this theme at the conference and a Thematic Paper Award in addition to other categories of awards.  
 Two-Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to ACL 2025  
 ACL 2025 will use href=""https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp"" - ACL Rolling Review
(ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the Open Review platform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:  
 Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors; 
  Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., ACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews. 
  ACL 2025 has chosen this approach in coordination with *CL 2024 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, after a paper has been fully reviewed, authors have the option to commit their paper to a conference or revise and resubmit for another round of reviews.  
 The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers, and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.  
 Mandatory Reviewing Workload  
 As the pace of research in the field continues to increase, we need to strengthen the commitment to reviewing for each paper submission. During the ARR submission process, authors will be required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing in this reviewing cycle. Please see the new ARR policy regarding reviewing workload here. As this is an ARR-wide policy for all *CL conferences, questions or clarifications should be addressed to ARR directly.  
 Important Dates  
 Submission deadline (all papers are submitted to ARR) | : February 15, 2025 
  ARR reviews & meta-reviews available to authors of the February cycle | : April 15, 2025

  Following the href=""https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/report-acl-committee-anonymity-policy"" - ACL and ARR policies
, there is no anonymity period requirement.   
 At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., ACL 2025). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected ACL 2025 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to ACL 2025 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than ACL 2025 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to ACL 2025.  
 Presentation at the Conference  
 All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline may be subject to desk rejection. Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.

 ACII 2025  

 The ACII 2025 organising committee is delighted to bring the ACII conference series to Australia for the first time. ACII 2025 will be an in-person event  held at the Hotel Realm conference venue in Canberra, Australia.   
 The ACII conference series – organized by the Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing ( AAAC , formerly known as Humaine) – is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognise, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena.  
 The theme for ACII 2025 is Socially Responsible Affective Computing   .  
 The main conference days will be on 8-10 Oct 2025, while workshops and tutorials will be held on Saturday, 11 Oct 2025. This ‘reverse’ conference schedule for  ACII 2025 will allow for maximum flexibility for attendees who also want to attend the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (  href=""https://icmi.acm.org/2025/"" - ICMI 2025
, 13-17 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling to combine two excellent conferences in one trip. While the organising committees of ACII 2025 and ICMI 2025 are separate, the teams work closely together and investigate registration options that will allow for different combinations of attending the two conferences for those who cannot attend both conferences in full. Further details will be provided in due time. (Sunday, 12 Oct 2025 will be a rest and recovery day for those attending both conferences.)

 Call for Papers   
 The Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC) invites you to submit your original research for presentation at the 13th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), which will be held as an in-person event  in Canberra, Australia, 8-11 October 2025. Accepted papers must be presented by one of the paper’s authors.    
 ACII 2025 will be held just before the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction ( href=""https://icmi.acm.org/2025/"" - ICMI 2025
, 13-17 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling the attendees to combine two excellent conferences in one trip.   
 The ACII conference series is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognise, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena. All accepted papers will be included in IEEE Xplore (subject to approval by the IEEE Computer Society) and indexed by EI. A selection of the best articles at ACII 2025 will be invited to submit extended versions to the IEEE   Transactions on Affective Computing   .   
 The theme for ACII 2025 is Socially Responsible Affective Computing  . Affective computing, with its ability to recognise and respond to human emotions, holds great potential for enhancing user experiences and fostering more natural interactions between humans and machines. It also has promising applications in fields such as mental health, where this technology can assist psychologists and other clinicians in making more accurate diagnoses by detecting mental states. However, this powerful technology also raises significant ethical concerns that must be addressed to ensure its responsible and transparent use.   
 One of the primary challenges is the potential misuse or exploitation of sensitive emotional data, including for manipulative or discriminatory purposes. Ensuring robust data privacy, clear ethical guidelines, and regulations around the use of emotional data is crucial. Additionally, the lack of transparency of many affective computing algorithms, systems build on limited data, and the potential for biases in emotion inference systems pose risks of perpetuating harmful stereotypes or inaccurate assessments based on factors such as gender, race, or cultural background. Transparency, accountability, and mitigating biases in these systems are essential to build trust with users.   
 Recognising these concerns, regulatory efforts such as the EU AI Act aim to establish legal frameworks and stringent requirements for high-risk AI applications, including those related to emotional state detection, ultimately safeguarding individual rights and upholding ethical principles in the development and deployment of affective computing technologies. A stronger focus needs to be placed on these matters by the affective computing research community.   
 The ACII 2025 (8-11 Oct 2025) and ICMI 2025 (13-17 Oct 2025) conferences will be held in back-to-back mode at the same venue in Canberra, Australia – one trip, two great conferences!

  Submission Guidelines  
 All papers for ACM WiSec 2025 must be submitted electronically through the HotCRP conference management system.  
 First Cycle: | href=""https://wisec25.hotcrp.com/"" - HotCRP submission site for Cycle 1 
  Second Cycle: | href=""https://wisec25-cycle2.hotcrp.com"" - HotCRP submission site for Cycle 2 
  Only PDF files will be accepted. Submissions must be prepared using the following ACM proceedings template and must use US Letter page size (215.9 x 279.4 mm / 8.5 x 11 inches):  
 The ACM proceedings template for LaTeX can be found at | Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - SIG Proceedings Template | . 
  Please look at | ACM Primary Article Template | for further information on ACM proceedings templates. 
  Full, short, and SoK papers  
 Full paper submissions must be at most 10 pages in double-column ACM format (use document option “sigconf”), excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for double-blind review.  
 Detailed submission instructions will be made available as the deadline approaches.  
 In addition to regular papers that present novel contributions in the field, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 15 pages overall. They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  
 Posters and demos  
 WiSec will solicit the submission of posters and demos. The instructions to submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  
 Artifact Evaluation label  
 In the spirit of open science, WiSec encourages authors of accepted papers to make software and data artifacts publicly available to the community.  
 Such artifacts will be evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee and corresponding papers will be granted an artifact evaluation label. While artifacts are optional, their availability will be positively considered during paper evaluation. Should the authors choose to submit their artifacts for evaluation, they should indicate their decision upon paper submission and follow the artifact submission guidelines in order to submit them upon paper acceptance. The detailed guidelines will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  
 Double submissions  
 It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions, where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved. Technical reports and pre-prints published online are allowed.  
 Workshops and Tutorial  
 ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorials that are co-organized with the main conference. Details will be made available on the website.  
 Research Ethics  
 The ethical conduct of research is critical to ensuring the public’s trust and support of science. All submitted papers will be reviewed for ethical concerns, and if ethical practices are not followed a paper will be rejected regardless of any other merit. Ethical concerns vary from project to project, so there is no “one size fits all” approach. Rather, researchers should consider ethical analysis to be an integral part of the research, just as evaluation and method design are. Ethics should be considered early in a project, during a project, and as the project is prepared for publication.  
 While every situation is unique, there are principles that researchers should consider and apply during their projects. The Menlo Report provides guidance and examples for network security. Principally, all research should embody the concepts of beneficence, justice, respect for persons, and respect of law and public interest. This is just as true for technical research as human subjects research. For example, if it is possible that a research method could cause harm to systems or users (e.g., testing jamming) researchers should explicitly detail the measures taken to prevent harm.  
 Research ethics is also paramount in any study that could be classified as “human subjects.” For WiSec, “human subject research” is defined as “research that involves interaction with identifiable humans or analysis of datasets containing data from one or more identifiable living humans.” Researchers are expected to follow the laws and common practices regarding human subjects review of their relevant jurisdictions and institutions. For example, researchers in the United States must undergo review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before beginning human subjects research. Authors doing human subjects research should mention the review standards in their jurisdictions and if they were met.  
 Computer security and privacy research often studies and even advanced tools and techniques with the capacity to harm others. In their submission, authors must convince reviewers that appropriate steps were taken to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to appropriate parties  
 Policy for Peer-Review Integrity  
 All SIGSAC-sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities ( https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment ) and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ( https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) . Also, all authors, PC members, and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc) . Particularly, we require all reviewers to uphold the integrity of the peer review process and avoid conflict of interest of any form (e.g., reviewer collusion ring). Those who violate these policies will be penalized according to ACM policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/penalties-for-publication-violations) . If you would like to report a violation, please contact program chairs of your conferences/workshops or SIGSAC officers. We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your communication.

 Welcome to the 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia!  

 Welcome to ACM Multimedia, the premier international conference dedicated to advancing research and applications across diverse multimedia fields. This conference brings together leading minds from academia and industry to explore cutting-edge developments in areas such as video, haptics, virtual and augmented reality, audio, speech, music, sensor, and social data. With a strong focus on integrating and exchanging information across modalities, ACM Multimedia encourages innovative approaches that have the potential for significant technological breakthroughs and positive real-world impacts. As a community with a rich tradition of leveraging AI and systems research to handle big data and enhance user experiences, we also place a unique emphasis on novel applications and addressing urgent industrial challenges. The conference warmly welcomes new intellectual perspectives and submissions from a wide range of related disciplines, including artificial intelligence, 3D & metaverse, vision and languages, human-computer interaction, and multimedia signal processing. We are particularly excited to see contributions that push the boundaries of multimedia in fields such as healthcare, education, and entertainment. Join us as we explore the future of multimedia innovation through the lens of four major conference themes, and help shape the next generation of groundbreaking multimedia technologies.   
 This year, ACM Multimedia 2025 will be held in Dublin, Ireland, and will be colocated with both CBMI 2025 and MediaEval 2025, both of which immediately precede the conference. At ACM Multimedia 2025, we expect to welcome you all to Dublin for an extensive in-person program consisting of technical sessions covering all aspects of the multimedia field via oral, video and poster presentations, tutorials, panels, exhibits, demonstrations, workshops, doctoral symposium, multimedia grand challenge, brave new ideas on shaping the research landscape, and open source software competition. Welcome to Dublin.

 Call for Regular Papers  
  
 ACM Multimedia is the premier conference in multimedia, a research field that discusses emerging computing methods from a perspective in which each medium — e.g. images, text, audio — is a strong component of the complete, integrated exchange of information. The multimedia community has a tradition of being able to handle big data, has been a pioneer in large-scale evaluations and dataset creations, and is uniquely angled towards novel applications and cutting-edge industrial challenges. As such the conference openly embraces new intellectual angles from both industry as well as academia and welcomes submissions from related fields, such as data science, HCI, and signal processing.  
 ACM Multimedia 2025 calls for research papers presenting novel theoretical and algorithmic solutions to address problems across multimedia and related application fields. The conference also calls for papers presenting novel, thought-provoking ideas, and promising (preliminary) results in realising these ideas, especially surrounding multimodal AI, such as multi-agent, real-time human and machine intelligence working collaboratively. The conference invites papers in five major themes of multimedia: Generative AI, Engagement, Experience, Systems and Understanding, as described href=""https://acmmm2025.org/research-topics/"" - here
.  
 The conference invites research papers of varying lengths from 6 to 8 pages, plus additional pages for the reference pages; i.e., the reference page(s) are not counted towards the page limit of 6 to 8 pages. Please note that there is no longer a distinction between long and short papers, but the authors may themselves decide on the appropriate length of the paper. All papers will undergo the same review process and review period.  
  
 Submission Deadlines  
 Abstract submission: 04.04.2025  
 Regular paper submission: 11.04.2025 (including supplementary materials, if applicable)   
 Please note: The submission deadline is at 23:59 of the stated deadline date Anywhere on Earth. See the full list of  href=""https://acmmm2025.org/important-dates/"" - Important Dates
 .  
  
 Submission Instructions  
 Submit your href=""https://openreview.net/group?id=acmmm.org/ACMMM/2025/Conference"" - Regular Paper via OpenReview
.  
 Submission system:    
 ACM MM’25 uses OpenReview for paper submission and peer review. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.   
 All listed authors must have an up-to-date  OpenReview profile. The following page contains information on  how to create   an OpenReview profile. Note OpenReview’s moderation policy for newly created profiles:   
 New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks. 
  New profiles created with an institutional email will (normally) be activated automatically. 
  The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflicts of interest and paper matching. An incomplete OpenReview profile of any co-author is sufficient ground for desk rejection.   
 To be considered complete, each author profile must be properly attributed with the following mandatory fields: current and past institutional affiliation (going back at least 5 years), homepage, DBLP (if there is prior publication), ORCID, Advisors and Recent Publications (if any). In addition, other fields such as Google Scholar, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar, Advisees and Other Relations should be entered wherever applicable.   
 Please note that we may ask any author to also serve as a reviewer. Authors who are also serving as reviewers will not be able to see the reviews on their own paper until they complete the reviews assigned to them in a proper and timely manner.   
 For any question or inquiry, please contact <  href=""mailto:tpc@acmmm2025.org"" - tpc@acmmm2025.org
>   
  
 Multimedia/multimodality Policy for Paper Submissions  
 As the volume of submissions to the MM conference continues to grow annually, the SIGMM community seeks to distinguish itself from other communities such as NeurIPS, CVPR, and ECCV. Our focus lies in promoting research that is inherently multimedia or multimodal in nature. While papers that involve unimedia/unimodal processing will not necessarily be rejected, papers that make multimedia/multimodal research contributions will be preferred for publication in the conference proceedings. Out-of-scope submissions may be desk-rejected.   
   
 Paper Format  
 Submitted papers (.pdf format) must use the ACM Article Template (  https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template ). Please remember to add Concepts and Keywords. Please use the template in traditional double-column format to prepare your submissions. For example, word users should use Word Interim Template, and LaTeX users should use sample-sigconf-authordraft template. When using sample-sigconf-authordraft template, for submission and review of manuscript you could use the following documentclass command instead of the example provided in the template:   \documentclass[sigconf, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart}   
  Please ensure that you submit your papers subscribing to this format for full consideration during the review process.   
  
 Policy on Authorship and Generative AI Tools  
 Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. If generative AI language tools generate inappropriate language, plagiarized content, errors, mistakes, incorrect references, or misleading content, and that output is included in scientific works, author(s) will take full responsibility for the same. For details and more polices, please see here.  
  
 Length  
 Submitted papers may consist of up to 8 pages. Up to two additional pages may be added for references. The reference pages must only contain references. Overlength papers will be rejected without review. Optionally, you may upload supplementary material that complements your submission (50Mb limit).  
  All the content other than that in the main paper should be written in the separate supplementary material. We do not allow appendix that follow right after the main paper in the main submission file.  
  
 Blinding  
 Paper submissions must conform with the “double-blind” review policy. This means that the authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the names of the authors. Please prepare your paper in a way that preserves anonymity of the authors. For reviewer assignment, the technical program chairs may employ local LLM instances or similar technologies to process your submissions. No information will be shared with third parties.   
 Do not put the authors’ names under the title. 
  Avoid using phrases such as “our previous work” when referring to earlier publications by the authors. 
  Remove information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs). 
  Check supplemental material (e.g., titles in the video clips, or supplementary documents) for information that may identify the authors’ identities. 
  Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. 
  Papers without appropriate blinding will be rejected without review. 
   
 Originality  
 Papers submitted to ACM Multimedia must be the original work of the authors. The may not be simultaneously under review elsewhere. Publications that have been peer-reviewed and have appeared at other conferences or workshops may not be submitted to ACM Multimedia (see also the arXiv/Archive policy below). Authors should be aware that ACM has a strict policy with regard to plagiarism and self-plagiarism (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism). The authors’ prior work must be cited appropriately.  
  
 Author List  
 Please ensure that you submit your papers with the full and final list of authors in the correct order. The author list registered for each submission is not allowed to change in any way after the full paper submission deadline. (Note that this rule regards the identity of authors, e.g., typos are correctable.)  
  
 Paper Title  
 As per MM Policy, paper titles should remain the same between the camera-ready version and submission.  
  
 Proofreading  
 Please proofread your submission carefully. It is essential that the language used in the paper is clear and correct so that it is easily understandable. (Either US English or UK English spelling conventions are acceptable.)  
  
 ArXiv/Archive Policy  
 In accordance with ACM guidelines, all SIGMM-sponsored conferences adhere to the following policy regarding arXiv papers:  
 We define a publication as a written piece documenting scientific work that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, has been accepted.  Documentation of scientific work that is published in a not-for-profit archive without any form of peer-review (departmental Technical Report, arXiv.org, etc.) is not considered a publication.  However, this definition of publication does include peer-reviewed workshop papers, even if they do not appear in formal proceedings. Any submission to ACM Multimedia must not have substantial overlap with prior publications or other work currently undergoing peer review anywhere.  Note that documents published on website archives are subject to change. Citing such documents is discouraged. Furthermore, ACM Multimedia will review the documents formally submitted and any additional information in a web archive version will not affect the review.   
   
 Rebuttal Policies  
 After receiving the reviews, the authors may optionally submit a rebuttal to address the reviewers’ comments. The rebuttal is limited to a One page PDF file using the rebuttal template. Responses longer than one page will simply not be reviewed. This includes responses where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those specified by the style guide (deleting the title to get some space is acceptable).  
  The rebuttal must maintain anonymity. It cannot include links to external material such as code, videos, etc.  
  Authors may optionally contact the Author’s Advocate, whose role is to listen to the authors, and to help them if reviews are clearly below average quality. The Author’s Advocate operates independently from the Technical Program Committee.

 Update to the AIAI Community from the Organisers  
 Dear Colleagues,  
 On behalf of the 21 st  AIAI (Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations) 2025 Organizing and Scientific Committee, it is a real honor and pleasure to welcome all Artificial Intelligence scholars who are looking for a well-established and prestigious forum to communicate and disseminate the innovative advances of their research. It is a fact that AI is continuously digging its way in a vast number of diverse scientific domains. AIAI aims to provide a forum for delegates from both academia and industry, who wish to share pioneer ideas, to get to know each other better and to present their research. Moreover, it aims to offer a deep glimpse into the future and to examine important AI ethical aspects.  
 The Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations  (AIAI) Conference has been held continuously since 2005, under the auspices of the IFIP WG12.5. Through the years, it has evolved to a well-respected and mature event, under the technical and scientific co-sponsorship of the AIAI community. This community comprises of an extended Group of leading scientists, not only from Europe but from all over the globe.  
 The h-index of the AIAI event is as high as 39  . This proves the novelty and quality of the presented-published research and its important contribution to the promotion of scientific ideas, algorithms and methods, globally. The fact that the conference Springer Proceedings, have been downloaded more than 2,800,000  times so far, supports the robust impact of the event among the scholars of AI internationally.. href=""https://ifipaiai.org/2025/message-of-the-organizers/"" - …[read more]

  Notification of acceptance/shepherding: | June 4, 2025 
  Camera-ready papers/end of shepherding: | July 15, 2025 
  Paper Submission  
 ADBIS 2025 invites original papers (not submitted elsewhere in parallel) describing results that broadly belong to the aforementioned list of topics. Accepted long papers will be published in a Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volume and accepted short papers are published in Springer's Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) series. The program committee may decide to accept a submission as a short paper if it reports interesting results but does not justify publication of a full paper.  
 LONG papers can be:   
 Regular research papers, reporting novel, solid research findings within the scope of the conference, typically but not exclusively found in proposing new models, querying or data handling methods, algorithms, data structures, and system architectures for the management of data. 
  Experimental re-evaluation papers, assessing previously published research results in terms of (i) performance evaluation for algorithms and systems, or, (ii) assessment of the application for methodologies, with the contribution of the paper being found (i) in the evaluation findings and (ii) in the discussion of strong and weak aspects of the algorithm/system/method being assessed. 
  SHORT papers can be:   
 Early findings/work-in-progress reports for prompt dissemination and discussion of early research results, that include early experimental findings and implementations, with an emphasis on (i) the description of the early findings, (ii) the possibilities they present, and, (iii) the difficulties being faced towards full fruition. 
  Vision papers, discussing possibilities and challenges in the exploration of radically new system architectures or methodologies for data management in important areas related to the scope of the conference, or areas that are currently considered outside the scope of the conference but hold the potential of becoming relevant. 
  Submission Guidelines  
 The page limits are as follows:  
 LONG (research or experimental) papers: 16 LNCS style pages, including references 
  SHORT (early findings or visionary) papers: up to 10 LNCS style pages, including references 
  Papers should be submitted in PDF format using the CMT  online submission system at: href=""https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADBIS2025"" - https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADBIS2025
.  
 Authors should consult href=""https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines"" - Springer’s authors’ guidelines
and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Licence-to-Publish agreement. The corresponding author, who must match the corresponding author marked on the paper, must have the full right, power, and authority to sign the agreement on behalf of all of the authors of a particular paper, and accepts responsibility for releasing this material on their behalf. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. An author of an accepted paper must register to ADBIS 2025 in order to have the paper published, and accepted papers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors.  
 Shepherding  
 Borderline papers will go through a shepherding phase where they will be expected to address the concerns of the reviewers, expressed as a list of required revisions. Failing to properly address them in due time will entail final rejection. The shepherding process will involve: authors will be given a list of issues/improvements that have to be addressed within 3 weeks’ time; authors improve the paper addressing these concerns; authors submit the revised paper in camera-ready format; the PC chairs ultimately decide whether the revised paper is acceptable as is or not to the final program.  
 Shepherding Schedule  
 The schedule for shepherding is as follows (All deadlines are 11:59 PM AoE):  
 Notification of shepherding status: | June 4, 2025 
  Authors submit revised, camera-ready version: | June 24, 2024 
  Notification of acceptance for shepherded papers: | July 1, 2024 
  Camera-ready documents and copyright: | July 15, 2024 
  Awards  
 Springer will sponsor the ADBIS 2025 Best Paper Award, Best PhD Symposium Paper Award, Best Demonstration and Best Short Paper, which will be announced during the ADBIS 2025 Banquet.  
 Special Issue  
 The best papers of the conference will be invited to submit an extended and revised version of their paper to a special issue in the Information Systems journal of Elsevier ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-systems ).  
 Inclusion and Diversity in Writing and Presentation  
 Authors are strongly encouraged to be inclusive in writing and presentation of their work.  
  Please visit the subsection ""D&I materials"" at https://dbdni.github.io/ for details.  
 Use of Generative AI  
 Authors should explicitly disclose the use of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in their manuscripts when these tools are employed for more than just editing the author’s text. This disclosure can be made through a statement placed at the end of the manuscript, preceding the References section.  
 If it comes to our notice that a submission utilized large language models (LLMs) without clear disclosure, such papers will be subject to immediate desk rejection. However, if there is no usage of such technologies, no disclosure statement is required.

  href=""https://acns25-cycle2.hotcrp.com/"" - PAPER SUBMISSION

  Instructions for Authors  
 Submissions must be done via the HotCRP website. The link will be announced shortly before the paper deadline.  
 ACNS 2025 will be an in-person  conference. Since remote presentations or videos will not be accepted, authors submitting a paper must ensure that one of the authors can present the paper at the conference in person.  
 Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published (other than preprint) or accepted for publication or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings. Information about submissions may be shared with program chairs of other conferences for that purpose.  
 ACNS encourages promising students to submit and present their results at the conference. ACNS gives a best student paper award, with a 1500 EUR prize sponsored by Springer, to encourage promising students to publish their best results at this venue. To be eligible, the paper must be co- authored by at least one full-time student who will present the paper at the conference.  
 Systematization of Knowledge   
 ACNS 2025 solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable to help our community to clarify and put into context complex research problems.  
 It is important to stress that SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research (like in a survey) but also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.  
 We encourage the authors to distinguish SoK submissions by adding the “SoK:” prefix to the title. SoK submissions will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, but they will be accepted based on their treatment of existing work and value to the community, and not based on any new research results they may contain. Accepted papers will be presented at the conference and included in the proceedings.  
  Submission Guidelines  
 Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. Each submission must begin with a title, short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non- specialist reader.  
 All submissions must be submitted in PDF format, following the unmodified LNCS format (accessible on the href=""https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines"" - Springer LCNS author guidelines
 webpage) and typeset using the corresponding LaTeX class file. They must fit within a page limit of 20 pages, including title and abstract, figures, etc., but excluding references. Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following the main body of the paper; however, reviewers are not required to read or review any supplementary material, and submissions are expected to be intelligible without it. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. To accommodate for changes requested in reviews, the page limit for the camera-ready proceedings versions is 30 pages, including references and appendices.  
 For papers that might raise ethical concerns, authors are expected to convince reviewers that proper procedures (such as Institutional Review Board approval) have been followed and due diligence has been made to minimize potential harm.  
 ACNS 2025 has two submission deadlines (in September and January) that authors may choose to submit their papers to. Papers rejected after the September round cannot be resubmitted at the January round.  
 We will publish our proceedings with Springer as a volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  
  Conflicts of Interest  
 The program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and program committee members to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest. During the submission process, we will ask authors to identify members of the program committee with whom they share a conflict of interest.  
 We regard the following relationships as conflicts of interest:  
 1. Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission (including secondary affiliations and consulting work),  
 2. Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past,  
 3. Anyone the author has collaborated or published within the prior two years,  
 4. Anyone who is serving as the sponsor or administrator of a grant that funds your research, or  
 5. Close personal or family ties.  
 If authors want to specify a conflict of another type than those listed above, they must contact the chairs and explain the perceived conflict. Program committee members who are in a conflict of interest with a paper, including program co-chairs, will be excluded from the evaluation and discussion of the paper by default.  
  Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure (adapted from IEEE S&P)  
 Where research identifies a vulnerability (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program, design weaknesses in a hardware system, or any other kind of vulnerability in deployed systems), we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. In nearly every case, disclosing the vulnerability to vendors of affected systems, and other stakeholders, will help protect users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days  to 90 days  ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.  
 Longer disclosure windows (which may keep vulnerabilities from the public for extended periods of time) should only be considered in exceptional situations, e.g., if the affected parties have provided convincing evidence the vulnerabilities were previously unknown and the full rollout of mitigations requires additional time. The authors are encouraged to consult with the PC chairs in case of questions or concerns.  
 The version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities; but, consistent with the timelines above, the authors do not have to disclose vulnerabilities ahead of submission. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
  Diversity and Inclusion  
 ACNS is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our community. If you have suggestions, concerns, or complaints related to biases or sexual harassment, we encourage you to reach out to the Conference Co-Chairs. We are committed to protecting the anonymity of such reports and helping to address your concerns. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community.  
 We encourage authors to be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions.

 Hard Topic Theme: Security Applications of Generative AI   
 This year's hard topic theme solicits research results and technologies that advance our understanding of the applicability of Generative AI and Large Language Models to computer security. These transformative new technologies can have a significant impact in addressing traditional security problems, such as vulnerability detection, fraud detection, reverse engineering, threat intelligence, and many others. At the same time, the complexity of these systems also exposes new potential vulnerabilities that are still not well understood by the research community.

 ACSAC solicits papers offering novel contributions in any aspect of applied security research. We encourage papers with results that are demonstrably useful for improving cybersecurity and that address lessons learned from practical applications. In particular, we encourage the submission of papers related to our hard topic theme: Security Applications of Generative AI . Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published elsewhere or that have been simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with proceedings and are under review.  
   
 href=""https://papers.submit.acsac.org/"" - Make Submission
 
 ** New this year **  Reproduction and Replication (R+R) Papers:  Security research is often criticized for the poor reproducibility of its results, a situation we aim to address through artifact evaluation. At the same time, reproduction and replication studies are often undervalued in academic publishing. Thus, in addition to regular papers and artifact evaluations, this year we are also soliciting studies that confirm, question, or clarify the results of previous research. These papers must contain the prefix “R+R:” in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.  
 We encourage submissions to follow the ACM guidelines on reproducibility (different team, same experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-use) and replicability (different team, different experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-implementation). Note, however, that submissions need to go beyond re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper(s) or re-implementing their approach. We are looking for submissions that not only replicate existing studies but also critically assess, clarify and extend their findings and limitations. This includes, but is not limited to, the verification of existing research results, ensuring their validity and reliability across different contexts, lessons learned when applying research results in real-world (industry) settings, and the adaption of artifacts to contemporary cybersecurity challenges.  
 Reproduction and replication papers will be held to the same scientific standards as original technical papers, will be reviewed by the full program committee, will appear in the proceedings, and will be presented at the conference as part of the technical program. We also particularly encourage these types of papers to provide their artifacts.  
 Review Process:  Paper submissions will be judged based on novelty, relevance to the conference topics, technical correctness, quality of the evaluation, and presentation clarity. Papers will undergo a double-blind review process in two rounds. At the end of Round 1, papers for which a strong consensus towards rejection is reached will be notified of the early rejection decision, giving them the opportunity to improve their paper based on the reviewers’ feedback and to resubmit to other venues. Papers that advance to Round 2 will be assigned additional reviewers. At the end of Round 2, the authors of papers that advanced to this stage will have an opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and comments. After the authors' response period, the papers will be further discussed by the Program Committee (PC) to reach a final decision.  
 Three outcomes are possible: Accepted, Minor Revision, and Rejected. The Minor Revision decision is reserved to papers that can be considered as conditionally accepted, assuming improvements required by the reviewers are made within the available revision time window and are approved by the PC. A PC member will be assigned as shepherd for Minor Revision papers, to guide the authors through the revision process and to lead the discussion on the revised paper among the reviewers. The revision requirements may include both presentation improvements and additional experiments that the PC believes are necessary to significantly improve the paper and that should be feasible within a limited time frame. While Minor Revision papers that do not meet the required changes may be rejected, the expectation is that most papers will be able to satisfy the required improvements and be finally accepted into the conference program. Both the author's responses and the discussions around revision requirements for Minor Revision papers will be handled anonymously, via the paper submission system.  
 Paper Artifacts:  Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to submit their software and data artifacts for formal evaluation by the Artifacts Evaluation Committee and to make them publicly available to the entire community. During submission, authors of papers whose main contributions and experimental results rely primarily on new or reproduced artifacts (e.g., code and/or data) should indicate whether they will separately submit their artifacts for evaluation, if their paper is accepted. This acknowledgement will be visible to the reviewers and may therefore be taken into consideration during the review process. Authors who have justifiable reasons to not submit their artifacts for evaluation (in case their paper is accepted) should add a comment in the corresponding comment box in the submission form. Additionally, during paper submission authors can optionally provide a URL pointing to a repository containing their paper artifacts. While artifacts will be formally evaluated only if the paper is accepted, as explained above, reviewers may also take into account the availability and quality of the paper artifacts during the main paper review process, before making a final decision (please refer to the paper submission form for additional details).  
 Important:  When preparing the artifacts repository for inclusion in the paper submission form, please take extra care to not include authors’ information in the repository or artifacts content, so as not to break the anonymity of the paper submission. Additional information and recommendations on anonymizing the artifacts repository can be found here .  
 Ethical Considerations:  Papers that might raise ethical concerns (e.g., papers that use human subjects, leverage potentially sensitive data, or describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems) must include an Ethical Considerations section that properly describes what procedures have been followed to minimize potential harm. Such papers should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties, whether an institutional ethics committee reviewed the research, or how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software/system vendors or owners before publication.  
 Paper Format:  Please ensure that your submission consists of a PDF file of no more than 10 double-column pages, excluding well-marked references and appendices limited to a maximum of 5 pages. The full PDF document must not exceed a total of 15 pages. Please note that PC members are not required to read the appendices and that page limits will be strictly enforced.  
 Papers must be appropriately anonymized to the dual anonymous review process. Author names and affiliations must not be included in the PDF submission. Authors can cite and refer to their own prior work, but must do so in the third person, as if it was written by someone else. In the rare case that citing previous work in the third person is not possible, please anonymize the reference and notify the Program Chairs.  
 Submission Process:  Submissions must be generated using the double-column ACM format (see template available at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template ) using the [sigconf, anonymous]  options. Submissions should not use older ACM templates (e.g., sig-alternate). All papers must be submitted exclusively through the ACSAC 2024 paper submission system. Note that paper title and abstract registration is not necessary ahead of the paper submission.  
 All formatting guidelines and constraints (e.g., page limits and anonymity) will be strictly enforced. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

 General call for paper  
 The 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025) will take place between July 22-26, 2025 in Palermo, Italy.  
  THE AIED 2025 THEME   
 “AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future”   

 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is progressing at an unprecedented rate, with generative AI and related technologies leading this transformative shift. These advancements are set to reshape education in significant ways, offering novel opportunities to enhance both teaching and learning processes. At the same time, more ‘traditional’ AI techniques continue to be developed, bringing in new insights. AI is expanding the horizons of what is achievable in education, enabling the creation of personalised and dynamic learning experiences. As these technologies continue to evolve, they equip educators with powerful tools to gain deeper insights into student needs, tailor instruction and resources to individual learning paths, and promote greater student engagement. AI is no longer merely an auxiliary tool — it is fundamentally transforming the core of educational practices, making learning environments more adaptive, accessible, and impactful.  
 The AIED 2025 conference, themed “AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future,”  centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education. By harnessing AI’s capacity to personalise learning experiences, educators can address the diverse needs of students and mitigate educational disparities, particularly among underserved and marginalised communities. This year’s theme also underscores the critical importance of ethical AI integration, ensuring that these advanced technologies are deployed responsibly to uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and privacy. We welcome submissions that investigate how AI can act as a catalyst for cultivating a more equitable and inclusive educational environment, ultimately empowering both teachers and students in the pursuit of a more just and accessible future.  
 AIED 2025 will be the 26th edition of this conference series. The AIED Society, organiser of the AIED conference, aims at advancing science and engineering of intelligent human-technology ecosystems that support learning. The conference will be the latest of a longstanding series of international conferences, known for high quality and innovative research on AI-assisted systems and cognitive science approaches for educational computing applications. AIED is ranked A in CORE (top 16% of all 783 ranked venues)  , the well-known ranking of computer science conferences. AIED is a venue for researchers, decision makers, stakeholders and practitioners in the areas of AI in Education, and especially welcomes teachers and industry, particularly SMEs involved in AIED. Due to the growth of this important area, AIED 2025 is implementing for the first time a track-based system.  
 Discover the Tracks  
 We are excited that this year’s conference is moving to a new track-based system! To help potential authors in selecting what track to submit to, we will be hosting two recorded information sessions:  
 one on | Monday February 3rd | at 8AM Eastern Standard Time | / 1PM Greenwich Mean Time / 9PM China Standard Time 
  and one on | Tuesday February 4th at 8AM EST | / 1PM GMT / 9PM CST. 
  Register for the information sessions here: https://pitt.zoom.us/meeting/register/y7reWqgRRmCR1QnZPlwjmg  
 Please consider attending if you have questions about what track to submit to.  
 Thus, for its main paper submissions, AIED 2025 solicits empirical and theoretical papers relating to both AI and education in the following lines of research and application, which represent our research tracks:  
 Track 1 – AIED architectures and tools   
 Papers submitted to this track should describe novel advances related to the engineering and development of AIED systems. Papers may be concerned with describing proof-of-concepts that demonstrate the feasibility of novel techniques, as well as real- world implementations that show the potential for reuse or adaptation by other researchers. Example research areas with applications in education include, but are not limited to, multi-agent architectures; tangible interfaces, wearables; speech technologies; virtual and augmented reality; A/B experimentation platforms. Innovative, domain-specific learning application architectures and tools also find a home in this track, for example, language, science, engineering, mathematics, medicine, military, industry, sports; scaling up and large-scale deployment of AIED systems. While papers may describe an evaluation of the system or tool with end-users, the primary scientific contribution of papers submitted to this track should be technical and systems-oriented.  
 Sample Keywords:  AI system (e.g., tutoring systems, conversational agents, assessment systems, learning management systems, simulations), AI devices and tools, newly developed, proof-of-concept, feasibility studies  
  Track 2 – Machine learning and Generative AI   
 Papers submitted to this track should describe advances in or applications of AI-based techniques within education, involving knowledge representation and machine learning. Generative AI-based techniques are also welcome within this track. Data-driven processing techniques (including educational data mining, deep learning, machine learning) in education will constitute the main focus of this track. Example areas are natural language processing for education, video data mining for education, etc. Papers will likely address novel contributions related to modeling learner, teacher, and other stakeholder processes and outcomes, or contributions to representing learning domains. Evaluation techniques in this track rely on computational analyses related, for example, to the accuracy, validity, or reliability of predictive or generative models. While papers will likely describe evaluations on previous datasets or newly collected data, the primary scientific contribution of these papers will be to AI and its application.  
 Sample Keywords:  classifiers, predictive models, learner modeling, learning analytics, LLMs, clustering, data mining, process data, deep learning, feature engineering/extraction  
  Track 3 – Learning, teaching and pedagogy   
 Papers submitted to this track should describe approaches to teaching, learning and evaluations of AIED systems and environments that relate to pedagogical techniques, learning processes, and outcomes, conceived broadly. Both quantitative (survey, correlational, comparative, experimental etc.) and qualitative (case study, ethnography, phenomenology, grounded theory, action research etc.) analysis, as well as mixed-methods approaches are encouraged under this paper category. AIED systems targeted here include, but are not limited, to: AI-assisted tutoring and scaffolding; Motivational diagnosis and feedback; Learner engagement/presence; Interactive pedagogical agents and learning companions; Agents that promote cognition, metacognition, self-regulation, co-regulation, motivation and positive affect; Adaptive question-answering and dialogue, Data-driven modeling (educational data mining, deep learning, machine learning,…); Learning analytics and teaching support, Learning with simulations; Explainability of models for teaching and learning. Learning targeted here refers to both formal and informal learning, including game-based learning; digital collaborative/cooperative and group learning; social networks; inquiry learning; social dimensions of learning; communities of practice; ubiquitous learning environments; learning through construction and making; learning grid; lifelong learning; learning in informal settings (museum, workplace, etc.); learning in the physical space; learning of motor skills. Evaluations here include studies on human learning. Learning spaces include massive open online courses; remote learning at any learning level including k-12 schools, higher education; synchronous, asynchronous, blended learning; mobile learning; active learning in virtual settings; video-based learning; mixed reality and learning. Papers may involve a novel system or a previously existing system, but the primary scientific contribution should be towards understanding the effects of the system and its features on learners, teachers, or other stakeholders. Studies where the focus of the research is fundamentally on the constructs of learning are suitable for this track.  
 Sample Keywords:  Cognitive, behavioral, affective states of learners, pedagogy, effects on learner  
  Track 4 – Human-centered design and design-based research   
 Papers submitted to this track should address design principles for AIED systems or methods for designing such systems, as well as broadening understanding of contextual and individual factors that might inform users’ interactions with these systems  . Papers submitted to this track can explore the design, use, and evaluation of human-AI hybrid systems for learning: research that explores the potential of human-AI interaction in educational contexts; systems and approaches in which educational stakeholders and AI tools build upon each other’s complementary strengths to achieve educational outcomes and/or improve mutually. Solutions explored in this track include human-AI partnership  : shared decision making between systems and users that promote agency and improve learning. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis user-centered design methods are encouraged under this paper category. Papers may involve the study of systems or prototypes that do not currently contain AI, as long as the primary purpose of the paper is to inform the design of AIED systems, putting the user (human) in the center. Evaluations in this track should focus on human-centeredness, or be a means to support human-centred design; or focus on the design and formative studies of AIED systems; in this context, they may include other aspects of the human side of human-AI interaction, such as on human cognition, affect, motivation, engagement, and attitudes. While these papers may also involve the development of a mockup for a new system, the primary scientific contribution should be towards human-centred design, or principles for the design of features of similar systems in similar contexts (as opposed to focusing on the technical implementation of a specific system).  
 Sample Keywords:  human in the centre AI, human-AI partnership, human-in-the-loop, augmented or hybrid systems, humans in the decision-making/ design process, usability with human involvement  
  Track 5 – Teaching AI    
 Papers submitted to this track should involve methods, principles, or technologies for teaching AI or supporting the development of AI literacy. This includes studies on skills and knowledge that enable individuals to understand, use, and critically evaluate AI; definitions of AI literacy; learning to use AI; developing a basic understanding of how AI works; learning to communicate and collaborate with AI; learning to live with AI, understanding limitations and problems of AI. This track especially welcomes work done by or in collaboration with teachers at all levels, from primary to university education. Papers in this track should preferably be based on empirical studies, including small-scale, classroom sized studies; although larger scale studies and theoretical contributions around the topic of teaching AI are also welcomed. Thus, the primary scientific contribution should be towards analysing or improving methods of teaching AI and development of AI literacy.  
 Sample Keywords:  education about AI, teaching AI, AI literacy, critical reflection on AI applications, data literacy  
  Track 6 – Ethics, Equity, and AIED in Society     
 Papers submitted to this track should take a perspective on AIED as it relates to society at different levels, more broadly, including the ethics of AIED, or designing AIED systems for a more equitable and just future. This includes AIED equity and inclusion-related theoretical or practical studies on socio-economic, gender, and racial issues; AI-assisted techniques to support students from under-resourced schools and communities; sponsorship, scientific validity, participant’s rights and responsibilities, data collection, management and dissemination. Additionally, it includes papers on ethics of AI in education, such as papers on explainability, transparency, accountability, and responsible AIED; learner consent and opt out; surveillance and privacy; the impact of AIED on teachers, learners and classrooms from an ethics perspective; teacher empowerment and student agency; the community’s responsibility for commercial applications; AIED ethical frameworks and principles for application. This track also includes AIED for development themes, such as leveraging AI technology to address and improve various aspects of development in societies and education, particularly in low and middle-income countries; AIED divide; AIED unplugged; Low-cost solutions; low-tech solutions; frugal Innovation; Jugaad Innovation. These papers may include systematic reviews of the literature or position papers on a particular issue. Both empirical results and theory are welcome in this track, with the primary contribution towards ethics, equity and society.  
 Sample Keywords:  Bias, algorithmic fairness, privacy, transparency, data collection and reuse-analysis, ethics, population groups (gender, racial/ethnic groups, minorities, cultural differences), the generalizability of models, measurement issues and biases, equity, inclusion  
  Track 7 – Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modelling for Education     
 Papers submitted to this track should include conceptual or theoretical models, methods, knowledge representation, reasoning related to AIED research and AIED systems. Papers will likely address novel contributions related to theoretical aspects of modelling learners (including open learner models), teachers, and other stakeholders, contributions to representing learning domains or modelling the processes involved in AIED systems. Other areas include, but are not limited, to theoretical contributions and modelling of: facilitators, tasks and problem-solving processes; models of groups and communities for learning; modeling motivation, metacognition, and affective aspects of learning; ontological modeling; computational thinking and model-building; representing and analysing activity flow and discourse during learning; representing and modeling psychomotor learning. Expanding and evaluating cognitive, motivational and affective theories within AIED context also constitutes a target of this track. Papers in this track can further be using bottom-up and top-down approaches to analyse data, in order to inform motivational, learning, and cognitive theories, and gain better understanding of the socio-cognitive nature of learning. The primary contribution of these papers can be of empirical results analysing theoretical aspects, or direct contributions to theories and theoretical models applicable to AIED.  
 Sample Keywords:  knowledge discovery, theory confirmation, theory modification about learning science, cognition, motivation, gathering empirical evidence with a heavy focus on theory, learner models, user models, domain models  

 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion   
 The AIED Society values diversity, equity, and inclusion (and related principles under this broad umbrella) as essential and fundamental values for the AIED community to uphold. Thus, in AIED 2025, we encourage authors to:  
 Write with care toward inclusive language (e.g., understanding identify-first vs. person-first language, gender neutral language, appropriate demographic categories and terminology, and avoiding the conflation of distinct dimensions such as race and ethnicity, or sex and gender). 
  Report methodology including descriptions of sample characteristics (e.g., demographic data), any procedures for inclusive and representative sampling, any barriers to inclusive and representative sampling, and the ethical issues addressed both in the research methodology and the AIED approaches or tools being researched. For example, it is important to report the strategies used to control or reduce bias against populations of any kind (e.g. benefit or bring prejudice to a particular gender, race, or people with different economic status) when collecting, using, or aggregating data both for the research and for the AIED approach or tool being researched. 
  Consider how their theoretical frameworks and findings are related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. For example, authors may discuss how these issues influence key assumptions, hypotheses, and methods. 
  Address implications or appropriate interpretations of their findings with respect to diversity, inclusion and equity. 

 Submission Instructions   
 We invite the following main submissions to the conference, to be submitted directly to one of the above research tracks :   
 Full paper submission: | Full papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Full papers will be presented as long oral talks. Papers submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper. 
  Short paper submission: | Short papers are expected to describe novel and interesting results to the overall community at large. The goal is to give novel but not necessarily mature work a chance to be seen by other researchers and practitioners and to be discussed at the conference. Short papers will be presented as short oral talks. 
  Submissions must follow Springer policies on publication (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process): https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v .   
 Please note that presenters of papers accepted to the main conference are expected to be on-site to give their presentations and to interact with the audience  . An online streaming option will be set-up for remote observers. Scholarships are available for researchers who lack funding to present at the conference, see website for more information. Workshops may however run hybrid, at the discretion of their organisers (for further information, see their websites).  
 Papers accepted to be published in the conference proceedings must have a unique onsite author registration (i.e., one registration per paper).  
 Authors should note that following AIED 2024, there will be NO downgrade path from main submissions to posters  . Authors whose papers submitted as main submissions are not accepted either as full or short paper are encouraged to revise and consider other submission types such as the late-breaking results or workshops. Note that due to the nature of the submission type, posters are to be presented physically at the conference; no remote presentation of posters will be allowed  .  
 We will announce further details for other submission types within AIED 2025 including:  
 Blue Sky: position papers envisioning the future of AIED 
  WideAIED: papers on research and ideas toward widening participation in AIED (e.g. by social scientists, share experiences in the area, …). 
  Invited papers from the International Journal of AIED 
  Late-breaking results 
  Practitioners and Industry 
  Doctoral Consortium 
  Interactive events (e.g. demos) 
   Review Process   
 All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the program committee, followed by a metareview conducted by a senior member of the program committee (all double-masked) to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation. It is important to note that the work presented should not have been published previously or be under consideration in other conferences of journals. Any paper caught in double submission will be rejected without review.  
 Anonymity   
 The review process will be double-masked, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous. To this end, authors should:  
 Eliminate all information that could lead to their identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, projects and/or systems) 
  Cite own prior work (if needed) in the third person 
  Eliminate acknowledgments and references to funding sources 
  Data collection, reporting, and analysis   
 Authors should be clear and specific about the composition of human-sourced data. Who were the participants? What was the distribution of gender, race, ethnicity, or related variables? If corpus data or training data were sourced from humans, a similar description could be offered.  
 Skewed or non-representative samples would not necessarily trigger a “reject” decision, but authors should acknowledge the demographic imbalances and discuss the potential impact on data, results, or conclusions. A more compelling paper would describe steps taken to generate an inclusive and representative sample (this is basic science, but often overlooked for convenience).  
 Authors are encouraged to discuss/justify how demographic variables are included in the analyses. If they are not included or “covaried out” please justify. If they are included, what are the assumptions? Are there “categorical effects”? Are the effects of different demographic variables independent, interdependent, or intersectional? What valid conclusions can be drawn? What erroneous conclusions need to be avoided or tempered?  
 Ethics   
 Authors should demonstrate some awareness of how ethical issues (including but not limited to equity, inclusion, accessibility) impact their data, methods, tools, approaches, products, and findings. How are different demographic groups or communities differentially connected to the work? People who are developing educational technologies need to think about access and use, for example. Corpus analyses need to address the impact of skewed/exclusive datasets and potential outcomes (e.g., algorithmic bias).  

 Submission Procedure and Publication of Accepted Contributions   
 All submissions must be in Springer format. Papers that do not use the required format may be rejected without review. Authors should consult Springer’s  authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers.

 ABZ 2025 – 11th International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods  

 Düsseldorf (Germany) - Jun 10, 2025 — Jun 13, 2025  
  
  The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.  
 The 11th instalment of the ABZ conference will be held at the Haus der Universität  , located in the centre of Düsseldorf with easy access to the airport and central rail station.  
 Authors interested in contributing to ABZ 2025 in Open Access or Open Choice should refer to the corresponding

 ABZ 2025 – 11th International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods  

 Call for papers  
 The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.  
 The name ABZ goes back to the first conference in London in 2008, where the ASM, B and Z conference series were merged into a joint event. In the following years other formal methods were added, e.g. Alloy in 2010 (Orford, Canada), VDM in 2012 (Pisa, Italy), and TLA+ in 2014 (Toulouse, France). After the also successful 2016 conferences in Linz, Austria, and 2018 in Southampton, UK, it was decided to name the conference “ABZ: International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods”, to stress the openness for further state-based formal methods. We hope to continue many fruitful discussions between representatives of the individual methods in the past, which will bring us closer to the common goal of this research community: the creation of reliable and safe software and systems.  
 ABZ 2025 will have a main conference track, a case study track, a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops.

  Submissions deadlines have been extended (abstract: March 1st, full submission: March 2nd).  
 Accepted papers will appear in the Springer LNCS proceedings.  
     
 Submission Process  
 Authors should consult href=""https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19242230/data/v11"" - Springer’s authors' guidelines
and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word , for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their href=""https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid"" - ORCIDs
in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.

This year's XP 
 What matters to you? 
 In just a few years, AI tools have been widely adopted by industry and their capabilities have improved enormously. Together with other trends such as platform engineering, conversational applications, sustainable development, and many more, the way we develop, operate, and evolve software may change drastically. At the same time, with the digital revolution, software has become part of the critical infrastructure of the entire economy; software is a core asset of many companies and is responsible for their success. 
 How can these trends and new research support and enhance agile software development and its operation in the future? Are the agile values and principles described in the manifesto still valid and/or sufficient? 
 What other trends, innovations, and research do you see emerging in the development and operation of valuable software products? Do you want to help shape the future of software development? Do you have ideas, and solutions or have you done experiments and research to solve a specific problem? 
 The overarching theme of XP 2025 is thus:“Adapt - Uncovering better ways to deliver valuable software products”.

 26th International Conference on Agile Software Development 
 href=""#we-welcome-the-xp-community-for-the-first-time-in-switzerland"" - We welcome the XP community for the first time in Switzerland!
XP is the premier agile software development conference, that combines, both, research and practice. It is a unique forum where agile researchers, practitioners, thought leaders, coaches, and trainers gather to present and discuss their most recent innovations and research results. At its inception, 26 years ago, the XP conference focused solely on eXtreme Programming. It quickly widened its scope to include all modern agile approaches and all the developing aspects of agility. XP draws people from around the globe, providing a diverse and inclusive environment for learning and inspiring conversations.

This year's XP 
 What matters to you? 
 In just a few years, AI tools have been widely adopted by industry and their capabilities have improved enormously. Together with other trends such as platform engineering, conversational applications, sustainable development, and many more, the way we develop, operate, and evolve software may change drastically. At the same time, with the digital revolution, software has become part of the critical infrastructure of the entire economy; software is a core asset of many companies and is responsible for their success. 
 How can these trends and new research support and enhance agile software development and its operation in the future? Are the agile values and principles described in the manifesto still valid and/or sufficient? 
 What other trends, innovations, and research do you see emerging in the development and operation of valuable software products? Do you want to help shape the future of software development? Do you have ideas, and solutions or have you done experiments and research to solve a specific problem? 
 The overarching theme of XP 2025 is thus:“Adapt - Uncovering better ways to deliver valuable software products”.

 Author and Submission Guidelines 
 Important IEEE Policy Announcement: The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Explore) if the paper is not presented at the conference. 
 Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE Communications society will take action against any author who engages in either practice. Follow these links to learn more: 
 IEEE Policy on Plagiarism 
 href=""https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/multi-sub-guidelines-intro.html"" - IEEE Policy on Double Submission
PLEASE NOTE:To be published in the IEEE WCNC 2025 Conference Proceedings and to be eligible for publication in IEEE Xplore®, an author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the FULL or LIMITED (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC Chair grants permission for a substitute presenter in advance of the event and who is qualified both to present and answer questions. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one FULL or LIMITED registration is valid for up to 3 papers. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE WCNC 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®. 
 During the initial paper submission process via EDAS, it is the authors' responsibility to ensure that the author list and the paper title of the submitted pdf file is an exact match to the author list and paper title on theEDAS registration page. In particular, the EDAS registration page must include all co-authors, not just the submitting author. Failure to comply with this rule might result in your paper being withdrawn from the review process. Please be aware that the author list of an accepted paper can NOT be changed in the final manuscript. Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all submissions must be done through EDAS. 
 IMPORTANT:The page length limit for all initial submissions for review is SIX (6) printed pages (10-point font) and must be written in English. Initial submissions longer than SIX (6) pages will be rejected without review. 
 All final submissions of accepted papers must be written in English with a maximum paper length of six (6) printed pages (10-point font) including figures. No more than two (2) additional printed pages (10-point font) may be included in final submissions and the extra pages (the 7th and 8th pages) will incur an over length page charge of US$100 for each page. All final papers must be submitted to the IEEE Conference eXpress website. Please refer to the acceptance letter for the instructions on how to upload final papers. 
 You may also use one of the following templates for Microsoft Word: A4, US letter.

The PDF files must have all non-standard fonts embedded. Submissions must be self-contained and in English. After uploading your submission, please verify the copy stored on the submission site. Submissions that do not follow these guidelines, or do not view or print properly, may be rejected without review. 
 PDF files submitted to WSDM 2025 must be anonymized: the submitted document should not include the author information and should not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. Explicitly revealing the manuscript authorship will result in rejection without review. Note, however, that it is acceptable to explicitly refer in the manuscript to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions. To this end, instead of stating, for instance, that an experiment “was conducted on the logs of a major search engine”, the authors should refer to the search engine by name. The reviewers will be informed that it does not necessarily imply that the authors are currently affiliated with the mentioned organization. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at submission time. To support faster dissemination of scientific results, we allow submissions that had earlier versions or code posted on preprint servers such as Arxiv.org or GitHub (with the understanding that these materials cannot be anonymous). In such cases, authors should exercise extra care and should not explicitly associate their submission with such publicly posted materials. 
 Supplementary Material 
 Authors may submit supplementary material (up to 100MB compressed in .zip format) containing full theoretical proofs and derivations, detailed descriptions of experimental setup, hyperparameter configurations, test datasets, or pointers to external repositories with datasets or source code, but should only do so if strict author anonymity can be maintained. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers, in other words, the paper should be self-contained as much as possible. In CMT, the option to add supplementary material will appear only after the main paper has been submitted. 
 Reproducibility 
 The resources and methods used within a manuscript should be described as completely as possible, in other words, the submitted 8+2 pages paper should be as self-contained as possible. Authors may submit supplementary material (up to 100MB compressed) containing detailed descriptions of experimental setup, hyperparameter configurations, test datasets or pointers to external repositories with datasets or code, but should only do so if strict author anonymity can be maintained. The additional content may or may not be considered when evaluating the manuscript, at the discretion of the reviewers. Wherever appropriate, the authors are encouraged to use publicly available test collections and state-of-the-art baselines, and are encouraged to share the experimental results, data, and code with the research community. 
 Authorship 
 Submitted manuscripts must adhere to thehref=""https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship"" - ACM authorship policy
. In particular, (i) each author must be the creator or originator of an idea in the work; (ii) each author must make substantial contributions to the work; and (iii) each author must be accountable for the work that was done and its presentation in a publication. The policy was recently updated to govern the use of generative AI tools in authoring papers. 
 If one submits numerous manuscripts to the same conference, it is less likely that one has materially contributed to all such submissions. To this end, we limit the number of submissions per author to 10 maximum. If more than 10 manuscripts are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional manuscripts submitted after the initial 10, will be rejected without review. 
 Only in exceptional cases will the PC Chairs grant permission for modifications to be made to the author list of a paper once it has been submitted and accepted. 
 Review Process 
 Each manuscript will be reviewed by at least three PC members and a senior PC member. The acceptance decisions will take into account manuscript novelty, technical depth, elegance, practical or theoretical impact, and presentation. WSDM 2025 will use a combination of single-blind reviewing and double-blind reviewing. The manuscripts will be double-blind to regular PC members, but the metadata (including authorship) of the manuscripts will be available to SPC to check for undisclosed conflicts of interest and to help assure the integrity of the review process.

CALL FOR PAPERS 
 IMPORTANT NOTE 
 WoWMoM 2024 will adopt a double-blind review process. Refer to the details under Paper Submission for the requirements to double-blind submissions. 
 SCOPE AND OVERVIEW 
 IEEE WoWMoM 2024 is soliciting original and previously unpublished papers addressing research challenges and advances in the areas of wireless, mobile, and multimedia networking as well as ubiquitous and pervasive systems and applications. Wireless networking technologies are continuously evolving and have become a critical part of modern life, be it for communication services, media distribution, or sensing and actuation services within the Internet of Things (IoT). Appropriate resource management, application design, and architectural networking paradigms are necessary to provide users with high quality experience in multimedia communication and services. Edge computing, machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are becoming essential tools to cope with the increasing diversity of connected devices and the plethora of new data-intensive and latency-sensitive applications. At the same time, the interoperability among IoT environments (including wearable computing and sensors), the network edge, and the cloud are evolving towards an IoT-edge-cloud continuum that is expected to support a wide range of application domains and services in a seamless and efficient manner. In this context, providing rich sets of measurements for characterizing and understanding the behavior of such complex systems is of paramount importance. 
 IEEE WoWMoM 2024 takes a broad view and seeks papers describing innovative research contributions to the field of mobile and wireless networking and applications. We solicit papers that present original work, validated by experimentation, simulation, or analysis. We also welcome practical experiences and experimental efforts from both industry and academia, duly documenting the lessons learned from testbeds, field trials, or real deployments.

 PAPER SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION 
 Authors are invited to submit papers describing original, previously unpublished work not currently under review by another conference, workshop, or journal. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Specifically, the authors should not identify themselves in any content within the paper either directly or indirectly (e.g., through references). Where relevant, authors must refer to their previous work in the third person write as if it was written by a third party. However, authors should ensure that any anonymization of their work is not destructive. For instance, omission of references to papers just because they are the authors' previous work should be avoided, as this could prevent reviewers from finding that related paper for the purpose of the review. Submissions violating anonymization rules will not be considered for review. 
 Although submission is double-blind, non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to the rejection of your paper. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints before completing a first read of your paper, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. 
 Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all submissions must be made electronically through EDAS. Clickhereto register your paper now! 
 Authors can submit regular or work-in-progress papers (appropriate category to be selected upon submission). 
 REGULAR PAPERS 
 Regular papers submissions may be up to 10 pages in length (including figures and references), formatted in two-column IEEE conference style with font size 10 points or greater. SeeIEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings.WORK IN PROGRESS PAPERS 
 WIP (Work-in-progress) papers provide a peer-reviewed forum for late-breaking or preliminary research results, giving an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present and demonstrate their recent research and obtain feedback from their peers in a poster session. Work-in-progress papers submissions may be up to 4 pages in length (including figures and references) and must have the prefix ""WIP:"" in the paper's title. 
 IMPORTANT DATES: 
 Papers due: | December 1, 2023 | December 17, 2023 
 Acceptance notification: February 19, 2024 
 Camera-ready version due: April 14, 2024 
 ACCEPTED PAPERS 
 An author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate. The paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference. Exceptions can be granted if compelling reasons are sent to the TPC Co-Chairs with a written request indicating an adequate substitute presenter before the conference. Accepted papers (both regular and WIP) will be included in the proceedings of IEEE WoWMoM 2024 which will be published through the IEEE Xplore digital library. 
 All conference proceedings must meet IEEE's quality standards, and IEEE reserves the right not to publish any proceedings that do not meet these standards. Furthermore, IEEE reserves the right to remove papers from IEEE Xplore that are not presented at the conference, for unjustified reasons. 
 BEST PAPER AWARD 
 All accepted regular papers will be considered for the Best Paper Award. A committee will select three best paper candidates based on the reviews received and also the quality of presentation. The winner will be announced during the conference. For any additional information, please contact the PC Co-chairs.

☰The 32ndIEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces 
 Ten years after the 2015 edition in Arles, located in the south of France, the conference is now exploring the west of France by landing in the historic city of Saint-Malo, in Brittany. 
 This exciting new edition of IEEE VR will be hosted at the Palais du Grand Large. This beachside congress center is designed to accommodate large-scale events like the IEEE VR conference. 
 Saint-Malo, a city known for its rich history of sea explorers and its openness to the world, perfectly embodies the spirit of the IEEE VR conference. It is a place that resonates deeply with our community as we continue to explore new scientific and technological challenges, with an open-minded approach. 
 Our IEEE VR community is renowned for its creativity and innovation. In line with this, we are thrilled to introduce a new track dedicated to artistic creation this year. This track will offer a unique venue for artists and students to showcase works that push the boundaries of traditional art forms, demonstrating how immersive technologies can transform and revisit artistic expressions. 
 Moreover, as a forward-thinking community, we recognize the importance of addressing the pressing issues of our world today. This year, we will place a special emphasis on sustainability, reflecting our commitment to making a positive impact on the world. Various initiatives and actions will be proposed to highlight and tackle environmental challenges, ensuring that our conference not only advances research and technology but also promotes a more sustainable future. 
 Join us in Saint-Malo for an unforgettable IEEE VR conference. Engage with leading experts, explore cutting-edge innovations, and be part of a vibrant community dedicated to shaping the future of immersive technologies. We look forward to seeing you there! 
 Your browser does not support the video tag.About the IEEE VR Conference 
 The IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (IEEE VR) is the premier international event for the presentation of research results in the broad areas of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR). Since 1993, IEEE VR has presented groundbreaking research and accomplishments by virtual reality pioneers: scientists, engineers, designers, and artists, paving the way for the future. Soon, IEEE VR expanded its scope to also include augmented, mixed, and other forms of mediated reality. Similarly, the IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces (3DUI), which started as a workshop at IEEE VR in 2004, has become the premier venue for 3D user interfaces and 3D interaction in virtual environments. In 2018, VR and 3DUI were merged into the IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces, with the short name IEEE VR. In 2020, VR was the first major IEEE conference to be held entirely online and in a virtual environment. 
 About Saint-Malo, Brittany, France 
 Saint-Malo is a port city located in the Brittany region of northwestern France, about 2 to 3 hours from Paris. It enchants visitors with its rich history, captivating architecture, and picturesque landscapes. Enclosed within formidable granite walls, it was once a pirate stronghold (corsairs approved by the King of France) strongly fortified against Norman and English attacks. This fortified port city exudes an old-world charm, offering a glimpse into its maritime past. Wander through the narrow cobblestone streets of the intra-muros (walled city) and discover charming cafes, boutiques, and historic landmarks such as the imposing Saint-Malo Cathedral. Beyond the city walls, visitors can explore stunning beaches, including the renowned Plage du Sillon, or embark on a journey to the nearby Mont Saint-Michel, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Whether strolling along the ramparts, indulging in fresh seafood, or simply soaking in the maritime ambiance, Saint-Malo offers a captivating blend of history, culture, and natural beauty that leaves a lasting impression on all who visit. 
 We are looking forward to welcoming you in France! 
 À bientôt à Saint-Malo !(See you in Saint-Malo)

IMPORTANT:IEEE VR 2025 uses a DOUBLE-BLIND review process. Failure to anonymize submissions will result in desk rejection. 
 Each research paper should provide a contribution covering one or more of the following categories: methodological, technical, applications, and systems. 
 Methodological papers | should describe advances in theories and methods of AR/VR/MR and 3DUI, such as ethical issues, theories on presence, or human factors. 
 Technical papers | should describe advancements in algorithms or devices critical to AR/VR/MR and 3DUI development such as input, display, user interaction, or tracking. 
 Application papers | provide an important insight to the community by explaining how the authors built upon existing ideas and applied them to solve an interesting problem in a novel way. Each paper should include an evaluation of the success of the use of AR/VR/MR and/or 3DUI in the given application domain. 
 System papers | should indicate how the developers integrated techniques and technologies to produce an effective system, and convey any lessons learned in the process. 
 Each paper should include an evaluation of its contributions, such as user studies, benchmarking and/or comparison with existing systems/techniques/methods. 
 Submission Length:We welcome paper submissions between 4 and 9 pages, not including references. Submissions may include an additional 2 pages of references. Supplementary materials should be provided in a separate file. Authors are encouraged to submit videos to aid the program committee in reviewing their submissions. 
 All paper submissions must be formatted using the IEEE Computer Society VGTC conference format (https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/). Accepted papers and posters will have to be formatted by the authors according to the relevant camera-ready guidelines.

 Review process 
 The review process will have two cycles. 
 Review Cycle I (Submission to Initial notification)Submissions will be assigned to two members of the VR 2025 International Program Committee (IPC): a coordinator (primary) and a secondary reviewer. Submissions that violate the submission guidelines or that receive low review scores from the coordinator and the secondary reviewer will be early rejected. This stage of the review process will be double blind. We will strive to have all other submissions receive a total of at least three reviews. Based on the reviews and in consultation with a subset of the IPC, the Program Chairs will make one of the following initial recommendations for each submission: 
 Conditionally accept as IEEE TVCG paper. | Continuing our cooperation with the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG), the top submissions will be considered for publication in a special issue of IEEE TVCG. 
 Conditionally accept as conference paper. | These submissions will be considered for inclusion in the Proceedings of IEEE VR, archived in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. 
 Recommend as a two-page poster. | Authors of a submission receiving this recommendation have the option of condensing their submission into a two-page poster, including references. Subject to a final approval by the Posters chairs, accepted posters will be included in the IEEE VR Abstracts and Workshops proceedings and will be archived in the IEEE Digital Library. Note that IEEE VR does not consider posters as a final disclosure of research results. Thus, work accepted as an IEEE VR poster might be eligible for inclusion in future publications. 
 Reject. 
 Review Cycle II (Initial notification to Final decision)The revision of each conditionally accepted paper will be reviewed by its coordinator, who will make a final recommendation regarding acceptance. Should the conditions for acceptance not be met, the paper will be rejected. 
 Additional Guidelines 
 Abstract Submission. 
 Note that a paper abstract must be uploaded seven days prior to the actual paper submission deadline. This facilitates the process of assigning reviewers, as the review process operates on a very tight schedule. 
 Ethics and Responsibility. 
 All submissions describing research experiments with human participants must follow the appropriate ethical guidelines required by the authors’ institution(s), and authors are required to secure and report their approval by the relevant ethics committee prior to collecting data. An approval by any ethical review board, if required by your institution, needs to be indicated via the submission system. Authors will be required to submit the name of the ethical review board, approved protocol title and number, and date that ethical approval was obtained prior to running human participants. Authors must be able to provide proof of ethical approval upon request. Incorrect reporting of ethical approval will result in desk rejection. 
 Participant Diversity. 
 To support high-quality research, all submissions describing research with human participants should strive for participant diversity. As first steps toward this goal, VR 2025 is encouraging the following: 
 Research that aims to benefit a general population should be representative of that population. (e.g. balanced across gender or age). Research that claims to benefit a specific population should clearly state and justify its focus on that population (e.g. pilots, surgeons). 
 All submissions must report participant demographics (gender, age, etc.). 
 Notes about recruiting representative populations: 
 Recruiting more diverse samples does not imply that the research must treat these data as independent variables and analyze differences in independent variables between demographic groups. 
 Recruiting more diverse samples does not increase the number of participants required for adequate statistical power given an effect size. 
 Many ethics review boards and funding sources already require participant diversity for inclusive and unbiased research. 
 The VR 2025 program committee and external reviewers will be strongly encouraged to consider participant diversity in relation to the generality of the claims made by a submission as a first-order reviewing concern. Submissions that make general claims yet rely on a severely imbalanced participant groups may be negatively impacted by the reviewing process. 
 Review Duties for Authors. 
 The increasing number of submissions for IEEE VR makes us all dependent on a large number of good reviewers who are willing to provide constructive feedback and engage with authors on their work. Every paper needs three quality reviews. To expand the reviewing pool and to promote quality reviews, for each submitted paper, one author will be required to register to review up to three papers through PCS at the time of submission. For example, if the same author group submits two papers, they need to commit to reviewing six papers. Additionally, senior authors are encouraged to ask experienced junior authors to register in PCS to review papers, and then to mentor the junior authors during the review process. 
 Presentation at the Conference. 
 All accepted submissions must be presented orally at the conference. An in-person presentation is expected, and online presentations will be accommodated only in exceptional cases. Requests for online presentations due to exceptional cases must be made at least one month before the conference. 
 Submission Language. 
 All paper submissions must be in English. 
 Previous Publication and Plagiarism. 
 Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously published. A manuscript is considered to have been previously published if it has appeared in a peer-reviewed journal, magazine, book, or meeting proceedings that is reliably and permanently available afterward in print or electronic form to non-attendees, regardless of the language of that publication. A manuscript identical or substantially similar in content (in its entirety or in part) to one submitted to VR should not be simultaneously under consideration for another conference or journal during any part of the VR review process, from the submission deadline until notifications of decisions are emailed to authors. 
 In some situations, a submission may build upon prior work. In order to fully explain the relationship between the submitted paper and prior work, authors may upload additional papers as well as a non-anonymous letter of explanation that highlights the significant changes or advances; these materials will only be seen by the primary reviewer. Specifically, this treatment is applied to the following cases: 
 non peer-reviewed works that are publicly available (on arXiv, as a technical report, etc.) 
 non-archival publications presented in past IEEE VR conferences (posters, demos, etc.) 
 Submissions will be checked for plagiarism using IEEE Crosscheck. Detection of significant plagiarism will lead to rejection. For more information about definitions of plagiarism and IEEE policies in this area, please see theIntroduction to the Guidelines for Handling Plagiarism Complaintsand theIEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual. 
 AI-generated Text. 
 Large-scale language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can only be used by the authors to edit grammar of their own text. 
 Submission Anonymity. 
 * IEEE VR uses a DOUBLE-BLIND review process * 
 This means that both the authors and the reviewers must remain anonymous to each other. Submissions (including citations and optional videos) must not contain information that identifies the authors, their institutions, funding sources, or their places of work. Relevant previous work by the authors must be cited in the third person to preserve anonymity (exceptions were described above). Authors should work diligently to ensure that their submissions do not expose their identities either intentionally or through carelessness. Authors that have questions/issues around the double-blind submission policy should contact the program chairs. 
 * Failure to make reasonable attempts to adhere to the double-blind policy will result in desk rejection. * 
 Pre-dissemination through public online repositories. 
 Uploading the submitted manuscript to an online repository (e.g., arXiv) before the end of the review process does not constitute a reason for rejecting the manuscript. However, the authors should be advised that doing so can compromise the anonymity of their manuscript and therefore bias its double-blind review. 
 Videos. 
 Videos must be submitted according to the instructions on the submission website. Videos submitted with papers will automatically be considered for possible inclusion in the video proceedings (video submissions may also be made independently, as described in the separate Call for Videos). When submitted as supporting material, videos must be free of any identifying information prior to reviewing as per the double-blind submission policy. If accepted for the video proceedings, a revised version of the materials will be requested.

 Welcome to VL/HCC 2025 
 From the beginning of the computer age, people have sought easier ways to learn, express, and understand computational ideas. Whether this meant moving from punch cards to textual languages, or command lines to graphical UIs, the quest to make computation easier to express, manipulate, and understand by a broader group of people is an ongoing challenge. 
 The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing is the premier international forum for research on this topic. Established in 1984, the mission of the conference is to support the design, theory, application, and evaluation of computing technologies and languages for programming, modeling, and communicating, which are easier to learn, use, and understand by people. 
 The 2025 symposium is scheduled to take place in October 2025 in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA. VL/HCC 2024 is Sponsored by IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Multimedia Computing (TCMC).

 href=""#scope-and-topics"" - Scope and Topics
We solicit original, unpublished research papers on computing technologies for modeling, programming, communicating, and reasoning, which are easier to learn, use or understand by humans than the current state-of-the-art. Papers should focus on efforts to design, formalize, implement, or evaluate those technologies and languages. This includes technologies intended for general audiences (e.g., professional or novice programmers, or the public) or domain-specific audiences (e.g., people working in business administration, production environments, healthcare, urban design or scientific domains).

 If you are not sure if your paper is a good fit for VL/HCC, feel free to email the PC Co-chairs (see “Contact” below). We welcome those new to the VL/HCC community to submit! 
 href=""#special-emphasis-for-2025-human-ai-collaboration"" - Special Emphasis for 2025: Human-AI Collaboration
We seek research that highlights the situations in which human-AI interactions enhance, or degrade, the human experience in computing. Papers describing positive, negative and unclear impacts are all welcome. 
 href=""#paper-submissions"" - Paper Submissions
We invite two kinds of papers: 
 full-length papers, up to 10 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements 
 short papers, up to 5 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements 
 All accepted papers, whether full or short, should be complete, self-contained, archival contributions. Contributions from full papers are more extensive than those from short papers. Papers do not have to reach the maximum page limit, but they should be of an appropriate length for the content. Note that some full paper submissions may be accepted as short papers if reviewers deem contributions to be comparable in size to a short paper. 
 Papers could be research findings, industry experience reports, replication studies, or vision papers. Please select the appropriate page length for the content of your paper. 
 Papers must be submitted using the IEEE two-column conference paper format. Be sure to use the current IEEE conference paper format (which was updated in 2019), and to select the “US letter”template 
 Papers should behref=""%20https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vlhcc2025"" - submitted via the EasyChair system
. 
 To facilitate the assigning of papers to reviewers, we authors should submit paper abstracts via EasyChair at least 1 week prior to the paper submission deadline (see Important Dates below). The abstract must be no longer than 250 words. 
 All submissions will be reviewed by members of the Program Committee in a double-anonymous review process. Authors will then receive the reviews for their submissions and will be able to answer them in a rebuttal phase. Only after this step will the PC make a final decision about the acceptance of the submissions. Submissions and reviews for the technical program are managed with EasyChair. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for VL/HCC 2025 and present the paper at the conference. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference, including IEEE Xplore Digital Library, if the paper is not presented by the author at the conference. 
 The proceedings of IEEE VL/HCC are published in digital form by the IEEE Computer Science Society and archived in the IEEE Digital Library with an official ISBN number. Accepted papers will be available to conference attendees via the IEEE Open Preview program in theIEEE Xplore Digital Library). 
 Double-Anonymous Reviewing 
 We follow a double-anonymous reviewing process. Both authors and reviewers are expected to make every effort to honor the double-anonymous reviewing process. In case of questions, please contact the Program Chairs. Authors should ensure that the submission can be evaluated without it being obvious who wrote the paper. This means leaving author names off the paper and using terms like “previous research” rather than “our previous research” when describing background. However, do not hide previous work – papers must still reference all relevant research using full (non-anonymized) citations, including the author’s own prior work, so that reviewers can evaluate novelty. Please reference your own prior work in the third-person just like you would do for any other related work (e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and instead write something like “As described by [10], …”). It is also important that authors specify all conflicts of interest with potential reviewers during the submission phase. Reviewers should not undertake any investigation that might lead to the revealing of authors’ identity. If identities are inadvertently revealed, please contact the Program Chairs. The Program Chairs will check all submissions for obvious signs of lack of anonymity and may ask authors to make changes and resubmit the paper within three days of the submission deadline. Only changes to resolve anonymity issues will be permitted. 
 Evaluation and Justification 
 Papers are expected to support their claims with appropriate evidence. For example, a paper that claims to improve programmer productivity is expected to demonstrate improved productivity; a paper that claims to be easier to use should demonstrate increased ease of use. 
 However, not all claims necessarily need to be supported with empirical evidence or studies with people. For example, a paper that claims to make something feasible that was clearly infeasible might substantiate its claim through the existence of a functioning prototype. 
 Moreover, there are many alternatives to empirical evidence that may be appropriate for justifying claims, including analytical methods, formal arguments or case studies. Given this criterion, we encourage potential authors to think carefully about what claims their submission makes and what evidence would adequately support these claims. 
 Replication papers will be evaluated on their own merit in terms of methods used, findings discussed and comparison to original studies in terms of different context or use of different methods. 
 Vision papers should make a case for future needs and research directions in VL and/or HCC community interest areas within a timeline of the next 5 to 10 years. 
 Industrial experience reports with VL and/or HCC topics should describe context, lessons learned (positive or negative), and recommendations for research and practice as appropriate. 
 We expect short papers to have less comprehensive evaluation than full-length papers, and may have less technical detail, but sufficient to make the case for the contribution. New ideas and early research results would be expected to use a short paper format. 
 Adhering to IEEE Guidelines 
 Please be sure that your submission follows thehref=""https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/author-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-policies/"" - IEEE requirements
Especially around Human Subject approvals and use of Generative AI: 
 href=""#research-on-human-and-animal-subjects"" - Research on Human and Animal Subjects
Excerpted from the IEEE Publication Services and Products Board (PSPB) Operations Manual, sections 8.1.1.E. Also see section 8.2.1.B.6. 
 Authors of articles reporting on research involving human subjects or animals, including but extending beyond medical research, shall include a statement in the article that the research was performed under the oversight of an institutional review board or equivalent local/regional body, including the official name of the IRB/ethics committee, or include an explanation as to why such a review was not conducted. For research involving human subjects, authors shall also report that consent from the human subjects in the research was obtained or explain why consent was not obtained. 
 Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text 
 The use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in a paper (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE publication. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the paper that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content. 
 The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. In this case, disclosure as noted above is recommended.

 International Conference on 
 Visual Communications and Image Processing 
 Welcome to 
 VCIP 
 2025 
 About VCIP 
 Visual Communications and Image Processing 
 The 2025 edition of Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP 2025) Conference, will be held in Klagenfurt, Austria, during December 1-4, 2025. VCIP is the oldest conference in the field and one of the flagship conferences of the CAS Visual Signal Processing and Communications Technical Committee. Since 1986 VCIP has served as a premier forum for the exchange of fundamental and applied research in the field of visual communications and image processing. 
 VCIP has a long tradition of showcasing pioneering technologies in visual communication and processing, and many landmark papers first appeared in VCIP. VCIP 2025 will cover new technology frontiers and new use cases, in the visual signal processing and communication areas, to discuss and envision the future of both technology and applications. VCIP 2025 inherits the tradition of previous conferences in providing a fertile ground for researchers, engineers, and professionals from academia and industry around the world. High-quality papers will be recommended to Transaction CSVT for journal extension. 
 Theme 
 Sustainable and Trustworthy Visual Communications in the Age of AI 
 In the Age of AI, the rapid evolution of visual technologies presents both incredible opportunities and pressing challenges for communication. Sustainable and trustworthy visual communications have become critical, as we navigate a world increasingly dominated by generative AI, deepfakes, and synthetic media. As AI systems grow more capable of creating hyper-realistic images and videos, the need for transparency, ethical standards, and responsible design has never been greater. How can we ensure that the visuals we rely on for education, journalism, and social interaction are authentic and free from manipulation? Moreover, how can we create visual content that minimizes environmental impact while remaining accessible and inclusive? This intersection of sustainability and trust in visual communications calls for innovative solutions—ones that preserve the integrity of information, protect privacy, and empower users to discern reality from illusion. By harnessing the potential of AI responsibly, we can redefine how visuals shape our perceptions of the world, ensuring they contribute to a more informed, ethical, and sustainable digital future

 Call for Full and Short Papers 
 UMAP 2025 will adopt registration and presentation policies that must be followed by the authors of each accepted contribution. We invite prospective authors to carefully check them in the call before submitting. Any inquiries can be directed to umap2025-chair@um.org.The 33rd International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization (ACM UMAP 2025)is the premier international conference bringing together research in AI and HCI to support effective human-AI collaboration via interactive systems that can model, adapt and personalize to their users. 
 ACM UMAP2025 is sponsored byACM SIGCHIandSIGWEB.User Modeling Inc., as the core Steering Committee, oversees the conference organization. ACM UMAP operates under theACM Conference Code of Conduct. The main conference proceedings, published by ACM, will be part of the ACM Digital Library. 
 The theme of ACMUMAP 2025is“Shaping Personalization and FATE (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics) in Human-Centered Generative AI”. 
 ACM UMAP2025 will bring together researchers, practitioners, and policymakers from around the world to discuss the latest developments in human-centered approaches to design and use AI systems that adapt to human needs while ensuring user control, fairness, accountability, transparency, inclusivity, and sustainability. While we encourage submissions related to this theme, the scope of the conference is not limited to the theme only. As always, contributions from academia, industry, and other organizations discussing open challenges or novel research approaches are expected to be supported by rigorous evidence appropriate to claims (e.g., user study, system evaluation, computational analysis).

 Submission Guidelines 
 All submissions must be written in English. Papers should be submitted electronically, in a PDF format, through the EasyChair submission system,href=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2025"" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2025
, by selecting the “UMAP25 Full and Short Papers” track. 
 Format.We encourage two types of submissions (reviewers will comment on whether the size is appropriate for each contribution), in the ACM two-column format: 
 Long papers | ( | 8 pages | at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) should report on substantial contributions of lasting value. They should reflect more complex innovations or studies and should have a more thorough discussion of related work. Each accepted long paper will be included in the main conference proceedings and presented in a plenary session as part of the main conference program. 
 Short papers | ( | 4 pages | at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper – they are not “work-in-progress” reports but rather complete reports on a smaller or simpler-to-describe but complete research work on advances that can be described, set into context, and evaluated concisely. In particular, novel but significant proposals will be considered for acceptance to this category despite not having gone through sufficient experimental validation or lacking a strong theoretical foundation. Each accepted short paper will be included in the main conference proceedings and presented either as an oral presentation or at a poster session as part of the main conference program. 
 We recommend that supplementary material is linked to an external source using an anonymized link. 
 Anonymity.Submissions must be anonymous, given that ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from submissions, and avoid obvious identifying statements. For instance, citations to the authors’ prior work should be made in the third person. Failure to anonymize your submission could result in desk rejection. It is acceptable to explicitly refer in the paper to the companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if there is no implication that the authors are currently affiliated with the mentioned organization. To release code and additional materials while preserving anonymity, we suggest using anonymous repositories such ashttps://anonymous.4open.science. 
 Templates.Following theACM Publication Workflow, all authors should submit manuscripts for review in the ACMdouble-column format. Instructions for authors are given below: 
 LaTeX: | Please use the latest version of the | Primary Article Template | – LaTeX to create your submission. Start the document with the \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} command to generate the output in a double-column format. Please see the | LaTeX documentation | and | ACM’s LaTeX best practices guide | for further instructions, ignoring the single-column instructions. Do not use the “manuscript” option, otherwise, the document will not be compiled in double-column, as required. Check the sample-sigconf.tex file included in the template package for a formatting example. To ensure 100% compatibility with The ACM Publishing System (TAPS), please restrict the use of packages to the | whitelist of approved LaTeX packages | . 
 Overleaf: | (use \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} for double-column). Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for | href=""https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/overleaf"" - preparing your article with Overleaf | . 
 Word: | Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for | href=""https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word"" - preparing your article with Microsoft Word | , ignoring the single-column instructions and the single-column submission template. Please use the | double-column Word template | . 
 Accessibility.Authors are strongly encouraged to provide “alt text” (alternative text) for floats (images, tables, etc.) in their content so that readers with disabilities can be given descriptive information for these floats that are important to the work. The descriptive text will be displayed in place of a float if the float cannot be loaded. This benefits the author and it broadens the reader base for the author’s work. Moreover, the alt text provides in-depth float descriptions to search engine crawlers, which helps to properly index these floats. Additionally, authors should follow thehref=""https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/describing-figures"" - ACM Accessibility Recommendations for Publishing in Color and SIG ACCESS guidelines on describing figures
. 
 Submission Policy.All submissions and reviews will be handled electronically. ACM UMAP has ano dual submission policy, which is why submitted manuscripts should not be currently under review at another publication venue. Particularly, please consider the following ACM’s publication policies: 
 “By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all | ACM Publications Policies | , including | href=""https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects"" - ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.” | href=""https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects"" - https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects 
 “Please ensure that you and your co-authors | obtain an ORCID ID | , so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a | href=""https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs"" - commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors | . We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.” 
 Review Process 
 Review.ACM UMAP uses adouble-blindreview process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from their submissions; they should also avoid obvious identifying statements. Submissions not abiding by anonymity requirements will be desk rejected. 
 Reviewers will evaluate papers based on their significance, originality, rigor, and contribution to the field. Papers that are out of scope, incomplete, or lack sufficient evidence to support the basic claims, may be rejected without full review. Furthermore, reviewers will be asked to comment on whether the length is appropriate for the contribution. In addition,ACM UMAP 2025 will introduce a new rebuttal stage during evaluation, offering a small window for authors to optionally discuss the initial decision of their submission, enhancing the transparency and quality of the reviewing process. 
 TheACM Code of Ethicsgives the ACM UMAP program committee the right to (desk-)reject papers that perpetuate harmful stereotypes, employ unethical research practices, or uncritically present outcomes/implications that disadvantage minority communities. Furthermore, reviewers will be explicitly asked to consider whether the research was conducted in compliance with professional ethical standards and applicable regulatory guidelines. Failure to do so could lead to a (desk-)rejection. 
 Registration and Presentation Policy 
 Each accepted paper must be accompanied by adistinct full author registration, completed by theearly registration date cut-off.Each accepted paper must be presented in personto be included in the conference proceedings, published byACM, and available via theACM Digital Library. The official publication date is when the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of UMAP 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. 
 Camera-ready Submission 
 Accepted papers will be subject to further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM.We strongly recommend the usage of LaTeX/Overleaf for the camera-ready papers to minimize the extent of reformatting. Users of the Word template must use either the version for Microsoft Word for Windows, Macintosh Office 2011, or Macintosh Office 2016 (other formats, such as Open Office, etc., are not admitted) for the camera-ready submission to avoid incompatibility issues. 
 Instructions for preparing the camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be provided after acceptance. This might include instructions to prepare a video of the accepted contribution. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be later submitted usingACM’s new production platform, where authors will be able to review PDF and HTML output formats before publication. 
 Ethical & Human Subjects Considerations 
 ACM UMAP expects papers to include a discussion of the ethical considerations, as well as the impact of the presented work and/or its intended application, where appropriate. ACM UMAP further expects all authors to comply with ethical standards and regulatory guidelines associated with human subjects research, including research involving human participants and research using personally identifiable data. Papers reporting on such human subjects research must include a statement identifying any regulatory review the research is subject to (and identifying the form of approval provided), or explaining the lack of required review.

Submission Formatting Guidelines for UIST 2025 
 We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format, but will accept papers for review as either 1- or 2-column paper format if you are authoring in Word. The rationale for strongly recommending a 2-column format is that reviewers have generally expressed a strong preference for printing and reading PDFs in a two-column format. Additionally, the PDFs that appear in the digital library are ultimately two-column. However, as we do use the TAPS workflow, we understand that Word users may want to utilize the single-column template. 
 Your submission must be original. UIST only accepts original submissions. This means that your submission cannot have been published in another peer-reviewed venue or be under concurrent review at another peer-reviewed venue. Similarly, if you make multiple submissions to UIST 2025 Papers, their contributions must be distinct & self-contained from each other. Please refer to thehref=""/2025/author-guide/"" - author guide
for details. Additionally, authors should avoid generating content using AI-agents (e.g., LLMs such as ChatGPT or similar), but the usage of these tools isallowed for editing and checking the author’s own text.Revised Papers from Prior Submissions:To ensure consistency of the review process, we encourage authors of previously rejected papers to upload the prior version of the paper, corresponding reviews, and summary of changes from the last round of submission as part of the UIST 2025 paper submission process. 
 Submission Information 
 Submission Platform 
 All required materials must be submitted electronically to | PCS | by the abstract and paper deadline. 
 In PCS, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select “SIGCHI”, “UIST 2025” and “UIST 2025 Papers”, respectively, and press “Go.” This track will be opened a few weeks before the submission deadline. 
 Submission Format and Length 
 Required Paper PDF and source files 
 We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow | . 
 For | LaTeX authors | , submissions are strongly recommended to be in the | double-column format | ( | href=""/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf"" - example PDF | ) using | \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} | . (please use the | downloadable LaTex template | or the | Overleaf template | ). 
 For | Word authors | , submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( | href=""/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx"" - submission template | , | href=""/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf"" - example PDF | ) or the single-column template ( | href=""/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.docx"" - submission template | , | href=""/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.pdf"" - example PDF | ). 
 UIST papers are of variable length. Paper length must be based on the weight of the contribution. A new idea presented in a compact format is more likely to be accepted than the same idea in a long format, and shorter, more focused papers are encouraged. As a guideline, consider | Short Papers | being submissions of 5,000 words or less. 
 Standard Length Papers | being submissions between 5,000 and 12,000 words are considered standard length (about 7,000-8,000 words on average). 
 References | and | appendices | are excluded from the word count. 
 Size: < | 20 MB | (compressed PDF files are encouraged during submission) 
 Please make | appendices as separate PDF files | and upload them as supplementary materials instead of including them as a subsection at the end of the original paper manuscript. 
 Accompanying Video 
 Optional, but highly encouraged 
 Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec 
 No more than 5 minutes long 
 Size: < 250 MB 
 Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
 Maximum File Size 
 Maximum total size for all files < 300 MB 
 Anonymity 
 Anonymous, i.e. authors must remove their names and affiliations throughout all submission materials (paper, videos, supplementary material) | href=""/2025/author-guide/#anonymity"" - (anonymity policy ) 
 Discuss your own prior work in 3rd person and include a full reference with names. 
 Selection Process 
 Refereed, i.e. the program committee and two external reviewers will review submitted papers 
 Publication 
 Archival, i.e. accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed in digital form to conference attendees 
 Quick rejection / Desk rejection policy 
 Papers, where the length is incommensurate with contribution or the stated length of the submission (i.e., short paper vs. standard length papers), will be desk rejected. | Submissions of more than 5,000 words for short papers or 12,000 words for standard papers will be desk rejected if their length is not justified. In very exceptional cases, such submissions may be considered for full review, but authors must provide clear and strong justification for why submissions are required to be longer than the word limit. 
 Anonymization Policy. | Authors are expected to anonymize their identities in the body of the paper but leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. Authors are required to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], …” and use instead “As described by Chetty et al. [10], …”. Papers that violate the anonymization policy by | explicitly and unequivocally identifying the authors | (i.e., beyond allowing the reviewers to simply ""guess""), including within the supplemental materials or external links to datasets, code repositories, etc., will be desk rejected. Any supplementary material (including the video) should also adhere to the anonymity rule. 
 Your submission must be original; it cannot be published or under concurrent review elsewhere. | If you have any concurrent submissions to UIST or other venues that are closely related | – i.e., are based on the same study, artifact, or dataset – | you must include an anonymized version of that submission to the concurrent submissions field. | Failure to do so will result in desk rejection. Please see | href=""https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions"" - ACM guide on prior and simultaneous submissions | . 
 Research Quality and Lack of Relevant Context: | Papers must include sufficient detail for reviewers to evaluate research quality according to the norms and expectations of the UIST community. Papers should demonstrate clear connections to existing research literature in HCI and related fields, showing how the work builds upon or relates to prior work. | Papers that lack adequate methodological details for proper evaluation, or that fail to engage with relevant prior research, may be desk rejected. 
 Your paper must be stand alone. Authors are encouraged to provide supplementary materials to support practices around research reproducibility as much as possible, however all important information to understand the contributions of your work must be in the main paper PDF. | Heavy reliance on appendices and/or supplementary materials can be a ground for rejection including desk rejection. 
 Please ensure that you use the correct template and correct formatting of references. | We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format, but will accept papers for review in either 1- or 2-column paper format if you are authoring in Word. Use of other templates or formats, including different citation styles, may result in desk rejection. 
 Final Publication Format 
 As required by the TAPS workflow, camera-ready manuscripts of all papers that have been accepted must be submitted in the formats listed below for final publication in the ACM Digital Library. 
 For | LaTeX authors | , your source files will be used to auto-generate (1) a double-column PDF ( | href=""/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf"" - example PDF | ), and (2) an accessible and responsive webpage ( | example HTML | ) that will be placed in the Digital Library. 
 For | Word authors | , you will need to submit your paper in | single-column format | to correctly auto-generate (1) a double-column PDF ( | href=""/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf"" - example PDF | ), and (2) an accessible and responsive webpage ( | example HTML | ) in the Digital Library. 
 Presentation Format 
 Talk at the conference delivered by one or more authors of the paper 
 Video Preview 
 Video previews are mandatory. 
 Recommended resolution: 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec 
 Length: 30 seconds 
 Size: < 150 MB 
 Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
 Please see the | href=""/2025/video-guide"" - video guide | for more information on producing a video preview. 
 We strongly recommend that authors make their videos accessible through following the guidelines under | href=""/2025/accessibility"" - Making Video Figures Accessible | . 
 Demo Fast Track 
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to participate in the UIST demo session. Details about this special/fast track of demos will be found on the | demo | page. 
 Please note that a | DOI will not be provided for invited demo papers. | Authors interested in having a DOI for their demo paper should consider submitting to the regular demo track. 
 Additional Notes 
 Accessibility: | Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. To this end, we allow 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline to provide alt-text for all figures and tables and upload video subtitles to make your optional video accessible. Allowing additional time for your paper and video submissions to be accessible will help increase the quality of the conference overall and enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. If the authors have difficulties with making their submission materials accessible, they are encouraged to contact the UIST 2025 Accessibility Chairs by emailing | href=""mailto:accessibility2025@uist.org"" - accessibility2025@uist.org | and volunteers with questions or for assistance to ensure that all accessible materials are submitted by the deadline. We strongly recommend that authors read the | href=""https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/"" - SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission | which describes the process to make a paper submission accessible, as well as the | href=""https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/videos/"" - SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos | , which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning. 
 The | author list | must be complete by the abstract submission deadline. Late author changes (i.e., additions or changes of order) require approval from program chairs and may be declined or might require paper withdrawal. Ensure all authors are listed in the correct order by the abstract deadline. 
 We will continue to put the papers up | publicly | on the ACM DL a week in advance of the conference. 
 Authors may submit a | rebuttal | after the reviews are released. Though the ACs may indicate if the rebuttal is likely to help the paper being accepted (based on reviews and internal discussions), any author may choose to respond. A rebuttal response by Associate Chairs and external reviewers will be enforced by the Program Chairs as much as possible. 
 The | video | has traditionally been due the same day as paper submissions and this has always been stressful. We will allow for 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline for uploading your optional video. 
 Open source | : Our community welcomes open source and encourages the practice of creating software/hardware and sharing it through open-source and public repositories. However, open source is | not | a requirement or prerequisite for acceptance. Open source, as well as many other types of artifacts (e.g., videos, datasets, raw data, appendices), is recommended but completely optional, and will not be used for evaluation criteria. The paper should be evaluated on its own merits, not depending on supporting artifacts that are not submitted by the authors. 
 ACM’s Publication Policies 
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to allACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

 Submission Format and Length 
 Demo Abstract 
 We will adopt the | ACM TAPS Workflow | . 
 For LaTeX authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format ( | href=""https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf"" - example PDF | ) using | \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart} | . 
 For Word authors, submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( | href=""https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx"" - submission template | , | href=""https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf"" - example PDF | ) or the single-column template ( | href=""https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.docx"" - submission template | , | href=""https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.pdf"" - example PDF | ). 
 We do not have a strong page limit, but we recommend that authors prepare a manuscript of ~1,500-2,000 words to equate to the double column 2-page length, often 4-5 pages in the single column (plus references). Submissions could be both single-column or double-column format in PDF. | We strongly encourage to use the double-column format. 
  
 Floor Plan 
 The demo submission should include a PDF document describing the envisioned setup and interaction (demo hardware components, tables, chairs, lights, and other equipment) so that organizers get a good understanding of your setup. 
 This will also allow the organizers to better consider your requirements when organizing the demonstration space at the venue. 
  
 Demo Video 
 This video should be a standalone demonstration of the work 
 It shows the working demo in appropriate detail 
 It will be published ahead of time (~2 weeks before the conference) on the conference website 
 Length: up to 5 min 
 Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec 
 Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
 Preview Video 
 Video previews are mandatory (7 days grace period after camera-ready deadline) 
 Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec 
 Size: < 150 MB 
 Length: 30 seconds 
 Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
 Anonymity 
 Demo submissions are not anonymous. Author names and institutions will be visible to the reviewing committee throughout the submission process. 
 Selection Process 
 Demos are juried by the UIST demo chairs, and there is no rebuttal phase 
 Due to the nature of the juried process, authors will not receive review feedback and will only be informed about the decision 
 Publication 
 Non-archival, ideas presented as a UIST demo can be resubmitted as an extended full paper in subsequent years 
 Demo abstracts will be included in the ACM digital library as adjunct proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees 
 Presentation Format 
 At least one author is required to be physically present at the conference and present their demo during demo sessions 
 Lab Demos 
 If the authors have multiple demo submissions from the same lab/company, we can group these demos together at the venue. Please indicate the submission IDs of all demos from the same lab on the PCS submission page. 
 Concurrent UIST Poster Submission

 Introduction 
 Ubiquitous sensors, devices, networks and information are paving the way towards a smart world in which computational intelligence is distributed throughout the physical environment to provide reliable and relevant services to people. This ubiquitous intelligence will change the computing landscape because it will enable new breeds of applications and systems to be developed and the realm of computing possibilities will be significantly extended. By enhancing everyday objects with intelligence many tasks and processes could be simplified, more efficient and more enjoyable. Ubiquitous computing is to create such intelligent/smart environments, services and applications.

 Past Conferences 
 The ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) is the result of a merger of the two most renowned conferences in the field: Pervasive and UbiComp. While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event. 
 The ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing (ISWC) discusses novel results in all aspects of wearable computing, and has been colocated with UbiComp and Pervasive since 2013. 
 A complete list of UbiComp, Pervasive, and ISWC past conferences is provided below.

 UBICOMM 2025: Call for Papers 
 Onsite and Online Options: In order to accommodate various situations, we are offering the option for either physical presence or virtual participation (pdf slides or pre-recorded videos). 
 The rapid advances in ubiquitous technologies make fruition of more than 35 years of research in distributed computing systems, and more than two decades of mobile computing. The ubiquity vision is becoming a reality. Hardware and software components evolved to deliver functionality under failure-prone environments with limited resources. The advent of web services and the progress on wearable devices, ambient components, user-generated content, mobile communications, and new business models generated new applications and services. The conference makes a bridge between issues with software and hardware challenges through mobile communications. 
 The goal of the International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies, UBICOMM 2025, is to bring together researchers from the academia and practitioners from the industry in order to address fundamentals of ubiquitous systems and the new applications related to them. The conference will provide a forum where researchers shall be able to present recent research results and new research problems and directions related to them. The conference seeks contributions presenting novel research in all aspects of ubiquitous techniques and technologies applied to advanced mobile applications. 
 Advances in web services technologies along with their integration into mobility, online and new business models provide a technical infrastructure that enables the progress of mobile services and applications. These include dynamic and on-demand service, context-aware services, and mobile web services. While driving new business models and new online services, particular techniques must be developed for web service composition, web service-driven system design methodology, creation of web services, and on-demand web services. 
 As mobile and ubiquitous computing becomes a reality, more formal and informal learning will take pace out of the confines of the traditional classroom. Two trends converge to make this possible; increasingly powerful cell phones and PDAs, and improved access to wireless broadband. At the same time, due to the increasing complexity, modern learners will need tools that operate in an intuitive manner and are flexibly integrated in the surrounding learning environment. 
 Educational services will become more customized and personalized, and more frequently subjected to changes. Learning and teaching are now becoming less tied to physical locations, co-located members of a group, and co-presence in time. Learning and teaching increasingly take place in fluid combinations of virtual and ""real"" contexts, and fluid combinations of presence in time, space and participation in community. To the learner full access and abundance in communicative opportunities and information retrieval represents new challenges and affordances. 
 Consequently, the educational challenges are numerous in the intersection of technology development, curriculum development, content development and educational infrastructure. 
 In this conference, we solicit research and industrial contributions covering developments that operate in the intersection of mobile and ubiquitous technologies on the one hand, and educational settings in open, distance and corporate learning on the other, including learning theories, applications, and systems. 
 We solicit both academic, research, and industrial contributions. We welcome technical papers presenting research and practical results, position papers addressing the pros and cons of specific proposals, such as those being discussed in the standard fora or in industry consortia, survey papers addressing the key problems and solutions on any of the above topics short papers on work in progress, and panel proposals. 
 Industrial presentations are not subject to the format and content constraints of regular submissions. We expect short and long presentations that express industrial position and status. 
 Tutorials on specific related topics and panels on challenging areas are encouraged. 
 The topics suggested by the conference can be discussed in term of concepts, state of the art, research, standards, implementations, running experiments, applications, and industrial case studies. Authors are invited to submit complete unpublished papers, which are not under review in any other conference or journal in the following, but not limited to, topic areas. 
 All topics and submission formats are open to both research and industry contributions.

 Technical Debt stands as a pivotal metaphor in the realm of software evolution, representing development shortcuts taken for expediency that cause the degradation of internal software quality. A critical element of the technical debt metaphor is its ability to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders within software development teams. The International Conference on Technical Debt (TechDebt) is the flagship conference dedicated to discuss how to identify, address, and manage technical debt in software projects. This premier event unites leading researchers and practitioners in software engineering to explore diverse strategies for managing various forms of technical debt, share experiences and best practices, and identify the most pressing challenges faced by both industry and academia. 
 The 8th International Conference on Technical Debt will be held in April 2025 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. As the previous editions, TechDebt will be co-located with the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025).

 The Ready Room will be available throughout the week. There will be some tables with computers where people can edit presentations (bring on a USB stick) and upload presentations to the presentation rooms through the Contact 1 website. There will also be AV technicians to help if needed. 
 You do not need to use the Ready Room: You have several choices: You can upload your presentation from your own computer in advance of your session (days in advance even) at the Contact 1 website (you will be sent a link). Or you can plug your computer in using an HDMI cable when you are starting your presentation. This last option is available but not recommended, since it increases the chance of delays. 
 There will be some tables and couches in the Ready Room where you can get work done, or have small get-togethers with people. 
 This room will not be ‘quiet’. If you want a quiet place to work or chill out (library quiet, no talking) then Room 209 will be available much of the time. 
 The Ready Room will also have some poster boards.

 Paper Submission Deadline: Monday, November 4, 2024, 7:59pm EST. 
 Camera-ready deadline for accepted papers: March 31, 2025. 
 The 57th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2025), sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (SIGACT), will be held in Prague, Czech Republic fromMonday, June 23toFriday, June 27. 
 Papers presenting new and original research on the theory of computation are sought. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include algorithms and data structures, computational complexity, randomness in computing, algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics, analysis of Boolean functions, approximation algorithms, cryptography, computational learning theory, continuous and discrete optimization, economics and computation, parallel and distributed algorithms, quantum computing, algorithmic coding theory, computational geometry and topology, computational applications of logic, algebraic computation, and computational and foundational aspects of areas such as machine learning, fairness, privacy, networks, data management, databases and computational biology. Papers that extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged. The program committee will make every effort to consider a broad range of areas. 
 Submission format:Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper,no author information (see below), and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the ""full version"" of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea. Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified. 
  
 Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. 
  
 STOC 2025 will use double-blind reviewing, and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not ""We build on our previous work…"" but rather ""We build on the work of…""). 
  
 The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. (In particular, to manage Conflicts Of Interests, author information will be available to the PC Chair, and possibly to a small set of PC Members on an as-needed basis.) Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. 
  
 All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition, the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions. 
  
 PC Member Submissions:Submissions authored or coauthored by PC members (other than the PC chair) are allowed. 
  
 Recommended Best Practices for References:Authors are encouraged to include hyperlink cross-referencing for bibliographic entries, theorems, sections, and so on, using for example the hyperref, cleverref, or varioref packages. If helpful, a table of contents may be added on a page immediately following the title page; this will not count towards the first ten pages. 
  
 Authors are asked to avoid ""et al."" in citations in favor of an equal mention of all authors' surnames. If the number of authors is large, consider writing ""\cite{XYZ} show..."" instead of ""X et al. show"". Bibliographic references should preferably be alphanumeric (e.g., the first letters of the authors' surnames, or at least the first three followed by +) followed by year of publication, instead of just a numerical reference. If using BibTeX, this can be accomplished by using \bibliographystyle{alpha} or \bibliographystyle{alphaurl}. 
 Conflict of Interest Policy:The submission process will include declaration of conflicts of interest (COI), to help manage the double-blind review process. This declared COI information can only be seen by the program committee chair and thus cannot be used by the rest of the program committee to deanonymize authors. (Notwithstanding, a small set of PC Members may see some of this information if their input is required in managing COIs.) STOC 2025 will use the following Conflict of Interest Policy, which combines aspects suggested by SafeToC (seehere) and the ACM Conflict of Interestpolicy. Authors should limit their COI declaration to the following categories: 
 Family member or close friend. 
 Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. 
 Person with the same affiliation. 
 Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
 Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
 Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipients of joint funding (within the last 2 years or reasonably expected within the next year) who you believe cannot objectively review your work. 
 If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, then they can contact the PC chair or anyToC advocateaffiliated with this conference directly. Note that if the program chair has reason to doubt the validity of the claim of conflict of interest, then they may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for the conflict. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., ones that do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. If authors are uncertain, they are encouraged to email the PC chair or a ToC advocate.Submission Instructions:Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing). 
 Thehref=""https://stoc25.hotcrp.com/"" - submission server
is scheduled to open on October 1, 2024.It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline. 
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
 Prior and Simultaneous Submissions:The conference will follow SIGACT's policy on prior publication and simultaneous submissions. Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which is scheduled for publication prior to June 2025, will not be considered for acceptance at STOC 2025. The only exception to this policy are prior or simultaneous publications appearing in the Science and Nature journals. SIGACT policy does not allow simultaneous submissions of the same (or essentially the same) material to another conference with published proceedings. The program committee may consult with program chairs of other (past or future) conferences to find out about closely related submissions. 
 Presentation of Accepted Papers:One author of each accepted paper will be expected to register and present the work in the form of a talk at the conference. Authors are expected to contact the program chair before submission in case it is anticipated that a strong reason (e.g., international travel restrictions) would prevent all authors from attending the conference. Authors will also be asked to upload a recording of their talk in advance of the conference, to enable it to be viewed by people who cannot attend in person. 
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
 Dates and other relevant information: 
 Paper submission deadline:Monday, November 4, 2024, 7:59pm EST. There is no separate abstract submission deadline. 
  
 Notification date:by email on or before February 1, 2025. 
  
 Camera-ready versions of accepted papers:A camera-ready copy of each accepted paper is required by March 31, 2025. The format of your paper must strictly adhere to theACM Format, and specifically the sigconf option. (LaTeX users, please use: \documentclass[sigconf,screen]{acmart}). Additional instructions will be sent directly to the authors of accepted papers. 
  
 STOC talks:Monday morning June 23 to Friday afternoon June 27, 2025. 
 Publication date:AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.) 
 Best Paper Award:The program committee may designate up to three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best Papers. All submissions are automatically eligible. In addition to the standard COI-avoidance, the final designation process will be conducted by the subset of PC Members with no submission to the conference. Rules for the award can be found athttps://www.sigact.org/prizes/best_paper.html. 
 Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award:A prize of $500 will be given to the author(s) of the best student-authored paper (or split between more than one paper if there is a tie). A paper is eligible if all of its authors are full-time students at the time of submission. To inform the program committee about a paper's eligibility, check the appropriate box in the web form on the submission server. The list of past winners can be found athttps://www.sigact.org/prizes/student.html. 
 Access to Proceedings:The committee intends to provide registered attendees with internet access to the Proceedings on a password-protected site that will be available from about two weeks before the conference until the end of the conference. Authors can opt out of this online distribution by contacting the program committee chair by March 19, 2025. 
 Student Travel Awards:SIGACT provides travel awards to students without available support, and researchers from developing countries. More information on the award process will be posted later on.

 Types of Submissions and Decisions 
 Four types of original papers can be submitted: 
 Full paper:Finished or consolidated R&D works, to be included in one of the Conference themes. These papers are assigned a 12-page limit. 
 Short paper:Ongoing works with relevant preliminary results, open to discussion. These papers are assigned a 8-page limit. 
 Poster paper:Initial work with relevant ideas, open to discussion. These papers are assigned to a 4-page limit. 
 Company paper:Companies' papers that show practical experience, R & D, tools, etc., focused on some topics of the conference. These papers are assigned to a 8-page limit. 
 Submitted papers must comply with the format of Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems series (seehref=""https://www.springer.com/us/authors-editors/conference-proceedings/conference-proceedings-guidelines"" - Instructions for Authors at Springer Website)
, be written in English, must not have been published before, not be under review for any other conference or publication and not include any information leading to the authors’ identification. Therefore, the authors’ names, affiliations and bibliographic references should not be included in the version for evaluation by the Program Committee. This information should only be included in the camera-ready version, saved in Word or Latex format and also in PDF format.These filesmustbe accompanied by theConsent to Publish formfilled out,in a ZIP file, and uploaded at the conference management system. 
 All papers will be subjected to a “double-blind review” by at least two members of the Program Committee. 
 Based on Program Committee evaluation, a paper can be rejected or accepted by the Conference Chairs. In the later case, it can be accepted as the type originally submitted or as another type. Thus, full papers can be accepted as short papers or poster papers only. Similarly, short papers can be accepted as poster papers only. 
 Poster papers and Company papers are not published in the Conference Proceedings, being only presented and discussed. The authors of accepted poster papers should build and print a poster to be exhibited during the Conference. This poster must follow an A1 or A2 vertical format. The Conference includes Work Sessions where these posters are presented and orally discussed, with a 7 minute limit per poster. 
 The authors of accepted Full papers will have 15 minutes to present their work in a Conference Work Session; approximately 5 minutes of discussion will follow each presentation. The authors of accepted Short papers and Company papers will have 11 minutes to present their work in a Conference Work Session; approximately 4 minutes of discussion will follow each presentation. 
 Publication and Indexing 
 To ensure that a full paper or short paper is published and presented, poster paper or company paper is presented, at least one of the authors must be fully registered by the 15thof January 2025, and the paper must comply with the suggested layout and page-limit. Additionally, all recommended changes must be addressed by the authors before they submit the camera-ready version. 
 No more than one paper per registration will be published. An extra fee must be paid for publication of additional papers, with a maximum of one additional paper per registration. One registration permits only the participation of one author in the conference. 
 Full and Short papers will be published in Proceedings by Springer, in several books ofof the Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems series. Poster and company papers will not be published, just presented in the conference. 
 Published Full and Short papers will be submitted for indexation by WoS, SCOPUS, DBLP and Google Scholar, among others, and will be available in the SpringerLink Digital Library. 
 The authors of the best selected papers will be invited to extend them for publication in international journals indexed by WoS/SCI, SCOPUS and DBLP, among others, such as:

 Jump to Detailed Instructions 
 Plagiarism & Use of ChatGPT or similar LLMs Policy 
 Plagiarism and the Use of ChatGPT or similar LLMs Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. Note that this policy does not prohibit authors from using LLMs for editing or polishing author-written text. 
 AAAI’2025 furthermore follows AAAI policy that any AI system, including Generative Models such as Chat-GPT, BARD, or DALL-E, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers published by AAAI and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in papers published by AAAI. Authors assume full responsibility for content, including checking for plagiarism and veracity of all text. 
 Any allegation of plagiarism, whether the result of the use of an LLM or otherwise, which comes to AAAI’s attention will be thoroughly investigated. If substantiated, the matter will be dealt with very seriously. Possible sanctions include rejection/retraction of the work, notification to all the authors’ institutions or employers and any other relevant bodies, and denial of service for and access to all AAAI-sponsored meetings. 
 Summary 
 Three technical tracks (Main Track; AI for Social Impact; AI Alignment) 
 Two-phase reviewing: two reviews in Phase 1, additional reviews in Phase 2 for papers not rejected in Phase 1. Author response after Phase 2, only for papers not rejected in Phase 1. 
 Three kinds of supplementary material may be submitted alongside all papers: (1) technical appendix; (2) multimedia; (3) code and data. Supplementary material deadline is 3 days after the paper submission deadline. 
 Additional pages for references only. 
 All authors must complete a reproducibility checklist, which facilitates replication of the reported research. 
 All authors are expected to be available to review (light load), unless extenuating circumstances apply. 
 Note that the NeurIPS fast track from previous years will not be included this year. The submission deadline is after NeurIPS initial reviews are released, and authors must withdraw the paper from consideration at NeurIPS if they wish to submit to AAAI. 
 The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-25 is the Thirty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. As with AAAI-24, the theme of this conference is to createcollaborative bridgeswithin and beyond AI. In addition to the bridge theme, we emphasize the importance of AI for social impact and responsible AI. Like AAAI 2024 conference, AAAI-25 will feature technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibition programs, and two other activities: a Bridge Program and a Lab Program. Many of these activities are tailored to the theme of bridges and are selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers. 
 AAAI-25 is an in-person conference. 
 Timetable for Authors 
 Please see thetimetable in the sidebar. 
 ​Collaborative Bridge Theme 
 Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today, both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating collaboration between two or more communities directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridges is broad and encompasses disciplines within and outside of AI. Hence, the communities that our Bridge Program is intended to bring together could be distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities. 
 Topics 
 AAAI-25 welcomes submissions reporting research that advances artificial intelligence, broadly conceived. The conference scope includes machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, multiagent systems, knowledge representation, human-in-the-loop AI, search, planning, reasoning, robotics and perception, and ethics. In addition to fundamental work focused on any one of these areas, we expressly encourage work that cuts across technical areas of AI (e.g., machine learning and computer vision; computer vision and natural language processing; or machine learning and planning), bridges between AI and a related research area (e.g., neuroscience; cognitive science), or develops AI techniques in the context of important application domains, such as healthcare, sustainability, transportation, and commerce. 
 The set of AAAI-25 keywords is available on thehref=""https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/aaai-25-keywords/"" - AAAI-25 keywords page
.href=""https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/aaai-25-keywords/#authors-guide"" - The author’s guide for choosing the best keywords
describes important considerations in selecting keywords for a paper. 
 Most papers in AAAI-25 will be part of the main track. All main track papers will be reviewed according to the same criteria and via the same process. This conference has two special tracks, which focus onAI for Social Impact, andAI Alignment. Papers in the special tracks will be reviewed according to a different evaluation rubric than papers in the main track. The same reviewing schedule will be followed for all papers. 
 Special Track on AI for Social Impact 
 As in past years, AAAI-25 will include a special track on AI for Social Impact (AISI). Submissions to this track will be reviewed according to a rubric that emphasizes the fit between the techniques used and a problem of social importance, rather than simply rewarding technical novelty. In particular, reviewers will assess the significance of the addressed problem; the paper’s engagement with previous literature on the application problem (whether in the AI literature or elsewhere); both novelty of and justification for the proposed AI-based approach; quality of evaluation; facilitation of follow-up work; and overall scope and promise for social impact. Further details are available at thehref=""https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/aisi-call/"" - AISI page
. 
 Special Track on AI Alignment 
 This year we are introducing a special track on AI alignment. This track is motivated by the fact that as we begin to build more and more capable AI systems, it becomes crucial to ensure that the goals and actions of such systems are aligned with human values. To accomplish this, we need to understand the risks of these systems and research methods to mitigate these risks. Further details are available on the AIA page, including review criteria specific to this track. 
 Review Criteria 
 AAAI is a highly selective conference. Prospective authors are therefore strongly encouraged to submit only their very best work to AAAI. 
 All submissions will be rigorously evaluated by expert reviewers to assess whether the contributions of the paper are substantive enough to warrant publication in AAAI. 
 The contributions may be theoretical, methodological, algorithmic, empirical, integrative (connecting ideas and methods across disparate subfields of AI), or critical (e.g., principled analyses and arguments that draw attention to fundamentally wrong choice of goals, assumptions, or approaches). Evaluation of submissions to the AI for Social Impact track should emphasize demonstrated or potential impact of the research in addressing pressing societal challenges, e.g., health, food, environment, education, governance, among others. Evaluation of submissions to the AI Alignment track will be evaluated using similar but slightly different from the criteria used for main track submissions. See the AI Alignment track CFP for more details. 
 All submissions will be evaluated and scored for the significance and novelty of the contributions (research problems or questions addressed, methods, experiments, analyses), theoretical and/or empirical soundness of the claims, their relevance to the AAAI community, and clarity of exposition. 
 Additional considerations include adherence to responsible research practices (e.g., with respect to human subject studies, use of sensitive data, as well as data and algorithmic bias), and of steps to ensure reproducibility of research results (e.g., by providing detailed proofs, documenting experiments, sharing data, and sharing code). 
 Solid, technical papers that explore new territory or point out new directions for research, or introduce new problems, address research questions, or introduce methods that are of interest beyond a single sub-area of AI are preferred to papers that advance the state of the art, but only incrementally, or only within a narrow sub-area of AI.

 Program Schedule 
 Here is our event schedule 
 Coming Soon 
 Event Venue 
 Catania, Sicily, Italy 
 Catania has a long and eventful history, having been founded about 2750 years ago in a very fertile area at the foot of the biggest volcano in Europe, Mount Etna. The first Sicilian University and one of the oldest in Italy was founded here in 1434. The city hosts many archeological sites, museums, churches and theatres and is close to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Besides the rich history, the magnificient Baroque architecture and the black-lava landscape, Catania is also known for its typical street food and active nightlife. 
 University of Catania, at Benedictine Monastery of “San Nicolò 
 The conference venue is one of the most beautiful city historical buildings: the Benedictine Monastery of “San Nicolò”. At 10 minutes walk from the Catania main Cathedral square you find the Monastery of San Nicolò l’Arena, a late baroque monument and one of the biggest Benedictine monastery in Europe. The construction of the building started in 1500 and has continued until today. It is an example of architectonical integration of different styles through different epochs: you can find a roman house, the cloisters and a roof garden. The monastery is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It hosts the Department of Humanities (DISUM) of the University of Catania 
 Directions 
 From the Airport to the City Centre by bus 
 Catania-Fontanarossa Airport offers bus services to the city of Catania and other surrounding areas. Bus services tend to be much cheaper than taking a taxi, and many passengers prefer this economical option. 
 The city of Catania is only a few miles away from the airport, and buses leave the airport every roughly 20 minutes to reach the city center and the train station. Buses are available from 04:40 until half past midnight. This bus transport is provided by the AMT 'Alibus' service AMTS lines Catania. 
 Take note that all bus tickets, once used, should be validated, or stamped. This is usually done by the validating machines near the entrance of the buses. The machine will put a stamp and a date on your ticket to show that it has been used. Passengers of the bus must validate their own tickets, as they are not validated by the driver of the bus. 
  
 Subway 
 Get off in Piazza Stesicoro and walk until reaching the Monastery.

 Event Venue 
 Catania, Sicily, Italy 
 Catania has a long and eventful history, having been founded about 2750 years ago in a very fertile area at the foot of the biggest volcano in Europe, Mount Etna. The first Sicilian University and one of the oldest in Italy was founded here in 1434. The city hosts many archeological sites, museums, churches and theatres and is close to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Besides the rich history, the magnificient Baroque architecture and the black-lava landscape, Catania is also known for its typical street food and active nightlife. 
 University of Catania, at Benedictine Monastery of “San Nicolò 
 The conference venue is one of the most beautiful city historical buildings: the Benedictine Monastery of “San Nicolò”. At 10 minutes walk from the Catania main Cathedral square you find the Monastery of San Nicolò l’Arena, a late baroque monument and one of the biggest Benedictine monastery in Europe. The construction of the building started in 1500 and has continued until today. It is an example of architectonical integration of different styles through different epochs: you can find a roman house, the cloisters and a roof garden. The monastery is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It hosts the Department of Humanities (DISUM) of the University of Catania 
 Directions 
 From the Airport to the City Centre by bus 
 Catania-Fontanarossa Airport offers bus services to the city of Catania and other surrounding areas. Bus services tend to be much cheaper than taking a taxi, and many passengers prefer this economical option. 
 The city of Catania is only a few miles away from the airport, and buses leave the airport every roughly 20 minutes to reach the city center and the train station. Buses are available from 04:40 until half past midnight. This bus transport is provided by the AMT 'Alibus' service AMTS lines Catania. 
 Take note that all bus tickets, once used, should be validated, or stamped. This is usually done by the validating machines near the entrance of the buses. The machine will put a stamp and a date on your ticket to show that it has been used. Passengers of the bus must validate their own tickets, as they are not validated by the driver of the bus. 
  
 Subway 
 Get off in Piazza Stesicoro and walk until reaching the Monastery.

 Computational Optimization 
 (CO) 
 Image 
 Kraków, Poland, 14-17 September, 2025 
 In the real world, Intelligence Systems address numerous problems in the fields of engineering, economics, medicine, and other domains. Many of these problems can be formulated as optimization tasks, in particular, we may consider challenges that are frequently characterized by non-convex, non-differentiable, discontinuous, noisy, or dynamic objective functions and constraints that ask for adequate computational methods. 
 The aim of this Thematic Session is to stimulate communication between researchers working on different fields of optimization and practitioners who need reliable and efficient computational optimization methods. 
 We invite original contributions related to both theoretical and practical aspects of optimization methods. 
 Topics 
 The list of topics includes, but is not limited to: 
 combinatorial and continuous global optimization 
 unconstrained and constrained optimization 
 multiobjective and robust optimization 
 optimization in dynamic and/or noisy environments 
 optimization on graphs 
 large-scale optimization, in parallel and distributed computational environments 
 meta-heuristics for optimization, nature-inspired approaches and any other derivative-free methods 
 exact/heuristic hybrid methods, involving natural computing techniques and other global and local optimization methods 
 numerical and heuristic methods for modeling 
 The applications of interest are included in the list below, but are not limited to: 
 classical operational research problems (knapsack, traveling salesman, etc) 
 computational biology and distance geometry 
 data mining and knowledge discovery 
 human motion simulations; crowd simulations 
 industrial applications 
 optimization in statistics, econometrics, finance, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering 
 environment modeling and optimization 
 In the past, a number of Best Paper awards was granted to participants of this Thematic SessionBest Paper Award – past winners.

 PreviousNextOverview 
 Virtually every human-technology interaction, or sensor network, generates observations that are in some relation with each other. As a result, many data science problems can be viewed as a study of some properties of complex networks in which nodes represent the entities that are being studied and edges represent relations between these entities. Such networks are often large-scale, decentralized, and evolve dynamically over time. Modeling and mining complex networks in order to understand the principles governing the organization and the behaviour of such networks is crucial for a broad range of fields of study, including information and social sciences, economics, biology, and neuroscience. 
 The aim of the20th Workshop on Modelling and Mining Networks (WAW 2025)is to further the understanding of networks that arise in theoretical as well as applied domains. The goal is also to stimulate the development of high-performance and scalable algorithms that exploit these networks. The workshop welcomes the researchers who are working on graph-theoretic and algorithmic aspects of networks represented as graphs or hypergraphs and other higher order structures. 
 WAW 2025will be held at theVilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.

Venue and Local Information 
 WAW 2025will take place at the Faculty of Philosophy, Vilnius University (Universiteto 9, Vilnius). The venue is conveniently located in the Old Town, within walking distance of numerous hotels. 
  
 Getting to Vilnius: 
 Vilnius is well-connected internationally via Vilnius Airport, located within the city. Alternatively, you can fly to Kaunas Airport (approximately 100 km from Vilnius) and either a shuttle bus to Vilnius (visitollex.lt/enfor details) or ask ChatGPT for help. Direct train connections are available from Warsaw, Krakow and Riga (visitltglink.lt), and there are also extensive international bus options (seeomio.com). 
  
 Getting around Vilnius: 
 For public transportation within the city, we recommend using the Trafi app or visitingstops.ltfor route planning. You can purchase a 60-minute ticket (allowing transfers) for €0.90 directly on buses or trolleybuses using a contactless bank card (see alsojudu.lt). Ride-hailing apps such as Bolt and Uber are widely available. For information on traditional taxis, visitGo Vilnius. 
  
 Official currency in Lithuania is Euro. Electronic payments with MasterCard and Visa are accepted in majority of shops and other points of interest. Currency exchange services are relatively uncommon. It is recommended to withdraw cash from ATMs operated by local banks, such as Šiaulių bankas, Citadele, Swedbank, Luminor, or SEB. 
  
 Within the European Economic Area (EEA), there are no mobile roaming charges. This means you can use your calls and data at domestic rates when using an EEA SIM card. Prepaid SIM cards (EZYS, LABAS, PILDYK) can be purchased at supermarkets and newsagents, but registration requires providing personal information. 
  
 Vilnius University was founded in 1579 by king Stephen Báthory of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth it was closed down in 1832 by Tsar Nikolas I of Russia after the November uprising. The university was reopened in 1919 and operates since then with a short break of 1943-1944, when it was closed by the Nazis. The first university campus shaped in the 16th century in an old city quarter is open for visitors.

 Workshop Goals 
 This workshop is a forum of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and physicists performing research on finite field arithmetic, interested in communicating the advances in the theory, applications, and implementations of finite fields. The workshop will help to bridge the gap between the mathematical theory of finite fields and their hardware/software implementations and technical applications, specially in cryptography and coding theory. 
 WAIFI 2026 will be held in Santander, Spain 
  
 Main Workshop Themes 
 The topics of WAIFI 2026 include but are not limited to: 
 Theory of finite field arithmetic: | Bases (canonical; normal; dual; etc.) 
 Polynomials (irreducible; primitive; permutation) 
 Boolean functions and special functions over finite fields 
 Algebraic curves over finite fields 
 Dynamical systems over finite fields 
 Hardware & Software implementations: | Design & implementation of finite field processors 
 Design & implementation of arithmetic algorithms

 VLDB 2025: Overview 
 The Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) is a premier annual international forum for data management, scalable data science, and database researchers, vendors, practitioners, application developers, and users. The forthcoming VLDB 2025 conference is poised to deliver a comprehensive program, featuring an array of research talks, keynote and invited talks, panels, tutorials, demonstrations, industrial tracks, and workshops. It will cover a spectrum of research topics related to all aspects of data management, where systems issues play a significant role, such as data management system technology and information management infrastructures, including their very large scale of experimentation, novel architectures, and demanding applications as well as their underpinning theory. 
 Key areas of interest for PVLDB include, but are not limited to, data mining and analytics, data privacy and security, database engines, database performance and manageability, distributed database systems, graph and network data, information integration and data quality, languages, machine learning, ai, and databases, novel database architectures, provenance and workflows, specialized and domain-specific data management, text and semi-structured data, and user interfaces. These thematic pillars represent the foundational elements underpinning the technological landscape of the emerging applications of the 21st century. 
 The VLDB 2025 conference will take place from 1st to 5th September 2025 at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre (QEII Centre) in London, UK. Located in the heart of Westminster, the QEII Centre offers a prime setting, just a five-minute walk from the iconic River Thames and two minutes from the peaceful St James’s Park. This venue perfectly balances the convenience of a central urban location with the serenity of nearby natural landmarks.

 Call for Papers 
 Software visualization is a broad research area whose general goal is to enhance and promote the theory, realization, and evaluation of approaches to visually encode and analyze software systems, including software development practices, evolution, structure, and software runtime behavior. Software visualization is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing on theories and techniques from areas such as information visualization, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, and data science, and applying these in the software engineering domain. 
 The VISSOFT conference is principally a venue for publishing and discussing research related to software visualization. Consequently, VISSOFT brings together a community of researchers from software engineering, information visualization, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, and data science to discuss theoretical foundations, algorithms, techniques, tools, and applications related to software visualization. 
 VISSOFT, co-located with ICSME, encourages a variety of submissions that address outstanding challenges in software systems using visualization. 
 Topics of interest include but are not limited to the visualization of: 
 Software Engineering data, which may include (but is not limited to) source code, dependencies, repositories, developer social networks (like StackOverflow and GitHub), mobile app reviews, documentation, runtime logs, and DevOps data 
 Software development activities, which may include design, requirements engineering, software maintenance, program comprehension, software performance, software testing, and debugging 
 Software analytical approaches based on data science concepts 
 Empirical evaluations of software visualizations, including eye-tracking studies 
 Tools, techniques, and frameworks that include visual programming languages 
 Interactive and immersive techniques and algorithms related to software development 
 Integrating tools with development environments 
 Industrial experience with using software visualization 
 Techniques used in Software Engineering Education 
 Application of trendy techniques such as Machine Learning and AI-assisted models (Large Language Models, Large Multi-Modal Models with Software) 
 Application of techniques such as Augmented and Virtual Reality, and Sonification, to software engineering activities 
 We solicit papers that present original, unpublished research results. Papers will be rigorously reviewed by an international program committee. In addition to full technical papers, VISSOFT features both a New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) Track and a Tools Track whose purpose is to present an idea still under development or to demonstrate the functionality of a newly developed tool. This year we present a new Visualization Challenge, with the goal to apply research efforts towards a collective software engineering dataset. All accepted submissions will appear in the conference proceedings and the IEEE Digital Library. 
 Submission Types 
 Research Track: 
 A paper submitted to the Research Track must describe an in-depth and mature research result relevant to software visualization. The content of a technical paper can be a maximum of 10 pages long (including all figures, tables, and appendices). However, the 10-page limit does not include the bibliography, which is limited to two additional pages. 
 All paper types common in information visualization (technique, design study/application, system, evaluation, and model, as described in [1]) could be accepted for presentation. When convenient, papers should include a user evaluation demonstrating their effectiveness, such as showcasing improvements over comparable tools or, if novel, demonstrating their utility and practical application. However, depending on the kind of paper, maybe results can be shown to be sound without a user evaluation. This could be the case, for example, of structured literature reviews, or of papers solving specific problems already shown to be relevant for users, or to address relevant technical problems. 
 The submission of a video (up to 5 minutes in length) to accompany the paper is highly encouraged to show interaction possibilities where this matters for understanding of the paper. Even when for convenience the video could be uploaded to some streaming platform, it is encouraged that it is also archived in an open access archive, such as Zenodo. Following open science practices, authors are also encouraged to archive their artifacts in a reproduction package, also archived in an open access archive. Authors who provide a video and/or a reproduction package should add the corresponding links in a specific section at the end of the paper (“Supplementary materials” section). 
 Paper Awards:VISSOFT 2025 may award distinguished technical papers. In case a paper is awarded as “best paper”, it will be invited to submit an extended version, with at least 30% of new materials, to the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics journal. This submission will go through the usual peer review process of the journal, and is not guaranteed to be accepted. 
 Artifact Evaluation:Paper authors are encouraged to submit research artifacts (e.g., tools, data repositories, frameworks, videos) for evaluation. For more details, please refer to thehref=""submission.html#artifact"" - Artifact Evaluation Track.

 NIER Track: 
 The NIER Track of VISSOFT accepts New Ideas and Emerging Results. NIER contributions have a limit of 5 pages (including bibliography). 
 NIER contributions describe work-in-progress and preliminary, exciting ideas and results. Authors are encouraged to include open questions and even provocative hypotheses to get early feedback on their research ideas. Usually, NIER contributions do not require an evaluation. One of the goals of the NIER Track is to foster collaboration among different research groups, by showcasing ideas which may lead to joint research activities.

Tools Track: 
 The Tools Track of VISSOFT accepts submissions describing already implemented and functional tools. Contributions to the Tools Track have a limit of 4 pages for short papers, and a limit of 10 pages for long papers (in both cases including all figures, tables, and appendices). For bibliography, short papers can use up to one additional page, and long papers up to two additional pages. 
 Tools Track papers describe the design or actual utilization of software visualization tools, with a focus on the architecture of the tool or its use to gain new insights. We also invite submitting significant evolutions of tools already presented (in past VISSOFT editions or in other venues). 
 Evaluation criteria: 
 Short tool papers usually just describe the presented tool, and will be evaluated mostly in terms of novelty and interest. 
 Long tool papers are expected to present a user evaluation which shows evidence of its effectiveness, for instance, improvements over other similar tools, or if it is novel, showing its utility and practical use. Long papers will be evaluated following the same criteria as in the Research track. 
 The submission of a video (up to 5 minutes in length) to accompany the paper is mandatory. Even when for convenience the video could be uploaded to some streaming platform, it is encouraged that it is also archived in an open access archive, such as Zenodo. Following open science practices, authors are also encouraged to archive their artifacts, such as the tool presented in the paper, in a reproduction package, also archived in an open access archive. Authors who provide a video and/or a reproduction package should add the corresponding links in a specific section at the end of the paper (“Supplementary materials” section). 
 Paper Awards:VISSOFT 2025 may award distinguished tool papers. 
 Showcase session:During the conference, we will organize an informal tool demonstration session where authors of TD papers are invited to demonstrate their tools. 
 Artifact Evaluation:Paper authors are encouraged to submit their tools and other related artifacts (e.g., data repositories, videos) for evaluation.

Artifact Evaluation Track: 
 Also this year, ICSME, VISSOFT, and SCAM have joined forces and present a single Artifact Evaluation Track for all three venues. We invite authors of papers of all lengths accepted to VISSOFT to submit artifacts associated with those papers for evaluation. Papers with artifacts that meet the review criteria will be awarded badges, noting their contributions to open science in SE. 
 More information on the Call for Papers of the Joint Artifact Evaluation Track are available at the ICSME 2025 web page, see thehref=""https://conf.researchr.org/track/icsme-2025/icsme-2025-artifact---rose"" - ICSME Artifact Evaluation Track.
Journal-First Track: 
 A submission to the VISSOFT 2025 call for journal-first paper presentations must adhere to the following criteria: 
 The paper was accepted by a relevant journal and it is in the scope of the conference 
 The paper was published between July 1, 2023 and July 11, 2025 
 The paper reports new research results and/or presents novel contributions that significantly extend, and were not previously reported in, prior work 
 The paper has not been presented at and is not under consideration for journal-first programs of other conferences 
 Authors of a paper that meets these criteria are invited to submit a one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, the paper’s authors, a short statement on how the work satisfies the journal first criteria, and a pointer to the original journal paper at the journal’s Website. If the paper is not online yet, then specify so. The original paper (or a preprint) should also be sent during submission. 
 The journal-first manuscripts are published through the journals and will not be part of the Conference proceedings. The journal-first papers will be listed in the conference program. Journal first presentations will have a presentation time similar to technical papers.

Poster Track: 
 The poster track of VISSOFT provides an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present their new and innovative preliminary work in an informal, interactive setting. Conference attendees can learn about novel on-going research projects that might not yet be complete, but whose preliminary results are already interesting. Poster presenters will have an opportunity to discuss their work and get feedback from knowledgeable sources at an early stage of their research. 
 The poster track of VISSOFT accepts two-page documents, typically combining text and images, that embody a succinct description of work that has been done. Presenting a poster is a good way to discuss and receive feedback on a work in progress that has not been fully developed into a paper. Posters should not present previously published work. 
 Poster manuscripts will be part of the Conference proceedings, and evaluated by the Program Co-Chairs on their suitability to VISSOFT topics of interest.

Visualization Challenge Track (NEW!): 
 The Visualization Challenge track of VISSOFT 2025 provides an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to contribute their expertise focused on a single software system. This collective effort aims to combine different perspectives so that insights from the visualization can reveal new understandings for the VISSOFT community. 
 This year, the target software system is the Linux kernel. Authors are free to use any existing dataset available related to the raw data source which is the Linux kernel. 
 Raw data source is: 
 Git repositories: | Kernel.org git repositories 
 PatchWork Projects: | Project List - Patchwork 
 GitHub mirror for Torvalds repository: | torvalds/linux: Linux kernel source tree 
 Examples of Datasets that can be used (if you happen to know any other dataset, inform the PC chairs so we can include it in this list): 
 Yulin Xu and Minghui Zhou. 2018. A multi-level dataset of Linux kernel patchwork. In Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR '18). Association for Computing Machinery, New York, NY, USA, 54–57. | https://doi.org/10.1145/3196398.3196475

 Examples of submissions could be a research team applying one of their tools to the dataset, or a part of it, aiming for a specific outcome; some analytical and empirical approaches with visual outputs; the customization of a tool to analyze a specific aspect of the Linux kernel which could include the source code, developer contributors or the bug fixes to the project; etc. In general, visualizations that help to understand the utility of tools (using the Linux kernel as a use case), or which show interesting aspects of the Linux kernel, will be welcome. 
 The visualization challenge track of VISSOFT 2025 accepts submissions composed of a short abstract, a video (up to 5 minutes in length), and optionally (but conveniently) a link to a tool demo. Authors should add the URL to the video at the end of the abstract (e.g., Video URL: https://youtu.be/XXX). 
 Challenge abstracts will be evaluated mostly in terms of novelty and interest. 
 After notification, accepted papers must submit a 2-4 page submission of the challenge, that must describe the design or actual utilization of software visualization tools, with a focus on the architecture of the tool or its use to gain new insights of the kernel. 
 Challenge manuscripts will be part of the Conference proceedings, and evaluated by the Program Co-Chairs, based on their suitability for VISSOFT topics of interest.

Showcase Session 
 As successfully done in the past, at VISSOFT 2025 authors of all accepted papers in all tracks, and specially in the Tools Track and in the Visualization Challenge Track, will be invited to demonstrate their approaches and tools to the participants in an informal setting. More details will follow a few weeks before the conference. 
 How to submit 
 Papers must strictly adhere to the two-column IEEE conference proceedings format and the page. Please use the available IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings:https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.htmlIf a submission is accepted, at least one author of the associated journal paper must register and present the paper at the conference. 
 Supplemental material (e.g., video, data, software) that might be helpful for reviewers can be linked in your paper. Following open science practices, authors are also encouraged to archive their artifacts in a reproduction package in an open access archive. Authors who provide a video and/or a reproduction package should add the corresponding links in a specific section at the end of the paper (“Supplementary materials” section). 
 Submission link:href=""https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vissoft2025"" - https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vissoft2025

 SESSION: Keynotes 
 In pursuit of a trusted computing base: the journey through virtualization (keynote) 
 Haibo Chen 
 A common approach to securing computing systems is identifying and securing the trusted computing base (TCB), which enforces the overall security policies under a particular threat model. For the sake of whole-system security, the TCB should be small enough to be trustworthy, be capable of mediating critical operations to enforce security policies and have a minimized attacking surface. 
 In this talk, I will introduce my journey of exploring virtualization to creating a TCB for both mobile and cloud systems. I will also share my experiences of making the TCB efficient and trustworthy, through exploiting existing hardware mechanisms as well as hardware/software co-designs. Finally, I will briefly outlook the challenges and opportunities in virtualization-based TCB for emerging computing models like serverless and AIoT. 
 Virtual programming environments: programming the cloud (keynote) 
 David Grove 
 Cloud-based applications are ubiquitous and essential. We expect them to be simultaneously scalable and available and simple to build and deploy. Virtual Programming Environments are what make these applications possible. Virtual Programming Environments are themselves complex distributed systems, built using the entire spectrum of System and Runtime Virtualization technology that is the subject of VEE. In the first part of the talk, I will focus on the purest form of Serverless Computing: Functions as a Service (FaaS) as embodied in Virtual Programming Environments such as AWS Lambda or Apache OpenWhisk. I will describe the programming abstractions they provide to the developer and how these abstractions are realized using virtualization technology. In the second part of the talk, I will outline the research challenges in moving beyond FaaS to build Virtual Programming Environments that can productively support building complex stateful applications on the cloud.

 Portkey: hypervisor-assisted container migration in nested cloud environments 
 Chandra Prakash 
 Debadatta Mishra 
 Purushottam Kulkarni 
 Umesh Bellur 
 Derivative cloud service providers use nesting to provision virtual computational entities (VCE) within VCEs, e.g., containers runtimes within virtual machines. As part of resource management and ensuring application performance, migration of nested containers is an important and useful mechanism. Checkpoint Restore In Userspace (CRIU) is the dominant method for migration, used by Docker and other container technologies. While CRIU works well for container migration from host to host, it suffers from significant increase in resource requirements in nested setups. The overheads are primarily due to the high network virtualization overhead in nested environments. While techniques such as SR-IOV can mitigate the overheads, they require additional hardware features and tight coupling of network endpoints. Based on our insights of network virtualization being the main bottleneck, we present Portkey - a software-based solution for efficient nested container migration that significantly reduces CPU utilization at both the source and destination hosts. Our solution relies on interposing a layer that directly coordinates network IO from within a virtual machine with the hypervisor. A new set of hypercalls provide this interfacing along with a control loop that minimizes the hypercall path usage. Extensive evaluation of our solution shows that Portkey reduces CPU usage by up to 75% and 82% at the source and destination hosts, respectively. 
 Container-aware I/O stack: bridging the gap between container storage drivers and solid state devices

 Hai Jin 
 Solid State Devices(SSDs) have been widely adopted in containerized cloud platforms as they provide parallel and high-speed data accesses for critical data-intensive applications. Unfortunately, the I/O stack of the physical host overlooks the layered and independent nature of containers, thus I/O operations require expensive file redirect (between the storage driver, Overlay2/EXT4, and thevirtual file system, VFS) and are scheduled sequentially. Moreover, containers suffer from significant I/O contention as resources at the native file system are shared between them. This paper presents aContainer-aware I/Ostack(CAST). CAST is made up ofLayer-awareVFS(LaVFS) andContainer-aware NativeFileSystem(CaFS). LaVFS locates files based on layer information and enables simultaneousCopy-on-Write(CoW) operations and thus avoids the overhead of searching and modifying files. CaFS, on the other hand, provides contention-free access by designing fine-grain resource allocation at the native file system. Experimental results using a NVMe SSD with micro-benchmarks and real-world applications show that CAST achieves 216%-219% (38%-98%, respectively) improvement over the original I/O stack. 
 ClusterRR: a record and replay framework for virtual machine cluster 
 Wei Wang 
 Zhiyu Hao 
 Lei Cui 
 The Record and Replay (RnR) technology provides the ability to reproduce past execution of systems deterministically. It has many prominent applications, including fault tolerance, security analysis, and failure diagnosis. In system virtualization, previous RnR researches mainly focus on individual VM, including coherent replaying of multi-core systems, reducing performance penalty and storage overhead. However, with the emerging of distributed systems deployed in virtual machine clusters (VMC), the existing RnR technology of individual VM can not meet the requirements of analyzers and developers. The critical challenge for VMC RnR is to maintain the consistency of global state. In this paper, we propose ClusterRR, a RnR framework for VMC. To solve the inconsistency problem, we propose coordination protocols to schedule the record and replay process of VMs. Meanwhile, we employ a Hybrid RnR approach to reduce the performance penalty and storage costs caused by recording network events. Moreover, we implement ClusterRR on QEMU/KVM platform and utilize a network packets retransmission framework to guarantee the reproducibility of VMC replay. Last, we conduct a series of experiments to measure its efficiency and overhead. The results show that ClusterRR would efficiently replay the execution of the whole VMC at instruction-level granularity. 
 EOP: efficient operator partition for deep learning inference over edge servers 
 Yuanjia Xu 
 Heng Wu 
 Wenbo Zhang 
 Yi Hu 
 Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have demonstrated great success for its attractive ability of high accuracy used in artificial intelligence Internet of Things applications. A common deployment solution is to run such DL inference tasks on edge servers. In a DL inference, each operator takes tensors as input and run in a tensor virtual machine, which isolates resource usage among operators. Nevertheless, existing edge-based DL inference approaches can not efficiently use heterogeneous resources (e.g., CPU and low-end GPU) on edge servers and result in sub-optimal DL inference performance, since they can only partition operators in a DL inference with equal or fixed ratios. It is still a big challenge to support partition optimizations over edge servers for a wide range of DL models, such as Convolution Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Transformers. 
 In this paper, we present EOP, an Efficient Operator Partition approach to optimize DL inferences over edge servers, to address this challenge. Firstly, we carry out a large-scale performance evaluation on operators running on heterogeneous resources, and reveal that many operators do not follow similar performance variation when input tensors change. Secondly, we employ three categorized patterns to estimate the performance of operators, and then efficiently partition key operators and tune partition ratios. Finally, we implement EOP on TVM, and experiments over a typical edge server show that EOP improves the inference performance by up to 1.25−1.97× for various DL models compared to state-of-the-art approaches. 
 Enabling pipeline parallelism in heterogeneous managed runtime environments via batch processing 
 Florin Blanaru 
 Athanasios Stratikopoulos 
 Juan Fumero 
 Christos Kotselidis 
 During the last decade, managed runtime systems have been constantly evolving to become capable of exploiting underlying hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and FPGAs. Regardless of the programming language and their corresponding runtime systems, the majority of the work has been focusing on the compiler front trying to tackle the challenging task of how to enable just-in-time compilation and execution of arbitrary code segments on various accelerators. Besides this challenging task, another important aspect that defines both functional correctness and performance of managed runtime systems is that of automatic memory management. Although automatic memory management improves productivity by abstracting away memory allocation and maintenance, it hinders the capability of using specific memory regions, such as pinned memory, in order to perform data transfer times between the CPU and hardware accelerators. 
 In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a series of memory optimizations specifically tailored for heterogeneous managed runtime systems. In particular, we propose: (i) transparent and automatic ""parallel batch processing"" for overlapping data transfers and computation between the host and hardware accelerators in order to enable pipeline parallelism, and (ii) ""off-heap pinned memory"" in combination with parallel batch processing in order to increase the performance of data transfers without posing any on-heap overheads. These two techniques have been implemented in the context of the state-of-the-art open-source TornadoVM and their combination can lead up to 2.5x end-to-end performance speedup against sequential batch processing. 
 Transparent and lightweight object placement for managed workloads atop hybrid memories 
 Zhe Li 
 Mingyu Wu 
 Managed workloads show strong demand for large memory capacity, which can be satisfied by a hybrid memory sub-system composed of traditional DRAM and the emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technology. Nevertheless, NVM devices are limited by deficiencies like write endurance and asymmetric bandwidth, which threatens managed applications’ performance and reliability. Prior work has proposed different object placement mechanisms to mitigate problems introduced by NVM, but they require domain-specific knowledge on applications or significant change on managed runtime. By analyzing the performance of representative data-intensive workloads atop NVM, this paper finds that reducing write operations is key for performance and wear-leveling. To this end, this paper proposes GCMove, a transparent and efficient object placement mechanism for hybrid memories. GCMove embraces a lightweight write barrier for write detection and relies on garbage collections (GC) to copy objects into different devices according to their write-related behaviors. Compared with prior work, GCMove does not require significant changes in heap layout and thus can be easily integrated with mainstream copy-based garbage collection. The evaluation on various managed workloads shows that GCMove can eliminate 99.8% of NVM write operations on average and improve the performance by up to 19.81× compared with the NVM-only version. 
 Capability Boehm: challenges and opportunities for garbage collection with capability hardware 
 Dejice Jacob 
 Jeremy Singer 
 The Boehm-Demers-Weiser Garbage Collector (BDWGC) is a widely used, production-quality memory management framework for C and C++ applications. In this work, we describe our experiences in adapting BDWGC for modern capability hardware, in particular the CHERI system, which provides guarantees about memory safety due to runtime enforcement of fine-grained pointer bounds and permissions. Although many libraries and applications have been ported to CHERI already, to the best of our knowledge this is the first analysis of the complexities of transferring a garbage collector to CHERI. We describe various challenges presented by the CHERI micro-architectural constraints, along with some significant opportunities for runtime optimization. Since we do not yet have access to capability hardware, we present a limited study of software event counts on emulated micro-benchmarks. This experience report should be helpful to other systems implementors as they attempt to support the ongoing CHERI initiative.","""No information available"""

 International Conference on 
 Visual Communications and Image Processing 
 Welcome to 
 VCIP 
 2025 
 About VCIP 
 Visual Communications and Image Processing 
 The 2025 edition of Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP 2025) Conference, will be held in Klagenfurt, Austria, during December 1-4, 2025. VCIP is the oldest conference in the field and one of the flagship conferences of the CAS Visual Signal Processing and Communications Technical Committee. Since 1986 VCIP has served as a premier forum for the exchange of fundamental and applied research in the field of visual communications and image processing. 
 VCIP has a long tradition of showcasing pioneering technologies in visual communication and processing, and many landmark papers first appeared in VCIP. VCIP 2025 will cover new technology frontiers and new use cases, in the visual signal processing and communication areas, to discuss and envision the future of both technology and applications. VCIP 2025 inherits the tradition of previous conferences in providing a fertile ground for researchers, engineers, and professionals from academia and industry around the world. High-quality papers will be recommended to Transaction CSVT for journal extension. 
 Theme 
 Sustainable and Trustworthy Visual Communications in the Age of AI 
 In the Age of AI, the rapid evolution of visual technologies presents both incredible opportunities and pressing challenges for communication. Sustainable and trustworthy visual communications have become critical, as we navigate a world increasingly dominated by generative AI, deepfakes, and synthetic media. As AI systems grow more capable of creating hyper-realistic images and videos, the need for transparency, ethical standards, and responsible design has never been greater. How can we ensure that the visuals we rely on for education, journalism, and social interaction are authentic and free from manipulation? Moreover, how can we create visual content that minimizes environmental impact while remaining accessible and inclusive? This intersection of sustainability and trust in visual communications calls for innovative solutions—ones that preserve the integrity of information, protect privacy, and empower users to discern reality from illusion. By harnessing the potential of AI responsibly, we can redefine how visuals shape our perceptions of the world, ensuring they contribute to a more informed, ethical, and sustainable digital future

Overview 
 The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. We are interested in systems of all scales, from small embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds. The scope of USENIX ATC covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including but not limited to: operating systems; runtime systems; parallel and distributed systems; storage; networking; security and privacy; virtualization; software-hardware interactions; performance evaluation and workload characterization; reliability, availability, and scalability; energy and power management; and bug-finding, tracing, analyzing, and troubleshooting. 
 We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches. 
 Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum, including journals, conferences, and workshops with proceedings. They will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity. An idea or a design that the PC deems flawed can be grounds for rejection. USENIX ATC '25 will employ double-blind reviewing. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. 
 Papers need to be registered and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract at the time of the abstract registration deadline will be rejected. 
 There will be an optional artifact evaluation process for accepted papers. 
 Submission Type: Full vs. Short 
 USENIX ATC '25 accepts both full and short submissions. Full submissions must not exceed 12 pages, and short submissions must not exceed 6 pages. In both cases, the page limit excludes references and appendices but includes all text, figures, tables, footnotes, etc. Both types are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in scope. A short paper presents a complete idea that is properly evaluated, just like in a full-length submission. Optionally, authors can include an appendix to provide material that may be of interest to some reviewers, such as algorithm details, proofs, and code snippets, but is not central to the contributions of the paper. For further details, see thehref=""https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc25/submission-instructions"" - submission instructions
. 
 Deployed Systems Track 
 USENIX ATC '25 solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with real-world deployment of systems and networks. Papers for the deployed systems track (occasionally referred to as the operational systems track in other USENIX conferences) need not present new ideas or results to be accepted but should convey practical insights. Note that the rules regarding submission and anonymization are different for deployed systems track papers. The final program will explicitly identify papers accepted to the deployed systems track to distinguish them from papers accepted to the regular track. 
 Early Rejection Notifications 
 USENIX ATC '25 reviews will be conducted in multiple rounds. For papers that are rejected in an early round, early rejection notifications will be sent to the authors at least one month ahead of the date that all remaining notifications (for acceptances and additional rejections) will be sent. 
 Authors' Response Period 
 USENIX ATC '25 will provide an opportunity for authors of papers that are not early rejected to respond to the reviews prior to the final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting according to the schedule detailed above. 
 Confidentiality 
 All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the USENIX ATC '25 website. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential. 
 On the Use of Generative AI 
 While we acknowledge that generative AI is seamlessly included in many editing packages, e.g., Grammarly, and thus often hard to detect, authors must not submit papers containing sections generated entirely by generative AI. In particular, for papers including sections generated entirely by generative AI, i.e., text, graphs, experiments, etc., the authorship is not clearly that of the authors and may be tantamount to plagiarism. To this end, authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper does not include sections completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP. For more detailed questions about the appropriate use of generative AI, please feel free to contact the ATC co-chairs athref=""mailto:atc25chairs@usenix.org?subject=Questions about USENIX ATC '25 CFP"" - atc25chairs@usenix.org

 Call for Papers: Symposium on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) 2025 
 The call for papers is now closed. 
 The Symposium on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) invites submissions on all aspects of human factors and usability in the context of security and privacy. USEC ’25 aims to bring together researchers already engaged in this interdisciplinary effort with other researchers in relevant areas. We encourage economics, HCI, AI, theoretical computer science, cryptography, psychology, and business studies researchers and practitioners to submit original research in this area. We particularly encourage collaborative research from authors in multiple fields. 
 To honor significant contributions that have had a lasting impact on the field, USEC ’25 will also feature aTest of Time Award. This award will celebrate research demonstrating enduring relevance and influence in usable security and privacy over the past 14 years of USEC. We will invite nominations for this award from the Organizing Committee, Program Committee, and authors submitting their works to USEC ’25. This recognition will honor research that continues to shape and inspire current and future investigations in the discipline. 
 Submission Guidelines for Papers 
 All submissions must be original work; authors must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. All papers should be written in English. We will review longer papers on mature/completed work in a research track, as well as shorter papers on work in progress, or work that has yet to begin, in a vision track. We aim to provide a venue for researchers at all stages of their careers and at all stages of their projects. The text must be in Times font, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line spacing. Use thehref=""https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2025/submissions/templates/"" - templates for NDSS Symposium and co-located events
. 
 Research Track:The research track is intended to report on mature work that has been completed. The goal of the USEC’s research track is to disseminate results of interest to the broader usable security and privacy community. Papers must not be more than 12 pages in length using the two-column submission format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. Try to scale the length of the paper according to the contributions you describe therein. Authors have the option to attach to their paper‘s supplementary appendices with study materials (e.g., survey instruments, interview guides, etc.) that would not otherwise take up valuable space within the body of the paper. Reviewers are not required to read appendices, so your paper should be self-contained without them. 
 Meta-Science Track:The Meta-Science Track is intended to report on mature work and seeks to disseminate results that contribute to the broader understanding and improvement of research practices, including the replicability of studies and the systematization of existing knowledge. Submissions in this track may include comprehensive evaluations of research methodologies, studies that replicate and verify prior findings, meta-analyses that synthesize existing literature, and SoK papers that systematically organize and analyze research in a specific domain. Papers must not exceed 12 pages in length using the two-column submission format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. Authors are encouraged to scale the length of their paper according to the contributions they describe therein. Additionally, authors have the option to attach supplementary appendices with materials such as study protocols, datasets, or detailed methodological descriptions that would not otherwise take up valuable space within the body of the paper. However, reviewers are not required to read these appendices, so the main paper should be self-contained without them. 
 Vision Track:The vision track is intended to report on work in progress or concrete ideas for work that has yet to begin. The focus of the vision track is to spark discussion with the goal of providing the authors helpful feedback, pointers to potentially related investigations, and new ideas to explore. Suitable submissions to the vision track include traditional work-in-progress pieces such as preliminary results of pre-studies but also research proposals and position papers outlining future research. Papers must be up to 5 pages in length using the two-column format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. 
 The submission portal for papers:href=""https://usec25.hotcrp.com/"" - https://usec25.hotcrp.com/
Reviewing will be double-blind. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper. Authors’ prior work should be preferably referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded. Submissions that violate these requirements will be rejected without review. The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs. 
 Areas of Interest 
 Topics include, but are not limited to: 
 Innovative security or privacy functionality and design 
 New applications of existing models or technology 
 Usability evaluations of new or existing security or privacy features and lessons learned 
 Security testing of new or existing usability features 
 Psychological, sociological, and economic aspects of security and privacy 
 Research and design methodologies for human-centric security and privacy research 
 Reports of replicating previously published studies and experiments 
 Reports of failed usable privacy/security studies or experiments, with the focus on the lessons learned from such experience 
 Systematization of Knowledge 
 Inclusive security and privacy 
 Ethics in human-centric security and privacy research 
 Workforce, labels, cyber-physical systems 
 Usability in smart manufacturing 
 All submissions must clearly relate to the human aspects of security or privacy. Papers on security or privacy that do not address usability or human factors will not be considered. Likewise, papers on usability or human factors that do not address security or privacy will not be considered. The determination of whether a paper is within scope will be solely at the discretion of the program committee chairs. 
 For accepted papers, at least one author must attend USEC 2025 and present their paper. 
 Important Dates 
 Submission Deadline: | 25 November 2024, 11:59 pm, | Anywhere-on-earth (AOE) 
 Reviews Due: 16 December 2024 
 Discussion Period: 16-19 December 2024 
 Notification of Acceptance: 20 December 2024 
 Camera Ready Deadline: 28 January 2025 
 Workshop Date: 24 February 2025 
 Conflicts of Interest 
 Authors and Program Committee members are required to indicate any conflict of interest and its nature. Advisors and those that they are advising, as well as authors and PC members with an institutional relationship are considered to share a conflict of interest. Professional collaborations (irrespective of whether they resulted in publication or funding) that occurred in the past 2 years and close personal relationships equally constitute a conflict of interest. PC members, including chairs, that have a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper.

31stInternational Symposium on 
 Temporal Representation 
 and Reasoning 
 Oct. 28–30, 2024 
 Montpellier, France 
  
 href=""#Dates"" - Dates | Program | Registration | Organization | Venue 
 Introduction 
 TIME has been for more than twenty years the only yearly multidisciplinary international event dedicated to the topic of time in computer science. The purpose of the symposium is to bring together active researchers in different research areas involving temporal representation and reasoning. The symposium also welcomes research papers on the related topics of spatial and spatio-temporal representation and reasoning. In the early years, most contributions came from the Artificial Intelligence community, but the number of contributions from other areas such as Temporal Logic and Verification and partly from Temporal Databases has been increasing in the last years.

 Important message from general chairs. 
 A welcome email was sent on Sunday March 2nd at 10.20am (French time) to all in-person participants. We noticed that some did not receive it or that it was considered as spam. If that's your case, go to thehref=""./attend/welcome-to-tei25"" - dedicated welcome web page
for all the information you need. 
 Welcome to TEI'25 
 TEI'25 is the 19th annual conference dedicated to presenting the latest results in tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction. The ACM TEI conference has gained substantial visibility and activity over the past decade, resulting in outstanding works from past conferences. TEI brings together researchers, practitioners, businesses, artists, designers and students from various disciplines, including engineering, interaction design, computer science, product design, media studies and the arts. TEI'25, will take place March 04-07 2025 in Bordeaux, France. 

Theme 
 Our theme for TEI'25 issustainable TEI. The theme echoes our pressing concerns about how human activity speeds up and our questioning of how to transition to more sustainable ways of living, working, and doing research. 
 First and foremost, for many the word sustainability likely evokes climate change and the exhaustion of the world's resources. Scientific conferences, such as TEI, contribute to climate change; directly, especially by encouraging travel, but also indirectly, for example, when promoting new techniques or technologies that may be wasteful of energy or resources. At the same time, conferences remain important events enabling researchers to discover each other's work which remains (at least for now) difficult to achieve in virtual formats, particularly for work having physical components, as is typical at TEI. 
 The theme also echoes how our scientific and design practices can be sustained in the long term, by being open and reproducible and building solid bases on past work. We will attract and draw attention to meaningful work targeting long-term impact. 
 The theme also echoes caring for oneself and others, including fellow researchers, students as well as end-users of our systems. In an era going faster every year, we want TEI’25 to be a bubble where attendees can communicate about the deep meaning of their research and their long-term career perspectives. 
 The conference organization itself will engage in an approach to minimize its environmental impact. First, TEI'25 will be a hybrid conference. For those traveling within Europe, we share resources for sustainable ways of traveling. The city of Bordeaux has also put together resources for asustainable stay within the larger Bordeaux area. Concerning the research presented at the conference, TEI has a history of producing numerous objects, which may be difficult to reuse or recycle. In the past, sustainability conflicted with usability when specific tangible objects made interaction easier or wider accessible. The theme of sustainability has been gaining prominence at the TEI conference each year. Our collective responsibility as the TEI community is to embrace sustainability and demonstrate that this issue is paramount to us. 
 We will seek to attract and draw attention to work that addresses sustainability, with the aim of making a significant contribution to the sustainability discourse. This will be reflected in the conference's choice of keynote speakers, the call for scientific contributions, the curatorial brief for the art track and exhibition, and the student design challenge. 

About Bordeaux 
 Bordeaux is situated in the south west of France, between the charming Atlantic west coast and the natural region Landes de Gascogne. The architecture of Bordeaux is worldly known for its 18 century style and has been recognized by the UNESCO as a gem of humanity's heritage. Bordeaux also plays an important part in the French gastronomy especially with its exceptional wines. You can visit many vineyard around Bordeaux. Bordeaux's wine long history also resulted in a traditional pastry: the cannelé.

 General Information 
 TEI 2025 is the 19th annual conference dedicated to tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction. The ACM TEI conference brings together researchers, practitioners, artists, designers and students from a variety of disciplines including interaction design, computer science, engineering, product design, media studies and the arts. The intimate size of this single-track conference provides a unique forum for exchanging ideas and presenting innovative work through talks, demonstrations, posters, art installations, performances, hands-on studios, and scholarly workshops. 
 We invite paper submissions from a wide range of perspectives: technical, applied, empirical, theoretical, philosophical, conceptual, and artistic. We welcome contributions from fields including but not limited to: tangible interaction design, embodied interaction design, embedded computing, digital fabrication, hybrid craft, e-textiles, wearables, haptics, robotics, smart cities, smart materials, and sustainability. 
 The 2025 conference theme isSustainable TEIand we are particularly interested in contributions that relate to this theme. Topics of interest include: conservation, sustainable materials, sustainable design and engineering processes, e-waste, and climate change. We also welcome submissions that relate to the cultural and social sustainability of TEI. Areas of interest include: community development and support, mentorship, lifelong learning, diversity, and inclusion. 
 Contribution types 
 Authors are invited to submit high-quality papers that contribute to advancing this rapidly developing field. We highlight the following non-exclusive set of contribution types: 
 Artifact: | Research artifacts that advance the state of the art in Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction. Artifacts can demonstrate new technologies (e.g., new sensing techniques or algorithms), new forms of input (e.g., novel interaction techniques) or new designs (e.g., provocative or evocative objects, systems or services). 
 Method: | Tools, approaches and techniques that enable researchers, technologists, designers and practitioners to study, research and work in Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction. Methods can include new forms of study design or data analysis as well as new engineering processes or frameworks. 
 Theory: | Explorations, extensions, refutions, instantiations and other developments of and to the theories pertaining to Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction, such as theories of cognition or the mind as well as design theories and conceptual frameworks. 
 Empirical: | Studies and data that add to our understanding of Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction by, for example, providing quantitative accounts of salient aspects of human performance or qualitative characterizations of experiences with tangible artifacts and systems. Empirical submissions can detail outcomes from a very wide range of lab, field and online studies. 
 Respecting the diversity of approaches and methods that together make up TEI, each contribution type will be peer-reviewed on its own merits. We seek high-quality work regardless of the specific subdomain or topic and we expect the work to be positioned firmly in, and building on, prior research in our field. 
 Authors are encouraged to submit a paper with a length proportional to its contribution. There is no maximum or minimum length for papers. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a submission relative to its method and length. Papers should be succinct, but thorough in presenting the work. Shorter, more focused papers are encouraged and will be reviewed like any other paper. Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected. 
 Accepted submissions of all contribution types will be included as papers in the conference proceedings, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library. 
 Submission guidelines 
 FORMAT REQUIREMENTSTEI 2025 uses the new ACM workflow TAPS for submission templates and published papers. TAPS requires the use of a simplified one-column template for submission, while the final two-column paper will be rendered for publication after acceptance. We strongly recommend using the LaTeX templates rather than Word. Papers do not have a page limit. All relevant information, including submission templates in Word and LaTeX, can be found here:href=""https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions"" - https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions
AUTHORSHIP POLICYYour submission must be original. TEI only accepts original submissions. This means that your submission cannot have been published in another peer-reviewed venue or be under concurrent review at another peer-reviewed venue. Similarly, if you make multiple submissions to TEI 2025 Papers, their contributions must be distinct & self-contained from each other. Please refer to thehref=""https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship"" - ACM policy on authorship
for details. Authors should avoid using text generated by AI-tools (e.g., LLMs such as ChatGPT or similar). The use of AI-tools must be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of your submission. 
 ANONYMIZATION POLICYAll papers must be anonymized for review. Author and affiliation sections and credits must be left blank. Authors of accepted submissions will add this information in preparation of the “camera-ready” version. We are usinghref=""https://dl.acm.org/journal/imwut/author-policies#:~:text=with%20the%20Editors.-,Anonymization,in%20the%20PDF%20meta%2Ddata"" - the ACM IMWUT Anonymization Policy
. We use a relaxed model that does not attempt to conceal all traces of identity from the body of the paper. 
 Authors are expected to remove author and institutional identities from the title and header areas of the paper. Make sure that no description that can easily reveal authors’ names and/or affiliations is included in the submission (e.g., too detailed descriptions of where user studies were conducted). Also, please make sure that identifying information does not appear in the document’s meta-data (e.g., the ‘Authors’ field in your word processor’s ‘Save As’ dialog box). In addition, we require that the acknowledgments section be left blank as it could also easily identify the authors and/or their institution. 
 Further suppression of identity in the body of the paper is left to the authors’ discretion. We do expect that authors leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. However, authors are encouraged, but not required, to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], …” and use instead “As described by Jones et al. [10], …” 
 SUBMISSIONAll abstracts and, subsequently, full papers, must be submitted electronically via thePrecision Conference (PCS) websitebefore their respective deadlines (see above for all relevant dates). At time of submission, authors must select their preferred presentation format. If authors chose to present their work as a demonstration, authors will be asked to provide basic requirements of their demo. 
 Regardless of length and contribution type, a paper may be scheduled as a talk, demo and/or poster. Please reflect on what you find the most appropriate presentation format for your work is. All submissions accepted in the paper track are published as archival full papers, irrespective of the chosen presentation format. 
 REVIEW PROCESSAfter a paper-bidding process by the ACS, the program chairs will assign each paper to a primary AC (1AC) and a secondary AC (2AC). The program chairs will identify ACs with expertease in the topic area of each submission 
 The 1AC will find two external reviewers. Each external reviewer and the 2AC will write a detailed review of their assigned submissions and assess the contribution of the research to the field. Thus, each paper will receive 3 detailed reviews. 
 Once the reviews are written, the 1AC is responsible for the quality of the reviews and will write a meta review of the paper, summarizing the reviews from the two external reviewers and the 2AC. If 1ACs disagree with the other reviews, they are encouraged to write a separate review in addition to the meta-review. 
 The 1AC will present a recommendation for the paper’s acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs. Program Chairs will decide the final acceptance of all papers for inclusion in the program in a discussion phase, based on the 1AC recommendation, the reviews and fit to the conference. 
 AFTER ACCEPTANCEAfter conditional acceptance, authors will have the opportunity to implement minor modifications at the discretion of the Program Chairs. Authors will receive confirmation of final acceptance, after the camera ready version is submitted. One author of each accepted paper is required to register for TEI 2025. Accepted papers will be included in the Proceedings of TEI 2025, and will become available in the ACM Digital Library and be distributed digitally to conference delegates as part of the conference proceedings. 
 At the conference, authors of accepted submissions must present their work and be available to answer questions from other conference participants. Presenters of papers will have a presentation slot at the conference of approximately 20 minutes, though this may be altered prior to the conference based on scheduling needs. Information on presentations will be sent by email to the corresponding author. Papers whose authors do not present in any form (talk, demo and/or poster) may be removed from the ACM Digital Library and the conference proceedings. 
 Accepted authors should ensure they have obtained permissions to use licensed content and images that depict identifiable people in their conference contributions (paper/pictorial, videos, and presentations). Authors will also be required to give permissions to include their contributions in the ACM Digital Library. Authors can either assign copyright or a license to the ACM or they can pay a fee to ACM for open access. More information on rights management can be found here:href=""https://authors.acm.org/"" - https://authors.acm.org/
. Finally, and as part of this rights management process, presenting authors will be asked to opt- in to and grant permission to record and/or stream their presentations at the conference. 
 CONFIDENTIALITYConfidentiality of submissions will be maintained during the review process. All rejected submissions will be kept confidential in perpetuity. All submitted materials for accepted submissions will be kept confidential until publication. 
 TAPS procedure 
 Further details on the TAPS publication procedure, what happens after acceptance of your paper? Read the following page carefully if you have not yet done so:href=""https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions"" - https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions
For papers to be published via TAPS, the following steps will take place: 
 Some time after you submitted the copyright form that you receive from ACM, you will receive an email from TAPS asking you to upload your source files and supplementary files to TAPS. 
 We strongly suggest using the LaTeX template instead of the Word template for preparing the camera-ready (TAPS) version. Finalizing the submission using the Word template/workflow has caused authors some frustration. Please use the ACM Master Article Class and the included template. It does not matter which | \documentclass | you choose because TAPS will automatically apply | \documentclass[sigconf]{acmart} | to your source. 
 If you are using the Word template, please prepare and submit your camera-ready version as a single-column manuscript by following these ACM provided guidelines: | href=""https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions"" - https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions 
 Prepare your source files and pack them into a ZIP file that follows the directory structure shown on the TAPS page. Note: You are also required to submit PDF version of your paper. However, this PDF is just for troubleshooting – all content for the Digital Library is compiled directly from the sources. 
 Upload the ZIP file either via the upload form on the TAPS page (only for small files) or by uploading it to the external service linked on the TAPS page. 
 TAPS will check whether the sources are valid and can be compiled. After some time the TAPS page will either show you a success message or an error message (you need to check the page manually from time to time). 
 In the latter case, you will be given an error log. Please fix all issues and upload the ZIP file again until the manuscript compiles successfully. 
 Once upload and compilation are completed successfully, you need to check whether PDF and HTML versions were generated correctly. Please check whether author names, figures, equations, references, etc. are rendered correctly in both formats. If not, click the “reject” radio button in order to upload a new version. 
 Once you are satisfied with the results, please click the “approve” radio button. 
 The proceedings chairs will check your submission for completeness and obvious formatting problems. If there are changes required, they will contact the corresponding author by email. Further documentation on what TAPS is, can be found here: | href=""https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow"" - new ACM workflow | .

 The 19th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering 
 TASE 2025 
 July 14-16, 2025 
 Limassol, Cyprus 
 WELCOME 
 The 19th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering (TASE 2025) will be held in Limassol, Cyprus on July 14-16, 2025. TASE 2025 aims to provide a forum for people from academia and industry to communicate their latest results on innovative advances in software engineering. Modern society is increasingly dependent on software systems that are becoming larger and more complex. This poses new challenges to the various aspects of software engineering, for instance, software dependability in trusted computing, interaction with physical components in cyber physical systems, quality assurance in AI-embedded systems, distribution in cloud computing applications, security and privacy in general. Hence, new concepts and methodologies are required to enhance the development of software engineering from theoretical aspects. 
 TASE 2025 is the 19th in the TASE series. The past TASE symposia were successfully held in Shanghai (’07), Nanjing (’08), Tianjin (’09), Taipei (’10), Xi’an (’11), Beijing (’12), Birmingham (’13), Changsha(’14), Nanjing(’15), Shanghai(’16), Nice(’17), Guangzhou(’18), Guilin(’19), Hangzhou (’20), Shanghai (’21), Cluj-Napoca (’22), Bristol (’23),Guiyang (’24). 
 The proceedings of the TASE 2025 symposium will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Springer). The authors of a selected subset of accepted papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers in the journal Science of Computer Programming (https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/science-of-computer-programming).

 Deadline for abstract registrations:March 24, 2025, anywhere on earth (extended from March 14).Deadline for submissions:March 28, 2025, anywhere on earth (extended from March 21).Scope and Mission 
 The mission of the TARK conferences is to bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields, including Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Game Theory, Decision Theory, Philosophy, Logic, Linguistics, and Cognitive Science, in order to further our understanding of interdisciplinary issues involving reasoning about rationality and knowledge. Previous conferences have been held bi-annually around the world. The information of all previous TARK conferences can be accessed athref=""http://www.tark.org"" - http://www.tark.org
.Topics of Interest 
 These include, but are not limited to, semantic models for knowledge, belief, awareness and uncertainty, bounded rationality and resource-bounded reasoning, commonsense epistemic reasoning, epistemic logic, epistemic game theory knowledge and action, applications of reasoning about knowledge and other mental states, belief revision computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, and foundations of multi-agent systems.Content 
 Strong preference will be given to papers whose topic is of interest to an interdisciplinary audience, and papers should be accessible to such an audience. Papers will be held to the usual high standards of research publications. In particular, they should:contain enough information to enable the program committee to identify the main contribution of the work; 
 explain the significance of the work–its novelty and its practical or theoretical implications; and 
 include comparisons with and references to relevant literature. 
 Style 
 Extended abstracts should be no longer than 10 pages (excluding references). Optional technical details such as proofs may be included in an appendix. One author of each accepted paper will be expected to present the paper at the conference. Note that the 10 page limit is to ensure that the reviewers can read and express an opinion on the submission within a short time. Please ensure that the main text for the reviewers stays within this limit.Format 
 To format your paper, please use the EPTCS LaTeX style from:https://style.eptcs.org/. 
 TARK reviewing is not double-anonymised, so author names can be included in the submission.

 31st International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems 
 Scope 
 TACAS is a forum for researchers, developers and users interested in rigorously based tools and algorithms for the construction and analysis of systems. 
 The conference aims to bridge the gaps between different communities with this common interest and to support them in their quest to improve the utility, reliability, flexibility and efficiency of tools and algorithms for building systems. 
 Theoretical papers with clear relevance for tool construction and analysis as well as tool descriptions and case studies with a conceptual message are all encouraged. The topics covered by the conference include, but are not limited to: 
 specification and verification techniques; 
 software and hardware verification; 
 analytical techniques for real-time, hybrid, or stochastic systems; 
 analytical techniques for safety, security, or dependability; 
 SAT and SMT solving; 
 theorem proving; 
 model checking; 
 static and dynamic program analysis; 
 testing; 
 abstraction techniques for modeling and verification; 
 compositional and refinement-based methodologies; 
 system construction and transformation techniques; 
 machine-learning techniques for synthesis and verification; 
 tool environments and tool architectures; 
 applications and case studies. 
 Important Dates 
 The important dates are available in thehref=""/2025/cfp"" - Joint Call for Papers
. 
 Submission Categories 
 TACAS accepts four types of submissions: research papers, case-study papers, regular tool papers, and tool demonstration papers. 
 Research Papersidentify and justify a principled advance to the theoretical foundations for the construction and analysis of systems. Where applicable, they are supported by experimental validation. Artifact evaluation for regular research papers is not mandatory but strongly encouraged. 
 We do not discourage authors of regular research papers to put their submission on arXiv (or similar repos). Yet, we strongly encourage authors to not put the work on arXiv (or similar repos) around 2 weeks before and after the submission deadline, because potential reviewers may be subscribed to receive updates on recently posted papers. 
 Case-Study Papersare full length case-studies that describe the application of techniques developed by the community to a single problem or a set of problems of practical importance, preferably in a real-world setting. Case-study papers must describe the problem of interest and its novelty. It must provide a detailed description of the case-study (or studies) and various related techniques to solve the problem of interest for the case-study application. Modeling aspects of the case-study must be discussed. The case-study paper must provide detailed results on the application of formal techniques and lead to a conclusion that could be of interest beyond TACAS (to the research community pertaining to the case study). Artifact evaluation is currently not mandatory for case-study papers but undergoing artifact evaluation is strongly encouraged. 
 Regular Tool Papersare full length papers that describe a tool of interest to the community or a new version of the tool built using novel algorithmic and engineering techniques. Regular tool papers must describe tools of broad interest and utility to the TACAS community. The papers must clearly describe the problem to be solved, its importance, related work, the techniques used in the tool and their novelty, the construction of the tool, its unique features, discuss how the tool is used and present benchmarking of the tool including comparisons with other tools and previous versions of the tool. For tools from the industry, the description should be useful in allowing the community members to reproduce some of the key techniques or “tricks” in their own tools. All tool papers must undergo mandatory artifact evaluation. 
 Tool-Demonstration Papersare short papers that demonstrate a new tool or application of existing tool on a significant and novel case-study. As such, tool demo papers will be accepted if the PC decides that they are sufficiently interesting and novel to the community. Artifact evaluation is mandatory for these papers. 
 Paper Submission 
 href=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tacas25"" - Submit paper
Submissions must follow theformatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS(use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through thehref=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tacas25"" - Easychair author interface of TACAS 2025
. 
 The review process of TACAS 2025 is: 
 double-blind | for regular research papers. As such, authors of regular research papers must omit their names and institutions; refer to prior work in the third person, just as prior work by others; not to include acknowledgments that might identify them. 
 single-blind | for case study papers, regular tool papers, and tool-demonstration papers. 
 Thelengthof regular research papers, case study papers, and regular tool papers is limited to 16 pp llncs.cls (excluding the bibliography and appendices). The length of tool demonstration papers is limited to 6 pp llncs.cls (excluding the bibliography and appendices). Additional material can be placed in a clearly marked appendix, at the end of the paper. The reviewers are, however, not obliged to read such appendices. If the paper is accepted, a full version including the appendix should be made publicly available via arXiv or a similar platform. 
 TACAS 2025 allows at most four submissions per author. 
 Submissions not adhering to the formatting and length requirements specified above will be rejected immediately. 
 Conflict of Interest 
 Upon paper submission, authors are asked to declare their Conflict of Interest (COI) with TACAS 2025 PC members. A COI includes the following sources: 
 Family member or close friend. 
 Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. 
 Person with the same affiliation. 
 Involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
 Reviewer owes author a favour (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
 Frequent or recent collaborator (within last 5 years) cannot objectively review your work. If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a COI not listed above, then the author can contact TACAS 2025 PC chairs. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. If an author is uncertain of COI, the author is encouraged to email TACAS 2025 PC chairs. 
 Paper Evaluation 
 All papers will be evaluated by the program committee (PC), coordinated by the PC chairs and aided by the artifact evaluation chairs. All papers will be judged on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity. 
 Reproducibility of results is of the utmost importance for TACAS. Therefore, we encourage all authors to include support for replicating the results of their papers. For theorems, this would mean providing proofs; for algorithms, this would mean including evidence of correctness and acceptable performance, either by a theoretical analysis or by experimentation; and for experiments, one should provide access to the artifacts used to generate the experimental data. Material that does not fit into the paper page limit may be provided as appendix and/or on a supplementary website (without violating double-blind submission requirements of regular research papers), with access appropriately enabled and license rights made clear. For example, the supplemental material for reviewing case-study papers and papers with experimental results could be classified as reviewer-confidential if necessary (e.g. if proprietary data are investigated or software is not open source). 
 TACAS 2025 will userebuttal for selected submissions(those in the grey zone). 
 Artifact Evaluation 
 TACAS 2025 implementsmandatory artifact evaluation for regular tool paper and tool demonstration paper submissions. Authors of these submissions must submit the respective artifacts by October 24, 2024 (AoE). The artifact will be evaluated, and the outcome will be considered in the paper’s acceptance decision. 
 TACAS 2025 also implements avoluntary artifact evaluation for regular paper and case study paper submissions. Authors of these submissions are encouraged to submit their respective artifacts. The artifacts will be evaluated post-paper-acceptance, provided the submission has been accepted as a regular paper or case study paper at TACAS 2025. Authors of accepted regular/case-study papers may revise/submit their artifact for evaluation shortly (in one week time and not longer than January 9, 2025) after the paper has been accepted. The outcome of the voluntary artifact evaluation will not alter the paper acceptance decision. 
 Details on artifacts and their evaluation criteriaare available on thehref=""https://tacas.info/artifacts-25.php"" - artifacts page
. 
 Artifact Submission 
 Artifact submission is handled viahref=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tacas25"" - EasyChair
. After the paper submission deadline, the paper submission will be copied by us from the main track to the artifact evaluation track. In this track, you should amend your submission’s abstract and upload a ZIP archive containing your artifact. Do not attempt to create a new submission, nor change your submission’s other details such as authors or title. Because of this copying process, you can upload or update your artefact either in the main track before the paper submission deadline or in the AE track during a window before the deadline. The TACAS PC or AEC chairs will inform authors when the AE track is open for different paper categories.

 Important Dates 
 Submission deadline: 26 September 2024, 23:59 AoE 
 Rebuttal: 15-21 November 2024 
 Author Notification: 16 December 2024 
 Camera-ready version: mid-January 2025 
 Conference: 4-7 March 2025 
 Submissions 
 Format of submissions 
 Submissions should be made through EasyChair, usinghref=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=stacs2025"" - this submission link
. 
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or a full paper with at most 15 pages; this page limit excludes the title page, the references section, and a possible appendix. The title page should contain the title of the paper and the abstract, but no author information. The first section of the paper should start on the next page, and the appendix, if any, should also start on the next page after the bibliography. 
 In preparation of submissions, the usage of the LIPIcs style file is mandatory; no changes to font size, page geometry, etc. are permitted. Please refer tohref=""https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author"" - LIPIcs author instructions
. Submissions submitted after the deadline will not be considered, and submissions not adhering to the expected format risk rejection without consideration of the content. 
 Submissions should be made to appropriate tracks. The PCs reserve the right to reassign a paper to a different track, if deemed necessary. 
 The extended abstract should contain a succinct statement of the considered issues and of their motivation, a summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their significance, accessible to non-specialist readers. This should be followed by a rigorous derivation of the claimed results. Proofs omitted due to space constraints should be put into an appendix, to be read by the program committee members at their discretion. It is allowed and encouraged to provide the full version of the paper as the appendix. 
 Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed. PC members are allowed to submit their works as well, except for PC chairs. 
 Double-blind reviewing 
 As in the previous years, STACS 2025 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process: submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymised. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. 
 Conflicts of interest 
 Authors will be invited to give a list of persons with a Conflict of Interest (COI). A Conflict of Interest is limited to the following categories: 
 Family member or close friend. 
 Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. 
 Person with the same affiliation. 
 Involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
 Reviewer owes the author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
 Frequent or recent collaborator (within last 3 years) who cannot objectively review your work. 
 If you are unsure about a conflict in which a reviewer may have positive bias towards your paper, we recommend erring on the side of not declaring it since PC members and sub-reviewers will be also asked if they feel that they can fairly evaluate your paper. If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a Conflict of Interest not listed above, then they can contact PC chairs. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. Authors will be asked to declare conflicts with PC members during submission, but an author can contact PC chairs directly if they have a conflict with an individual who is likely to be asked to serve as a subreviewer for the paper. 
 Rebuttal 
 There will be a rebuttal period for authors. Authors will receive the reviews of their submissions and have a few days to prepare and submit rebuttals. These rebuttals become part of the PC discussions, but entail no specific responses. Rebuttals will be handled through EasyChair. 
 Conference 
 At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register at the conference. For authors who cannot present their paper in person, a possibility for remote presentation will be offered. 
 Proceedings 
 Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the symposium. As usual, these proceedings will appear in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (href=""https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs"" - LIPIcs
) series, based at Schloss Dagstuhl. This guarantees perennial, free and easy electronic access, while the authors retain the rights over their work. With their submission, authors consent to sign a license authorizing the program committee chairs to organize the electronic publication of their paper, provided the paper is accepted. 
 The final camera-ready of each accepted paper should be formatted in accordance with thehref=""https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs"" - LIPIcs guidelines
and taking reviewer comments into account. General instructions regarding the preparation of the camera-ready version and the style can be found athref=""https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#authors"" - LIPIcs author instructions
. Notice that there is a limit of 18 pages for the main body of the final camera-ready, excluding the bibliography, the front page(s) (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract). Any appendices to the initial submission were officially not under review and thus should not be included in the proceedings. In general, major new content can be added only if suggested by the reviewers. You are however more than welcome to have the proceedings paper link to the full version published elsewhere (e.g., on arXiv).

 The9th IFAC Symposium on System Structure and Control (SSSC),19th IFAC Workshop on Time Delay Systems (TDS), and2nd IFAC Workshop on Control of Complex Systems (COSY)will be held jointly in Gif-sur-Yvette, France, between June 30th and July 2nd, 2025. 
 The initial submission deadline isFebruary 10th, 2025. The notification of acceptance will be communicated onMarch 27th, 2025.Final submission deadline is onApril 30th, 2025. The submission link at Papercept can be found athttps://ifac.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl. Contributions can be submitted as either an extended abstract (2 pages) or a full paper (minimum 4 and maximum 8 pages initial submission, 6 pages final submission), in A4 size and PDF format. Accepted papers will be published in IFAC Papers on-line. Abstract submissions will NOT be published in IFAC Papers on-line but will be included in the conference preprints. 
 The joint conference is planned to be an in-person event to be held at CentraleSupélec in the Paris-Saclay University campus in Gif-sur-Yvette between June 30th and July 2nd, 2025. 
 The aim of this joint event is to gather academics and professionals with a particular interest in system structure, control, linear and nonlinear system theory and to offer them a forum where to discuss current research developments and open problems, as well as to establish scientific networks with a focus on the mathematical structure of systems as well as on the limits it imposes on control systems design and performance. 
 Starting with 2013, the Symposium on System Structure and Control (SSSC) and the Workshop on Time Delay Systems (TDS) take place in the framework of “joint IFAC Conferences.” The novelty of this joint event is to include the Workshop on Control of Complex Systems (COSY). The present joint conference aims to achieve the same high-quality standard of IFAC. As for the previous editions, the National Organizing Committee (NOC) and the Program Editor are the same for the “joint IFAC Conference,” and the registration fees are unique for the entire event, allowing the participants to follow sessions of any of the symposium (SSSC) and workshops (TDS, COSY). The joint conference is structured across multiple tracks, each incorporating several special or regular sessions, poster sessions, and industry presentations and demonstrations. The paper proposals will undergo a standard peer-reviewing process. Accepted and presented papers will be included in the Conference Proceedings, which will be published in IFAC PapersOnLine. 
 About 
 History of SSSC 
 The origins of the meetings on Systems Structure and Control (SSC) under the technical sponsorship of IFAC go back to the IFAC workshops first held in Prague, Czech Republic, in 1989 and 1992 and subsequently in Nantes, France, in 1995 and 1998 as conferences. Also, in late 1997 a Conference on SSC, sponsored by IFAC, had been held in Bucharest, Romania. The meeting returned to Prague in 2001 as an IFAC symposium; its 2nd Edition was held in Oaxaca, Mexico, in 2004, the 3rd at Foz do Iguassu, Brazil, in 2007, the 4th in Ancona, Italy, in 2010, the 5th in Grenoble, France (2013), the 6th in Istanbul, Turkey (2016), the 7th in Sinaia, Romania (2019) and the 8th in Montréal, Canada (2022). In this way, the series of IFAC symposiums on Systems Structure and Control has been established, and the present edition is the 9th of the series to be held in Gif-sur-Yvette, France, between June 30th and July 2nd, 2025. 
 History of TDS 
 IFAC Workshop on Time Delay Systems brings together the scientific community in systems with time delay from theory to applications. Strong interest in this research area has culminated in a series of workshops, starting first in July 1998 (Grenoble, France) and followed by those in September 2000 (Ancona, Italy), December 2001 (Santa Fe, USA), September 2003 (Rocquencourt, France), September 2004 (Leuven, Belgium), July 2006 (L’Aquila, Italy), September 2007 (Nantes, France), September 2009 (Sinaia, Romania), June 2010 (Prague, Czech Republic), June 2012 (Boston, USA), February 2013 (Grenoble, France), June 2015 (Ann Arbor, USA), June 2016 (Istanbul, Turkey), June 2018 (Budapest, Hungary), September 2019 (Sinaia, Romania), September 2021 (Guangzhou, China), September 2022 (Montréal, Canada), September 2024 (Udine, Italy). In this way, the series of annual IFAC Workshops on Time Delay Systems has been established, and the present edition is the 19th of the series to be held in Gif-sur-Yvette, France, between June 30th and July 2nd, 2025. 
 History of COSY 
 The IFAC Workshop on Control of Complex Systems brings academics and professionals from the control community who share an interest in complex systems. The workshop’s goal is to offer them a forum where to discuss current research developments, open problems, emerging structural properties, and methodologies on the control of complex systems. The first edition of IFAC COSY will be held in Bologna, Italy, in November 2022, and the present edition is the 2nd of the series to be held in Gif-sur-Yvette, France, between June 30th and July 2nd, 2025.

 Welcome to SSDBM 2025 
  
 The International Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Management 2025 is aimed to bring together domain experts, data management researchers, practitioners, and developers for the presentation and exchange of the latest research results on concepts, tools, and techniques for scalable and scientific data management. Previous editions of SSDBM focused on scientific statistical databases. In 2025, the scope of the 37th edition of SSDBM will be expanded to all scalable and scientific data management fields. The name of the conference is changed toInternational Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Managementfrom the International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management, while keeping the acronym SSDBM. 
 The new SSDBM conference will provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation and evaluation of latest advances in scalable and scientific data management. The conference program typically consists of a single track to facilitate discussion, and contains presentations of invited talks, panel sessions, and demonstrations of research prototypes and industrial systems. 
 SSDBM 2025 will be hosted by The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The conference will be held on June 23 - 25, 2025, in the Ideation Zone of the Translational Data Analytics Institute. SSDBM 2025 will continue the tradition of past SSDBM meetings in providing a stimulating environment to encourage discussion, fellowship and exchange of ideas in all aspects of research related to scientific and statistical data management, and high-performance data analysis tools and techniques for distributed datasets.

Overview 
 The 2025 Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS) will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners in human computer interaction, security, and privacy. The program will feature: 
 Technical papers, including replication papers and systematization of knowledge papers 
 Workshops and tutorials 
 A poster session 
 Lightning talks 
 Technical Papers 
 We invite authors to submit previously unpublished papers describing research or experience in all areas of usable privacy and security. We welcome a variety of research methods, including both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Papers will be judged on their scientific quality, overall quality, and contribution to the field. Topics include, but are not limited to: 
 Innovative security or privacy functionality and design 
 Field studies of security or privacy technology 
 Usability evaluations of new or existing security or privacy features 
 Security testing of new or existing usability features 
 Longitudinal studies of deployed security or privacy features 
 Studies of administrators or developers and support for security and privacy 
 Organizational policy or procurement decisions and their impact on security and privacy 
 Lessons learned from the deployment and use of usable privacy and security features 
 Foundational principles of usable security or privacy 
 Ethical, psychological, sociological, or anthropological aspects of usable security and privacy 
 Usable security and privacy implications/solutions for specific domains (e.g., IoT, medical, vulnerable populations) 
 Replicating or extending important previously published studies and experiments 
 Systematization of knowledge papers that integrate and systematize existing knowledge to provide new insight into a previously studied area 
 Paper Registration:Technical papers must be registered byFebruary 6, 2025. Registration is mandatory for all papers. Registering a paper in the submission system requires filling out all the fields of the online form that describe the submission, but does not require uploading a PDF of the paper.This information must describe the paper accurately, in sufficient detail to assign appropriate reviewers. Placeholder, incomplete, or inaccurate titles and abstracts may result in rejection without review. 
 Paper Submission:Technical papers must be uploaded as PDFs byFebruary 13, 2025(but note the mandatory February 6, 2025, registration deadline above). All submissions must follow the guidelines described below.Submissions that violate any of the requirements below may be rejected without review. 
 Contact the program chairs prior to submission athref=""mailto:soups25chairs@usenix.org"" - soups25chairs@usenix.org
if you have any questions about these requirements. 
 Format and Page Limits:Papers must use the SOUPS formatting template (available forhref=""https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference-files/usenix2025_soups.doc"" - MS Word
orhref=""https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference-files/usenix2025_soups_latex-template.zip"" - LaTeX
) and be submitted as a PDF via thehref=""https://soups2025.usenix.hotcrp.com/"" - web submission system
. Submissions must be no more than 12 pages (excluding acknowledgments, bibliography, and appendices).For the body of your paper, brevity is appreciated, as evidenced by the fact that many published papers in prior years have been well under this limit. 
 Submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for references and for supplementary material in appendices. The paper should stand alone without the supplementary material. We encourage authors to use the appendices for content that is peripheral to the main contributions of the paper but that may interest some readers or that may facilitate replication. Note that members of the program committee are free to not read this material when reviewing the paper. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers have an official limit of 12 pages (excluding acknowledgments, bibliography, and appendices) and 20 pages total including references and appendices. The program committee chairs will grant any extension they determine reasonable to accommodate references and supplemental material. 
 Paper Content:Papers need to describe the purpose and goals of the work, cite related work, show how the work effectively integrates usability or human factors with security or privacy, and clearly indicate the innovative aspects of the work or lessons learned as well as the contribution of the work to the field. The paper abstracts should contain a sentence summarizing the contribution to the field and literature. 
 All submissions must clearly relate to the human aspects of security or privacy. Papers on security or privacy that do not address usability or human factors will not be considered. Likewise, papers on usability or human factors that do not address security or privacy will not be considered. The determination of whether a paper is within scope will be solely at the discretion of the program committee chairs. 
 Your paper and research approach—including research instruments—should be inclusive and respectful. Avarietyofguidanceexistson this topic. 
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers:We are soliciting Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that integrate and systematize existing knowledge to provide new insight into a previously studied area of usable security or privacy. SoK papers should draw on prior work to put forth a new taxonomy, argument, or observation in an area in which substantial work has already been done. SoK papers should be more than a survey or summary of prior work in an area. SoK papers will be held to the same scientific and presentation standards as other technical papers. Please prefix the title of these papers with “SoK:” and check the SoK checkbox on the submission form to flag them for the review process. 
 Replication Papers:In addition to original work, we are soliciting well-executed replication studies that meaningfully confirm, question, or clarify the result under consideration. Please prefix the title of these papers with the word “Replication:” for the review process. 
 Replication papers should aim to replicate important/influential findings from the literature. They may not necessarily offer new or unexpected findings; papers confirming previous findings are also considered contributions. Replication of a result that has already been replicated many times is less valuable. Replication of an obscure study that originally had only minimal influence on the community is less valuable. Authors should clearly state why they conducted a replication study, describe the methodological differences precisely, and compare their findings with the results from the original study. 
 Replication papers will be held to the same scientific standards as other technical papers. They should use currently accepted methodologies and technologies. Authors should not reuse outdated methods/technologies simply because they were used in the original paper. Replications may follow the same protocol as the original study, or may vary one or more key variables to see whether the result is extensible (e.g., re-running a study with a sample from a different population). 
 Anonymous Submission:Reviewing is anonymous. No names or affiliations should appear on the title page or in the body of the paper, acknowledgments should be removed, and papers should avoid revealing the authors' identities in the text (e.g., don't name a specific organization's ethics review board or similar) or in the PDF metadata.Any references to the authors' own work should be made in the third person, as if it was work by someone else.Appendices and figures should also be de-identified (e.g., do not leave logos or contact info on study materials, and remove identifying URLs from screenshots). Please ensure all author names, affiliations, URLs, etc. have been removed; even minor mistakes may result in rejection without review. Contact the program chairs athref=""mailto:soups25chairs@usenix.org"" - soups25chairs@usenix.org
if you have any questions. 
 Overlap with Previous Papers:href=""https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/submissions-policy"" - USENIX policy
prohibits simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, and plagiarism. SOUPS further prohibits the submission of substantially similar work to multiple venues. On the recommendation of a program chair, USENIX may take action against authors who have committed these practices. Any overlap between your submitted paper and other work either under submission, previously published, or submitted elsewhere before the SOUPS notification deadline must be documented in an explanatory note sent to the chairs. If a subsequent overlapping submission is made during the review process, the chairs should be notified. State precisely how the two works differ in their goals, share experiments or data sources, and offer unique contributions. If the other work is under submission elsewhere, the program committee may ask to review that work to evaluate the overlap. Please note that program committees frequently share information about papers under review and reviewers usually work on multiple conferences simultaneously. Technical reports, e.g., arXiv reports, are exempt from this rule. If in doubt, please contact the program chairs athref=""mailto:soups25chairs@usenix.org"" - soups25chairs@usenix.org
for advice. 
 Self-plagiarism includes verbatim or near-verbatim use of one's own published work without citing the original source and is generally not acceptable. In some cases, it may be acceptable to include abriefportion of selected content from the introduction, background, related work, or methods of a closely related paper. In these cases, the original paper must be explicitly referenced and the overlap should be clear to the reader. The reused content must not be part of the main contributions of the paper and, where possible, rewriting the text is preferred. Papers with significant text reuse may be rejected because of too much overlap. If in doubt, please contact the program chairs athref=""mailto:soups25chairs@usenix.org"" - soups25chairs@usenix.org
for advice. 
 Appendices:Authors may attach to their paper supplementary appendices containing study materials (e.g., survey instruments, interview guides, etc.) that would not otherwise fit within the body of the paper. These appendices may also include any material that could assist reviewers with questions that fall outside the stated contribution of your paper on which your work is to be evaluated. Appendices can include links (e.g. to a working prototype or source code repository or data repository); please include full links (not shortened ones), and try to use long-term archives like osf.io or Dataverse for online appendices. Reviewers are not required to read any appendices, so your paper should be self contained without them. We note that in recent years, inclusion of study materials as appendices has become very common, and reviewers may choose to refer to appendices for clarification or confirmation. Accepted papers will be published online with their supplementary appendices included. 
 Conflicts of Interest:The submission system will request information about conflicts of interest between the paper's authors and program committee (PC) members, including a brief explanation. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when one or more of the following conditions holds: 
 The PC member shared an institutional affiliation with the author in the prior two years. 
 The PC member was the advisor or advisee of the author at any time. 
 The PC member has collaborated or published with the author in the prior two years. 
 The PC member is serving as the sponsor or administrator of a grant that funds the author's research. 
 The PC member is a close personal friend or relative of the author. 
 We recognize that special circumstances may exist, such as deep personal animosity. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the program chairs athref=""mailto:soups25chairs@usenix.org"" - soups25chairs@usenix.org
. 
 Ethical Research:User studies should follow the basic principles of ethical research, including beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), minimal risk (appropriateness of the risk versus benefit ratio), voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. Studies that rely on crowdworkers can incur additional ethical obligations, including but not limited to paying a fair wage. If images of participants are included in the paper, make sure that these images will not create potential risk for participants and that the informed consent covers potential publication of participant images. 
 All papers, especially those with human subjects studies, are expected to discuss ethical considerations. Risks and benefits of the presented research should be weighed. Methodological decisions should be justified. Authors may be asked to provide additional explanations should questions arise during the review process. 
 If your organization or institution requires formal clearance for research with human subjects, your paper may be rejected if clearance is not obtained. However, such clearance alone does not guarantee acceptance, and the program committee may reject a paper on ethical grounds. 
 Early Rejections:Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. At this point, papers are no longer considered under submission (except if authors appeal). 
 Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the program committee chairs. Authors' appeals must clearly and explicitly identify concrete disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection. 
 Response:A response period will occur after the second round of reviews. Authors will be given a chance to see reviews, and they may provide a short response that will be considered in subsequent discussions. Due to time constraints, the response period is fairly short.Please ensure that you reserve enough time between April 17–24, 2025, for the response process. Late responses will not be accepted. 
 Presentation:For accepted papers, we require at least one of the paper authors to attend the conference and present the work. However, in exceptional cases, authors of accepted papers may present remotely with permission from the PC Co-Chairs. If you have any questions, please contact the program chairs athref=""mailto:soups25chairs@usenix.org"" - soups25chairs@usenix.org

 Topics 
 SOSP takes a broad view of systems and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including: operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, virtualization, networking as it relates to operating systems, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interaction of computer systems with related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, verification, and databases. In keeping with SOSP tradition, we will favor work that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with or measurements of state-of-the-art implementations. 
 Submission Criteria 
 Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. A good paper will: 
 Motivate a significant problem; 
 Propose and implement an interesting, compelling solution; 
 Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution; 
 Draw appropriate conclusions; 
 Clearly describe the paper's contributions; 
 Articulate the advances beyond previous work; and 
 Be accessible to the broader systems community. 
 We encourage submission of groundbreaking work in significant new directions, with the understanding that the evaluation criteria for papers addressing new problems may be different from those continuing a line of work in a more established area. 
 Originality 
 Submissions should contain original, unpublished material. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism is not allowed. 
 Submissions that extend the authors' previous work are welcome, but authors must explain the differences between the SOSP submission and the prior work, much in the same way that the authors are expected to articulate the contributions of their submission as they relate to prior work by others. 
 Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in SOSP. As long as there is significant additional content in the submission compared to the prior workshop publication, the PC will evaluate the submission's entire contribution, not just the delta. 
 Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is explicitly permitted. 
 Resubmissions 
 Submitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted, although authors are expected to have improved the paper to address substantive issues raised in previous reviews. Authors should provide information regarding the previous submission(s) and a summary of the subsequent revisions to the paper. This description, which will be supplied to reviewers after they’ve completed their reviews, helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit the description of changes to one page. All information should be properly anonymized, as described below, and should be uploaded via the submission form. 
 Anonymity 
 SOSP will use double-blind reviewing. Please make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of the author names. If the name of your project or system is already known to the community (e.g., through arXiv, technical reports, talks, social media posts, or other uses), your SOSP submission must use an anonymized name. 
 Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. For example, you might say ""Our system modifies the XYZ operating system built by Lee et al. [Lee17]"". 
 For concurrent submissions on related topics, cite an anonymized version of the concurrent submission and discuss the relation between the submissions. Additionally, email the PC chairs (sosp2025@gmail.com) with a copy of your other concurrent submission. 
 If your submission reports on experiences with a system at your institution or organization, you should refer to the system anonymously but describe the properties of the system that are needed to appreciate the work (e.g., size of the user base, volume of requests, etc.). We recognize that, in some cases, these properties may allow a reviewer to identify your institution or organization. 
 Supplementary Material 
 Authors may optionally include supplementary material as a separate document. Supplementary material is intended for items that are not critical for evaluating the paper but may be of interest to some readers. Examples include: formal proofs that are only sketched in the submission, additional analyses, and methodological details that aren’t essential for the PC’s assessment but are important for reproducibility. PC members are not required to read this optional supplementary material, so the submission must stand alone without it. 
 Formatting 
 Papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format. 
 Submissions may have at most 12 pages of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit. Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by 8 mm (0.33 in) of whitespace. Use 10-point font (typeface Times Roman, Linux Libertine, etc.) on 12-point (single-spaced) leading. Graphs and figures should be readable without magnification; they are encouraged to be in color, but should remain readable if printed in grayscale. All pages should be numbered, and references within the paper should be hyperlinked. 
 Submissions violating these rules will not be considered for publication, and there will be no extensions for fixing violations. We encourage you to upload an early draft of the paper well before the deadline to check if the paper meets the formatting rules. 
 Most of these rules are automatically applied when using thehref=""https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions"" - official SIGPLAN LaTeX
orhref=""https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions"" - MS Word templates
from the ACM. 
 For Latex, we recommend you use: 
 \documentclass[sigplan,10pt]{acmart} \renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{} \pagestyle{plain} ... \settopmatter{printfolios=true} \maketitle ...Confidentiality 
 Reviewing will be done mostly by members of the program committee, with limited use of outside reviewers. Submissions will be treated as confidential; however, papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered for publication. 
 Conflicts 
 To avoid conflicts of interest in the review process, when you register and submit your paper, we ask that you provide information about conflicts between any of the authors of your submission and PC members. Use the following guidelines to determine conflicts: 
 Institutional:You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years (since April 2023), or are going to begin employment at the same institution. Former interns should list their internship supervisor(s) and collaborator(s) as conflicts, not the entire institution where they interned. 
 Advisor:You have a past or present association as PhD thesis advisor or advisee. 
 Collaborator:You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years (April 2023 or later). 
 Personal:You are close family relatives (e.g., spouses, domestic partners, parents, children, or siblings). 
 The PC chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. You should not improperly identify a PC member as a conflict in an attempt to avoid having the individual review your paper. 
 PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the ""conflict chair"". Any paper with a PC chair co-author will be held to a higher standard of being a “clear accept”. 
 Author Response Period 
 SOSP will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. In particular, responses must not include new experiments or data, describe additional work completed since submission, or promise additional work to follow. As PC members are not required to review supplementary materials, responses must not rely on the existence of those materials. 
 Submission of a response is optional. There is no explicit limit to the response, but authors are strongly encouraged to keep responses under 500 words; reviewers are neither required nor expected to read excessively long responses. 
 Accepted Papers 
 Papers selected by the program committee will receive conditional acceptance, with the final acceptance subject to revisions and approval by a program committee member acting as a shepherd. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to supply electronic versions of their papers and encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and understand their results, as part of an artifact evaluation process. To facilitate broad technical discussion, all accepted papers will be made available online in advance of the conference. The official publication date will be the date the proceedings are made publicly accessible. For more information about the ACM OpenSurround Service, please go tohttps://www.acm.org/publications/policies/free-access. Papers of particular merit will be forwarded to the ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS) and the Communications of the ACM's Research Highlights (CACM RH) for possible publication.

 Technical Committee 
 MAY 12-15, 2025 AT THE HYATT REGENCY SAN FRANCISCO SAN FRANCISCO, CA 
 46th IEEE Symposium on 
 Security and Privacy 
 Sponsored by theIEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Security and Privacyin cooperation with thehref=""http://www.iacr.org"" - International Association for Cryptologic Research
Call for Papers 
 Since 1980 in Oakland, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for computer security research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners. We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in any aspect of security or privacy. Papers may present advances in the theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and measurement of secure systems. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice. 
 Topics of interest include: 
 Applied cryptography 
 Attacks with novel insights, techniques, or results 
 Authentication, access control, and authorization 
 Blockchains and distributed ledger security 
 Cloud computing security 
 Cyber physical systems security 
 Distributed systems security 
 Economics of security and privacy 
 Embedded systems security 
 Formal methods and verification 
 Hardware security 
 Hate, Harassment, and Online Abuse 
 Human-centered security and privacy 
 Intrusion detection and prevention 
 Machine learning and computer security 
 Malware and unwanted software 
 Network security and measurement 
 Operating systems security 
 Privacy-enhancing technologies, anonymity, and censorship 
 Program and binary analysis 
 Protocol security 
 Security and privacy metrics 
 Security and privacy policies 
 Security architectures 
 Security for at-risk populations 
 Software supply chain security 
 Systems security 
 User studies for security and privacy 
 Web security and privacy 
 Wireless and mobile security/privacy 
 This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; S&P is interested in all aspects of computer security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to security or privacy, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review. 
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers 
 As in past years, we solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence, or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate and may be rejected without full review. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, but they will be accepted based on their treatment of existing work and value to the community, and not based on any new research results they may contain. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings. You can find an overview of recent SoK papers athttps://oaklandsok.github.io. 
 Submission Deadlines & Decisions 
 Similar to 2024, for each submission, one of the following decisions will be made: 
 Accept:Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference. Within one month of acceptance, all accepted papers must submit a camera-ready copy incorporating reviewer feedback. The papers will immediately be published, open access, in the Computer Society’s Digital Library and they may be cited as “To appear in the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy, May 2025”. After the symposium, papers will be behind a paywall for one year before they are again made open access. 
 Reject:Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Rejected papers must wait for one year, from the date of original submission, to resubmit to IEEE S&P. A paper will be judged to be a resubmit (as opposed to a new submission) if the paper is from the same or similar authors, and a reviewer could write a substantially similar summary of the paper compared with the original submission. As a rule of thumb, if there is more than 40% overlap between the original submission and the new paper, it will be considered a resubmission. 
 Public Meta-Reviews:Similar to 2024, all accepted papers will be published with a meta-review (< 500 words) in the final PDF that lists: (a) the reasons the PC decided to accept the paper and (b) concerns the PC has with the paper. Authors will be given the option to write a response to the meta-review (< 500 words) which will be published as part of the meta-review. Authors will be given a draft meta-review at the time of acceptance. Authors will be given the option of addressing some or all of the concerns within one review cycle. A shepherd will remove concerns from the meta-review if they are sufficiently addressed by the revisions. 
  
 The goal of this process is to provide greater transparency and to better scope change requests made by reviewers. More information about the reasons behind this change can be found on thehref=""https://sp2024.ieee-security.org/changes-cfp.html"" - 2024 IEEE S&P website
. 
 Symposium Event (Important Changes) 
 The number of papers accepted to IEEE S&P continues to grow substantially each year. Due to conference venue limitations and costs, each accepted paper will have: (a) a short talk presentation (e.g., 5-7 minutes, length determined based on the number of accepted papers) and (b) a poster presentation immediately following the talk session containing the paper. All accepted papers are required to present both a short talk and a poster. 
 Important Dates 
 All deadlines are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12). 
 First deadline 
 Paper submission deadline: June 6, 2024 
 Early-reject notification: July 22, 2024 
 Rebuttal period (interactive): August 19 - August 30, 2024 
 Rebuttal text due: August 26, 2024 
 Acceptance notification: September 9, 2024 
 Camera-ready deadline: October 18, 2024 
 Second deadline 
 Paper submission deadline: November 14, 2024 
 Early-reject notification: January 20, 2025 
 Rebuttal period (interactive): February 17 - February 28, 2025 
 Rebuttal text due: February 24, 2025 
 Acceptance notification: March 10, 2025 
 Camera-ready deadline: April 18, 2025 
 Rebuttal Period 
 Papers reaching the second round of reviewing will be given an opportunity to write a rebuttal to reviewer questions. The rebuttal period will be interactive, and is separate from the meta-review rebuttal given to accepted papers. Authors have the opportunity to exchange messages with the reviewers and respond to questions asked. To this end, we will use HotCRP’s anonymous communication feature to enable a communication channel between authors and reviewers. The authors should mainly focus on factual errors in the reviews and concrete questions posed by the reviewers. New research results can also be discussed if they help to clarify open questions. More instructions will be sent out to the authors at the beginning of the rebuttal period. 
 Resubmission of Rejected Papers 
 As with previous IEEE S&P symposia with multiple submission cycles, rejected papers must wait one year before resubmission to IEEE S&P. Given the move from three submission deadlines in 2024 to two submission deadlines in 2025, rejected papers are eligible to submit according to the table below. 
  
 2024 deadlines | Reject decision 
 Eligible 2025 deadlines 
 First 2024 
 (April 13, 2023) | Either 2025 deadline 
 Second 2024 
 (August 3, 2023) | Either 2025 deadline 
 Third 2024 
 (Dec 6, 2023) | Second deadline 
 (Nov 14, 2024) 
 Instructions for Paper Submission 
 These instructions apply to both the research papers and systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers. All submissions must be original work; the submitter must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. Failure to point out and explain overlap will be grounds for rejection. Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection. Contact the program committee chairs if there are questions about this policy. 
 Anonymous Submission 
 Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. In the unusual case in which a third-person reference is infeasible, authors can blind the reference itself. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. PC members who have a genuine conflict of interest with a paper, including the PC Co-Chairs and the Associate Chairs, will be excluded from evaluation and discussion of that paper. 
 While a paper is under submission to the IEEE Security & Privacy Symposium, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper to an archival repository such as arXiv, and disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors. Authors should refrain from widely advertising their results, but in special circumstances they should contact the PC chairs to discuss exceptions. Authors are not allowed to directly contact PC members to discuss their submission. 
 The submissions will be treated confidentially by the PC chairs and the program committee members. Program committee members are not allowed to share the submitted papers with anyone, with the exception of qualified external reviewers approved by the program committee chairs. Please contact the PC chairs if you have any questions or concerns. 
 Conflicts of Interest 
 During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when and only when one or more of the following conditions holds: 
 The PC member is a co-author of the paper. 
 The PC member has been a co-worker in the same company or university within the past two years. | For student interns, the student is conflicted with their supervisors and with members of the same research group. If the student no longer works for the organization, then they are not conflicted with a PC member from the larger organization. 
 The PC member has been a collaborator within the past two years. 
 The PC member is or was the author’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
 The author is or was the PC member’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
 The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of the author. 
 For any other situation where the authors feel they have a conflict with a PC member, they must explain the nature of the conflict to the PC chairs, who will mark the conflict if appropriate. The program chairs will review declared conflicts. Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection. 
 Research Ethics Committee 
 Similar to 2024, IEEE S&P 2025 has a research ethics committee (REC) that will check papers flagged by reviewers as potentially including ethically fraught research. The REC will review flagged papers and may suggest to the PC Chairs rejection of a paper on ethical grounds. The REC consists of members of the PC. Authors are encouraged to review theMenlo Reportfor general ethical guidelines for computer and information security research. 
 Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure 
 Where research identifies a vulnerability (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program, design weaknesses in a hardware system, or any other kind of vulnerability in deployed systems), we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. In nearly every case, disclosing the vulnerability to vendors of affected systems, and other stakeholders, will help protect users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 dayshref=""https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/Wiki/Vulnerability+Disclosure+Policy"" - https://vuls.cert.org/confluence/display/Wiki/Vulnerability+Disclosure+Policy
to 90 dayshref=""https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-faq.html"" - https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-faq.html
ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations. 
 Longer disclosure windows (which may keep vulnerabilities from the public for extended periods of time) should only be considered in exceptional situations, e.g., if the affected parties have provided convincing evidence the vulnerabilities were previously unknown and the full rollout of mitigations requires additional time. The authors are encouraged to consult with the PC chairs in case of questions or concerns. 
 The version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities; but, consistent with the timelines above, the authors do not have to disclose vulnerabilities ahead of submission. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions. 
 Note: Submitted papers shouldnotinclude full CVE identifiers in order to preserve the anonymity of the submission. 
 Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research 
 Submissions that describe experiments that could be viewed as involving human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should: 
 Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable. 
 Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect. 
 If a submission deals with any kind of personal identifiable information (PII) or other kinds of sensitive data, the version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken to mitigate harms to the persons identified. If a paper raises significant ethical and/or legal concerns, it will be checked by the REC and it might be rejected based on these concerns. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions. 
 Financial and Non-financial competing interests 
 In the interests of transparency and to help readers form their own judgements of potential bias, the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy requires authors and PC members to declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in relation to the work described. Authors need to include a disclosure of relevant financial interests in the camera-ready versions of their papers. This includes not just the standard funding lines, but should also include disclosures of any financial interest related to the research described. For example, “Author X is on the Technical Advisory Board of the ByteCoin Foundation,” or “Professor Y is the CTO of DoubleDefense, which specializes in malware analysis.” More information regarding this policy is availablehref=""https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2022/financial-con.html"" - here
. 
 Page Limit and Formatting (Important Changes) 
 Submitted papers may include up to 13 pages of text and up to 5 pages for references and appendices, totaling no more than 18 pages. All text and figures past page 13 must be clearly marked as part of the appendix. The final camera-ready paper must be no more than 18 pages, although, at the PC chairs’ discretion, additional pages may be allowed. Reviewers are not required to read appendices. 
 Papers must be formatted for US letter (not A4) size paper. All submissions must use the IEEE “compsoc” conference proceedings template. LaTeX submissions using the IEEE templates must use IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b with options “conference,compsoc.” (That is, begin your LaTeX document with the line \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran}.). See the “IEEE Demo Template for Computer Society Conferences”Overleaf templatefor an example. We are not aware of an MS Word template that matches this style. 
 Papers that fail to use the “compsoc” template (including using the non-compsoc IEEE conference template), modify margins, font, or line spacing, or use egregious space scrunching are subject to rejection without review.Authors are responsible for verifying the paper format (e.g., compare with the above linked Overleaf template). While HotCRP provides some automated checking, the checks are limited. Note that some LaTeX packages (e.g., \usepackage{usenix}) override the compsoc formatting and must be removed. 
 Withdrawing Policy 
 A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper can not be withdrawn. 
 Authorship Policy 
 Changes to the authorship list (adding or removing authors) are not permitted after paper submission. Changes to the authors affiliation after paper acceptance are not permitted without PC chairs approval. If authors anticipate that they might change affiliation during the time the paper is under submission it is recommended to mark both the current and future institution as COI. 
 Conference Submission Server 
 Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf). Authors should pay special attention to unusual fonts, images, and figures that might create problems for reviewers. 
 Submission servers:

.href="""" - SOFSEM Profile
SOFSEM maintains a unique position among the annual conferences and symposia in computing. Through itsinvited talks and the selected contributed papers on current research, as well as its well-known familiar atmosphere, SOFSEM is an appreciable mix of an international symposium and a winter school. It is a proven format, combining the presentation of original, high-quality research papers with lectures on trending themes in foundations and their, often interdisciplinary, background.SOFSEM conferences are conducted in person. Traditionally housing all participants at thesamevenue, the conference provides an optimalset-up for discussions, meetings, research initiatives, new contacts, and social interactions. SOFSEMencourages the co-operation and exchange of ideas among researchers across all domains of fundamental computer science and its bordering fields, in all stages of their career. It makes SOFSEM especially attractive for young computer scientists. 
 SOFSEM focuses on novel research and current developments in all key areas in fundamental computer science and its interfaces to the foundations of artificial intelligence (algorithms, AI-inspired methods, computational complexity, formal models). SOFSEM's list of topics of interest was renewed in 2022 and evolves with the developments and trends in foundational research in computing with each edition of the conference.Awards 
 Each year the SOFSEM Program Committee determines which of the contributed papers is/are deservant of theBest Student Paper Awardand theBest Paper Awardof the conference. The winners of the awards are normally posted on the conference website.href="""" - Recent SOFSEM Conferences

 href="""" - Brief History of SOFSEM
SOFSEM (orig.SOFtware SEMinar) was founded in 1974 as a winter seminar for computer scientists and software engineers in former Czechoslovakia. SOFSEM soon became the foremost national seminar devoted to theoretical and practical problems of software systems. In fact, in these early days of computer science and technology, SOFSEM supplemented the university education and academic research by facilitating a fast transfer of the latest relevant knowledge in computing to its audience. Later on international experts were invited also, to present series of lectures on recent topics. Each SOFSEM consisted of several series of invited lectures of 3 to 5 hours, complemented by selected contributions of participants. Until 1994, the total duration of every SOFSEM was two weeks.Gradually, SOFSEM transformed from a mainly national seminar into an international conference. After the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993 SOFSEM continued, but now alternating between the Czech and Slovak Republics. SOFSEM became recognized for its high-level invited talks and well-chosen tracks that followed the trends in the field. From 1995 onward, the SOFSEM proceedings were included in the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science of Springer. The duration of SOFSEM was shortened to eight days, and the track areas became more and more fixed for a longer time. Over the years, as the field expanded and international collaborations flourished, SOFSEM's unique role withinthe Czech and Slovak computer science communities lessened, yet its significance and position as an international symposium grew. 
 In 2016 the SOFSEM Steering Committee decided that, from then on, SOFSEM conferences could be organized by colleagues anywhere in Europe, i.e. not limited to the Czech or Slovak Republics anymore. The duration of SOFSEM was limited to a week or four days but its format and focus were still left unchanged, with three separate tracks (foundations, software engineering, and data science and engineering), a special theme track (algorithmic computational biology), and a student research forum. In 2022 SOFSEM did not take place, due to the covid-19 pandemic, but the time was used to prepare SOFSEM for the next major step on its new course, namely focusing the conference fully and undividedly to the foundations of computer science, together with its interfaces to closely related areas, especially the computational principles of artificial intelligence and data science.ArchiveEarly history of SOFSEM: | href=""https://www.sofsem.cz/sofsem95/history.html"" - SOFSEM - History | (SOFSEM'95)

Code of conduct 
 SoCG is dedicated to providing an environment that is free from harassment, bullying, discrimination, and retaliation for all participants. Starting in 2025, CG Week including SoCG will be organized as an event of theCG Society. All members of the Society are bound by itsCode of Conduct. Only members of the Society can give a presentation and hence at least one author of each accepted paper must become a member of the Society. Society membership is free. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 Paper types | When writing or evaluating a SoCG paper, it is important to keep in mind that there are different types of contributions, each with its own strengths. To ensure that a submission is evaluated on its own merits, authors will need to identify the main strengths of their submission, as captured by four possible paper types. PC members and external reviewers will be asked to take into account these paper types together with their associated evaluation criteria when they evaluate a paper. There are no quotas for the paper types and submissions can be labeled with more than one paper type at the time of submission. | Mathematical Foundations: | A typical paper will contain theorems and proofs describing new results in discrete or combinatorial geometry, discrete differential geometry or topology, or in topological combinatorics. The paper will primarily be evaluated on its technical depth, the importance of the results, the elegance of the solution, the connection of the problem studied to computational geometry and topology, and the potential future impact on algorithm development. 
 Algorithmic Complexity: | A typical paper will contain algorithms, data structures, theorems, proofs, or lower bound constructions describing new results on computational geometry problems. The paper will primarily be evaluated on the (mathematical or computational) relevance and importance of the problem studied, its technical depth, the elegance of the solution, and the potential future impact of the results or the proposed new methods and techniques. 
 Experiments and Implementation: | A typical paper will make a clear contribution to the implementation and evaluationp of geometric algorithms, such as exact, approximate, or algebraic computation, algorithms engineering, or the experimental evaluation of competing algorithmic approaches. The paper will primarily be evaluated on the completeness and the expected impact of the proposed implementation, the soundness of the experiments, the quality and quantity of testing, and on the general amount of knowledge gained. 
 Applications: | A typical paper will describe the modeling and algorithmic choices made when developing or adapting computational geometry techniques for an application area. The paper will be primarily evaluated on the soundness of the modeling decisions, the ingenuity of the solution, the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the expected impact in the application area. One might also consider the lesson learned regarding the applicability or suitability of computational geometry tools to the specific area. 
 Double Blind and PC submissions | SoCG will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process, and will allow PC members (other than the PC chairs) to submit to the conference as well. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, funding information, and email addresses should not appear in the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not ""We build on our previous work ..."" but rather ""We build on the work of ...""). Particular care needs to be taken if there is any accompanying software or data, which needs to be linked anonymously (for example, via a DropBox anonymous folder orAnonymous GitHub, perhaps with a subset of synthetic data if the real data is not anonymized). Upon registering a submission, the authors will declare conflicts of interest with PC members, as well as listing email address or domain level conflicts (i.e. “Haitao Wang (University of Utah)”, “All (Graz University of Technology)”) of other professional or personal conflicts. This includes past advisors and students, people with the same affiliation, and any recent/frequent coauthors and collaborators. Please refer to thehref=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QNR3JUe_DimGP79EbcmayUi7I3obiTdxAIzXMFxaCfI/pub"" - SoCG 2025 Conflict of Interest Guidelines
for a detailed discussion of possible conflicts of interest. | The purpose of lightweight double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. We encourage authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing to contact the PC chairs, or to see the more detailed discussion inthe proposalthat preceded the vote to move to double blind. 
 Format | Submissions must be formatted in accordance with theLIPIcs proceedings guidelines. Authors are required to use the LaTeX class filehref=""https://computational-geometry.org/documents/socg-lipics-v2021.cls"" - socg-lipics-v2021.cls
(V0.9, Sep 19, 2022), with the option “anonymous”; note that the class file is a wrapper around the standard LIPIcs class. The LIPIcs style and instructions are availablehref=""https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author"" - here
; the SoCG class file is availablehref=""https://computational-geometry.org/documents/socg-lipics-v2021.cls"" - here
, and instructions on how to use it are availablehere. Submissions must not exceed 500 lines, excluding front matter (title), references, and a clearly marked appendix (further described below), but including all other lines (in abstract, algorithms, tables, captions, etc.). The class files provide line counting which should be accurate in most cases. Authors should refrain from putting excessive amounts of text in parts in which lines are not counted automatically. If authors need constructs that contain uncounted lines of text, they should compensate for this by reducing the final line count accordingly. It is the sole responsibility of the authors not to exceed 500 lines even if some lines are not counted automatically. 
 Contents of the submission | Papers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract, which begins with the title of the paper, as well as a short abstract. This should be followed by the main body of the paper that begins with a precise statement of the problem considered, a succinct summary of the results obtained (emphasizing the significance, novelty, and potential impact of the research), and a clear comparison with related work. The remainder of the extended abstract should provide sufficient details to allow the program committee to evaluate the validity, quality, and relevance of the contribution. Clarity of presentation is very important; the entire extended abstract should be written carefully, taking into consideration that it will be read and evaluated by both experts and non-experts, often under tight time constraints. | In addition, authors are asked to avoid ""et al."" in citations in favor of an equal mention of all authors' surnames. For instance, if the number of authors is large, consider writing ""The authors in [#] show"" instead of ""A et al. [#] show"". 
 Appendix and additional data | All details needed to verify the results must be provided. Supporting materials, including proofs of theoretical claims and experimental details, that do not fit in the 500-line limit should be given in an appendix. If more appropriate, the full version may be given as the appendix. In both cases, however, the authors should include in the main part specific pointers to the relevant locations in the appendix. The appendix will be read by the program committee members and subreviewers at their discretion and will not be published as part of the proceedings. Thus, the paper without the appendix should be able to stand on its own. Experimental and implementation results (independent of paper type) must be reproducible and verifiable. Authors of all types of papers are encouraged to put accompanying software and relevant data, if there is any, in a repository accessible to the reviewers. 
 Previous or simultaneous submissions | Results previously published or accepted for publication in the proceedings of another conference cannot be submitted. Simultaneous submissions of the results to another conference with published proceedings are not allowed. Exempted are workshops and conferences without formal proceedings, but possibly with handouts containing short abstracts. In particular, submissions of papers that have appeared or will be submitted to EuroCG are allowed, since EuroCG does not publish formal proceedings, while submissions of papers that have appeared in CCCG are not allowed. Results that have already been accepted (with or without revision) for publication in a journal at the time of their submission to the symposium are not allowed. 
 Strict guidelines | Submissions deviating from the above guidelines risk being rejected without further consideration. 
 Guidelines for reviewers | The guidelines for reviewers are availablehref=""https://computational-geometry.org/documents/socg-reviewing.pdf"" - here
. 
 Accepted Papers 
 Presentation | An author of each accepted paper is expected to attend the symposium and present the paper (approximately 20 minutes). Note that SoCG 2025 will be organized as an event of theCG Societyand hence the presenting author(s) must be a member of the Society. Society membership is free. 
 Best paper award | An accepted paper may be selected as the best paper. All papers are eligible. | Best student paper award | An accepted paper may be selected as the best student paper. A paper is eligible if all authors are students at the time of submission. This must be indicated in the submission process. There is a box provided for this purpose on the submission server. | Best student presentation award | Based on the feedback from the audience, a presentation during the symposium by a student may be selected as the best student presentation. | In exceptional cases, each of these awards may be granted to more than one paper/presentation. 
 Invited papers and special issues | Authors of the best paper will be invited to submit an extended version of their paper to theJournal of the ACM, and authors of one (or more) most highly ranked papers may be invited to submit their full paper to the journalTheoretiCS. Authors of a selection of accepted papers from the symposium will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to special issues ofDiscrete & Computational GeometryandJournal of Computational Geometry. 
 Format | Final proceedings versions of accepted papers must respect the same formatting constraints as the submissions (href=""https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author"" - LIPIcs proceedings format
withhref=""https://computational-geometry.org/documents/socg-lipics-v2021.cls"" - socg-lipics-v2021
; 500-line limit, excluding front matter and references), but must not comprise any appendix. If any supporting material (including complete proofs of theoretical claims and experimental details) does not fit in the specified limit, then the full version of the paper containing this information must be referenced in the conference version and made available at a public repository, such asarXiv, by the time the final version is submitted. Where applicable, we encourage the authors to make accompanying software and/or data publicly accessible, with proper references in the paper.

Submission Guidelines 
 Authors must adhere to the IEEE conference written paper format (including paper title, authors and affiliations, figures, and references) and they must submit the draft version of the paper for review before the due submission deadlines (see dates below). These are submitted through the PaperCept submission system (see link above). IEEE is very strict about the requirements for PDF files for inclusion in theIEEE Xplore® Digital Library. We strongly recommend using the set of templates inMS WordandLaTeXformat provided by IEEE. Letter page size should be used. Please use them to create your paper, but don’t modify the style or the format under any circumstances. 
 Submit only original work, not previously published or copyrighted. Prospective authors are expected to submit only their original works. The conference will be using the CrossCheck automated screening system to help verify the originality of papers. Submitted works may be compared to over 20 million articles in databases worldwide. Papers that violate IEEE’s publication principles may be summarily rejected. If the violation is deemed severe, then disciplinary actions may also be taken by IEEE. For further details please have a look at thehref=""https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/"" - Conference Authors @ IEEE Author Center
. 
 The IEEE SMC 2025 conference utilizes a single-blind review process, ensuring that reviewers are aware of the authors' identities while authors remain unaware of the reviewers' identities. 
 Accepted papers must be presented at the conference, either by the authors themselves or via proxy. If a paper is not presented, it will be deemed a ""no-show"" and will be removed from post-conference distribution. No-show papers will not be available in theIEEE Xplore® Digital Libraryor other public-access IEEE forums. 
 Accepted and presented papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings, which will be eligible for inclusion in theIEEE Xplore® Digital Library, once it meets the requirements of an IEEE quality review. They will also be submitted toScopusfor indexing after the conference, provided they meet the necessary requirements. In addition, authors are generally permitted to share and post their papers, provided they adhere to thehref=""https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/get-published/post-your-paper/"" - IEEE's publication guidelines
.

 Paper Types 
 Regular Papers 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit full-length papers electronically through the conference website. Papers (regular length of up to 6 pages) with max. 2 overlength pages (including paper title, authors and affiliations, figures, and references) for an extra fee should be concise but contain sufficient details and references to allow critical review. Papers will be reviewed (single-blinded) by at least two referees for technical merit and content. 
 Special Sessions Papers 
 Special Sessions provide a focused discussion of new and innovative topics. Special Session proposers should download the special session proposal template and submit the completed proposal to the Special Session Chairs. Special Session organizers should collect at least six papers. All submitted special session papers undergo the same review process as regular papers and submission to the proposed session is not a guarantee of acceptance. 
 The list of accepted special sessions can be foundhere. 
 Work-in-Progress and Industrial Papers 
 These contributions are intended to show work-in-progress and to promote contributions from industries on technology development, innovations, and implementations, which will facilitate collaboration between industrial and academic members of the SMC community. Such kinds of papers describe research that has not yet produced the results required for a regular paper, but that due to its novelty and potential impact deserves to be shared with the community at an early stage. These submissions need to follow the guidelines for the regular and special sessions but are limited to four (4) pages (total length including references). All submitted work-in-progress and industrial papers undergo the same review process as regular papers via the submission page. 
 Workshop Papers 
 These contributions are intended to promote contributions from applied research and applications, including work in progress, and facilitate increased collaboration between industrial and academic members of the IEEE SMC community. All submitted workshop papers undergo the same review process as regular papers and submission to the proposed session is not a guarantee of acceptance. 
 The list of accepted workshops can be foundhere.
