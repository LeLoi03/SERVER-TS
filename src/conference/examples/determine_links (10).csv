 ABZ 2025 – 11th International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods  

 Call for papers  
 The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.  
 The name ABZ goes back to the first conference in London in 2008, where the ASM, B and Z conference series were merged into a joint event. In the following years other formal methods were added, e.g. Alloy in 2010 (Orford, Canada), VDM in 2012 (Pisa, Italy), and TLA+ in 2014 (Toulouse, France). After the also successful 2016 conferences in Linz, Austria, and 2018 in Southampton, UK, it was decided to name the conference “ABZ: International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods”, to stress the openness for further state-based formal methods. We hope to continue many fruitful discussions between representatives of the individual methods in the past, which will bring us closer to the common goal of this research community: the creation of reliable and safe software and systems.  
 ABZ 2025 will have a main conference track, a case study track, a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops.

  Caution: there are some FAKE conferences that pretend to be ICFCA or ICCS conferences. The real ICFCA and ICCS conferences do not exist anymore. Fake conferences can be easily recognised because they do not have any FCA researchers on their committees. Furthermore, an internet search for the website domain name and ""scam"" or ""fake"" will provide evidence of the fake nature.

 History  
 ICFCA, CLA and ICCS are three highly relevant conferences in the field of formal concept analysis (FCA) and related areas. All three conferences contribute significantly to advancing the understanding and application of formal concept analysis. In particular:  
 On October 2023, representatives of the three conferences approved the merging of the three conferences  ICFCA,   CLA and ICCS   and creating a new joint event, the  International Joint Conference on Conceptual Knowledge Structures (CONCEPTS).   This merger aimed to create a unified and comprehensive forum for researchers, academics, and professionals from various disciplines interested in formal concept analysis, conceptual structures, and related fields to exchange ideas, present their research, and discuss the latest advancements in these areas. For this purpose, the overall organization of CONCEPTS will follow the existing rules and traditions of the three conferences.

 Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics  
 Robot algorithms are abstractions of computational processes that control or reason about motion and perception in the physical world. Because actions in the physical world are subject to physical laws and geometric constraints, the design and analysis of robot algorithms raises a unique combination of questions in control theory, computational and differential geometry, and computer science. Algorithms serve as a unifying theme in the multi-disciplinary field of robotics.  
 The Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations aims to bring together a group of about sixty researchers to discuss recent trends and important future directions of research on the algorithmic issues related to robotics and automation.

 FedCSIS 2025 Invited speakers and Keynotes   
  
 The mission   of the FedCSIS Conference Series is to provide a presentation, discussion and a reputable publication forum in computer science and intelligence systems. The forum invites researchers and practitioners from around the world to contribute their research results focused on their scientific and professional interests in a chosen area.  
 The FedCSIS conference consists of the Main Track  and Thematic Session  . Papers submitted to the Main Track can be assigned, by their authors, to Topical Areas,  which are managed by Topical Area Curators  . Based on the scope of the contribution, Topical Area Curators select its reviewers from the Main Track Program Committee  . Besides the Main Track, the authors may prefer to submit their papers to Thematic Session, which announce their own Calls for Thematic Session Papers  and are assisted by the FedCSIS Chairs in reaching out to the FedCSIS Community.  
 For all five Topical Areas, situated within a general domain of Computer Science, the continually emerging topic of Intelligence Systems stands as the common denominator. All Thematic Sessions also refer to the Intelligence Systems from different perspectives. They are regarded as a path toward introducing more Intelligence into Computer Science and IT.

 ADCOM 2024 seeks to share insights for a ‘Responsible AI’ framework to develop Artificial Intelligence safely and ethically based on the five core principles of fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy and safety. Sustainable, reliable, effective, and human-centered AI systems require responsible AI principles and perspectives not only from technological but also from ethical, legal, and socio-economic domains. This edition of ADCOM will also explore as a sub theme the democratization of access to AI with a need for Trust, Risk and Security Management (TRiSM) to enhance positive performance and societal gains that AI enables.

 Workshop on “System Dynamics Modelling and Decarbonisation of Transport Sector” 
 Day and Time:2:00 pm -5:00 pm, Wednesday, December 11, 2024 
 Location:UNSW Sydney, Kensington Campus (In-Person) 
 Price:100 AUD/person (unlimited) 
 Overview: 
 System dynamics modelling excels in forecasting due to its ability to capture complex, dynamic interactions within a system. Unlike methods that isolate supply and demand components, it adopts a holistic view, crucial for understanding how various factors interact and influence outcomes. Key features of system dynamics modelling include: 
 ·Feedback Loops:It models dynamic relationships by incorporating feedback loops, showing how changes in one area (e.g., energy supply) affect others (e.g., demand for electric trucks) over time. 
 ·Time Delays:The models reflect real-world delays, important for energy demand forecasting where policy impacts are not immediate. 
 ·Non-linear Behaviour:System dynamics capture non-linear interactions, providing a more accurate representation of complex variable relationships. 
 ·Scenario Analysis:It allows exploration of different future scenarios based on variable changes, aiding decision-makers in understanding potential outcomes. 
 System dynamics is particularly suited for evolving conditions and relationships in forecasting the effectiveness of various policies such as decarbonisation scenarios for the transport and logistics sector. 
 This workshop is designed for beginners interested in learning systems dynamics simulation modelling. In the first hour of the course, the system dynamics modelling and examples will be presented. In the second hour, the attendees will develop a simple systems dynamics model using the Vensim software. In the third hour, a system dynamics modelling framework for decarbonisation of freight transport will be presented and the attendees can get a hands-on experience with the model dashboard, model reports and sensitivity analysis. The attendees will gain practical experience and improve their strategic system dynamics simulation modelling skills. 
 Workshop content: 
 In this workshop, we will cover the topics of:

Analyzing and improving the reliability and safety of intelligent systems is a challenging task. In this talk, we will present some of our related research and discuss the problem from a systems engineering perspective. Intelligent systems rely heavily on the availability of large amounts of data, which can be affected by issues such as measurement accuracy, sensor dependability, and uncertainty due to the changing environments in which these systems operate. Some possible approaches to address these challenges will also be discussed. These may include techniques for ensuring data quality, robust sensor fusion, uncertainty quantification, and system-level verification and validation. By rigorously addressing the dependability of intelligent systems, we can unlock their full potential while ensuring the safety and reliability of the critical applications they enable.

 ASOR Conferences 
 APORS 2022 
 ASOR is a member of the Asia-Pacific Operations Research Societies (APORS), and the APORS 2022 conference is being held Nov 9-12 in Manila, Philippines. APORS is an abstract-only conference. This means that to attend the conference as a speaker you need to submit an abstract of up to 500 words, and the program committee then invites you to give a presentation (in person or virtual) based on an assessment of your abstract and its relevance to Operations Research. 
 The abstract submission date was recently extended to 17 July 2022. To submit your abstract visithttps://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=apors2022, and visithttp://apors.orgfor more information. 
 ASOR 2022 
 Due to the proximity of APORS 2022 and MODSIM/ASOR 2023, ASOR will be holding a workshop-style conference in late 2022, rather than a conference made up of presentations. More information to come. 
 MODSIM/ASOR 2023 
 ASOR is very pleased to announce that we will once again be holding an annual national conference joint with the Modelling and Simulation Society of Australia and New Zealand (MSSANZ) - this time, atMODSIM 2023 in Darwin. This is much earlier in the year than usual for MODSIM, but allows us all to be in Darwin at the best possible time of year. The conference organising committee has opened the conference up to early registrations. This is prior to 30 June 2022 so as to assist intending participants to commit 2021-2022 financial year funding if this suits their present financial situation. There are several more months until the full paper or extended abstract submission due dates. 
 Past Conferences 
 ASOR National Conference 2021 - ASOR at MODSIM 2021 
 The MODSIM Conference in 2021 was held at U. Sydney and ASOR was again a partner in the conference. It was our national conference for 2021.

For example, in her postdoc at the ANU, Sondoss has expanded on her PhD work in an ARC-funded project to develop a multi-method OR methodology which combines the use of cognitive mapping, software engineering tools, and agent-based modelling to incorporate stakeholder's views into planning water and groundwater systems. Sondoss was invited to present this work at a number of national events, such as the keynote speech at the National Centre for Groundwater Research and Training Summer School. In her current post at the Capability Systems Centre at UNSW Canberra, Sondoss' work involves the integration of multiple modelling methods to provide robust, client-oriented decision support tools, and conducting experimental studies to examine ways to improve model-based learning and teaching. Sondoss is a chief investigator in an international research grant by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) to identify core modelling practices to teach the next generation of modellers. Sondoss teaches various courses that are related to OR, such as simulation-based modelling, systems thinking, and system dynamics modelling. She has delivered training courses on systems thinking and complex problem solving for organisations such as the Australian Department of Defence. Since 2015, Sondoss has been a member of the executive committee of the ASOR-ACT Chapter. Sondoss introduced the ASOR-ACT Chapter Student Award, an annual tradition to promote research excellence in OR and provide a forum for students to share their research projects.

The submission must not include information that serves to identify the authors of the manuscript, such as name(s) or affiliation(s) of the author(s), anywhere in the manuscript, abstract, references and bibliographic citations. While research papers with open-source software are highly encouraged where the software will be made publicly available (via GitHub or similar), the authors’ identities need to be anonymized in the submitted paper for the double-blind review process. Issuing the paper as a technical report, posting the paper on a website, or presenting the paper at a workshop that does not publish formally reviewed proceedings, does not disqualify it from appearing in the proceedings. Submissions of pre-print papers, e.g., published on arXiv, are also allowed in ASP-DAC 2025. However, that the authors are expected to follow all reasonable efforts to ensure that the submission is compliant with the double-blind review process. Note that each paper shall be accompanied by at least one different conference registration at the speaker’s registration rate. ACM and IEEE reserve the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from ACM Digital Library and IEEE Xplore) if the paper is not presented at the conference by any author.

 Welcome to the ASP-DAC 2024  
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee, I would like to invite all of the engineers on the LSI design and design automation areas to the 29th Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASP-DAC 2024). ASP-DAC 2024 will be held from January 22 (Mon.) to January 25 (Thur.), 2024 at Songdo Convention Center, Incheon, Korea.  
 ASP-DAC is a high-quality and premium conference on Electronic Design Automation (EDA) area like other sister conferences such as Design Automation Conference (DAC), Design, Automation & Test in Europe (DATE), International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD), and Embedded Systems Week (ESWEEK). ASP-DAC started in 1995 and has continuously offered opportunity to know the recent advanced technologies on LSI design and design automation areas, and to communicate each other for researchers and designers around Asia and South Pacific regions.  
 The conference site is Songdo Convensia, which is an international convention center, and is located at Westside in Incheon, Korea. Songdo Convensia is close to central Seoul, about 40 minutes by bus, and Incheon International airport, about 20 minutes by bus. Joining the conference and participating in technological discussions, you can also enjoy many attractions in Seoul area, such as Gang-Nam (modern restaurants and K-pop), Myung-Dong (shopping), and Buk-Chon/Nam-Dae-Mon (traditional architecture and traditional food market), etc.  
 ASP-DAC 2024 received 482 submissions, which is ever the highest submission record, from all over the world. Based on rigorous and thorough reviews and a full-day face-to-face meeting by the Technical Program Committee in early September at Taiwan, 139 papers have been accepted and 36 technical sessions have been organized. Five Special Sessions have also been organized based on invited talks by the Technical Program Committee.  
 We have arranged four Keynote sessions at the beginning of each day to know the future directions of this area. The first keynote address in the morning on January 23 is ‘Advanced Technology and Design Enablement’ by Dr. Sei-Seung Yoon of Samsung Foundry, Korea. The second one in the morning on January 24 is ‘Present and Future Challenges of High Bandwidth Memory’ by Dr. Myeong-Jae Park of SK Hynix, Korea. The third keynote address during the banquet in the evening on January 24 is ‘ALM and EDA: Current Status and Prospectives on the Future’ by Prof. Andrew B. Kahng of University of California San Diego, USA. The fourth keynote address in the morning on January 25 is ‘Unleashing the Future of IC Design with AI Innovation’ by Dr. Erick Chao of Cadence Design Systems, Taiwan.  
 The Designers’ Forum is a unique program that will share design experience and solutions of actual product designs of the industries, which will be held in the afternoon of January 23 and 24. The topics discussed in this forum include Next Generation AI Semiconductor Design, Heterogeneous Integration and Chiplet Design, and AI/ML for Chip Design and EDA — Current Status and Future Perspectives from Diverse Views. Additionally, a joint short workshop of AI-EDA and Tilos projects in two-session format will be held in the last of the conference.  
 The University Design Contest is also an important annual event of ASP-DAC where 11 high-quality designs all including actual silicon proof were selected for presentation at Tuesday, January 23.  
 Eight tutorials have been arranged on Monday, January 22nd. Each tutorial has 3-hour presentation. Registrants can choose one topic from the morning session including 4 topics and another one from the afternoon session including 4 topics depending on their interests and can obtain wider perspective on the recent hot topics with the reduced tutorial fee.  
 ASP-DAC 2024 offers you an ideal opportunity to touch the recent technologies and the future directions on the LSI design and design automation areas. You will be able to meet and discuss with a lot of researchers and designers on this area, so please do not miss ASP-DAC 2024. Finally, we would like to express our sincere appreciation to authors, speakers, reviewers, session organizers, session chairs, sponsors, supporters, and committee members.

 The scope of ASPLOS 2026 covers all practical aspects related to the three main ASPLOS disciplines: computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems, as well as closely-related associated areas. ASPLOS construessystemsbroadly, and areas of interest include, but are not limited to: operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, and virtualization. 
 We seek original, high-quality research submissions that improve and further the knowledge of applied computer systems, with emphasis on theintersection between the main ASPLOS disciplines: Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Computer Architecture and Emerging Hardware. 
 Research submission may be applicable to computer systems of any scale, ranging from small, ultra-low power wearable devices to large scale parallel computers and data centers. We embrace research that directly targets new problems in innovative ways. The research may target diverse goals, such as throughput, latency, energy, and security. Non-traditional topics are encouraged, and the review process will be sensitive to the challenges of multidisciplinary work in emerging areas. We welcome submission of “experience papers” that have a novel component and that clearly articulate the lessons learned. We likewise welcome submissions whereby novelty lies in furthering our understandings of existing systems, e.g., by uncovering previously unknown, valuable insights or by convincingly refuting prior published results and common wisdom. We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches. 
 Alphabetically sorted areas of interest related to practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems include but are not limited to: 
 Existing, emerging, and nontraditional compute platforms at all scales 
 Heterogeneous architectures and accelerators 
 Internet services, cloud computing, and datacenters 
 Memory, storage, networking, and I/O 
 Power, energy, and thermal management 
 Profiling, debugging, and testing 
 Security, reliability, and availability 
 Systems for enabling parallelism and computation on big data 
 Virtualization and virtualized systems 
 A good submission will typically: motivate a significant problem; propose a practical solution or approach that makes sense; demonstrate not just the pros but also the cons of the proposal using sound experimental methods; explicitly disclose what has and has not been implemented; articulate the new contributions beyond previous work; and refrain from overclaiming, focusing the abstract and introduction sections primarily on the difference between the new proposal and what is already available. The latter statement should be interpreted broadly to also encompass studies that broaden our understanding of existing systems (rather than suggest new ones), which may constitute a significant problem in its own right. Submissions will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, clarity. Submissions are expected to adhere to SIGPLAN’sEmpirical Evaluation Guidelinesand all the policies specified below. 
 Explicit assessment of interdisciplinary research 
 This interdisciplinary nature of the paper will serve a significant factor when considering paper acceptance. At the time of the submission we will ask the authors to identify and briefly justify the core disciplines the paper contributes the most. Papers with a single specified discipline are less likely to appear in the conference. In addition, reviewers will be asked to assess the paper relevance to the declared disciplines and low relevance scores will affect the chances of acceptance. If the PC decides that the paper does not fit the selected disciplines at all, it will be rejected without review. 
 Resubmissions 
 Authors of resubmitted work from ASPLOS or other venues must describe in a separate note—to be uploaded to the submission site at submission time—the changes since the previous submission(s). This description helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit this document to one page. 
 For resubmitted work that received a “Major Revision” followed by a revised submission,the revision also counts as a submission, so the note should describe changes relative to the revision rather than the original submission. 
 Submissions rejected from ASPLOS must not be submitted to thenextsubsequent review cycles and will be desk-rejected otherwise. Thus 
 The papers rejected from ASPLOS’26 Spring | may | be submitted to ASPLOS’27 Spring 
 The papers rejected from ASPLOS’26 Summer | may | be submitted to ASPLOS’27 Summer 
 Due to transition to two deadlines in 2026 from three deadlines in 2025, the following are the rules for papers rejected from ASPLOS’25 
 The papers rejected from ASPLOS’25 Spring | may | be submitted to ASPLOS’26 Spring 
 The papers rejected from ASPLOS’25 Summer | may | be submitted to ASPLOS’26 Summer 
 The papers rejected from ASPLOS’25 Fall | may | be submitted to ASPLOS’26 Summer 
 These resubmission rules are strict and hold even if a submission has undergone extensive revision. If a paper is withdrawn from an ASPLOS cycleafter reviews are made available, it is considered “rejected” from that cycle (and cannot be resubmitted to the next two cycles). 
 Limit on the number of submissions by the same author 
 The number of submissions by the same author will be limited to 5 submissions per submission cycle. The submissions will be screened after the deadline, and violating authors will be requested to withdraw their submissions until the limit is met. 
 Major Revisions 
 In addition to Accept and Reject outcomes, ASPLOS 2026 will offer some submissions a “Major Revision” decision. The authors of such submissions will be given the opportunity to apply a major revision to their work and resubmit it at the camera ready deadline (6 weeks from notification). These submissions will be provided with clear and actionable reviewer feedback for their revision, and they will be typically reviewed by some of the same reviewers as the original submission. If the revision requirements are satisfactorily met, the revised submission will be accepted to ASPLOS’26. 
 Revised submissions can use 13 pages (the same length as camera-ready versions, and 2 pages more than the original submission). The additional length is intended to let authors address the revision requirements. 
 Notifications of major revisions will occur no later than two months after the revision submission deadline. 
 Declaring Areas and Topics 
 Authors should indicate on the submission form the focused topics matching their work. The selection should be as accurate as possible, and includeatmost 3 topics. These will be used for reviewer assignments.Incorrect topic selection will result in assigning the paper to less competent reviewers. 
 Anonymization 
 ASPLOS employs a double-blind review process, keeping author identities concealed from reviewers and vice versa. You must therefore make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission by avoiding identifying yourself or your institution/affiliation in any of the submitted documents (except in specific fields on the HotCRP submission form designated for this purpose), either explicitly or by implication, e.g., through references, acknowledgments, online repositories that are referenced by the submission, or interaction with committee members. 
 Do not include a “reference removed for blind review” text or similar in your submission. When it is necessary to cite your own studies, cite them as written by a third party. Only if that is not possible, they can be uploaded and cited as anonymized supplemental material (see below). This applies to workshop papers that are being extended by your current ASPLOS submission, and related submissions of your own that are simultaneously under review or awaiting publication at other venues. Publication as a technical report or in an online repository does not constitute a violation of this policy, and some other exceptions apply; see the “originality and concurrent submissions” section below for details. 
 Please make sure not to reveal author and/or affiliation information through side channels and other less obvious means. For example, the metadata included in the PDF should not give away such information. If you’d like to point to a repository of, e.g., the working code of your system (which is great and much appreciated), this repository should, of course, be anonymized. It is okay and often makes sense to create anonymized repositories merely for the sake of an anonymous submission. If your system is already released to the public, rename it in your submission. You should likewise avoid inadvertently revealing affiliation in your submission by identifying your company’s name in situations where, e.g., it is clear that the authors of the submission most probably work for the company that manufactures the device or provides the service that constitutes the topic of your work; instead, please use a generic name, like “a computer server vendor X,” “a cloud service provider Y,” and such like. 
 If concealing system name or affiliation would make your paper difficult to understand, contact the program chairs to discuss exceptions to this policy. Submissions that are not properly anonymized will likely be rejected without review. 
 Anonymized Supplemental Material and Appendixes 
 Supplemental material and Appendixes may be submitted as part of the submission file and have no page limit. The submission must be self-contained within the page limit, and the supplemental material/appendixes should not be used as a way to circumvent this limit. The reviewersare neither required nor encouraged to read such materialwhen making their decision. 
 Declaring Conflicts of Interest 
 Authors must register all their conflicts in their HotCRP submission page. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a submission is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem or if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the submission will be summarily rejected. 
 Both people and institutions (companies, universities, and other relevant organizations) may be declared as having a conflict of interest (COI) with respect to an author. Please declare a COI with the following for any author of your submission; please do so with respect to all your conflicts, not just restricted to program committee (PC) and extended review committee (ERC) members, as we may occasionally ask for external reviews from people outside the PC/ERC. 
 Your current institution(s) and other institutions that you were affiliated with in the past four years relative to the submission deadline; also, an institution that is about to become your employer. 
 Your PhD advisor(s), post-doctoral host(s), PhD students, and post-doctoral advisees; these COIs are forever. 
 Family relations by blood or marriage and close personal friends (who may potentially be reviewers); these COIs are likewise forever. 
 People with whom you have collaborated in the last four years, including co-authors of accepted/rejected/pending paper submissions and co-PIs of accepted/rejected/pending grant proposals. 
 Potential reviewers who shared your primary institution(s) in the last four years, or where one is actively engaged in discussions about employment with the other person’s institution. 
 When there is a direct funding relationship between an author and a potential reviewer (e.g., the reviewer is a sponsor of an author’s research on behalf of his/her company or vice versa). 
 Among PIs of research structures supported under the same umbrella funding award who (1) participate regularly in non-public meetings sponsored by that umbrella award, and (2) are regularly exposed to presentations or discussions of unpublished work at such meetings. 
 Do not declare a COI for the following cases: 
 You must not declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. 
 “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization or an open-source community, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials, do not themselves create a COI. 
 Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects without direct collaboration among the projects does not constitute a conflict among the authors of the different projects. 
 Internships constitute a conflict of interest during the period of employment of the intern, but not thereafter, unless some other provision applies (e.g., co-authorship or ongoing research collaboration after the internship). Graduate students are not presumed to have an automatic COI with their undergraduate institution. On the other hand, prospective graduate students do have a COI with any institution they have applied to if they are actively engaged in discussions with any faculty member at that institution. Once they join an institution to pursue graduate studies, automatic COIs with any other prospective institutions sunset. In all these cases, the collaboration COI above still applies. 
 When in doubt, contact the program chairs and ask. 
 Declaring Authors 
 Declare all the authors of the submission upfront. Addition/removal of authors once the submission is accepted will have to be approved by the program chairs, since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for reviewer assignment. 
 Originality and Concurrent Submissions 
 By submitting a manuscript to ASPLOS, the authors guarantee that the manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any conference, journal, or workshop. The only exceptions are (1) workshops without archived proceedings such as in the ACM digital library (or where the authors chose not to have their paper appear in the archived proceedings), or (2) venues such as IEEE CAL where there is an explicit policy that such publication does not preclude longer conference submissions. These are not considered prior publications. Technical reports and papers posted on public social media sites, web pages, or online repositories such as arxiv.org are not considered prior publications either. In these cases, the submitted manuscript may ignore the posted work to preserve author anonymity. 
 The authors additionally guarantee that no manuscript that contains significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted document is or will be under review for any other conference, journal, or workshop during the ASPLOS review cycle for which it was submitted. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection and possibly additional actions against the offending authors. 
 You should also adhere to the ACM Plagiarism Policy (http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy), which covers a range of ethical issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or one’s own work. 
 As usual, if in doubt, consult with the program chairs. 
 Ethical and Other Obligations 
 Authors are not allowed to break anonymity when interacting with known ASPLOS PC/ERC members, e.g., by mentioning/identifying work that they plan to submit to ASPLOS or have already submitted and is currently under review. 
 Authors are not allowed to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members in order to encourage or solicit them to bid on any submission; to attempt to sway a reviewer or PC/ERC member to review any submission positively or negatively; to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members requesting any type of information about the reviewing process, either in general or specifically about submitted manuscripts; to contact reviewers or PC/ERC members to ask about the outcomes of any submission. 
 Authors are not allowed to advertise their work during the period starting two weeks before the submission deadline and ending when the results of the review cycle are publicized. The work includes the submission itself and closely related documents such as technical reports or arxiv.org uploads. Advertisement pertains to such communication channels such as social media, community blogs, and web pages. To clarify, authors are indeed allowed to upload their submission to arxiv.org and other such online repositories; the restriction relates to advertising such postings. 
 Authors are not allowed to post in the aforementioned channels about the content of the reviews they may have received until the results of the corresponding review cycle are publicized; “shaming” (and thus potentially applying pressure on) reviewers before the review process terminates is considered unethical. 
 Authors must abide by the ACM ethics policy ( | https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics | ). 
 Violation of these policies might result in rejection of the submission and possible additional action by the ACM. 
 ACM requires that all submitting authors will be aware of the following policies in particular: 
 By submitting your article to an ACM publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to allACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s newhref=""https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects"" - Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects
. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
 Formatting and Editing 
 We will use the same format template for submission and camera-ready versions. Submissions must be printable PDF files. When creating your submission, you must use the sigplan proceedings template of ACM’s acmart Latex class availableon the official ACM site. Your main LaTeX file should have the following structure: 
 % use the base acmart.cls % use the sigplan proceeding template with the default 10 pt fonts % nonacm option removes ACM related text in the submission. \documentclass[sigplan,nonacm]{acmart} % enable page numbers \settopmatter{printfolios=true} \begin{document} \title{...} \begin{abstract} ... \end{abstract} \maketitle % should come after the abstract % add the paper content here % use the ACM bibliography style \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format} \bibliography{...} \end{document}Your final submission should visually look similar to thishref=""https://www.asplos-conference.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/asplos25-paper-template.pdf"" - sample
produced from the zip file above. 
 “Squeezing” Space is Forbidden. Refrain from tweaking the aforementioned template and from formatting your text in a manner that violates its settings. Notably, refrain from squeezing additional space, e.g., by using \vspace or packages that manipulate vertical space. The template already generates a very dense document, and you must not make it denser. Your submission will be visually and automatically inspected using tools developed for this purpose, and it will be rejected if you violate the formatting policy, even if your PDF passed the HotCRP format check (which is unable to verify much of the requirements). 
 Page Layout and Limit. Full submissions must not exceed 11 pages of single-spaced two-column text. This page limit applies to all text, figures, tables, and footnotes. The only exceptions are the bibliographic references section and the appendices, which arenotincluded in the page limit. Note that the submission must be self-contained within the page limit, allowing reviewers to evaluate the work without having to consider any external or supplementary material outside this limit. The reviewers greatly value conciseness, so if you can describe your work with fewer pages than the limit, please do. All pages should be numbered. 
 Page Limit of Accepted Papers and Major Revisions. The authors of an accepted paper are allowed to use +2 pages in the camera-ready version beyond the aforementioned page limit. The same applies to major revisions, to accommodate added experiments and such. In addition to this +2 automatic page limit increase, authors of accepted papers may purchase 1–2 more pages, if they wish (payment will be processed when registering to the conference). 
 Font Size, Tables, and Figures. The submission’s text must use a 10pt font (not 9pt) or bigger. Labels, captions, and text within figures, graphs, and tables must use reasonable font sizes that, as printed, do not require extra magnification beyond “100%” to be legible. In particular, text inside figures/tables should generally use what appears to readers as a 9pt font or bigger after any intra-document scaling has been applied. Fonts appearing smaller than 8pt are not permitted. As noted, this and other requirements are not checked automatically by the HotCRP format checker, so it is the authors’ responsibility to check it. Figures can and should use colors but should also be color-blind friendly. Spacing between figures/tables/captions/text should be determined by the latex template. 
 References. Because references do not count against the page limit, the space they occupy should not be “optimized” away. Notably, the full, non-abbreviated first and last names of all co-authors of all citations must be specified (no “et al.”). The reference citations within the submission (numbers in square brackets) should be hyperlinked to the corresponding items in the references section, to ease the job of reviewers. Also, reviewers will very much appreciate clickable links (preferablyDOIs) associated with each entry in your references section. 
 Specifications. The following table specifies some of the main typeset requirements. Use our mandatory latex template and follow the above instructions to make sure that these and other formatting requirements are met. 
  
 Aspect | Requirement 
 file format | PDF with numbered pages 
 page limit | 11 pages, not including references 
 paper size | US Letter 8.5in x 11in 
 top margin | 1in 
 bottom margin | 1in 
 left margin | 0.75in 
 right margin | 0.75in 
 column separation | 0.333in 
 body | 2-column, single-spaced 
 body font size | 10pt 
 abstract font | 10pt 
 section heading font | 12pt, bold 
 subsection heading font | 10pt, bold 
 space between section heading and text | ≥ 6pt 
 caption font | 9pt 
 fonts in figures and tables | ≥ 8pt, preferably ≥ 9pt 
 reference entries | 8pt; no page limit; list full names of all author (no “et al.”); include link to document (preferablyDOI); make references to citations clickable 
 appendices | do not count towards the page limit 
 Submissions that violate any of these restrictions might be rejected without being reviewed. 
 Author Response Period 
 ASPLOS 2026 will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting; see exact dates specified above. Authors should generally focus their rebuttal on (1) correcting factual errors in the reviews and (2) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. When a major revision is a realistic possibility, in addition to clarifying the submitted work, rebuttals may describe new experiments and data, if doing so addresses the reviewers’ concerns. Rebuttals are optional but strongly encouraged, and their absence might indicate to reviewers that authors are not interested in improving the work. There is no explicit word limit to a rebuttal, but authors are strongly encouraged to keep it under 800 words, and reviewers are not expected to read words that exceed this limit. Authors are not allowed to attach files to the rebuttal HotCRP comment. 
 Accepted Papers 
 Submissions selected by the program committee will be conditionally accepted, subject to revision and approval by a committee member acting as a shepherd. Accepted papers will be allowed two additional pages in the proceedings (and up to two more with a fee of $200 per page). We expect that one author of each accepted paper will physically attend the conference and present the work in a dedicated time slot (unlessallauthors have difficulty traveling due to such serious limitations as visa restrictions, care-giving responsibilities, and disability). By default, all accepted papers will be made available online to registered attendees before the conference at a date that depends on the review cycle. Papers accepted to the spring and summer deadlines will be published in separate volumes in advance of the conference. 
 ACM requires that all authors of accepted papers will adhere to the following policy. Please ensure that you and your co-authorsobtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has made ahref=""https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs"" - commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all published authors
to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution, and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
 Artifact Evaluation 
 Artifact evaluation will continue in 2026 as has become a tradition at ASPLOS. Please refer to the ASPLOS 2026 AEC web page for more information. 
 Poster and Lightning Sessions 
 In addition to the regular presentations, the program may include poster and lightning sessions. If those are included, details can be found here when they become available. 
 Wild and Crazy Ideas Session 
 The program will also tentatively include a WACI session. Details will become available later. 
 Best Paper Award 
 The committee will select a handful of papers to receive a Best Paper Award. The decision may or may not be communicated to the winning authors prior to the official announcement at the opening session of the conference. 
 Program and Registration 
 Complete program and registration information will be available on the conference website as soon as it becomes available. 
 Confidentiality 
 All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

 Paper submission 
 Authors are invited to submit high-quality manuscripts reporting original unpublished research in the topics related to the symposium. Simultaneous submission to other journals or conferences with published proceedings is not allowed. By submitting a paper the authors acknowledge that in case of acceptance, at least one of the authors must register at ALGO/ATMOS 2025, attend the conference on-site, and present the paper. 
  
 Submissions must be in the form of a single PDF file prepared according to thehref=""https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/OASIcs#author"" - author instructions
and using thehref=""https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/OASIcs#author"" - LaTeX OASIcs style file
and must be submitted electronically via thehref=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atmos2025"" - EasyChair submission system
. 
  
 ATMOS 2025 accepts two types of submissions, both of which will be reviewed with the same quality standards by the Program Committee. 
  
 Regular paper submissions: A regular paper submission should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state its key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main results. A regular paper submission should consist of a main body plus an optional and clearly marked appendix. The target length for the main body (excluding the bibliography, the front page(s) (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, …)) is 12-15 pages. The total paper, including the bibliography, the front page(s) (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, …) and the optional appendix, may not exceed 20 pages. Authors should include all necessary details in their submission so that the Program Committee can judge the correctness, importance and originality of their work. Any material (e.g., proofs or experimental results) omitted (from the main part of 15 pages) due to space limitations can be put into the optional appendix, which will be read at the Program Committee’s discretion. Regular papers will be allotted up to 20 pages in the proceedings. 
  
 Short papersubmissions: A short paper submission may present preliminary results or work-in-progress on a specific topic. Authors should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A short paper submission should have at least 4 and at most 6 pages. Authors should provide sufficient details in their submission so that the Program Committee can judge the correctness, importance and originality of their work. Short papers will be allotted up to 6 pages in the proceedings.

. 
  
 ATMOS 2025 accepts two types of submissions, both of which will be reviewed with the same quality standards by the Program Committee. 
  
 Regular paper submissions: A regular paper submission should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state its key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main results. A regular paper submission should consist of a main body plus an optional and clearly marked appendix. The target length for the main body (excluding the bibliography, the front page(s) (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, …)) is 12-15 pages. The total paper, including the bibliography, the front page(s) (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, …) and the optional appendix, may not exceed 20 pages. Authors should include all necessary details in their submission so that the Program Committee can judge the correctness, importance and originality of their work. Any material (e.g., proofs or experimental results) omitted (from the main part of 15 pages) due to space limitations can be put into the optional appendix, which will be read at the Program Committee’s discretion. Regular papers will be allotted up to 20 pages in the proceedings. 
  
 Short papersubmissions: A short paper submission may present preliminary results or work-in-progress on a specific topic. Authors should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A short paper submission should have at least 4 and at most 6 pages. Authors should provide sufficient details in their submission so that the Program Committee can judge the correctness, importance and originality of their work. Short papers will be allotted up to 6 pages in the proceedings.

 Since 1992, AVI has been a biennial appointment for a vast international community of experts with a broad range of backgrounds. Throughout three decades, the Conference has attracted leading researchers of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) from all over the world, offering a forum to present and disseminate new technological results, paradigms, and visions for HCI and user interfaces. 
 Because of advanced technology and new possibilities for user interaction, AVI has broadened the topics it covers, still keeping its primary focus on the conception, design, implementation, and evaluation of novel visual interfaces. 
 The maintopicscan be seen in thehref=""/calls/paper-submission"" - Call for Papers
. 
 While rooted in Italy, AVI is an actual international conference concerning the nationality of participants, authors of papers, and program committee members. The mixture of carefully selected research contributions paired with cordial Italian hospitality creates a unique conference atmosphere, which has made AVI an internationally recognized brand.

 https://avi2024.dibris.unige.it/calls 

DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM 
  
 The goal of the Doctoral Consortium is to provide a setting for PhD students to present their work and receive feedback on their doctoral research plan and progress. Students will be offered the opportunity to articulate and discuss their problem statement, goals, methods, and results. The Doctoral Consortium also aims at providing students with guidance on various aspects of their research from established researchers and the other students participating in the sessions. Finally, the Doctoral Consortium seeks to motivate students in the development of their scientific curiosity and facilitate their networking within the research community. 

PROCEEDINGS 
  
 Accepted full and short research papers, poster papers, demo papers, and workshop descriptions will appear in the Proceedings published by ACM Press. They will be available in the ACM Digital Library. For each accepted paper, at least one author must register to AVI 2024 by the early registration deadline for authors and present the paper at the Conference.

 AVI 30th Anniversary 
  
 Since 1992, AVI has been a biennial appointment for a vast international community of experts with a broad range of backgrounds. Throughout three decades, the Conference has attracted leading researchers of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) from all over the world, offering a forum to present and disseminate new technological results, paradigms and visions for HCI and user interfaces. 
 Because of advanced technology and new possibilities for user interaction, AVI has broadened the topics it covers, still keeping its primary focus on the conception, design, implementation and evaluation of novel visual interfaces. 
  
 While rooted in Italy, AVI is an actual international conference concerning the nationality of participants, authors of papers and program committee members. The mixture of carefully selected research contributions paired with cordial Italian hospitality creates a unique conference atmosphere, which has made AVI an internationally recognized brand. 
  
 AVI 2022 is under the patronage of Sapienza Università di Roma, Dipartimento di Informatica. 
  
 We look forward to your participation in AVI2022!

 Important notice 
 Unfortunately, on the night of Sunday 5th June, a fire started in the SPA of the Hotel Villa Tuscolana. 
 We are doing everything possible to ensure this has the most negligible impact on the conference and the attendees' stay. 
 AVI remembers prof. Michele Risi, who passed away prematurely last Saturday, February 12th. 
 Professor at University of Salerno, he was a member of our Program Committee.

 On behalf of the organizing committee, we warmly welcome you to the 20th edition of the IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal-Based Surveillance (AVSS), taking place in the beautiful city of Niagara Falls, ON, Canada. 
  
 The IEEE AVSS Conference aims to provide a transformative and interdisciplinary forum that brings together experts from academia, industry, and government to advance the frontiers of theory, methods, systems, and applications. This year, we place a special emphasis on the recent trends in generative AI and large language models, which are revolutionizing the fields of video and signal-based surveillance. 
  
 Our program features three oral sessions, three keynotes, one tutorial, two workshops, and two poster sessions. Out of the 74 submissions, 44 papers have been accepted to the main track of the conference, resulting in an acceptance rate of 59.4%. Each submission underwent a rigorous review process, with a minimum of three reviews per paper. Authors had the opportunity to provide feedback on the reviews before the program chairs diligently curated the final conference program. 
  
 On the second day of the conference, we have two specialized workshops that highlight the impact of generative AI: (1) Workshop on New Trends in AI-Generated Media and Security (AIMS 2024), and (2) Intelligent Visual Computing Systems and Security Concerns (IVCSSC 2024). The AIMS Workshop features five keynotes, each with its own in-depth topic. The selection of papers for these workshops was conducted separately from the main conference track. AVSS 2024 features one Tutorial session, where Peter Tu and his team will offer an excellent tutorial on cutting-edge developments in social analytics. 
  
 AVSS 2024 features three distinguished keynote speakers: Prof. Xin Li from SUNY Albany, Prof. Xiaoming Liu from Michigan State University, and Prof. Pramod Varshney from Syracuse University. They will share their insights on aerial video analysis, biometric recognition and distributed inference in human-sensor networks, respectively. We hope you will find their talks both inspiring and enriching. 
  
 With the contributions of our authors, presenters, keynote speakers, and organizers, we are proud to present a strong program that covers a variety of state-of-the-art research. The success of AVSS 2024 would not be possible without the dedication, effort, and hard work of many individuals. We take this opportunity to thank all the authors for their submissions and participation in this conference. 
  
 We gratefully acknowledge the mentorship provided by our Honorary Chair Prof. Venu Govindaraju. We express our sincere gratitude to the Technical Program Committee members and external referees for their diligent work in reviewing the submitted papers, as well as their invaluable contributions and support. Special thanks go to the Area Chairs: Dr. Feng Ding, Dr. Ting Liu, Dr. Dylan Campbell, Dr. Chinwe Ekenna, and Dr. Shu Hu. We also thank the Workshop Chairs: Dr. Ifeoma Nwogu and Dr. Pradeep Atrey, Industry Chairs: Dr. Arslan Basharat and Dr. Lipeng Ke, Tutorial Chair: Dr. Chaker Larabi, Publication Chair: Dr. Shan Jia, Finance Chair: Dr. Hui Guo, Registration Chair: Dr. Xin Wang, Publicity Chair: Dr. Zhedong Zheng, and Website and Local Chairs: Dr. Chengzhe Sun and Dr. Jialing Cai. Additionally, we appreciate the efforts of our local student assistants: Riky Zhou, Yu Cai, and Zhaofeng Si.

 Call For Papers 
 Recent years witnessed significant interest in the use of Machine Learning and AI-based techniques to support large data analysis, with research and implementation of systems specifically focused on supporting different phases of the data processing lifecycle. These have ranged from in-memory systems and distributed environments (e.g., MapReduce/Hadoop, Spark) to specialist environments for stream processing of data and events (e.g., Flink, Kinesis) and Serverless (e.g., OpenWhisk, AWS Lambda). On the other hand, we also realise the importance of computational systems required to process small data volumes, but which involve interdependencies and relationships that are hard to capture and derive. 
 The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT) is a premier annual conference series aiming to provide a platform for researchers from both academia and industry to present new discoveries in the broad area of big data computing and applications.

PAPER SUBMISSION 
  
 Submitted manuscripts must represent original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other conference or journal. Manuscripts are submitted in PDF format and may not exceed ten (10) ACM-formatted *double-column* pages, including figures, tables, and references. All manuscripts undergo a double-blind peer-review process and will be reviewed and judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, rigor in analysis, quality of results, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference attendees. Your submission is subject to a determination that you are not under any sanctions by ACM. Accepted papers will later be converted into single-column format through the ACM TAPS process and therefore need to use the new templates that are single-column by default. Switch them to double-column for authoring your paper. This is possible in both the Word and the LaTeX templates. 
  
 At least one author of each paper must be registered for the conference in order for the paper to be published in the proceedings. The conference proceedings will be published by the ACM and made available online via the IEEE Xplore Digital Library and ACM Digital Library. 
  
 IMPORTANT DATES 
 Time zone: Anywhere in the world! 
 Paper Submissions Due: 10 August 2024 
 Acceptance Notification: 7 October 2024 
 Camera Ready Papers Due: 20 October 2024 
 AWARDS AND SPECIAL ISSUES 
 A selection commission chaired by the BDCAT 2024 technical programme committee will select and acknowledge the best paper to receive an award during the conference.

IEEE/ACM Int’l Conf. on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT) 
 We are pleased to inform you that the “11th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT 2024)” will be held in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates between 16 and and 19 December, 2024. 
 Recent years witnessed significant interest in the use of Machine Learning and AI-based techniques to support large data analysis, with research and implementation of systems specifically focused on supporting different phases of the data processing lifecycle. These have ranged from in-memory systems and distributed environments (e.g., MapReduce/Hadoop, Spark) to specialist environments for stream processing of data and events (e.g., Flink, Kinesis) and Serverless (e.g., OpenWhisk, AWS Lambda). On the other hand, we also realise the importance of computational systems required to process small data volumes, but which involve interdependencies and relationships that are hard to capture and derive. 
 The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT) is a premier annual conference series aiming to provide a platform for researchers from both academia and industry to present new discoveries in the broad area of big data computing and applications. Previous events were held in London, UK (BDCAT 2014), Limassol, Cyprus (BDCAT 2015), Shanghai, China (BDCAT 2016), Austin, USA (BDCAT 2017), Zurich, Switzerland (BDCAT 2018), Auckland, New Zealand (BDCAT 2019), Leicester, UK (BDCAT 2020), Leicester, UK (BDCAT 2021), Vancouver, USA (BDCAT 2022), and Taormina, Italy (BDCAT 2023). The BDCAT 2024 will be held in conjunction with the 17th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC 2024) in Sharjah, UAE.

 Introduction 
 Big data is an emerging paradigm applied to datasets whose size is beyond the ability of commonly used software tools to capture, manage, and process the data within a tolerable elapsed time. Such datasets are often from various sources (Variety) yet unstructured such as social media, sensors, scientific applications, surveillance, video and image archives, Internet texts and documents, Internet search indexing, medical records, business transactions and web logs; and are of large size (Volume) with fast data in/out (Velocity). More importantly, big data has to be of high value (Value) and establish trust in it for business decision making (Veracity). Various technologies are being discussed to support the handling of big data such as massively parallel processing databases, scalable storage systems, cloud/stream computing platforms, and high performance/parallel computing platforms.  
   
  The 18th IEEE International Conference on Big Data Science and Engineering (BigDataSE-2024) is going to provide a prime international forum for researchers, industry practitioners and environment experts to exchange the latest fundamental advances in the state of the art and practice of Big Data and broadly related areas. The goal of this conference is to promote community-wide discussion for identifying advanced applications, technologies and theories for big data. We seek submissions of papers that invent novel techniques, investigate new applications, introduce advanced methodologies, propose promising research directions and discuss approaches for unsolved issues.  
   
  BigDataSE-2024 will be hosted in Sanya, China. Sanya, a picturesque coastal city, offers an ideal setting for the conference and provides opportunities for exploration, including visits to renowned sites such as Tianya Haijiao, Wuzhizhou Coral Island, and the beaches of Yalong Bay.  
   
  Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to BigDataSE-2024. Accepted papers will be submitted for possible inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.

 BMVC 2024  : We are pleased to announce that BMVC will be held from 25th - 28th November 2024 in Glasgow.

 Call for Volunteers for hosting and organsing BMVC!  
 We are seeking volunteers to host and form the organising team for BMVC.  
 BMVC is a flagship conference and important conference for the global computer vision community; as such it is a priorty for the BMVA. The conference can only run with support of the vision community; the organisational teams include junior and senior researchers across both academia and industry from the UK and around the world.  
 The vision community, and the size of the conference, has expanded over recent years and we currently plan for around 500 attendees. This places a strain on the old model of hosting within a university with a team entirely from the same university. Instead, BMVC has moved to a model where the conference is split with general chairs comprising a local chair and a programme chair. The local chair is responsible for overseeing the physical hosting of the conference and the programme chair for the selection of the papers (appointing area chairs and reviewers, etc…). These chairs lead teams of volunteers who do not need to be at the same institution and we encourage forming a diverse team from across the global vision community.  
 The BMVA committee can assist with finding and securing venues if this is required (the scale of BMVC can now make it difficult to host within a university lecture theatre for example) and we can provide assistance with putting together the budget and sponsorship.  
 Proposals to Host a Future BMVC  
 If you would like to host BMVC, proposals are solicited in June of each year for the BMVC two years later. Please contact the Chair for further details.

The format is designed for easy on-screen reading, and to print well at one or two pages per sheet. Additional features include: pop-up annotations for citations~\cite{Authors06,Mermin89}; a margin ruler for reviewing; and a greatly simplified way of entering multiple authors and institutions. {\bf All authors are encouraged to read this document}, even if you have written many papers before. As well as a description of the format, the document contains many instructions relating to formatting problems and errors that are common even in the work of authors who {\em have} written many papers before. \end{abstract} %------------------------------------------------------------------------- \section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro} The proceedings of BMVC are published only in electronic form, but it is still assumed that readers of the papers may wish to print the paper. This document illustrates the required paper format, which is designed to read well either printed with two pages per sheet (``2-up''), or on screen. Note that printing with one page per sheet will produce a ``large print'' version, which in many cases is not what is desired. To approximate the old BMVC format, print at one page per sheet, but do not choose the option to ``scale to fit paper''. \LaTeX\ users should use this template in order to prepare their paper. Users of other packages should emulate the style and layout of this example. Note that best results will be achieved using {\tt pdflatex}, which is available in most modern distributions. \subsection{Paper length: nine pages plus bibliography} Paper length should not exceed 9~pages, {\em not counting} the bibliography. {\bf Papers which are overlength will not be reviewed}. This includes papers where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those laid down by this style guide. The reason such papers will not be reviewed is that there is no provision for supervised revisions of manuscripts. The reviewing process cannot determine the suitability of the paper for presentation in nine pages if it is reviewed in twelve. The bibliography should begin immediately after the paper text. It may be of any length, within reason. It should {\em not} include annotations, figures, or any other paraphernalia intended to subvert the paper length requirement. \begin{figure} \begin{tabular}{ccc} \bmvaHangBox{\fbox{\parbox{2.7cm}{~\\[2.8mm] \rule{0pt}{1ex}\hspace{2.24mm}\includegraphics[width=2.33cm]{images/eg1_largeprint.png}\\[-0.1pt]}}}& \bmvaHangBox{\fbox{\includegraphics[width=2.8cm]{images/eg1_largeprint.png}}}& \bmvaHangBox{\fbox{\includegraphics[width=5.6cm]{images/eg1_2up.png}}}\\ (a)&(b)&(c) \end{tabular} \caption{It is often a good idea for the first figure to attempt to encapsulate the article, complementing the abstract. This figure illustrates the various print and on-screen layouts for which this paper format has been optimized: (a) traditional BMVC print format; (b) on-screen single-column format, or large-print paper; (c) full-screen two column, or 2-up printing. } \label{fig:teaser} \end{figure} \subsection{Citations} When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``{\em et alia}'', shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word.) The provided \verb'\etal' macro is a useful {\em aide memoire} in this regard. However, use it only when there are three or more authors. Thus, the following is correct: `` Frobnication has been trendy lately. It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.'' This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...'' because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors. If you use the \verb'\etal' macro, then you need not worry about double periods when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal. %For this citation style, keep multiple citations in numerical (not %chronological) order, so prefer We use {\tt natbib}, so citations in random order are nicely sorted: \cite{Alpher03,Alpher02,Authors06b,Authors06}. However, we don't use the compress option, as we want each reference to have its own hyperlink and popup window. %------------------------------------------------------------------------- \subsection{Footnotes} Please use footnotes\footnote {This is what a footnote looks like. It often distracts the reader from the main flow of the argument.} sparingly. Indeed, try to avoid footnotes altogether and include necessary peripheral observations in the text (within parentheses, if you prefer, as in this sentence). If you wish to use a footnote, place it at the bottom of the column on the page on which it is referenced. Use Times 8-point type, single-spaced. \begin{figure*} \begin{center} \fbox{\rule{0pt}{2in} \rule{.9\linewidth}{0pt}} \end{center} \caption{Example of a short caption, which should be centered.} \label{fig:short} \end{figure*} \begin{table} \begin{center} \begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Method & Frobnability \\ \hline\hline Theirs & Frumpy \\ Yours & Frobbly \\ Ours & Makes one's heart Frob\\ \hline \end{tabular} \end{center} \caption{Results. Ours is better.} \end{table} \subsection{Mathematics} Please number all of your sections and displayed equations. It is important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation. Just because you didn't refer to it in the text doesn't mean some future reader might not need to refer to it. It is cumbersome to have to use circumlocutions like ``the equation second from the top of page 3 column 1''. (Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not an alternative to equation numbers). All authors will benefit from reading Mermin's description~\cite{Mermin89} of how to write mathematics. %------------------------------------------------------------------------- \subsection{References} List and number all bibliographical references in 9-point Times single-spaced, at the end of your paper. When referenced in the text enclose the citation number in square brackets, for example~\cite{Authors06}. Where appropriate, include the name(s) of editors of referenced books. %------------------------------------------------------------------------ \subsection{Color} Color is valuable, and will be visible to readers of the electronic copy. However ensure that, when printed on a monochrome printer, no important information is lost by the conversion to grayscale. \bibliography{egbib} \end{document}

 Call For Papers 
 The British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) is one of the major international conferences on computer vision and related areas. It is organised by the British Machine Vision Association (BMVA). The 36th BMVC will now be an in-person event from 24th—27th November 2025 in Sheffield, UK. 
  
 Authors are invited to submit high-quality papers in image processing, computer vision, machine learning and related areas for BMVC 2025. Submitted papers will be refereed on originality, presentation, empirical results, and evaluation quality. Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings published and DOI-indexed by BMVA. Past proceedings are online at the BMVA proceedings website. 
  
 Please note that BMVC is a single-track meeting with oral and poster presentations. The paper submission deadline will be on the 16th of May 2025. Submitted papers should not exceed NINE pages (references are excluded), and appendices should be submitted via the supplementary information. You can find further information in the Author Guidelines and Submit your Paper pages. 
  
 The submission portal will be available from late-April, 2025. 
  
 Topics include, but are not limited to: 
  
 3D from X 
 3D Shape modeling and processing 
 Action and event understanding 
 Adversarial attack and defense 
 Architecture and Space Design 
 Biometrics 
 Brave new ideas (not beating SOA but a new appraoch, theory, niche) 
 Computational Photography and Photogrammetry 
 Computer vision theory 
 Datasets and Evaluation 
 Deep learning architectures and techniques 
 Document analysis and understanding 
 Embodied vision: Active agents; simulation 
 Explainable AI

 Video analysis and Understanding 
 Vision and audio 
 Vision and graphics 
 Vision and language 
 Vision and robotics 
 Vision applications and systems 
 Visual reasoning and logical representation 
  
 Papers submitted under the “Brave new ideas” subject area are expected to move away from incremental benchmark gains. Proposed ideas should radically differ from the current research strand or propose a novel problem. 
 Reviewing Process for BMVC 2025 
  
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. The Area Chair will provide a meta-review, summarising the reviewers’ points and recommending paper decisions. 
  
 Please Note: Due to the anticipated volume of papers for BMVC 2025 (based on recent year’s experience), there will be NO extension granted to the submission deadline. In keeping with conferences in the field (e.g., NeurIPS, CVPR) and to cope with the increasing number of submissions, we ask that all authors be prepared to review papers. The submission site will ask authors to acknowledge this commitment, and failure to engage with the reviewing process might be grounds for rejection. 
  
 Further information about the reviewing process can be found at the Reviewing policies. 
  
 Any queries to the Programme Chairs should be sent to pc_email.

 Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion  
 The BPM community is committed to the promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in all aspects of our professional activities. We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience. We encourage all participants to consider DEI in their writing, reviews, presentations, and all interactions related to the BPM conference. The BPM community has a tradition of researching and experimenting with real-world applications and, as such, needs to find the balance between research and societal events that shape our lives as a liberal society that supports DEI principles. Therefore, the conference participants should feel free to express themselves on all topics within and beyond our interests as a research community and to do so in a non-aggravating and respectful manner, being considerate to those who are the possible victims of, a.o., violence, war, or political oppression and making use of this special opportunity to gather in an international setting to better understand multiple view points in a safe and inclusive environment.

 About BPMDS    
  
 The BPMDS working conference, sponsored by IFIP WG8.1, has been a fertile ground for influential research and a catalyst for pioneering developments in business process modeling and support. This year, we reaffirm our commitment to fostering cutting-edge research and facilitating robust discussions that shape the future of business processes.   
 Recognizing the evolving nature of our field, we introduce innovations to the submission process designed to enhance participation and engagement. We invite contributions ranging from completed research papers to idea papers. We encourage submissions that not only reflect on the established foundations of BPMDS, but also explore new paradigms, methodologies, and applications. Whether through the lens of AI and machine learning, process mining, human-centric approaches, or the implications of digital assistants such as ChatGPT, we seek to reflect the dynamic and diverse nature of our community.   

 Topics    
  
 BPMDS welcomes submissions on a broad range of topics, that include, but are not limited to:   
 Process Mining and Data-Driven BPM:  Discussing techniques and tools to obtain process-related information from event logs, including process discovery, conformance checking, and enhancement. 
  AI and Machine Learning in BPM:  How are artificial intelligence and machine learning being used to improve any facet of the BPM? 
  Assistants and BPM:  Exploring how assistants such as ChatGPT impact BPM. 
  Advancements in Business Process Modeling:  Exploring the latest developments, including new symbols, semantics, and modeling approaches. 
  Platforms and BPM:  Joining innovation and transaction with business process management. 
  Case Studies on BPM in Different Industries:  Sharing practical experiences and insights from applying BPM in sectors such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and services. 
  Human-centric BPM:  Focusing on the role of human judgment and interaction in BPM and how to better integrate human factors. 
  BPM for Sustainability:  Leveraging BPM to support sustainable business practices and the development of green business processes. 
  Regulatory Compliance and BPM:  Addressing how business process modeling or BPM in general can aid in achieving and maintaining regulatory compliance. 
  Future Trends in BPM:  Predicting future directions of BPM research, including potential disruptive technologies and methodologies. 
  BPM Education and Training:  Best practices for teaching and training professionals in business process modeling, development, and support. 
  Evaluation and Benchmarking of BPM Tools:  Providing insights into the evaluation of BPM tools and methodologies, including comparative studies and benchmarking. 

 Submissions    
  
 We invite two kinds of submissions:   
 ●    Completed research papers  (14 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references) that report on research with evaluated results.   
 ●    Idea papers  (7 pages,  plus up to 2 pages for references  ) that present innovative concepts or directions to inspire discussion.   
 Submissions should adhere to the LNBIP formatting instructions at  https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines.  Page limits are defined excluding the reference list, but including all text, figures, and appendices. BPMDS uses a single-blind review system, so author details can be included in the submission. Submissions not conforming to the formatting instructions, the page limitations, or that are obviously out of the scope of the conference, will be rejected without review. The results described in the submitted paper must be unpublished and must not be under review elsewhere.   
 Submissions should be made through the CAISE 2025 EasyChair (select BPMDS 2025 as the track):  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=caise2025   

 Special Collection    
  
 From the accepted completed research papers, a selection will be invited to submit an extended version to a special collection of the  Process Science Journal  .   

 Open Science Principles    
  
 BPMDS encourages authors of research papers to follow the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. In particular, the conference supports the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourages authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data in order to increase reproducibility and replicability.   
 Authors are encouraged to make research artefacts (e.g., prototypes, interview protocols, questionnaires) or the datasets (used in, or produced by, the empirical evaluation) reported in the paper available in a suitable form. To facilitate this, we kindly ask authors to include links in their manuscripts to private or public repositories where reviewers can access the associated research artefacts. This information may be presented in a dedicated section, such as “Data availability” or “Reproducibility”. This requirement does not apply to papers that neither involve an empirical study nor a prototype implementation.   
 Authors who are unable or choose not to share their research artefacts and datasets with the program committee are encouraged to provide an explanation within their submitted manuscript, detailing the reasons behind their decision. This statement may be removed from the final version of the paper if it gets accepted. Possible reasons may involve privacy restrictions or non-disclosure agreements.   
 To enhance the accessibility of research artefacts and datasets, authors are advised to make them accessible via public repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, GitHub, or institutional archives) under an open data license such as the CC0 dedication or the CC-BY 4.0 license. Making research artefacts and datasets available via cloud services such as Dropbox or Google Docs is discouraged due to the volatility of the links associated with these services.   
 Finally, authors are encouraged to self-archive their pre- and post-prints in open, preserved repositories, such as their institutional preprint repository, arXiv or other non-profit services, in line with Springer’s copyright agreement (see “License to Publish form for LNCS, CCIS or LNBIP”, §3, available at  https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines  ).
