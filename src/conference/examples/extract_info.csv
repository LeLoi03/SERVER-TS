  Camera-ready papers/end of shepherding: | July 15, 2025 
  Paper Submission  
 ADBIS 2025 invites original papers (not submitted elsewhere in parallel) describing results that broadly belong to the aforementioned list of topics. Accepted long papers will be published in a Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volume and accepted short papers are published in Springer's Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) series. The program committee may decide to accept a submission as a short paper if it reports interesting results but does not justify publication of a full paper.  
 LONG papers can be:   
 Regular research papers, reporting novel, solid research findings within the scope of the conference, typically but not exclusively found in proposing new models, querying or data handling methods, algorithms, data structures, and system architectures for the management of data. 
  Experimental re-evaluation papers, assessing previously published research results in terms of (i) performance evaluation for algorithms and systems, or, (ii) assessment of the application for methodologies, with the contribution of the paper being found (i) in the evaluation findings and (ii) in the discussion of strong and weak aspects of the algorithm/system/method being assessed. 
  SHORT papers can be:   
 Early findings/work-in-progress reports for prompt dissemination and discussion of early research results, that include early experimental findings and implementations, with an emphasis on (i) the description of the early findings, (ii) the possibilities they present, and, (iii) the difficulties being faced towards full fruition. 
  Vision papers, discussing possibilities and challenges in the exploration of radically new system architectures or methodologies for data management in important areas related to the scope of the conference, or areas that are currently considered outside the scope of the conference but hold the potential of becoming relevant. 
  Submission Guidelines  
 The page limits are as follows:  
 LONG (research or experimental) papers: 16 LNCS style pages, including references 
  SHORT (early findings or visionary) papers: up to 10 LNCS style pages, including references 
  Papers should be submitted in PDF format using the CMT  online submission system at: href=""https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADBIS2025"" - https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADBIS2025
.  
 Authors should consult href=""https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines"" - Springer’s authors’ guidelines
and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Licence-to-Publish agreement. The corresponding author, who must match the corresponding author marked on the paper, must have the full right, power, and authority to sign the agreement on behalf of all of the authors of a particular paper, and accepts responsibility for releasing this material on their behalf. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. An author of an accepted paper must register to ADBIS 2025 in order to have the paper published, and accepted papers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors.  
 Shepherding  
 Borderline papers will go through a shepherding phase where they will be expected to address the concerns of the reviewers, expressed as a list of required revisions. Failing to properly address them in due time will entail final rejection. The shepherding process will involve: authors will be given a list of issues/improvements that have to be addressed within 3 weeks’ time; authors improve the paper addressing these concerns; authors submit the revised paper in camera-ready format; the PC chairs ultimately decide whether the revised paper is acceptable as is or not to the final program.  
 Shepherding Schedule  
 The schedule for shepherding is as follows (All deadlines are 11:59 PM AoE):  
 Notification of shepherding status: | June 4, 2025 
  Authors submit revised, camera-ready version: | June 24, 2024 
  Notification of acceptance for shepherded papers: | July 1, 2024 
  Camera-ready documents and copyright: | July 15, 2024 
  Awards  
 Springer will sponsor the ADBIS 2025 Best Paper Award, Best PhD Symposium Paper Award, Best Demonstration and Best Short Paper, which will be announced during the ADBIS 2025 Banquet.  
 Special Issue  
 The best papers of the conference will be invited to submit an extended and revised version of their paper to a special issue in the Information Systems journal of Elsevier ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-systems ).  
 Inclusion and Diversity in Writing and Presentation  
 Authors are strongly encouraged to be inclusive in writing and presentation of their work.  
  Please visit the subsection ""D&I materials"" at https://dbdni.github.io/ for details.  
 Use of Generative AI  
 Authors should explicitly disclose the use of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in their manuscripts when these tools are employed for more than just editing the author’s text. This disclosure can be made through a statement placed at the end of the manuscript, preceding the References section.  
 If it comes to our notice that a submission utilized large language models (LLMs) without clear disclosure, such papers will be subject to immediate desk rejection. However, if there is no usage of such technologies, no disclosure statement is required.

Examples of SoK papers include papers that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence, or provide an extensive and realistic evaluation and comparison of competing approaches to solving specific security problems.  
 SoK papers must include the prefix ""SoK:"" in the title of the paper and will be reviewed by the full PC. They will be accepted based on their treatment of existing work and value to the community.  
  
  Instructions for Authors  
  
 ACISP 2025 will have two rounds of submission. Round one will be on 6 Nov 2024. Round two will be on 19 February 2025. The first round will have the results including reject, major revision, and accept. For the major revision, we encourage authors to submit the updated manuscripts to round two. Round two only includes accept and reject.  
 All the submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted to another conference or journal for consideration of publication. Submissions must be fully anonymous with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references. Submissions must be written in English and have at most 20 pages including bibliography using Springer's LNCS package with no changes to the style. Submissions can exceed 20 pages, but any content beyond 20 pages should be placed in the Appendix. Papers should be sufficiently intelligible and self-contained without appendices so that PC members can make decisions without reading appendices. Submissions not meeting the submission guidelines risk rejection regardless of their merits.  
 The proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag as a volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

 ABZ 2025 – 11th International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods  

 Call for papers  
 The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.  
 The name ABZ goes back to the first conference in London in 2008, where the ASM, B and Z conference series were merged into a joint event. In the following years other formal methods were added, e.g. Alloy in 2010 (Orford, Canada), VDM in 2012 (Pisa, Italy), and TLA+ in 2014 (Toulouse, France). After the also successful 2016 conferences in Linz, Austria, and 2018 in Southampton, UK, it was decided to name the conference “ABZ: International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods”, to stress the openness for further state-based formal methods. We hope to continue many fruitful discussions between representatives of the individual methods in the past, which will bring us closer to the common goal of this research community: the creation of reliable and safe software and systems.  
 ABZ 2025 will have a main conference track, a case study track, a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops.

The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) is an interdisciplinary conference that brings together researchers in machine learning, neuroscience, statistics, optimization, computer vision, natural language processing, life sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, and other adjacent fields. We invite submissions presenting new and original research on topics including but not limited to the following:
Applications (e.g., vision, language, speech and audio, Creative AI)
Deep learning (e.g., architectures, generative models, optimization for deep networks, foundation models, LLMs)
Evaluation (e.g., methodology, meta studies, replicability and validity, human-in-the-loop)
General machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, online, active, etc.)
Infrastructure (e.g., libraries, improved implementation and scalability, distributed solutions)
Machine learning for sciences (e.g. climate, health, life sciences, physics, social sciences)
Neuroscience and cognitive science (e.g., neural coding, brain-computer interfaces)
Optimization (e.g., convex and non-convex, stochastic, robust)
Probabilistic methods (e.g., variational inference, causal inference, Gaussian processes)
Reinforcement learning (e.g., decision and control, planning, hierarchical RL, robotics)
Social and economic aspects of machine learning (e.g., fairness, interpretability, human-AI interaction, privacy, safety, strategic behavior)
Theory (e.g., control theory, learning theory, algorithmic game theory)
Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, and so we welcome interdisciplinary submissions that do not fit neatly into existing categories. We also encourage in-depth analysis of existing methods that provide new insights in terms of their limitations or behaviour beyond the scope of the original work.
Authors are asked to confirm that their submissions accord with thehref=""https://neurips.cc/public/CodeOfConduct"" - NeurIPS code of conduct.

OpenReview
We are using OpenReview to manage submissions. The reviews and author responses will not be public initially (but may be made public later, see below). As in previous years, submissions under review will be visible only to their assigned program committee. We will not be soliciting comments from the general public during the reviewing process. Anyone who plans to submit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create (or update) their OpenReview profile by the full paper submission deadline. Your OpenReview profile can be edited by logging in and clicking on your name inhttps://openreview.net/. This takes you to a URL ""https://openreview.net/profile?id=~[Firstname]_[Lastname][n]"" where the last part is your profile name, e.g., ~Po-Yi_Lu1.
The OpenReview profiles must be up to date, with all publications by the authors, and their current affiliations. The easiest way to import publications is through DBLP but it is not required,see OpenReview FAQ. Submissions without the authors' updated OpenReview profiles will be desk rejected. The information entered in the profile is critical for ensuring thathref=""https://neurips.cc/public/guides/ConflictsOfInterest"" - conflicts of interestand reviewer matching are handled properly. Because of the rapid growth of NeurIPS, we request that all authors help with reviewing papers, if asked to do so. We need everyone's help in maintaining the high scientific quality of NeurIPS.
Please be aware that OpenReview has a moderation policy for newly created profiles: New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks. New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically. If you have any questions about the use of OpenReview, please refer to its FAQ: https://openreview.net/faq
Our OpenReview portal ishref=""https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference"" - https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference. Please note that submissions meant for the Datasets & Benchmarks papers should be submitted to a different OpenReview portal, as shownhref=""https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks"" - here. Papers will not be transferred between the main and the D&B track after the submission is closed.
Abstract Submission
There is a mandatory abstract submission deadline onMay 11, 2025, four days before full paper submissions are due. While it will be possible to edit the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline, submissions with ""placeholder"" abstracts that are rewritten for the full submission risk being removed without consideration. This includes titles and abstracts that either provide little or no semantic information (e.g., ""We provide a new semi-supervised learning method."") or describe a substantively different claimed contribution. After the abstract deadline, adding or removing authors is not allowed, but listed authors can potentially be reordered before the submission deadline.
Paper Formatting Instructions
All submissions must be in PDF format, and in a single PDF file include, in this suggested order:
The submitted paper content
Paper references
The NeurIPS paper checklist
The authors may optionally choose to include some or all of the technical appendices in the same PDF above. But those included parts cannot be changed after the full submission deadline.
The main text of a submitted paper is limited tonine content pages, including all figures and tables. Additional pages containing references, checklist, and the optional technical appendices do not count as content pages. If your submission is accepted, you will be allowed an additional content page for the camera-ready version. The maximum file size for a main paper submission is 50MB.
You must format your submission using thehref=""https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2025/Styles.zip"" - NeurIPS 2025 LaTeX style file, which includes a ""preprint"" option for non-anonymous preprints posted online. Submissions that violate the NeurIPS style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) or page limits may be rejected without further review. Papers may also be rejected without consideration of their merits if they fail to meet the submission requirements, as described in this document.
Paper Checklist
In order to improve the rigor and transparency of research submitted to and published at NeurIPS, authors are required to complete ahref=""https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist"" - paper checklist. The paper checklist is intended to help authors reflect on a wide variety of issues relating to responsible machine learning research, including reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. The checklist forms part of the paper submission, but does not count towards the page limit.
Technical Appendices and Supplementary Material
Technical appendices with additional results, figures, graphs and proofs may be submitted with the paper submission before the full submission deadline (see above), or as a separate PDF in the ZIP file below before the supplementary material deadline. There is no page limit for the technical appendices.
Supplementary material, such as data, or source code may also be submitted separately in a single ZIP file. The material should be created by the authors that directly supports the submission content. We encourage authors to upload their code specifically as part of their supplementary material in order to help reviewers assess the quality of the work. Checkhref=""/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy"" - the policyas well as code submissionhref=""https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code"" - guidelines and templatesfor further details.
Like main paper submissions, technical appendices and supplementary material must be anonymized. Looking at technical appendices and supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers. Authors may submit up to 100MB of technical appendices and supplementary material.
Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)
The NeurIPS policy for use of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be foundhref=""https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM"" - here. Authors are responsible for following it.
Double-blind Reviewing
All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. This policy applies to any supplementary or linked material as well, including code. If you are including links to any external material, it is your responsibility to guarantee anonymous browsing. Please do not include acknowledgments at submission time. If you need to cite one of your own papers, you should do so with adequate anonymization to preserve double-blind reviewing. For instance, write ""In the previous work of Smith et al. [1]…"" rather than ""In our previous work [1]..."". If you need to cite one of your own papers that is in submission to NeurIPS and not available as a non-anonymous preprint, then include a copy of the cited anonymized submission in the supplementary material and write ""Anonymous et al. [1] concurrently show..."". Any papers found to be violating this policy will be desk rejected.
Please note that a different policy applies to Datasets & Benchmarks papers, as shownhref=""https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks"" - here.
Ethics Review
Reviewers and ACs may flag submissions forhref=""https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines"" - ethics review. Flagged submissions will be sent to an ethics review committee for comments. Comments from ethics reviewers will be considered by the primary reviewers and AC as part of their deliberation. They will also be visible to authors, who will have an opportunity to respond. Ethics reviewers do not have the authority to reject papers, but in extreme cases papers may be rejected by the program chairs on ethical grounds, regardless of scientific quality or contribution.
Preprints
The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other online repositories, personal websites, social media) will not result in rejection. If you choose to use the NeurIPS style for the preprint version, you must use the ""preprint"" option rather than the ""final"" option. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Authors may submit anonymized work to NeurIPS that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv) without citing it. Note that public versions of the submission should not say ""Under review at NeurIPS"" or similar.
Dual Submissions
Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that the authors have previously published or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed venues with proceedings or journals may not be submitted to NeurIPS. Papers previously presented at workshops are permitted, so long as they did not appear in conference proceedings (e.g., CVPRW proceedings), a journal or a book. NeurIPS coordinates with other conferences to identify dual submissions. The NeurIPS policy on dual submissions applies for the entire duration of the reviewing process. Failure to cope with the dual submission policy is ground to desk rejection during any point of the reviewing and program building process. Slicing contributions too thinly is discouraged. The reviewing process will treat any other submission by an overlapping set of authors as prior work. If publishing one would render the other too incremental, both may be rejected.
Please note that dual submissions to both the main conference track and the Datasets & Benchmarks track will be desk rejected.
Anti-collusion
NeurIPS does not tolerate any collusion whereby authors secretly cooperate with reviewers, ACs or SACs to obtain favorable reviews. The penalty for collusion is immediate removal from the reviewing system, rejection of all papers under consideration, and/or sanctions to future NeurIPS.
If collusion is identified, the authors and reviewers involved will be notified, and be able to respond to the accusation. While their answers will be carefully taken into consideration, given the short time window to act, the PCs will deliberate and their decision will be final.
Identifying collusion can happen at any point during the review process, including but not limited to the bidding process and the rebuttal period.
Author Responses
Authors will have one week to view and respond to initial reviews. Author responses may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. Authors may not submit revisions of their paper or supplemental material, but may post their responses as a discussion in OpenReview. This is to reduce the burden on authors to have to revise their paper in a rush during the short rebuttal period.
After the initial response period, authors will be able to respond to any further reviewer/AC questions and comments by posting on the submission's forum page. The program chairs reserve the right to solicit additional reviews after the initial author response period. These reviews will become visible to the authors as they are added to OpenReview, and authors will have a chance to respond to them.
After the notification deadline, accepted and opted-in rejected papers will be made public and open for non-anonymous public commenting. Their anonymous reviews, meta-reviews, author responses and reviewer responses will also be made public. Authors of rejected papers will have two weeks after the notification deadline to opt in to make their deanonymized rejected papers public in OpenReview. These papers are not counted as NeurIPS publications and will be shown as rejected in OpenReview.
Publication of Accepted Submissions
Reviews, meta-reviews, and any discussion with the authors will be made public for accepted papers (but reviewer, area chair, and senior area chair identities will remain anonymous). Camera-ready papers will be due in advance of the conference. All camera-ready papers must include ahref=""https://neurips.cc/public/guides/FundingDisclosure"" - funding disclosure. We strongly encourage accompanying code and data to be submitted with accepted papers when appropriate, as per thehref=""https://neurips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy"" - code submission policy. Authors will be allowed to make minor changes for a short period of time after the conference.
Contemporaneous Work
For the purpose of the reviewing process, papers that appeared online after March 1st, 2025 will generally be considered ""contemporaneous"" in the sense that the submission will not be rejected on the basis of the comparison to contemporaneous work. Authors are still expected to cite and discuss contemporaneous work and perform empirical comparisons to the degree feasible. Any paper that influenced the submission is considered prior work and must be cited and discussed as such. Submissions that are very similar to contemporaneous work will undergo additional scrutiny to prevent cases of plagiarism and missing credit to prior work.
Plagiarism is prohibited by the NeurIPShref=""https://neurips.cc/public/CodeOfConduct"" - Code of Conduct.
Other Tracks
Similarly to earlier years, we will host multiple tracks, such as datasets and benchmarks, competitions, tutorials as well as workshops, in addition to the main track for which this call for papers is intended. See the conference homepage for updates and calls for participation in these tracks.
This year, the Datasets and Benchmarks track will share the exact same deadlines as the main conference program. DB submissions will also adhere to the main track's guidelines for formatting, supplementary materials, LLM use, ethics review, preprints, dual submissions, anti-collusion, author responses, and publication. Please refer to thehref=""https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks"" - Datasets and Benchmarks CFPfor details on the track specific requirements; otherwise, the main track's CFP applies.
This year, we introduce a new Position Paper track, with formatting requirements that are consistent to those for the main conference and shared policies on double-blind reviewing, etc. The Position track also has a “lay summary” requirement for papers that are accepted for publication. The deadlines for position papers are shifted slightly later compared to those of the main conference. Please refer to thehref=""/Conferences/2025/CallForPositionPapers"" - Position Papers CFPfor more details.
Experiments
As in past years, the program chairs will be measuring the quality and effectiveness of the review process via randomized controlled experiments. All experiments are independently reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). The program chairs and the Datasets and Benchmarks track chairs will decide whether the experiments are applicable to either or both of the tracks.
Financial Aid
Each paper may designate up to one (1) NeurIPS.cc account email address of a corresponding student author who confirms that they would need the support to attend the conference, and agrees to volunteer if they get selected. To be considered for Financial the student will also need to fill out the Financial Aid application when it becomes available.

ACM IMC 2025 in MadisonACM Internet Measurement Conference 2025
Madison, Wisconsin, USA
October 28-31, 2025
The 2025 Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a three-and-a-half day event focusing on Internet measurement and analysis. The conference is sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM. IMC 2025 is the 25th in ahref=""http://www.sigcomm.org/events/imc-conference"" - seriesof highly successful Internet Measurement Workshops and Conferences.
The ACM IMC 2025 conference will be held from October 28-31, 2025 in Madison, WI, USA.
Announcements
This is the first edition of IMC withtwo deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected.As these novelties will affect decisions and submissions please see thehref=""/imc/2025/cfp/"" - Call for Papers. Also note that papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 21st, 2024 deadline.

ISSTA 2025
Welcome to the website of the ISSTA 2025 conference.
The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) is the leading research symposium on software testing and analysis, bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experience on how to analyze and test software systems.
2025 will mark the 34th edition of ISSTA!

Research Papers: Call for Papers
href=""https://conf.researchr.org/track/issta-2025/issta-2025-papers"" - View track page for all detailsWe invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental research on software testing and analysis.
ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions. The majority of submissions are expected to be “Research Papers”, but submissions that best fit the description of “Experience Papers” or “Replicability Studies” should be submitted as such. A good Experience Paper will include lessons learned or other wisdom synthesised for the community from the reported experience. Replicability Studies shall clearly describe their purpose and value beyond the original result.
NEW THIS YEAR: The conference proceedings will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE), Issue: ISSTA 2025.
href=""#research-papers"" - Research Papers
Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.
href=""#experience-papers"" - Experience Papers
Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience.
Replicability Studies
ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artefacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs. Particularly, replicability studies are encouraged to target techniques that previously were evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artefact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.
Replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): the measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artefacts which they develop completely independently. Moreover, it is generally also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:
Depth and breadth of experiments
Clarity of writing
Appropriateness of conclusions
Amount of useful, actionable insights
Availability of artefacts
We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artefacts the study is built on, and to submit those artefacts to the artefact evaluation. Artefacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.
Major Revisions
Papers submitted to the initial deadline may be accepted, rejected or may receive a chance to submit a major revision of the initial submission to the major revision deadline.
href=""#submission-guidelines"" - Submission Guidelines
Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to theACM Policyand Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.
At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates:LatexorWord (Mac)orWord (Windows). Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In sum, you want to use:
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}
Papers may use either numeric or author-year format for citations.It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review.
The page limit is strict, i.e., papers that take more than 18 pages for anything apart from references (including any section, figure, text, or appendix), will be desk-rejected. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission: “[TITLE](Experience Paper)”, “[TITLE](Replicability Study)”. Papers must be submitted electronically through thehref=""https://issta2025.hotcrp.com"" - ISSTA 2025 submission site.
Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and verifiability/transparency of the work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.
Double-anonymous Reviewing
ISSTA 2025 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission and may want to confirm that their generated PDF does not contain any meta-data with their names. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.
Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.
Open Science Policy and “Data Availability” Section
ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.
Upon submission, authors are asked to make their code, data, etc. available to the program committee (via upload of anonymized supplemental material or a link to an anonymized private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. At least one of the reviewers will check the provided data. While sharing the data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, it will inform the program committee’s decision. Furthermore, we ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named “Data Availability” after the Conclusion section.

At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates:LatexorWord (Mac)orWord (Windows). Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In sum, you want to use:
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}
Papers may use either numeric or author-year format for citations.It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review.
The page limit is strict, i.e., papers that take more than 18 pages for anything apart from references (including any section, figure, text, or appendix), will be desk-rejected. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission: “[TITLE](Experience Paper)”, “[TITLE](Replicability Study)”. Papers must be submitted electronically through thehref=""https://issta2025.hotcrp.com"" - ISSTA 2025 submission site.
Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and verifiability/transparency of the work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.
Double-anonymous Reviewing
ISSTA 2025 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission and may want to confirm that their generated PDF does not contain any meta-data with their names. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.
Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.
Open Science Policy and “Data Availability” Section
ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.
Upon submission, authors are asked to make their code, data, etc. available to the program committee (via upload of anonymized supplemental material or a link to an anonymized private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. At least one of the reviewers will check the provided data. While sharing the data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, it will inform the program committee’s decision. Furthermore, we ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named “Data Availability” after the Conclusion section.

UbiComp / ISWC

Past Conferences
The ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) is the result of a merger of the two most renowned conferences in the field: Pervasive and UbiComp. While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event.
The ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing (ISWC) discusses novel results in all aspects of wearable computing, and has been colocated with UbiComp and Pervasive since 2013.
A complete list of UbiComp, Pervasive, and ISWC past conferences is provided below.

UbiComp / ISWC

Past Conferences
The ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) is the result of a merger of the two most renowned conferences in the field: Pervasive and UbiComp. While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event.
The ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing (ISWC) discusses novel results in all aspects of wearable computing, and has been colocated with UbiComp and Pervasive since 2013.
A complete list of UbiComp, Pervasive, and ISWC past conferences is provided below.

Call for Papers - Research Track

ISSRE (International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering) is the leading conference on software reliability and it focuses on approaches, techniques, and tools for assessing, predicting, and improving the reliability, safety, and security of software systems.
ISSRE 2025 is introducing***Early Decisions***. At the beginning of the author response period we will notify the authors with the following outcomes: ""Accept"" if reviewers do not require any clarification and are happy with the current state of the paper; ""Reject"" if the reviewers agree that the authors’ response is unlikely to alter their evaluation; ""Response Recommended"" if reviewers have explicit questions that clarify some aspects of the paper, and the decision Accept/Reject is postponed.
The research track at ISSRE 2025 invites high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results exploring new scientific ideas, contributing new evidence to established research directions, or reflecting on practical experience. Specifically, ISSRE solicits submissions in three categories: (1) full research regular (REG) papers, (2) practical experience reports (PER), and (3) tools and artefacts (TAR) papers. Papers will be assessed with criteria appropriate to each category.
REG papers should describe a novel contribution to the reliability of software systems. Novelty should be argued via concrete evidence and appropriate positioning within the state of the art. REG papers are also expected to clearly explain the validation process and its limitations.
PER papers should provide an in-depth exposition of practical experiences ideally performed by a collaboration of researchers and industry practitioners. The key contribution of these papers should be lessons learned from the application of known research tools and methods related to ISSRE topics, or new knowledge acquired through empirical studies performed according to various research methodologies. Negative results are welcome, e.g., discussing where or why current research cannot be applied in an industrially relevant context.
TAR papers should describe a new tool or artefact. Tool-focused TAR papers must present either a new tool or novel and substantial extensions to an existing tool. They should include a description of (i) the theoretical foundations, (ii) the design and implementation aspects, and (iii) experiments with realistic case studies. Making the tool publicly available is strongly encouraged. Artefact-focused TAR papers should cover (i) a working copy of the software and (ii) experimental data sets.
The ISSRE conference encourages authors of research papers to follow the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Authors are encouraged to disclose data to increase reproducibility and replicability. Should the paper be accepted, the authors will have the opportunity (and are encouraged to) submit artifacts to the Artifact Evaluation (AE) track, to enhance the reproducibility and quality of your research. By submitting your artifacts you not only contribute to the progress of our field but also stand a chance to earn badges that will be displayed on your papers in the conference proceedings showcasing the credibility and rigor of your work.
At least one author of every accepted paper is required to make a full author registration and present at the conference physically in São Paulo.
Special issues
Special issue Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to a special issue of the Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) journal. The Call for Paper will be available soon.

Software testing and formal methods
Software fault localization, debugging, root-cause analysis
Metrics, measurements and threat estimation for reliability prediction and the interplay with safety/security
Reliability of autonomous systems and (self-)adaptive systems
Reliability of AI-based systems, AI for Reliability Engineering
Reliability of Large Language/Foundational Model (LLM) and LLM for software reliability
Reliability of software services and Software as a Service (SaaS)
Reliability of model-based and auto-generated software
Reliability of open-source software
Reliability of software dealing with Big Data
Reliability of model-based and auto-generated software
Reliability of green and sustainable systems
Reliability of mobile systems
Reliability of software within specific technological spaces (e.g., Internet of Things, Cloud, Semantic Web/Web 3.0, Virtualization, Blockchain, networks softwarization, 5G/6G, edge-to-cloud computing)
Normative/regulatory/ethical spaces about software reliability
Societal aspects of software reliability
Anonymizing Rules
Authors shall anonymize their papers. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or acknowledgements). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, the names of case study subjects may be left un-anonymized, if the subject name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. In that case, they should avoid mentioning that a specific tool has been conceived and developed by them, as well as a paper that has been co-authored by them. The authors can provide the name of a case study subject software and the name of the entity developing it (private company or foundations); in case some of the authors are employees of the developing entity, the authors should not explicitly mention their affiliation but clarify potential threats to validity (e.g., familiarity with the subject), as appropriate.
Additionally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:
Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page
Remove acknowledgement of identifying names and funding sources
Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g.,Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments.
Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person just as you would any other piece of related work.
If you have a concurrent submission, reference it as follows:""Closely related work describes a microkernel implementation [Anonymous 2025].""with the corresponding citation:""[Anonymous 2025] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing.""
If you cite anonymous work, you must also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email.
It is within the authors to use a non-anonymized version of the submitted work to, e.g., discuss it with colleagues, give talks, and publish it at ArXiV, but, in doing so, the authors cannot mention that the work is under submission to ISSRE 2025.
Submissions that do not conform to the above submission deadline, anonymization and formatting guidelines (e.g., are too long, use fonts or line spacing smaller than what is indicated) or are unoriginal, previously published, or under submission to multiple venues, will be disregarded.
Formatting Rules
Submissions must adhere to theIEEE Computer Society Format Guidelinesas implemented by the following LaTeX/Word templates:
LaTex Package(ZIP)
Word Template(DOCX)
Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file. All fonts must be embedded. We also strongly recommend you print the file and review it for integrity (fonts, symbols, equations etc.) before submitting it. A defective printing of your paper can undermine its chance of success. Please take a note of the following:
Submissions should be anonymous.
The first page must include the title of the paper and a maximum 200-word abstract.
Please take into account that the abstract will be used by the reviewers to bid on papers. Thus, describe the paper goals clearly, as well as the means used to achieve them.
The first page is not a separate page, but is a part of the paper (i.e., it has technical material in it). Thus, this page counts toward the total page budget for the paper.
The use of color for figures and graphs is allowed only if the paper turns out to be readable if printed in grayscale.
Symbols and labels used in the graphs should be readable as printed, without requiring on-screen magnification.
Try to limit the file size to less than 15 MB.
Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and better understand their results.
Paper Submission
Papers are submitted via Easychair at the following URL:href=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=issre2025"" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=issre2025
Submissions will be reviewed by the program committee through a double-blind reviewing process, with a limited use of outside referees. Papers will be held in full confidence during the reviewing process, but papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be rejected without review.
Changes in the number and order of authors will not be allowed after the paper acceptance.
Authors must anonymize their submissions according to the guidelines given above. Submissions violating the formatting and anonymization rules will be desk rejected without review. There will be no extensions for reformatting.
Review Process and Author Response
After the papers have been reviewed, but before the Program Committee/Board meeting, the reviews will be made available to the authors to respond to any factual errors in the reviews. Rebuttals do not include additional information about the research or a submission of an updated or revised paper. Author responses will be made available to all PC/PB members before the paper is discussed for selection in the PC/PB meeting. The submissions website will include rebuttal guidelines.
***NEW IN 2025: Early Decisions***
To reduce the authors and reviewers burden of unnecessary writing/reading of authors responses, ISSRE 2025 is introducing early decisions:
If reviewers decide that a paper can be accepted in its current state without requiring any further input from the authors, the authors will receive an “Accept” decision at the beginning of the author response period and will not be required to submit a response.
If a paper is perceived to be in a highly deficient state by the reviewers, leading them to conclude that the authors’ response is unlikely to alter their evaluation, the authors will receive a “Reject” decision at the beginning of the author response period and will not be required to submit a response.
All other papers will receive a “Response Recommended” notification at the beginning of the author response period. As customary, it is still up to the authors to decide if they want to submit an author response.
This approach ensures that author responses are primarily reserved for cases with some controversy or where the reviewers have specific and pertinent inquiries to be addressed.
Best Research Paper Award
ISSRE is pleased to announce the Best Research Paper Award, attributed every year to the best paper in the Research Track.
Conference Proceedings
The conference proceedings will be published by IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services (CPS). Papers presented at the conference will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore and to all of the A&I (abstracting and indexing) partners (such as the EI Compendex).
IEEE Conference Publishing Policies
All submissions must adhere to IEEE Conference Publishing Policies <href=""https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/author-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-policies/"" - Submission Policies - IEEE Author Center Conferences>.
IEEE Cross Check
All submissions will be screened for plagiarized material through the IEEE Cross Check portal.

Initial Manuscript Submission
Initial Author Instructions - Full Paper Preparation, Technical Tracks, Special Session and Workshop Papers

Authors are invited to submit full regular papers (6-8 pages) of their work, reporting original research using the online submission system. The working language of the conference is English. Regular papers are typically 6-8 pages long, and are anyway limited to maximum eight (8) pages. Submissions of papers shorter than 5 pages may be automatically rejected.

The author must submit the draft version of the paper for review before the due submission deadline ( href=""https://etfa2025.ieee-ies.org/for_authors/index.html#important-dates"" - Important Dates ). Authors of accepted papers must submit the final paper version according to the deadline, register for the conference, and attend to present their paper(s). The maximum length for final papers is 8 pages without exceptions.

IEEE is strict about the requirements for PDF files for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. We strongly recommend to use the set of templates in MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE. Please use them to create your paper, without modifying the style or format under any circumstances. A4 page size is preferred, and letter size can also be used. To learn more about formatting of papers for IEEE IES conferences, please visit this page. We will be checking pdf compliance internally through our software.

Use of the IEEE PDF eXpress service will only be required and made available for the final version of accepted papers. This service allows you to transform your document from text editor to pdf format as well as checking the conformance of any pdf file to IEEE formatting rules. The number of attempts provided to each author is limited in number so reserve its use for the final version of your paper. When using this service the conference ID will need to be specified - the ETFA 2025 conference ID will be made public once the submission of final papers opens.

Please ensure that you submit only original work that has not been previously published or copyrighted. As a prospective author, you are expected to submit only your own original work. The Conference will be using the CrossCheck automated screening system to verify the originality of papers. Submitted works may be compared to over 20 million articles in databases worldwide. Papers that violate IEEE's publication principles may be summarily rejected. If the violation is deemed severe, disciplinary actions may also be taken by IEEE.

Initial Author Instructions - Work-In-Progress Papers, Technical Tracks and Special Session Papers

The submissions in the Work in Progress papers category describe research that have not yet produced the results required for a regular paper, but that due to its novelty and potential impact deserves to be shared with the community at an early stage. These submissions need to follow the guidelines for the regular and special session but limited to four (4) pages (total length including references).

WiP contributors are expected to give a short presentation of their work and to prepare a poster for the discussion forum that will take place after the presentations. More specifically, each WiP paper shall be presented by one of the authors in a very short oral presentation of 5 minutes, without any ensuing discussion, in its respective session.

Accepted and presented papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings and in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.

Submission System Instructions

In the case you are using the new IES submission system for the first time, you will need to register at the ConfComm Login page. After registering wait for the confirmation email and verify your email address. If you don't get the confirmation email or have some problem with your submission, please contact us.

In case you already have an account with the IEC submission system you can href=""https://confcomm.ieee-ies.org/app/general/conferences/ETFA25/initial-submission"" - submit a paper to ETFA2025 here .

When submitting papers in the submission system, please select the correct track:
TT01 ... TT11 – technical tracks (regular papers).
SS01 … SS12 – special sessions (regular papers)
WS01, WS02, WS03 – workshops based on solicited papers (regular papers)
WIP TT01 … WIP TT11 – technical tracks (work-in-progress papers)
WIP SS01 … WIP SS12 – special sessions (work-in-progress papers)

Papers are solicited for regular Technical Tracks and Special Session tracks both as Regular papers and Work in progress (WIP) papers. Workshops based on solicited papers are instead accepting only regular papers (no WiP submissions will be accepted).

Final Manuscript Submission
Preparation of the Camera Ready version of your paper - Technical Tracks, Special Session and Workshop Papers
1. Generate an IEEE Xplore compatible manuscript using PDF Xpress

All authors of accepted papers are required to submit their camera ready versions to the PDF Xpress tool prior to uploading into the system.

Create your IEEE PDF eXpress Account (https://ieee-pdf-express.org/).
Previous users: PDF eXpress should enter the same email address and password that was used for previous conferences, just specifying the ETFA 2025 Conference ID in the topmost field.
First time users: Please create a new account following the link for new users Create Account.
Please note that in order to access the service, you need to allow the use of cookies from the PDF eXpress web site.
You will be asked to create a password, and to insert the proper Conference ID
The Conference ID for IEEE ETFA 2025 is 65518X
Once you have succesfully logged in:
Go to the Dashboard (on the left menu)
Create a new title using the button on the main page
Follow the required steps, and upload your PDF file (containing your paper) for conversion.
Wait for the system validating your PDF file.
If everything is ok, you will soon receive by e-mail the IEEE Xplore-compatible PDF of your paper.
If the PDF submitted passed the check: If the PDF passed all checks and you are satisfied with your IEEE PDF eXpress-converted PDF, go to the next step.
If the PDF submitted fails the check: Read the PDF Check Report, then click “The PDF Check Report” in the sidebar to get information on possible solutions, or eventually Request Technical Help through your account.
Very often, PDF Xpress complaints about some fonts being not embedded in your PDF. There could be several options to embed all the fonts in your PDF, depending on the software you are using to produce your paper.
If you are using LaTeX, then you can use Ghostscript (typically included with the LaTeX installation) to post-process your PDF in this way:
In a Terminal window, go to the folder where your PDF is located
Use this commend to generate a PDF with all the fonts embedded:
gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dEmbedAllFonts=true -sOutputFile=output.pdf -f input.pdf
When you have tried your best to solve all the issues, you can try to upload the pdf again.
2. Upload your Xplore compatible PDF manuscript to ConfComm
Log in into the ConfComm submission system
In the menu on the left of your window, go down to ""Manusprits""
Click on the Manuscripts link, there you will find all the manuscripts you have submitted to ETFA 2025
Accepted papers are in the status ""initial_approved"", for each of this paper, you can click on the arrow on the right.
Click on the top right button Submit Final Version, and upload the PDF Xpress validated file
Complete the electronic copyright form via ConfComm. IEEE is enforcing strict copyright rules.
To access the copyright form, select the button ""Sign IEEE Copyright"" within your paper record, after the final PDF has been uploaded.
NO PAPER WILL BE PUBLISHED WITHOUT THE SUBMITTED COPYRIGHT FORM.
Contacting PDF eXpress Support

Initial Manuscript Submission
Initial Author Instructions - Full Paper Preparation, Technical Tracks, Special Session and Workshop Papers

Authors are invited to submit full regular papers (6-8 pages) of their work, reporting original research using the online submission system. The working language of the conference is English. Regular papers are typically 6-8 pages long, and are anyway limited to maximum eight (8) pages. Submissions of papers shorter than 5 pages may be automatically rejected.

The author must submit the draft version of the paper for review before the due submission deadline ( href=""https://etfa2025.ieee-ies.org/for_authors/index.html#important-dates"" - Important Dates ). Authors of accepted papers must submit the final paper version according to the deadline, register for the conference, and attend to present their paper(s). The maximum length for final papers is 8 pages without exceptions.

IEEE is strict about the requirements for PDF files for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. We strongly recommend to use the set of templates in MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE. Please use them to create your paper, without modifying the style or format under any circumstances. A4 page size is preferred, and letter size can also be used. To learn more about formatting of papers for IEEE IES conferences, please visit this page. We will be checking pdf compliance internally through our software.

Use of the IEEE PDF eXpress service will only be required and made available for the final version of accepted papers. This service allows you to transform your document from text editor to pdf format as well as checking the conformance of any pdf file to IEEE formatting rules. The number of attempts provided to each author is limited in number so reserve its use for the final version of your paper. When using this service the conference ID will need to be specified - the ETFA 2025 conference ID will be made public once the submission of final papers opens.

Please ensure that you submit only original work that has not been previously published or copyrighted. As a prospective author, you are expected to submit only your own original work. The Conference will be using the CrossCheck automated screening system to verify the originality of papers. Submitted works may be compared to over 20 million articles in databases worldwide. Papers that violate IEEE's publication principles may be summarily rejected. If the violation is deemed severe, disciplinary actions may also be taken by IEEE.

Initial Author Instructions - Work-In-Progress Papers, Technical Tracks and Special Session Papers

The submissions in the Work in Progress papers category describe research that have not yet produced the results required for a regular paper, but that due to its novelty and potential impact deserves to be shared with the community at an early stage. These submissions need to follow the guidelines for the regular and special session but limited to four (4) pages (total length including references).

WiP contributors are expected to give a short presentation of their work and to prepare a poster for the discussion forum that will take place after the presentations. More specifically, each WiP paper shall be presented by one of the authors in a very short oral presentation of 5 minutes, without any ensuing discussion, in its respective session.

Accepted and presented papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings and in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.

Submission System Instructions

In the case you are using the new IES submission system for the first time, you will need to register at the ConfComm Login page. After registering wait for the confirmation email and verify your email address. If you don't get the confirmation email or have some problem with your submission, please contact us.

In case you already have an account with the IEC submission system you can href=""https://confcomm.ieee-ies.org/app/general/conferences/ETFA25/initial-submission"" - submit a paper to ETFA2025 here .

When submitting papers in the submission system, please select the correct track:
TT01 ... TT11 – technical tracks (regular papers).
SS01 … SS12 – special sessions (regular papers)
WS01, WS02, WS03 – workshops based on solicited papers (regular papers)
WIP TT01 … WIP TT11 – technical tracks (work-in-progress papers)
WIP SS01 … WIP SS12 – special sessions (work-in-progress papers)

Papers are solicited for regular Technical Tracks and Special Session tracks both as Regular papers and Work in progress (WIP) papers. Workshops based on solicited papers are instead accepting only regular papers (no WiP submissions will be accepted).

Final Manuscript Submission
Preparation of the Camera Ready version of your paper - Technical Tracks, Special Session and Workshop Papers
1. Generate an IEEE Xplore compatible manuscript using PDF Xpress

All authors of accepted papers are required to submit their camera ready versions to the PDF Xpress tool prior to uploading into the system.

Create your IEEE PDF eXpress Account (https://ieee-pdf-express.org/).
Previous users: PDF eXpress should enter the same email address and password that was used for previous conferences, just specifying the ETFA 2025 Conference ID in the topmost field.
First time users: Please create a new account following the link for new users Create Account.
Please note that in order to access the service, you need to allow the use of cookies from the PDF eXpress web site.
You will be asked to create a password, and to insert the proper Conference ID
The Conference ID for IEEE ETFA 2025 is 65518X
Once you have succesfully logged in:
Go to the Dashboard (on the left menu)
Create a new title using the button on the main page
Follow the required steps, and upload your PDF file (containing your paper) for conversion.
Wait for the system validating your PDF file.
If everything is ok, you will soon receive by e-mail the IEEE Xplore-compatible PDF of your paper.
If the PDF submitted passed the check: If the PDF passed all checks and you are satisfied with your IEEE PDF eXpress-converted PDF, go to the next step.
If the PDF submitted fails the check: Read the PDF Check Report, then click “The PDF Check Report” in the sidebar to get information on possible solutions, or eventually Request Technical Help through your account.
Very often, PDF Xpress complaints about some fonts being not embedded in your PDF. There could be several options to embed all the fonts in your PDF, depending on the software you are using to produce your paper.
If you are using LaTeX, then you can use Ghostscript (typically included with the LaTeX installation) to post-process your PDF in this way:
In a Terminal window, go to the folder where your PDF is located
Use this commend to generate a PDF with all the fonts embedded:
gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dEmbedAllFonts=true -sOutputFile=output.pdf -f input.pdf
When you have tried your best to solve all the issues, you can try to upload the pdf again.
2. Upload your Xplore compatible PDF manuscript to ConfComm
Log in into the ConfComm submission system
In the menu on the left of your window, go down to ""Manusprits""
Click on the Manuscripts link, there you will find all the manuscripts you have submitted to ETFA 2025

ACM/IEEE Conference on
Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems
May 11-14, 2026 Saint-Malo, France
Co-located with CPS-IoT Week 2026

We are excited to announce the inaugural edition of the International Conference on Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems (SenSys).

The goal of this new conference# is to offer a single, top-ranked, flagship event for the research communities formerly revolving around SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI, as well as a focal point for other communities in related fields. The original three conferences, now merged into SenSys 2026, have driven innovation across multiple disciplines, including sensor networks, embedded systems, mobile computing, wireless communication, signal processing, data science, and AI-driven applications. Nevertheless, the continued and increasing relevance of intelligent sensing systems in academia and industry demands a unified, high-impact forum acting as a catalyzer for advancing research at the intersection of sensing systems and embedded artificial intelligence. The new conference, sponsored jointly by ACM and IEEE, addresses exactly this need. SenSys will provide a comprehensive platform where researchers and industry professionals from different areas can converge to present state-of-the-art research, exchange novel ideas, address key challenges, and ultimately shape the future of this continuously expanding and interdisciplinary field.

# Pending final approval by ACM and IEEE.

Double deadline

Thanks to the merging of several conferences, SenSys will transition to a new submission process with two deadlines.

Papers rejected in one cycle can be resubmitted to the next, but only with a strong statement justifying in detail how the revised version addresses the reviewers’ concerns. Resubmissions lacking this justification will be desk-rejected.

Submission Guidelines

Submitted papers must be original, unpublished work, and must not be under review for any other publication at the time of submission. Submissions must be at most 12 pages (full papers) or 6 pages (short papers), and must include all figures and tables within the page limits. References may use as many pages as needed. Both formats should be prepared on single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages, using a 9-point font size in a two-column layout. Submissions must follow either the LaTeX template (preferred) or Word style files provided here. LaTeX submissions should specifically use the acmart.cls template with the sigconf option.

Authors are expected to make a good-faith effort to anonymize their manuscripts. The presence of non-anonymous preprints (such as those on arXiv or similar repositories) will not result in rejection. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but incidentally discovering such materials will not violate the double-blind policy. Submissions that do not comply with the specified size, formatting, or anonymization guidelines will not be reviewed. All papers must be submitted in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) through the designated conference submission system.

For submissions that involve research with human participants, including those using anonymized data, authors must include a brief description of how ethical considerations were addressed and whether the work received approval from an ethics review board (e.g., IRB). All authors are expected to comply with the policies of their institutions regarding data collection and research involving human subjects.

Camera-Ready Manuscript Details

Accepted submissions will be available on the ACM digital library. Please note that ACM uses 9-pt fonts in all conference proceedings, and the templates in both LaTeX and Word implicitly define the font size to 9-pt. Please refer to the publication chair's earlier Note and the User Guide of the new class.
