 ACII 2025  

 The ACII 2025 organising committee is delighted to bring the ACII conference series to Australia for the first time. ACII 2025 will be an in-person event  held at the Hotel Realm conference venue in Canberra, Australia.   
 The ACII conference series – organized by the Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing ( AAAC , formerly known as Humaine) – is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognise, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena.  
 The theme for ACII 2025 is Socially Responsible Affective Computing   .  
 The main conference days will be on 8-10 Oct 2025, while workshops and tutorials will be held on Saturday, 11 Oct 2025. This ‘reverse’ conference schedule for  ACII 2025 will allow for maximum flexibility for attendees who also want to attend the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (  href=""https://icmi.acm.org/2025/"" - ICMI 2025
, 13-17 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling to combine two excellent conferences in one trip. While the organising committees of ACII 2025 and ICMI 2025 are separate, the teams work closely together and investigate registration options that will allow for different combinations of attending the two conferences for those who cannot attend both conferences in full. Further details will be provided in due time. (Sunday, 12 Oct 2025 will be a rest and recovery day for those attending both conferences.)

 Call for Papers   
 The Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC) invites you to submit your original research for presentation at the 13th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), which will be held as an in-person event  in Canberra, Australia, 8-11 October 2025. Accepted papers must be presented by one of the paper’s authors.    
 ACII 2025 will be held just before the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction ( href=""https://icmi.acm.org/2025/"" - ICMI 2025
, 13-17 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling the attendees to combine two excellent conferences in one trip.   
 The ACII conference series is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognise, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena. All accepted papers will be included in IEEE Xplore (subject to approval by the IEEE Computer Society) and indexed by EI. A selection of the best articles at ACII 2025 will be invited to submit extended versions to the IEEE   Transactions on Affective Computing   .   
 The theme for ACII 2025 is Socially Responsible Affective Computing  . Affective computing, with its ability to recognise and respond to human emotions, holds great potential for enhancing user experiences and fostering more natural interactions between humans and machines. It also has promising applications in fields such as mental health, where this technology can assist psychologists and other clinicians in making more accurate diagnoses by detecting mental states. However, this powerful technology also raises significant ethical concerns that must be addressed to ensure its responsible and transparent use.   
 One of the primary challenges is the potential misuse or exploitation of sensitive emotional data, including for manipulative or discriminatory purposes. Ensuring robust data privacy, clear ethical guidelines, and regulations around the use of emotional data is crucial. Additionally, the lack of transparency of many affective computing algorithms, systems build on limited data, and the potential for biases in emotion inference systems pose risks of perpetuating harmful stereotypes or inaccurate assessments based on factors such as gender, race, or cultural background. Transparency, accountability, and mitigating biases in these systems are essential to build trust with users.   
 Recognising these concerns, regulatory efforts such as the EU AI Act aim to establish legal frameworks and stringent requirements for high-risk AI applications, including those related to emotional state detection, ultimately safeguarding individual rights and upholding ethical principles in the development and deployment of affective computing technologies. A stronger focus needs to be placed on these matters by the affective computing research community.   
 The ACII 2025 (8-11 Oct 2025) and ICMI 2025 (13-17 Oct 2025) conferences will be held in back-to-back mode at the same venue in Canberra, Australia – one trip, two great conferences!

  Second Cycle: | href=""https://wisec25-cycle2.hotcrp.com"" - HotCRP submission site for Cycle 2 
  Only PDF files will be accepted. Submissions must be prepared using the following ACM proceedings template and must use US Letter page size (215.9 x 279.4 mm / 8.5 x 11 inches):  
 The ACM proceedings template for LaTeX can be found at | Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - SIG Proceedings Template | . 
  Please look at | ACM Primary Article Template | for further information on ACM proceedings templates. 
  Full, short, and SoK papers  
 Full paper submissions must be at most 10 pages in double-column ACM format (use document option “sigconf”), excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for double-blind review.  
 Detailed submission instructions will be made available as the deadline approaches.  
 In addition to regular papers that present novel contributions in the field, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 15 pages overall. They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  
 Posters and demos  
 WiSec will solicit the submission of posters and demos. The instructions to submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  
 Artifact Evaluation label  
 In the spirit of open science, WiSec encourages authors of accepted papers to make software and data artifacts publicly available to the community.  
 Such artifacts will be evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee and corresponding papers will be granted an artifact evaluation label. While artifacts are optional, their availability will be positively considered during paper evaluation. Should the authors choose to submit their artifacts for evaluation, they should indicate their decision upon paper submission and follow the artifact submission guidelines in order to submit them upon paper acceptance. The detailed guidelines will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  
 Double submissions  
 It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions, where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved. Technical reports and pre-prints published online are allowed.  
 Workshops and Tutorial  
 ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorials that are co-organized with the main conference. Details will be made available on the website.  
 Research Ethics  
 The ethical conduct of research is critical to ensuring the public’s trust and support of science. All submitted papers will be reviewed for ethical concerns, and if ethical practices are not followed a paper will be rejected regardless of any other merit. Ethical concerns vary from project to project, so there is no “one size fits all” approach. Rather, researchers should consider ethical analysis to be an integral part of the research, just as evaluation and method design are. Ethics should be considered early in a project, during a project, and as the project is prepared for publication.  
 While every situation is unique, there are principles that researchers should consider and apply during their projects. The Menlo Report provides guidance and examples for network security. Principally, all research should embody the concepts of beneficence, justice, respect for persons, and respect of law and public interest. This is just as true for technical research as human subjects research. For example, if it is possible that a research method could cause harm to systems or users (e.g., testing jamming) researchers should explicitly detail the measures taken to prevent harm.  
 Research ethics is also paramount in any study that could be classified as “human subjects.” For WiSec, “human subject research” is defined as “research that involves interaction with identifiable humans or analysis of datasets containing data from one or more identifiable living humans.” Researchers are expected to follow the laws and common practices regarding human subjects review of their relevant jurisdictions and institutions. For example, researchers in the United States must undergo review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before beginning human subjects research. Authors doing human subjects research should mention the review standards in their jurisdictions and if they were met.  
 Computer security and privacy research often studies and even advanced tools and techniques with the capacity to harm others. In their submission, authors must convince reviewers that appropriate steps were taken to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to appropriate parties  
 Policy for Peer-Review Integrity  
 All SIGSAC-sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities ( https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment ) and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ( https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) . Also, all authors, PC members, and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc) . Particularly, we require all reviewers to uphold the integrity of the peer review process and avoid conflict of interest of any form (e.g., reviewer collusion ring). Those who violate these policies will be penalized according to ACM policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/penalties-for-publication-violations) . If you would like to report a violation, please contact program chairs of your conferences/workshops or SIGSAC officers. We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your communication.

 Welcome to the 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia!  

 Welcome to ACM Multimedia, the premier international conference dedicated to advancing research and applications across diverse multimedia fields. This conference brings together leading minds from academia and industry to explore cutting-edge developments in areas such as video, haptics, virtual and augmented reality, audio, speech, music, sensor, and social data. With a strong focus on integrating and exchanging information across modalities, ACM Multimedia encourages innovative approaches that have the potential for significant technological breakthroughs and positive real-world impacts. As a community with a rich tradition of leveraging AI and systems research to handle big data and enhance user experiences, we also place a unique emphasis on novel applications and addressing urgent industrial challenges. The conference warmly welcomes new intellectual perspectives and submissions from a wide range of related disciplines, including artificial intelligence, 3D & metaverse, vision and languages, human-computer interaction, and multimedia signal processing. We are particularly excited to see contributions that push the boundaries of multimedia in fields such as healthcare, education, and entertainment. Join us as we explore the future of multimedia innovation through the lens of four major conference themes, and help shape the next generation of groundbreaking multimedia technologies.   
 This year, ACM Multimedia 2025 will be held in Dublin, Ireland, and will be colocated with both CBMI 2025 and MediaEval 2025, both of which immediately precede the conference. At ACM Multimedia 2025, we expect to welcome you all to Dublin for an extensive in-person program consisting of technical sessions covering all aspects of the multimedia field via oral, video and poster presentations, tutorials, panels, exhibits, demonstrations, workshops, doctoral symposium, multimedia grand challenge, brave new ideas on shaping the research landscape, and open source software competition. Welcome to Dublin.

 Call for Regular Papers  
  
 ACM Multimedia is the premier conference in multimedia, a research field that discusses emerging computing methods from a perspective in which each medium — e.g. images, text, audio — is a strong component of the complete, integrated exchange of information. The multimedia community has a tradition of being able to handle big data, has been a pioneer in large-scale evaluations and dataset creations, and is uniquely angled towards novel applications and cutting-edge industrial challenges. As such the conference openly embraces new intellectual angles from both industry as well as academia and welcomes submissions from related fields, such as data science, HCI, and signal processing.  
 ACM Multimedia 2025 calls for research papers presenting novel theoretical and algorithmic solutions to address problems across multimedia and related application fields. The conference also calls for papers presenting novel, thought-provoking ideas, and promising (preliminary) results in realising these ideas, especially surrounding multimodal AI, such as multi-agent, real-time human and machine intelligence working collaboratively. The conference invites papers in five major themes of multimedia: Generative AI, Engagement, Experience, Systems and Understanding, as described href=""https://acmmm2025.org/research-topics/"" - here
.  
 The conference invites research papers of varying lengths from 6 to 8 pages, plus additional pages for the reference pages; i.e., the reference page(s) are not counted towards the page limit of 6 to 8 pages. Please note that there is no longer a distinction between long and short papers, but the authors may themselves decide on the appropriate length of the paper. All papers will undergo the same review process and review period.  
  
 Submission Deadlines  
 Abstract submission: 04.04.2025  
 Regular paper submission: 11.04.2025 (including supplementary materials, if applicable)   
 Please note: The submission deadline is at 23:59 of the stated deadline date Anywhere on Earth. See the full list of  href=""https://acmmm2025.org/important-dates/"" - Important Dates
 .  
  
 Submission Instructions  
 Submit your href=""https://openreview.net/group?id=acmmm.org/ACMMM/2025/Conference"" - Regular Paper via OpenReview
.  
 Submission system:    
 ACM MM’25 uses OpenReview for paper submission and peer review. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.   
 All listed authors must have an up-to-date  OpenReview profile. The following page contains information on  how to create   an OpenReview profile. Note OpenReview’s moderation policy for newly created profiles:   
 New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks. 
  New profiles created with an institutional email will (normally) be activated automatically. 
  The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflicts of interest and paper matching. An incomplete OpenReview profile of any co-author is sufficient ground for desk rejection.   
 To be considered complete, each author profile must be properly attributed with the following mandatory fields: current and past institutional affiliation (going back at least 5 years), homepage, DBLP (if there is prior publication), ORCID, Advisors and Recent Publications (if any). In addition, other fields such as Google Scholar, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar, Advisees and Other Relations should be entered wherever applicable.   
 Please note that we may ask any author to also serve as a reviewer. Authors who are also serving as reviewers will not be able to see the reviews on their own paper until they complete the reviews assigned to them in a proper and timely manner.   
 For any question or inquiry, please contact <  href=""mailto:tpc@acmmm2025.org"" - tpc@acmmm2025.org
>   
  
 Multimedia/multimodality Policy for Paper Submissions  
 As the volume of submissions to the MM conference continues to grow annually, the SIGMM community seeks to distinguish itself from other communities such as NeurIPS, CVPR, and ECCV. Our focus lies in promoting research that is inherently multimedia or multimodal in nature. While papers that involve unimedia/unimodal processing will not necessarily be rejected, papers that make multimedia/multimodal research contributions will be preferred for publication in the conference proceedings. Out-of-scope submissions may be desk-rejected.   
   
 Paper Format  
 Submitted papers (.pdf format) must use the ACM Article Template (  https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template ). Please remember to add Concepts and Keywords. Please use the template in traditional double-column format to prepare your submissions. For example, word users should use Word Interim Template, and LaTeX users should use sample-sigconf-authordraft template. When using sample-sigconf-authordraft template, for submission and review of manuscript you could use the following documentclass command instead of the example provided in the template:   \documentclass[sigconf, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart}   
  Please ensure that you submit your papers subscribing to this format for full consideration during the review process.   
  
 Policy on Authorship and Generative AI Tools  
 Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. If generative AI language tools generate inappropriate language, plagiarized content, errors, mistakes, incorrect references, or misleading content, and that output is included in scientific works, author(s) will take full responsibility for the same. For details and more polices, please see here.  
  
 Length  
 Submitted papers may consist of up to 8 pages. Up to two additional pages may be added for references. The reference pages must only contain references. Overlength papers will be rejected without review. Optionally, you may upload supplementary material that complements your submission (50Mb limit).  
  All the content other than that in the main paper should be written in the separate supplementary material. We do not allow appendix that follow right after the main paper in the main submission file.  
  
 Blinding  
 Paper submissions must conform with the “double-blind” review policy. This means that the authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the names of the authors. Please prepare your paper in a way that preserves anonymity of the authors. For reviewer assignment, the technical program chairs may employ local LLM instances or similar technologies to process your submissions. No information will be shared with third parties.   
 Do not put the authors’ names under the title. 
  Avoid using phrases such as “our previous work” when referring to earlier publications by the authors. 
  Remove information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs). 
  Check supplemental material (e.g., titles in the video clips, or supplementary documents) for information that may identify the authors’ identities. 
  Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. 
  Papers without appropriate blinding will be rejected without review. 
   
 Originality  
 Papers submitted to ACM Multimedia must be the original work of the authors. The may not be simultaneously under review elsewhere. Publications that have been peer-reviewed and have appeared at other conferences or workshops may not be submitted to ACM Multimedia (see also the arXiv/Archive policy below). Authors should be aware that ACM has a strict policy with regard to plagiarism and self-plagiarism (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism). The authors’ prior work must be cited appropriately.  
  
 Author List  
 Please ensure that you submit your papers with the full and final list of authors in the correct order. The author list registered for each submission is not allowed to change in any way after the full paper submission deadline. (Note that this rule regards the identity of authors, e.g., typos are correctable.)  
  
 Paper Title  
 As per MM Policy, paper titles should remain the same between the camera-ready version and submission.  
  
 Proofreading  
 Please proofread your submission carefully. It is essential that the language used in the paper is clear and correct so that it is easily understandable. (Either US English or UK English spelling conventions are acceptable.)  
  
 ArXiv/Archive Policy  
 In accordance with ACM guidelines, all SIGMM-sponsored conferences adhere to the following policy regarding arXiv papers:  
 We define a publication as a written piece documenting scientific work that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, has been accepted.  Documentation of scientific work that is published in a not-for-profit archive without any form of peer-review (departmental Technical Report, arXiv.org, etc.) is not considered a publication.  However, this definition of publication does include peer-reviewed workshop papers, even if they do not appear in formal proceedings. Any submission to ACM Multimedia must not have substantial overlap with prior publications or other work currently undergoing peer review anywhere.  Note that documents published on website archives are subject to change. Citing such documents is discouraged. Furthermore, ACM Multimedia will review the documents formally submitted and any additional information in a web archive version will not affect the review.   
   
 Rebuttal Policies  
 After receiving the reviews, the authors may optionally submit a rebuttal to address the reviewers’ comments. The rebuttal is limited to a One page PDF file using the rebuttal template. Responses longer than one page will simply not be reviewed. This includes responses where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those specified by the style guide (deleting the title to get some space is acceptable).  
  The rebuttal must maintain anonymity. It cannot include links to external material such as code, videos, etc.  
  Authors may optionally contact the Author’s Advocate, whose role is to listen to the authors, and to help them if reviews are clearly below average quality. The Author’s Advocate operates independently from the Technical Program Committee.

 Update to the AIAI Community from the Organisers  
 Dear Colleagues,  
 On behalf of the 21 st  AIAI (Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations) 2025 Organizing and Scientific Committee, it is a real honor and pleasure to welcome all Artificial Intelligence scholars who are looking for a well-established and prestigious forum to communicate and disseminate the innovative advances of their research. It is a fact that AI is continuously digging its way in a vast number of diverse scientific domains. AIAI aims to provide a forum for delegates from both academia and industry, who wish to share pioneer ideas, to get to know each other better and to present their research. Moreover, it aims to offer a deep glimpse into the future and to examine important AI ethical aspects.  
 The Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations  (AIAI) Conference has been held continuously since 2005, under the auspices of the IFIP WG12.5. Through the years, it has evolved to a well-respected and mature event, under the technical and scientific co-sponsorship of the AIAI community. This community comprises of an extended Group of leading scientists, not only from Europe but from all over the globe.  
 The h-index of the AIAI event is as high as 39  . This proves the novelty and quality of the presented-published research and its important contribution to the promotion of scientific ideas, algorithms and methods, globally. The fact that the conference Springer Proceedings, have been downloaded more than 2,800,000  times so far, supports the robust impact of the event among the scholars of AI internationally.. href=""https://ifipaiai.org/2025/message-of-the-organizers/"" - …[read more]

 Conference overview  
 The href=""http://adbis.eu/"" - ADBIS
series of conferences provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and promotes interaction and collaboration among the database, information systems, data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning communities from European countries and the rest of the world. ADBIS conferences have provided an international platform for researchers and developers to present and discuss cutting-edge results on database theory, data management and information technologies, data engineering, analytics and visualization, and their advanced applications. ADBIS 2025 will consist of regular sessions with technical contributions reviewed and selected by an international program committee, as well as invited keynote and tutorial talks presented by leading scientists.  
 DEI Disclaimer

  Paper Submission  
 ADBIS 2025 invites original papers (not submitted elsewhere in parallel) describing results that broadly belong to the aforementioned list of topics. Accepted long papers will be published in a Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volume and accepted short papers are published in Springer's Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) series. The program committee may decide to accept a submission as a short paper if it reports interesting results but does not justify publication of a full paper.  
 LONG papers can be:   
 Regular research papers, reporting novel, solid research findings within the scope of the conference, typically but not exclusively found in proposing new models, querying or data handling methods, algorithms, data structures, and system architectures for the management of data. 
  Experimental re-evaluation papers, assessing previously published research results in terms of (i) performance evaluation for algorithms and systems, or, (ii) assessment of the application for methodologies, with the contribution of the paper being found (i) in the evaluation findings and (ii) in the discussion of strong and weak aspects of the algorithm/system/method being assessed. 
  SHORT papers can be:   
 Early findings/work-in-progress reports for prompt dissemination and discussion of early research results, that include early experimental findings and implementations, with an emphasis on (i) the description of the early findings, (ii) the possibilities they present, and, (iii) the difficulties being faced towards full fruition. 
  Vision papers, discussing possibilities and challenges in the exploration of radically new system architectures or methodologies for data management in important areas related to the scope of the conference, or areas that are currently considered outside the scope of the conference but hold the potential of becoming relevant. 
  Submission Guidelines  
 The page limits are as follows:  
 LONG (research or experimental) papers: 16 LNCS style pages, including references 
  SHORT (early findings or visionary) papers: up to 10 LNCS style pages, including references 
  Papers should be submitted in PDF format using the CMT  online submission system at: href=""https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADBIS2025"" - https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADBIS2025
.  
 Authors should consult href=""https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines"" - Springer’s authors’ guidelines
and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Licence-to-Publish agreement. The corresponding author, who must match the corresponding author marked on the paper, must have the full right, power, and authority to sign the agreement on behalf of all of the authors of a particular paper, and accepts responsibility for releasing this material on their behalf. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. An author of an accepted paper must register to ADBIS 2025 in order to have the paper published, and accepted papers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors.  
 Shepherding  
 Borderline papers will go through a shepherding phase where they will be expected to address the concerns of the reviewers, expressed as a list of required revisions. Failing to properly address them in due time will entail final rejection. The shepherding process will involve: authors will be given a list of issues/improvements that have to be addressed within 3 weeks’ time; authors improve the paper addressing these concerns; authors submit the revised paper in camera-ready format; the PC chairs ultimately decide whether the revised paper is acceptable as is or not to the final program.  
 Shepherding Schedule  
 The schedule for shepherding is as follows (All deadlines are 11:59 PM AoE):  
 Notification of shepherding status: | June 4, 2025 
  Authors submit revised, camera-ready version: | June 24, 2024 
  Notification of acceptance for shepherded papers: | July 1, 2024 
  Camera-ready documents and copyright: | July 15, 2024 
  Awards  
 Springer will sponsor the ADBIS 2025 Best Paper Award, Best PhD Symposium Paper Award, Best Demonstration and Best Short Paper, which will be announced during the ADBIS 2025 Banquet.  
 Special Issue  
 The best papers of the conference will be invited to submit an extended and revised version of their paper to a special issue in the Information Systems journal of Elsevier ( https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-systems ).  
 Inclusion and Diversity in Writing and Presentation  
 Authors are strongly encouraged to be inclusive in writing and presentation of their work.  
  Please visit the subsection ""D&I materials"" at https://dbdni.github.io/ for details.  
 Use of Generative AI  
 Authors should explicitly disclose the use of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in their manuscripts when these tools are employed for more than just editing the author’s text. This disclosure can be made through a statement placed at the end of the manuscript, preceding the References section.  
 If it comes to our notice that a submission utilized large language models (LLMs) without clear disclosure, such papers will be subject to immediate desk rejection. However, if there is no usage of such technologies, no disclosure statement is required.

  href=""https://acns25-cycle2.hotcrp.com/"" - PAPER SUBMISSION

  Instructions for Authors  
 Submissions must be done via the HotCRP website. The link will be announced shortly before the paper deadline.  
 ACNS 2025 will be an in-person  conference. Since remote presentations or videos will not be accepted, authors submitting a paper must ensure that one of the authors can present the paper at the conference in person.  
 Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published (other than preprint) or accepted for publication or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings. Information about submissions may be shared with program chairs of other conferences for that purpose.  
 ACNS encourages promising students to submit and present their results at the conference. ACNS gives a best student paper award, with a 1500 EUR prize sponsored by Springer, to encourage promising students to publish their best results at this venue. To be eligible, the paper must be co- authored by at least one full-time student who will present the paper at the conference.  
 Systematization of Knowledge   
 ACNS 2025 solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable to help our community to clarify and put into context complex research problems.  
 It is important to stress that SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research (like in a survey) but also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.  
 We encourage the authors to distinguish SoK submissions by adding the “SoK:” prefix to the title. SoK submissions will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, but they will be accepted based on their treatment of existing work and value to the community, and not based on any new research results they may contain. Accepted papers will be presented at the conference and included in the proceedings.  
  Submission Guidelines  
 Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. Each submission must begin with a title, short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non- specialist reader.  
 All submissions must be submitted in PDF format, following the unmodified LNCS format (accessible on the href=""https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines"" - Springer LCNS author guidelines
 webpage) and typeset using the corresponding LaTeX class file. They must fit within a page limit of 20 pages, including title and abstract, figures, etc., but excluding references. Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following the main body of the paper; however, reviewers are not required to read or review any supplementary material, and submissions are expected to be intelligible without it. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. To accommodate for changes requested in reviews, the page limit for the camera-ready proceedings versions is 30 pages, including references and appendices.  
 For papers that might raise ethical concerns, authors are expected to convince reviewers that proper procedures (such as Institutional Review Board approval) have been followed and due diligence has been made to minimize potential harm.  
 ACNS 2025 has two submission deadlines (in September and January) that authors may choose to submit their papers to. Papers rejected after the September round cannot be resubmitted at the January round.  
 We will publish our proceedings with Springer as a volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.  
  Conflicts of Interest  
 The program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and program committee members to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest. During the submission process, we will ask authors to identify members of the program committee with whom they share a conflict of interest.  
 We regard the following relationships as conflicts of interest:  
 1. Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission (including secondary affiliations and consulting work),  
 2. Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past,  
 3. Anyone the author has collaborated or published within the prior two years,  
 4. Anyone who is serving as the sponsor or administrator of a grant that funds your research, or  
 5. Close personal or family ties.  
 If authors want to specify a conflict of another type than those listed above, they must contact the chairs and explain the perceived conflict. Program committee members who are in a conflict of interest with a paper, including program co-chairs, will be excluded from the evaluation and discussion of the paper by default.  
  Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure (adapted from IEEE S&P)  
 Where research identifies a vulnerability (e.g., software vulnerabilities in a given program, design weaknesses in a hardware system, or any other kind of vulnerability in deployed systems), we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. In nearly every case, disclosing the vulnerability to vendors of affected systems, and other stakeholders, will help protect users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days  to 90 days  ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.  
 Longer disclosure windows (which may keep vulnerabilities from the public for extended periods of time) should only be considered in exceptional situations, e.g., if the affected parties have provided convincing evidence the vulnerabilities were previously unknown and the full rollout of mitigations requires additional time. The authors are encouraged to consult with the PC chairs in case of questions or concerns.  
 The version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities; but, consistent with the timelines above, the authors do not have to disclose vulnerabilities ahead of submission. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this policy applies to their submissions.  
  Diversity and Inclusion  
 ACNS is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our community. If you have suggestions, concerns, or complaints related to biases or sexual harassment, we encourage you to reach out to the Conference Co-Chairs. We are committed to protecting the anonymity of such reports and helping to address your concerns. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community.  
 We encourage authors to be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions.

 Jump to Detailed Instructions   

 Plagiarism & Use of ChatGPT or similar LLMs Policy  
 Plagiarism and the Use of ChatGPT or similar LLMs Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. Note that this policy does not prohibit authors from using LLMs for editing or polishing author-written text.  
 AAAI’2025 furthermore follows AAAI policy that any AI system, including Generative Models such as Chat-GPT, BARD, or DALL-E, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers published by AAAI and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in papers published by AAAI. Authors assume full responsibility for content, including checking for plagiarism and veracity of all text.  
 Any allegation of plagiarism, whether the result of the use of an LLM or otherwise, which comes to AAAI’s attention will be thoroughly investigated. If substantiated, the matter will be dealt with very seriously. Possible sanctions include rejection/retraction of the work, notification to all the authors’ institutions or employers and any other relevant bodies, and denial of service for and access to all AAAI-sponsored meetings.  
 Summary  
 Three technical tracks (Main Track; AI for Social Impact; AI Alignment) 
  Two-phase reviewing: two reviews in Phase 1, additional reviews in Phase 2 for papers not rejected in Phase 1. Author response after Phase 2, only for papers not rejected in Phase 1. 
  Three kinds of supplementary material may be submitted alongside all papers: (1) technical appendix; (2) multimedia; (3) code and data. Supplementary material deadline is 3 days after the paper submission deadline. 
  Additional pages for references only. 
  All authors must complete a reproducibility checklist, which facilitates replication of the reported research. 
  All authors are expected to be available to review (light load), unless extenuating circumstances apply. 
  Note that the NeurIPS fast track from previous years will not be included this year. The submission deadline is after NeurIPS initial reviews are released, and authors must withdraw the paper from consideration at NeurIPS if they wish to submit to AAAI. 
  The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines. AAAI-25 is the Thirty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence. As with AAAI-24, the theme of this conference is to create collaborative bridges  within and beyond AI. In addition to the bridge theme, we emphasize the importance of AI for social impact and responsible AI. Like AAAI 2024 conference, AAAI-25 will feature technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibition programs, and two other activities: a Bridge Program and a Lab Program. Many of these activities are tailored to the theme of bridges and are selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers.  
 AAAI-25 is an in-person conference.  
 Timetable for Authors  
 Please see the timetable in the sidebar .  
 ​Collaborative Bridge Theme  
 Driven by its disciplinary diversity, AAAI has incubated numerous AI sub-disciplines and conferences and has nurtured for decades the cohesion of AI. New communities often emerge when two or more disciplines come together in order to explore new opportunities and perspectives; today, both are plentiful. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program is to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating collaboration between two or more communities directed towards a common goal. Our interpretation of bridges is broad and encompasses disciplines within and outside of AI. Hence, the communities that our Bridge Program is intended to bring together could be distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities.  
 Topics  
 AAAI-25 welcomes submissions reporting research that advances artificial intelligence, broadly conceived. The conference scope includes machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, multiagent systems, knowledge representation, human-in-the-loop AI, search, planning, reasoning, robotics and perception, and ethics. In addition to fundamental work focused on any one of these areas, we expressly encourage work that cuts across","{

 Thank you for joining us at our 40th anniversary!  
 See you back in Hawaii December 8-12, 2025  
   
 The Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC)  brings together leading researchers and practitioners, along with a diverse group of security professionals drawn from academia, industry, and government, gathered to present and discuss the latest cybersecurity results and topics. With peer reviewed technical papers, invited talks, panels, national interest discussions, and workshops, ACSAC continues its core mission of investigating practical solutions for computer and network security technologies.  
 This year, we will celebrate ACSAC's 40th edition. ACSAC's first edition was held in 1985 and is now one of the oldest computer security conferences, second only to the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy. We invite you to join us for this special anniversary, which will be held near the infamous Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii!  
 As an internationally recognized forum where researchers, practitioners, and developers meet to learn and to exchange practical ideas and experiences in computer and network security, we invite you to submit your work. In addition to peer-reviewed papers on novel applied research, we also welcome case studies on real-world applications, panels featuring world experts, and workshops consisting of 1-2 day sessions on hot cybersecurity and privacy topics.

 Hard Topic Theme: Security Applications of Generative AI   
 This year's hard topic theme solicits research results and technologies that advance our understanding of the applicability of Generative AI and Large Language Models to computer security. These transformative new technologies can have a significant impact in addressing traditional security problems, such as vulnerability detection, fraud detection, reverse engineering, threat intelligence, and many others. At the same time, the complexity of these systems also exposes new potential vulnerabilities that are still not well understood by the research community.

 ** New this year **  Reproduction and Replication (R+R) Papers:  Security research is often criticized for the poor reproducibility of its results, a situation we aim to address through artifact evaluation. At the same time, reproduction and replication studies are often undervalued in academic publishing. Thus, in addition to regular papers and artifact evaluations, this year we are also soliciting studies that confirm, question, or clarify the results of previous research. These papers must contain the prefix “R+R:” in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.  
 We encourage submissions to follow the ACM guidelines on reproducibility (different team, same experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-use) and replicability (different team, different experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-implementation). Note, however, that submissions need to go beyond re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper(s) or re-implementing their approach. We are looking for submissions that not only replicate existing studies but also critically assess, clarify and extend their findings and limitations. This includes, but is not limited to, the verification of existing research results, ensuring their validity and reliability across different contexts, lessons learned when applying research results in real-world (industry) settings, and the adaption of artifacts to contemporary cybersecurity challenges.  
 Reproduction and replication papers will be held to the same scientific standards as original technical papers, will be reviewed by the full program committee, will appear in the proceedings, and will be presented at the conference as part of the technical program. We also particularly encourage these types of papers to provide their artifacts.  
 Review Process:  Paper submissions will be judged based on novelty, relevance to the conference topics, technical correctness, quality of the evaluation, and presentation clarity. Papers will undergo a double-blind review process in two rounds. At the end of Round 1, papers for which a strong consensus towards rejection is reached will be notified of the early rejection decision, giving them the opportunity to improve their paper based on the reviewers’ feedback and to resubmit to other venues. Papers that advance to Round 2 will be assigned additional reviewers. At the end of Round 2, the authors of papers that advanced to this stage will have an opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and comments. After the authors' response period, the papers will be further discussed by the Program Committee (PC) to reach a final decision.  
 Three outcomes are possible: Accepted, Minor Revision, and Rejected. The Minor Revision decision is reserved to papers that can be considered as conditionally accepted, assuming improvements required by the reviewers are made within the available revision time window and are approved by the PC. A PC member will be assigned as shepherd for Minor Revision papers, to guide the authors through the revision process and to lead the discussion on the revised paper among the reviewers. The revision requirements may include both presentation improvements and additional experiments that the PC believes are necessary to significantly improve the paper and that should be feasible within a limited time frame. While Minor Revision papers that do not meet the required changes may be rejected, the expectation is that most papers will be able to satisfy the required improvements and be finally accepted into the conference program. Both the author's responses and the discussions around revision requirements for Minor Revision papers will be handled anonymously, via the paper submission system.  
 Paper Artifacts:  Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to submit their software and data artifacts for formal evaluation by the Artifacts Evaluation Committee and to make them publicly available to the entire community. During submission, authors of papers whose main contributions and experimental results rely primarily on new or reproduced artifacts (e.g., code and/or data) should indicate whether they will separately submit their artifacts for evaluation, if their paper is accepted. This acknowledgement will be visible to the reviewers and may therefore be taken into consideration during the review process. Authors who have justifiable reasons to not submit their artifacts for evaluation (in case their paper is accepted) should add a comment in the corresponding comment box in the submission form. Additionally, during paper submission authors can optionally provide a URL pointing to a repository containing their paper artifacts. While artifacts will be formally evaluated only if the paper is accepted, as explained above, reviewers may also take into account the availability and quality of the paper artifacts during the main paper review process, before making a final decision (please refer to the paper submission form for additional details).  
 Important:  When preparing the artifacts repository for inclusion in the paper submission form, please take extra care to not include authors’ information in the repository or artifacts content, so as not to break the anonymity of the paper submission. Additional information and recommendations on anonymizing the artifacts repository can be found here .  
 Ethical Considerations:  Papers that might raise ethical concerns (e.g., papers that use human subjects, leverage potentially sensitive data, or describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems) must include an Ethical Considerations section that properly describes what procedures have been followed to minimize potential harm. Such papers should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties, whether an institutional ethics committee reviewed the research, or how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software/system vendors or owners before publication.  
 Paper Format:  Please ensure that your submission consists of a PDF file of no more than 10 double-column pages, excluding well-marked references and appendices limited to a maximum of 5 pages. The full PDF document must not exceed a total of 15 pages. Please note that PC members are not required to read the appendices and that page limits will be strictly enforced.  
 Papers must be appropriately anonymized to the dual anonymous review process. Author names and affiliations must not be included in the PDF submission. Authors can cite and refer to their own prior work, but must do so in the third person, as if it was written by someone else. In the rare case that citing previous work in the third person is not possible, please anonymize the reference and notify the Program Chairs.  
 Submission Process:  Submissions must be generated using the double-column ACM format (see template available at https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template ) using the [sigconf, anonymous]  options. Submissions should not use older ACM templates (e.g., sig-alternate). All papers must be submitted exclusively through the ACSAC 2024 paper submission system. Note that paper title and abstract registration is not necessary ahead of the paper submission.  
 All formatting guidelines and constraints (e.g., page limits and anonymity) will be strictly enforced. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

 ABZ 2025 – 11th International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods  

 Call for papers  
 The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.  
 The name ABZ goes back to the first conference in London in 2008, where the ASM, B and Z conference series were merged into a joint event. In the following years other formal methods were added, e.g. Alloy in 2010 (Orford, Canada), VDM in 2012 (Pisa, Italy), and TLA+ in 2014 (Toulouse, France). After the also successful 2016 conferences in Linz, Austria, and 2018 in Southampton, UK, it was decided to name the conference “ABZ: International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods”, to stress the openness for further state-based formal methods. We hope to continue many fruitful discussions between representatives of the individual methods in the past, which will bring us closer to the common goal of this research community: the creation of reliable and safe software and systems.  
 ABZ 2025 will have a main conference track, a case study track, a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops.

 Submission Process  
 Authors should consult href=""https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19242230/data/v11"" - Springer’s authors' guidelines
and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word , for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their href=""https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid"" - ORCIDs
in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.

The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) is an interdisciplinary conference that brings together researchers in machine learning, neuroscience, statistics, optimization, computer vision, natural language processing, life sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, and other adjacent fields. We invite submissions presenting new and original research on topics including but not limited to the following:
Applications (e.g., vision, language, speech and audio, Creative AI)
Deep learning (e.g., architectures, generative models, optimization for deep networks, foundation models, LLMs)
Evaluation (e.g., methodology, meta studies, replicability and validity, human-in-the-loop)
General machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, online, active, etc.)
Infrastructure (e.g., libraries, improved implementation and scalability, distributed solutions)
Machine learning for sciences (e.g. climate, health, life sciences, physics, social sciences)
Neuroscience and cognitive science (e.g., neural coding, brain-computer interfaces)
Optimization (e.g., convex and non-convex, stochastic, robust)
Probabilistic methods (e.g., variational inference, causal inference, Gaussian processes)
Reinforcement learning (e.g., decision and control, planning, hierarchical RL, robotics)
Social and economic aspects of machine learning (e.g., fairness, interpretability, human-AI interaction, privacy, safety, strategic behavior)
Theory (e.g., control theory, learning theory, algorithmic game theory)
Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, and so we welcome interdisciplinary submissions that do not fit neatly into existing categories. We also encourage in-depth analysis of existing methods that provide new insights in terms of their limitations or behaviour beyond the scope of the original work.
Authors are asked to confirm that their submissions accord with thehref=""https://neurips.cc/public/CodeOfConduct"" - NeurIPS code of conduct.

OpenReview
We are using OpenReview to manage submissions. The reviews and author responses will not be public initially (but may be made public later, see below). As in previous years, submissions under review will be visible only to their assigned program committee. We will not be soliciting comments from the general public during the reviewing process. Anyone who plans to submit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create (or update) their OpenReview profile by the full paper submission deadline. Your OpenReview profile can be edited by logging in and clicking on your name inhttps://openreview.net/. This takes you to a URL ""https://openreview.net/profile?id=~[Firstname]_[Lastname][n]"" where the last part is your profile name, e.g., ~Po-Yi_Lu1.
The OpenReview profiles must be up to date, with all publications by the authors, and their current affiliations. The easiest way to import publications is through DBLP but it is not required,see OpenReview FAQ. Submissions without the authors' updated OpenReview profiles will be desk rejected. The information entered in the profile is critical for ensuring thathref=""https://neurips.cc/public/guides/ConflictsOfInterest"" - conflicts of interestand reviewer matching are handled properly. Because of the rapid growth of NeurIPS, we request that all authors help with reviewing papers, if asked to do so. We need everyone's help in maintaining the high scientific quality of NeurIPS.
Please be aware that OpenReview has a moderation policy for newly created profiles: New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks. New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically. If you have any questions about the use of OpenReview, please refer to its FAQ: https://openreview.net/faq
Our OpenReview portal ishref=""https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference"" - https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference. Please note that submissions meant for the Datasets & Benchmarks papers should be submitted to a different OpenReview portal, as shownhref=""https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks"" - here. Papers will not be transferred between the main and the D&B track after the submission is closed.
Abstract Submission
There is a mandatory abstract submission deadline onMay 11, 2025, four days before full paper submissions are due. While it will be possible to edit the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline, submissions with ""placeholder"" abstracts that are rewritten for the full submission risk being removed without consideration. This includes titles and abstracts that either provide little or no semantic information (e.g., ""We provide a new semi-supervised learning method."") or describe a substantively different claimed contribution. After the abstract deadline, adding or removing authors is not allowed, but listed authors can potentially be reordered before the submission deadline.
Paper Formatting Instructions
All submissions must be in PDF format, and in a single PDF file include, in this suggested order:
The submitted paper content
Paper references
The NeurIPS paper checklist
The authors may optionally choose to include some or all of the technical appendices in the same PDF above. But those included parts cannot be changed after the full submission deadline.
The main text of a submitted paper is limited tonine content pages, including all figures and tables. Additional pages containing references, checklist, and the optional technical appendices do not count as content pages. If your submission is accepted, you will be allowed an additional content page for the camera-ready version. The maximum file size for a main paper submission is 50MB.
You must format your submission using thehref=""https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2025/Styles.zip"" - NeurIPS 2025 LaTeX style file, which includes a ""preprint"" option for non-anonymous preprints posted online. Submissions that violate the NeurIPS style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) or page limits may be rejected without further review. Papers may also be rejected without consideration of their merits if they fail to meet the submission requirements, as described in this document.
Paper Checklist
In order to improve the rigor and transparency of research submitted to and published at NeurIPS, authors are required to complete ahref=""https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist"" - paper checklist. The paper checklist is intended to help authors reflect on a wide variety of issues relating to responsible machine learning research, including reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. The checklist forms part of the paper submission, but does not count towards the page limit.
Technical Appendices and Supplementary Material
Technical appendices with additional results, figures, graphs and proofs may be submitted with the paper submission before the full submission deadline (see above), or as a separate PDF in the ZIP file below before the supplementary material deadline. There is no page limit for the technical appendices.
Supplementary material, such as data, or source code may also be submitted separately in a single ZIP file. The material should be created by the authors that directly supports the submission content. We encourage authors to upload their code specifically as part of their supplementary material in order to help reviewers assess the quality of the work. Checkhref=""/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy"" - the policyas well as code submissionhref=""https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code"" - guidelines and templatesfor further details.
Like main paper submissions, technical appendices and supplementary material must be anonymized. Looking at technical appendices and supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers. Authors may submit up to 100MB of technical appendices and supplementary material.
Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)
The NeurIPS policy for use of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be foundhref=""https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM"" - here. Authors are responsible for following it.
Double-blind Reviewing
All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. This policy applies to any supplementary or linked material as well, including code. If you are including links to any external material, it is your responsibility to guarantee anonymous browsing. Please do not include acknowledgments at submission time. If you need to cite one of your own papers, you should do so with adequate anonymization to preserve double-blind reviewing. For instance, write ""In the previous work of Smith et al. [1]…"" rather than ""In our previous work [1]..."". If you need to cite one of your own papers that is in submission to NeurIPS and not available as a non-anonymous preprint, then include a copy of the cited anonymized submission in the supplementary material and write ""Anonymous et al. [1] concurrently show..."". Any papers found to be violating this policy will be desk rejected.
Please note that a different policy applies to Datasets & Benchmarks papers, as shownhref=""https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks"" - here.
Ethics Review
Reviewers and ACs may flag submissions forhref=""https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines"" - ethics review. Flagged submissions will be sent to an ethics review committee for comments. Comments from ethics reviewers will be considered by the primary reviewers and AC as part of their deliberation. They will also be visible to authors, who will have an opportunity to respond. Ethics reviewers do not have the authority to reject papers, but in extreme cases papers may be rejected by the program chairs on ethical grounds, regardless of scientific quality or contribution.
Preprints
The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other online repositories, personal websites, social media) will not result in rejection. If you choose to use the NeurIPS style for the preprint version, you must use the ""preprint"" option rather than the ""final"" option. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Authors may submit anonymized work to NeurIPS that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv) without citing it. Note that public versions of the submission should not say ""Under review at NeurIPS"" or similar.
Dual Submissions
Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that the authors have previously published or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed venues with proceedings or journals may not be submitted to NeurIPS. Papers previously presented at workshops are permitted, so long as they did not appear in conference proceedings (e.g., CVPRW proceedings), a journal or a book. NeurIPS coordinates with other conferences to identify dual submissions. The NeurIPS policy on dual submissions applies for the entire duration of the reviewing process. Failure to cope with the dual submission policy is ground to desk rejection during any point of the reviewing and program building process. Slicing contributions too thinly is discouraged. The reviewing process will treat any other submission by an overlapping set of authors as prior work. If publishing one would render the other too incremental, both may be rejected.
Please note that dual submissions to both the main conference track and the Datasets & Benchmarks track will be desk rejected.
Anti-collusion
NeurIPS does not tolerate any collusion whereby authors secretly cooperate with reviewers, ACs or SACs to obtain favorable reviews. The penalty for collusion is immediate removal from the reviewing system, rejection of all papers under consideration, and/or sanctions to future NeurIPS.
If collusion is identified, the authors and reviewers involved will be notified, and be able to respond to the accusation. While their answers will be carefully taken into consideration, given the short time window to act, the PCs will deliberate and their decision will be final.
Identifying collusion can happen at any point during the review process, including but not limited to the bidding process and the rebuttal period.
Author Responses
Authors will have one week to view and respond to initial reviews. Author responses may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. Authors may not submit revisions of their paper or supplemental material, but may post their responses as a discussion in OpenReview. This is to reduce the burden on authors to have to revise their paper in a rush during the short rebuttal period.
After the initial response period, authors will be able to respond to any further reviewer/AC questions and comments by posting on the submission's forum page. The program chairs reserve the right to solicit additional reviews after the initial author response period. These reviews will become visible to the authors as they are added to OpenReview, and authors will have a chance to respond to them.
After the notification deadline, accepted and opted-in rejected papers will be made public and open for non-anonymous public commenting. Their anonymous reviews, meta-reviews, author responses and reviewer responses will also be made public. Authors of rejected papers will have two weeks after the notification deadline to opt in to make their deanonymized rejected papers public in OpenReview. These papers are not counted as NeurIPS publications and will be shown as rejected in OpenReview.
Publication of Accepted Submissions
Reviews, meta-reviews, and any discussion with the authors will be made public for accepted papers (but reviewer, area chair, and senior area chair identities will remain anonymous). Camera-ready papers will be due in advance of the conference. All camera-ready papers must include ahref=""https://neurips.cc/public/guides/FundingDisclosure"" - funding disclosure. We strongly encourage accompanying code and data to be submitted with accepted papers when appropriate, as per thehref=""https://neurips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy"" - code submission policy. Authors will be allowed to make minor changes for a short period of time after the conference.
Contemporaneous Work
For the purpose of the reviewing process, papers that appeared online after March 1st, 2025 will generally be considered ""contemporaneous"" in the sense that the submission will not be rejected on the basis of the comparison to contemporaneous work. Authors are still expected to cite and discuss contemporaneous work and perform empirical comparisons to the degree feasible. Any paper that influenced the submission is considered prior work and must be cited and discussed as such. Submissions that are very similar to contemporaneous work will undergo additional scrutiny to prevent cases of plagiarism and missing credit to prior work.
Plagiarism is prohibited by the NeurIPShref=""https://neurips.cc/public/CodeOfConduct"" - Code of Conduct.
Other Tracks
Similarly to earlier years, we will host multiple tracks, such as datasets and benchmarks, competitions, tutorials as well as workshops, in addition to the main track for which this call for papers is intended. See the conference homepage for updates and calls for participation in these tracks.
This year, the Datasets and Benchmarks track will share the exact same deadlines as the main conference program. DB submissions will also adhere to the main track's guidelines for formatting, supplementary materials, LLM use, ethics review, preprints, dual submissions, anti-collusion, author responses, and publication. Please refer to thehref=""https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks"" - Datasets and Benchmarks CFPfor details on the track specific requirements; otherwise, the main track's CFP applies.
This year, we introduce a new Position Paper track, with formatting requirements that are consistent to those for the main conference and shared policies on double-blind reviewing, etc. The Position track also has a “lay summary” requirement for papers that are accepted for publication. The deadlines for position papers are shifted slightly later compared to those of the main conference. Please refer to thehref=""/Conferences/2025/CallForPositionPapers"" - Position Papers CFPfor more details.
Experiments
As in past years, the program chairs will be measuring the quality and effectiveness of the review process via randomized controlled experiments. All experiments are independently reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). The program chairs and the Datasets and Benchmarks track chairs will decide whether the experiments are applicable to either or both of the tracks.
Financial Aid
Each paper may designate up to one (1) NeurIPS.cc account email address of a corresponding student author who confirms that they would need the support to attend the conference, and agrees to volunteer if they get selected. To be considered for Financial the student will also need to fill out the Financial Aid application when it becomes available.

ACM IMC 2025 in MadisonACM Internet Measurement Conference 2025
Madison, Wisconsin, USA
October 28-31, 2025
The 2025 Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a three-and-a-half day event focusing on Internet measurement and analysis. The conference is sponsored by ACM SIGCOMM. IMC 2025 is the 25th in ahref=""http://www.sigcomm.org/events/imc-conference"" - seriesof highly successful Internet Measurement Workshops and Conferences.
The ACM IMC 2025 conference will be held from October 28-31, 2025 in Madison, WI, USA.
Announcements
This is the first edition of IMC withtwo deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)and an optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines. The key goal of these novelties is (i) to further enhance the quality and timeliness of the papers we publish; (ii) provide more flexibility in submission timing, with guaranteed timeliness of reviews; (iii) allowing exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round); and allow researchers to spread out their submissions across the year and submit high quality work. We will test and tune this process this year and revisit based on the data and feedback collected.As these novelties will affect decisions and submissions please see thehref=""/imc/2025/cfp/"" - Call for Papers. Also note that papers rejected at IMC 2024 cannot be submitted to the November 21st, 2024 deadline.
2025-06-04: The inauguralhref=""/imc/2025/student-workshop"" - IMC 2025 Student Workshophas been announced. Please submit your abstracts by July 14.

ISSTA 2025
Welcome to the website of the ISSTA 2025 conference.
The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) is the leading research symposium on software testing and analysis, bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experience on how to analyze and test software systems.
2025 will mark the 34th edition of ISSTA!

Research Papers: Call for Papers
href=""https://conf.researchr.org/track/issta-2025/issta-2025-papers"" - View track page for all detailsWe invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental research on software testing and analysis.
ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions. The majority of submissions are expected to be “Research Papers”, but submissions that best fit the description of “Experience Papers” or “Replicability Studies” should be submitted as such. A good Experience Paper will include lessons learned or other wisdom synthesised for the community from the reported experience. Replicability Studies shall clearly describe their purpose and value beyond the original result.
NEW THIS YEAR: The conference proceedings will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE), Issue: ISSTA 2025.
href=""#research-papers"" - Research Papers
Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.
href=""#experience-papers"" - Experience Papers
Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience.
Replicability Studies
ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artefacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs. Particularly, replicability studies are encouraged to target techniques that previously were evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artefact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.
Replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): the measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artefacts which they develop completely independently. Moreover, it is generally also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:
Depth and breadth of experiments
Clarity of writing
Appropriateness of conclusions
Amount of useful, actionable insights
Availability of artefacts
We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artefacts the study is built on, and to submit those artefacts to the artefact evaluation. Artefacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.
Major Revisions
Papers submitted to the initial deadline may be accepted, rejected or may receive a chance to submit a major revision of the initial submission to the major revision deadline.
href=""#submission-guidelines"" - Submission Guidelines
Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to theACM Policyand Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.
At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates:LatexorWord (Mac)orWord (Windows). Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In sum, you want to use:
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}
Papers may use either numeric or author-year format for citations.It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review.
The page limit is strict, i.e., papers that take more than 18 pages for anything apart from references (including any section, figure, text, or appendix), will be desk-rejected. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission: “[TITLE](Experience Paper)”, “[TITLE](Replicability Study)”. Papers must be submitted electronically through thehref=""https://issta2025.hotcrp.com"" - ISSTA 2025 submission site.
Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and verifiability/transparency of the work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.
Double-anonymous Reviewing
ISSTA 2025 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission and may want to confirm that their generated PDF does not contain any meta-data with their names. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.
Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.
Open Science Policy and “Data Availability” Section
ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.
Upon submission, authors are asked to make their code, data, etc. available to the program committee (via upload of anonymized supplemental material or a link to an anonymized private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. At least one of the reviewers will check the provided data. While sharing the data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, it will inform the program committee’s decision. Furthermore, we ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named “Data Availability” after the Conclusion section.

Call for Papers information:
href=""#Call-for-Papers"" - Call for PapersCall for Papers
We invite high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental research on software testing and analysis.
ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions. The majority of submissions are expected to be “Research Papers”, but submissions that best fit the description of “Experience Papers” or “Replicability Studies” should be submitted as such. A good Experience Paper will include lessons learned or other wisdom synthesised for the community from the reported experience. Replicability Studies shall clearly describe their purpose and value beyond the original result.
NEW THIS YEAR: The conference proceedings will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE), Issue: ISSTA 2025.
href=""#research-papers"" - Research Papers
Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.
href=""#experience-papers"" - Experience Papers
Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience.
Replicability Studies
ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artefacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs. Particularly, replicability studies are encouraged to target techniques that previously were evaluated only on proprietary subject programs or inputs. A replicability study should clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. In the latter case, authors are encouraged to make an effort to communicate or collaborate with the original paper’s authors to determine the cause for any observed discrepancies and, if possible, address them (e.g., through minor implementation changes). We explicitly encourage authors to not focus on a single paper/artefact only, but instead to perform a comparative experiment of multiple related approaches.
Replicability studies should follow the ACM guidelines on replicability (different team, different experimental setup): the measurement can be obtained with stated precision by a different team, a different measuring system, in a different location on multiple trials. For computational experiments, this means that an independent group can obtain the same result using artefacts which they develop completely independently. Moreover, it is generally also insufficient to focus on reproducibility (i.e., different team, same experimental setup) alone. Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:
Depth and breadth of experiments
Clarity of writing
Appropriateness of conclusions
Amount of useful, actionable insights
Availability of artefacts
We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artefacts the study is built on, and to submit those artefacts to the artefact evaluation. Artefacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.
Major Revisions
Papers submitted to the initial deadline may be accepted, rejected or may receive a chance to submit a major revision of the initial submission to the major revision deadline.
href=""#submission-guidelines"" - Submission Guidelines
Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to theACM Policyand Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.
At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates:LatexorWord (Mac)orWord (Windows). Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In sum, you want to use:
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}
Papers may use either numeric or author-year format for citations.It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review.
The page limit is strict, i.e., papers that take more than 18 pages for anything apart from references (including any section, figure, text, or appendix), will be desk-rejected. Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission: “[TITLE](Experience Paper)”, “[TITLE](Replicability Study)”. Papers must be submitted electronically through thehref=""https://issta2025.hotcrp.com"" - ISSTA 2025 submission site.
Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation, quality of presentation, appropriate comparison to related work, and verifiability/transparency of the work. Some papers may have more than three reviews, as the PC chairs may solicit additional reviews based on factors such as reviewer expertise and strong disagreement between reviewers. The program committee as a whole will make final decisions about which submissions to accept for presentation at the conference.
Double-anonymous Reviewing
ISSTA 2025 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission and may want to confirm that their generated PDF does not contain any meta-data with their names. They should also ensure that any citations to related work by themselves are written in third person, that is, “the prior work of XYZ” as opposed to “our prior work”.
Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chair by email.
Open Science Policy and “Data Availability” Section
ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability.
Upon submission, authors are asked to make their code, data, etc. available to the program committee (via upload of anonymized supplemental material or a link to an anonymized private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. At least one of the reviewers will check the provided data. While sharing the data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, it will inform the program committee’s decision. Furthermore, we ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named “Data Availability” after the Conclusion section.

UbiComp / ISWC 2025

UbiComp / ISWC goes north! The conference will be held during October, 2025 in Espoo, Finland.

UbiComp / ISWC is a premier interdisciplinary venue in which leading international researchers, designers, developers, and practitioners in the field present and discuss novel results in all aspects of ubiquitous, pervasive and wearable computing. This includes the design, development, and deployment of ubiquitous, pervasive and wearable computing technologies and the understanding of human experiences and social impacts that these technologies facilitate.
The conference will be held duringOctober, 2025atAalto University, Espoo, Finland.Aalto Universityis a public research university located in Espoo, Finland, within the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area. It was established in 2010 as a merger of three major Finnish universities: the Helsinki University of Technology, the Helsinki School of Economics and the University of Art and Design Helsinki. The close collaboration between the scientific, business and arts communities is intended to foster multi-disciplinary education and research.
Papers published by the Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT) are invited to present at the main technical tracks of the conference. UbiComp / ISWC also features a separate track for ISWC Briefs and Notes, as well as Workshops, Tutorials, Posters & Demos, Student Challenges, a Doctoral Symposium, and an array of Keynotes.
Join us for UbiComp/ISWC 2025 in-person!

We are excited to host the community inAalto University.

Sponsors
We would like to thank our awesome sponsors for supporting the 2025 UbiComp/ISWC community. Your help shapes the conference and will benefit students, researchers, and practitioners to advance our knowledge.

Past Conferences
The ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) is the result of a merger of the two most renowned conferences in the field: Pervasive and UbiComp. While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event.
The ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing (ISWC) discusses novel results in all aspects of wearable computing, and has been colocated with UbiComp and Pervasive since 2013.
A complete list of UbiComp, Pervasive, and ISWC past conferences is provided below.

UbiComp / ISWC

Past Conferences
The ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) is the result of a merger of the two most renowned conferences in the field: Pervasive and UbiComp. While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event.
The ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing (ISWC) discusses novel results in all aspects of wearable computing, and has been colocated with UbiComp and Pervasive since 2013.
A complete list of UbiComp, Pervasive, and ISWC past conferences is provided below.

Call for Papers - Research Track

ISSRE (International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering) is the leading conference on software reliability and it focuses on approaches, techniques, and tools for assessing, predicting, and improving the reliability, safety, and security of software systems.
ISSRE 2025 is introducing***Early Decisions***. At the beginning of the author response period we will notify the authors with the following outcomes: ""Accept"" if reviewers do not require any clarification and are happy with the current state of the paper; ""Reject"" if the reviewers agree that the authors’ response is unlikely to alter their evaluation; ""Response Recommended"" if reviewers have explicit questions that clarify some aspects of the paper, and the decision Accept/Reject is postponed.
The research track at ISSRE 2025 invites high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results exploring new scientific ideas, contributing new evidence to established research directions, or reflecting on practical experience. Specifically, ISSRE solicits submissions in three categories: (1) full research regular (REG) papers, (2) practical experience reports (PER), and (3) tools and artefacts (TAR) papers. Papers will be assessed with criteria appropriate to each category.
REG papers should describe a novel contribution to the reliability of software systems. Novelty should be argued via concrete evidence and appropriate positioning within the state of the art. REG papers are also expected to clearly explain the validation process and its limitations.
PER papers should provide an in-depth exposition of practical experiences ideally performed by a collaboration of researchers and industry practitioners. The key contribution of these papers should be lessons learned from the application of known research tools and methods related to ISSRE topics, or new knowledge acquired through empirical studies performed according to various research methodologies. Negative results are welcome, e.g., discussing where or why current research cannot be applied in an industrially relevant context.
TAR papers should describe a new tool or artefact. Tool-focused TAR papers must present either a new tool or novel and substantial extensions to an existing tool. They should include a description of (i) the theoretical foundations, (ii) the design and implementation aspects, and (iii) experiments with realistic case studies. Making the tool publicly available is strongly encouraged. Artefact-focused TAR papers should cover (i) a working copy of the software and (ii) experimental data sets.
The ISSRE conference encourages authors of research papers to follow the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Authors are encouraged to disclose data to increase reproducibility and replicability. Should the paper be accepted, the authors will have the opportunity (and are encouraged to) submit artifacts to the Artifact Evaluation (AE) track, to enhance the reproducibility and quality of your research. By submitting your artifacts you not only contribute to the progress of our field but also stand a chance to earn badges that will be displayed on your papers in the conference proceedings showcasing the credibility and rigor of your work.
At least one author of every accepted paper is required to make a full author registration and present at the conference physically in São Paulo.
Special issues
Special issue Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to a special issue of the Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) journal. The Call for Paper will be available soon.

Dependability attributes (i.e., security, safety, maintainability, survivability, resilience, robustness) impacting software reliability
Reliability threats, i.e. faults (defects, bugs, etc.), errors, failures
Reliability means (fault prevention, fault removal, fault tolerance, fault forecasting)
Software testing and formal methods
Software fault localization, debugging, root-cause analysis
Metrics, measurements and threat estimation for reliability prediction and the interplay with safety/security
Reliability of autonomous systems and (self-)adaptive systems
Reliability of AI-based systems, AI for Reliability Engineering
Reliability of Large Language/Foundational Model (LLM) and LLM for software reliability
Reliability of software services and Software as a Service (SaaS)
Reliability of model-based and auto-generated software
Reliability of open-source software
Reliability of software dealing with Big Data
Reliability of model-based and auto-generated software
Reliability of green and sustainable systems
Reliability of mobile systems
Reliability of software within specific technological spaces (e.g., Internet of Things, Cloud, Semantic Web/Web 3.0, Virtualization, Blockchain, networks softwarization, 5G/6G, edge-to-cloud computing)
Normative/regulatory/ethical spaces about software reliability
Societal aspects of software reliability
Anonymizing Rules
Authors shall anonymize their papers. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or acknowledgements). However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, the names of case study subjects may be left un-anonymized, if the subject name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. In that case, they should avoid mentioning that a specific tool has been conceived and developed by them, as well as a paper that has been co-authored by them. The authors can provide the name of a case study subject software and the name of the entity developing it (private company or foundations); in case some of the authors are employees of the developing entity, the authors should not explicitly mention their affiliation but clarify potential threats to validity (e.g., familiarity with the subject), as appropriate.
Additionally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:
Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page
Remove acknowledgement of identifying names and funding sources
Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g.,Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments.
Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person just as you would any other piece of related work.
If you have a concurrent submission, reference it as follows:""Closely related work describes a microkernel implementation [Anonymous 2025].""with the corresponding citation:""[Anonymous 2025] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing.""
If you cite anonymous work, you must also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email.
It is within the authors to use a non-anonymized version of the submitted work to, e.g., discuss it with colleagues, give talks, and publish it at ArXiV, but, in doing so, the authors cannot mention that the work is under submission to ISSRE 2025.
Submissions that do not conform to the above submission deadline, anonymization and formatting guidelines (e.g., are too long, use fonts or line spacing smaller than what is indicated) or are unoriginal, previously published, or under submission to multiple venues, will be disregarded.
Formatting Rules
Submissions must adhere to theIEEE Computer Society Format Guidelinesas implemented by the following LaTeX/Word templates:
LaTex Package(ZIP)
Word Template(DOCX)
Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file. All fonts must be embedded. We also strongly recommend you print the file and review it for integrity (fonts, symbols, equations etc.) before submitting it. A defective printing of your paper can undermine its chance of success. Please take a note of the following:
Submissions should be anonymous.
The first page must include the title of the paper and a maximum 200-word abstract.
Please take into account that the abstract will be used by the reviewers to bid on papers. Thus, describe the paper goals clearly, as well as the means used to achieve them.
The first page is not a separate page, but is a part of the paper (i.e., it has technical material in it). Thus, this page counts toward the total page budget for the paper.
The use of color for figures and graphs is allowed only if the paper turns out to be readable if printed in grayscale.
Symbols and labels used in the graphs should be readable as printed, without requiring on-screen magnification.
Try to limit the file size to less than 15 MB.
Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and better understand their results.
Paper Submission
Papers are submitted via Easychair at the following URL:href=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=issre2025"" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=issre2025
Submissions will be reviewed by the program committee through a double-blind reviewing process, with a limited use of outside referees. Papers will be held in full confidence during the reviewing process, but papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be rejected without review.
Changes in the number and order of authors will not be allowed after the paper acceptance.
Authors must anonymize their submissions according to the guidelines given above. Submissions violating the formatting and anonymization rules will be desk rejected without review. There will be no extensions for reformatting.
Review Process and Author Response
After the papers have been reviewed, but before the Program Committee/Board meeting, the reviews will be made available to the authors to respond to any factual errors in the reviews. Rebuttals do not include additional information about the research or a submission of an updated or revised paper. Author responses will be made available to all PC/PB members before the paper is discussed for selection in the PC/PB meeting. The submissions website will include rebuttal guidelines.
***NEW IN 2025: Early Decisions***
To reduce the authors and reviewers burden of unnecessary writing/reading of authors responses, ISSRE 2025 is introducing early decisions:
If reviewers decide that a paper can be accepted in its current state without requiring any further input from the authors, the authors will receive an “Accept” decision at the beginning of the author response period and will not be required to submit a response.
If a paper is perceived to be in a highly deficient state by the reviewers, leading them to conclude that the authors’ response is unlikely to alter their evaluation, the authors will receive a “Reject” decision at the beginning of the author response period and will not be required to submit a response.
All other papers will receive a “Response Recommended” notification at the beginning of the author response period. As customary, it is still up to the authors to decide if they want to submit an author response.
This approach ensures that author responses are primarily reserved for cases with some controversy or where the reviewers have specific and pertinent inquiries to be addressed.
Best Research Paper Award
ISSRE is pleased to announce the Best Research Paper Award, attributed every year to the best paper in the Research Track.
Conference Proceedings
The conference proceedings will be published by IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services (CPS). Papers presented at the conference will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore and to all of the A&I (abstracting and indexing) partners (such as the EI Compendex).
IEEE Conference Publishing Policies
All submissions must adhere to IEEE Conference Publishing Policies <href=""https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/author-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-policies/"" - Submission Policies - IEEE Author Center Conferences>.
IEEE Cross Check
All submissions will be screened for plagiarized material through the IEEE Cross Check portal.

Initial Manuscript Submission
Initial Author Instructions - Full Paper Preparation, Technical Tracks, Special Session and Workshop Papers

Authors are invited to submit full regular papers (6-8 pages) of their work, reporting original research using the online submission system. The working language of the conference is English. Regular papers are typically 6-8 pages long, and are anyway limited to maximum eight (8) pages. Submissions of papers shorter than 5 pages may be automatically rejected.

The author must submit the draft version of the paper for review before the due submission deadline ( href=""https://etfa2025.ieee-ies.org/for_authors/index.html#important-dates"" - Important Dates ). Authors of accepted papers must submit the final paper version according to the deadline, register for the conference, and attend to present their paper(s). The maximum length for final papers is 8 pages without exceptions.

IEEE is strict about the requirements for PDF files for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. We strongly recommend to use the set of templates in MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE. Please use them to create your paper, without modifying the style or format under any circumstances. A4 page size is preferred, and letter size can also be used. To learn more about formatting of papers for IEEE IES conferences, please visit this page. We will be checking pdf compliance internally through our software.

Use of the IEEE PDF eXpress service will only be required and made available for the final version of accepted papers. This service allows you to transform your document from text editor to pdf format as well as checking the conformance of any pdf file to IEEE formatting rules. The number of attempts provided to each author is limited in number so reserve its use for the final version of your paper. When using this service the conference ID will need to be specified - the ETFA 2025 conference ID will be made public once the submission of final papers opens.

Please ensure that you submit only original work that has not been previously published or copyrighted. As a prospective author, you are expected to submit only your own original work. The Conference will be using the CrossCheck automated screening system to verify the originality of papers. Submitted works may be compared to over 20 million articles in databases worldwide. Papers that violate IEEE's publication principles may be summarily rejected. If the violation is deemed severe, disciplinary actions may also be taken by IEEE.

Initial Author Instructions - Work-In-Progress Papers, Technical Tracks and Special Session Papers

The submissions in the Work in Progress papers category describe research that have not yet produced the results required for a regular paper, but that due to its novelty and potential impact deserves to be shared with the community at an early stage. These submissions need to follow the guidelines for the regular and special session but limited to four (4) pages (total length including references).

WiP contributors are expected to give a short presentation of their work and to prepare a poster for the discussion forum that will take place after the presentations. More specifically, each WiP paper shall be presented by one of the authors in a very short oral presentation of 5 minutes, without any ensuing discussion, in its respective session.

Accepted and presented papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings and in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.

Submission System Instructions

In the case you are using the new IES submission system for the first time, you will need to register at the ConfComm Login page. After registering wait for the confirmation email and verify your email address. If you don't get the confirmation email or have some problem with your submission, please contact us.

In case you already have an account with the IEC submission system you can href=""https://confcomm.ieee-ies.org/app/general/conferences/ETFA25/initial-submission"" - submit a paper to ETFA2025 here .

When submitting papers in the submission system, please select the correct track:
TT01 ... TT11 – technical tracks (regular papers).
SS01 … SS12 – special sessions (regular papers)
WS01, WS02, WS03 – workshops based on solicited papers (regular papers)
WIP TT01 … WIP TT11 – technical tracks (work-in-progress papers)
WIP SS01 … WIP SS12 – special sessions (work-in-progress papers)

Papers are solicited for regular Technical Tracks and Special Session tracks both as Regular papers and Work in progress (WIP) papers. Workshops based on solicited papers are instead accepting only regular papers (no WiP submissions will be accepted).

Once you have succesfully logged in:
Go to the Dashboard (on the left menu)
Create a new title using the button on the main page
Follow the required steps, and upload your PDF file (containing your paper) for conversion.
Wait for the system validating your PDF file.
If everything is ok, you will soon receive by e-mail the IEEE Xplore-compatible PDF of your paper.
If the PDF submitted passed the check: If the PDF passed all checks and you are satisfied with your IEEE PDF eXpress-converted PDF, go to the next step.
If the PDF submitted fails the check: Read the PDF Check Report, then click “The PDF Check Report” in the sidebar to get information on possible solutions, or eventually Request Technical Help through your account.
Very often, PDF Xpress complaints about some fonts being not embedded in your PDF. There could be several options to embed all the fonts in your PDF, depending on the software you are using to produce your paper.
If you are using LaTeX, then you can use Ghostscript (typically included with the LaTeX installation) to post-process your PDF in this way:
In a Terminal window, go to the folder where your PDF is located
Use this commend to generate a PDF with all the fonts embedded:
gs -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -dEmbedAllFonts=true -sOutputFile=output.pdf -f input.pdf
When you have tried your best to solve all the issues, you can try to upload the pdf again.
2. Upload your Xplore compatible PDF manuscript to ConfComm
Log in into the ConfComm submission system
In the menu on the left of your window, go down to ""Manusprits""
Click on the Manuscripts link, there you will find all the manuscripts you have submitted to ETFA 2025

Initial Manuscript Submission
Initial Author Instructions - Full Paper Preparation, Technical Tracks, Special Session and Workshop Papers

Authors are invited to submit full regular papers (6-8 pages) of their work, reporting original research using the online submission system. The working language of the conference is English. Regular papers are typically 6-8 pages long, and are anyway limited to maximum eight (8) pages. Submissions of papers shorter than 5 pages may be automatically rejected.

The author must submit the draft version of the paper for review before the due submission deadline ( href=""https://etfa2025.ieee-ies.org/for_authors/index.html#important-dates"" - Important Dates ). Authors of accepted papers must submit the final paper version according to the deadline, register for the conference, and attend to present their paper(s). The maximum length for final papers is 8 pages without exceptions.

IEEE is strict about the requirements for PDF files for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. We strongly recommend to use the set of templates in MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE. Please use them to create your paper, without modifying the style or format under any circumstances. A4 page size is preferred, and letter size can also be used. To learn more about formatting of papers for IEEE IES conferences, please visit this page. We will be checking pdf compliance internally through our software.

Use of the IEEE PDF eXpress service will only be required and made available for the final version of accepted papers. This service allows you to transform your document from text editor to pdf format as well as checking the conformance of any pdf file to IEEE formatting rules. The number of attempts provided to each author is limited in number so reserve its use for the final version of your paper. When using this service the conference ID will need to be specified - the ETFA 2025 conference ID will be made public once the submission of final papers opens.

Please ensure that you submit only original work that has not been previously published or copyrighted. As a prospective author, you are expected to submit only your own original work. The Conference will be using the CrossCheck automated screening system to verify the originality of papers. Submitted works may be compared to over 20 million articles in databases worldwide. Papers that violate IEEE's publication principles may be summarily rejected. If the violation is deemed severe, disciplinary actions may also be taken by IEEE.

Initial Author Instructions - Work-In-Progress Papers, Technical Tracks and Special Session Papers

The submissions in the Work in Progress papers category describe research that have not yet produced the results required for a regular paper, but that due to its novelty and potential impact deserves to be shared with the community at an early stage. These submissions need to follow the guidelines for the regular and special session but limited to four (4) pages (total length including references).

WiP contributors are expected to give a short presentation of their work and to prepare a poster for the discussion forum that will take place after the presentations. More specifically, each WiP paper shall be presented by one of the authors in a very short oral presentation of 5 minutes, without any ensuing discussion, in its respective session.

Accepted and presented papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings and in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.

Submission System Instructions

In the case you are using the new IES submission system for the first time, you will need to register at the ConfComm Login page. After registering wait for the confirmation email and verify your email address. If you don't get the confirmation email or have some problem with your submission, please contact us.

In case you already have an account with the IEC submission system you can href=""https://confcomm.ieee-ies.org/app/general/conferences/ETFA25/initial-submission"" - submit a paper to ETFA2025 here .

When submitting papers in the submission system, please select the correct track:
TT01 ... TT11 – technical tracks (regular papers).
SS01 … SS12 – special sessions (regular papers)
WS01, WS02, WS03 – workshops based on solicited papers (regular papers)
WIP TT01 … WIP TT11 – technical tracks (work-in-progress papers)
WIP SS01 … WIP SS12 – special sessions (work-in-progress papers)

Papers are solicited for regular Technical Tracks and Special Session tracks both as Regular papers and Work in progress (WIP) papers. Workshops based on solicited papers are instead accepting only regular papers (no WiP submissions will be accepted).

ACM ISS Announcement for 2025-2026
Plans for 2025-2026

While we will still run the ISS special issue in PACM HCI in 2025, with two rounds, due to a lack of bids for hosting the conference, the steering committee has decided to postpone the conference to 2026. Accepted articles will be published in a special issue of PACM, aimed for release in fall 2025. In addition, authors of all accepted submissions will be invited to present their work in person at ACM ISS 2026.

Please see our href=""authors/papers/"" - call for papers for instructions on how to submit to the special issue.

We are also currently href=""https://iss.acm.org/#tab-bids"" - soliciting bids to host the conference in 2026-2028.
