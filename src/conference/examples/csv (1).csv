 July 14-18, 2025 
 CGI 2025 
 CGI is one of the oldest annual international conferences on Computer Graphics in the world. Half centuries of influence, we are dedicated to making CGI as a top conference on graphics and media. Researchers are invited to share their experiences and novel achievements in various fields of Computer Graphics, Media, and Virtual Reality. Previous recent CGI conferences have been held in Sydney, Australia (2014), Strasbourg, France (2015), Heraklion, Greece (2016), Yokohama, Japan (2017), Bintan, Indonesia (2018), Calgary, Canada (2019), and Shanghai, China (2023). CGI has been virtual between 2020 and 2022 due to the COVID pandemic, and has been held last year in Geneva, Switzerland (2024). 
 This year, CGI 2025 is organized by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and supported by the Computer Graphics Society (CGS). The Visual Computer Journal, published by Springer Nature, is the official journal of the Computer Graphics Society.

 CGI is one of the oldest annual international conferences on Computer Graphics in the world. Half centuries of influence, we are dedicated to making CGI as a top conference on graphics and media. Researchers are invited to share their experiences and novel achievements in various fields of Computer Graphics, Media, and Virtual Reality. Previous recent CGI conferences have been held in Sydney, Australia (2014), Strasbourg, France (2015), Heraklion, Greece (2016), Yokohama, Japan (2017), Bintan, Indonesia (2018), Calgary, Canada (2019), and Shanghai, China (2023). CGI has been virtual between 2020 and 2022 due to the COVID pandemic, and has been held last year in Geneva, Switzerland (2024). 
  
 This year, CGI 2025 is organized by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and supported by the Computer Graphics Society (CGS). The Visual Computer Journal, published by Springer Nature, is the official journal of the Computer Graphics Society. 
  
 You are invited to submit your full papers to CGI 2025 via EasyChair. As in previous years, CGI 2025 papers can be submitted for possible publication in The Visual Computer journal, the CAVW journal, VRIH journal, and CGI Conference Proceedings (LNCS, Springer).

 The scientific program of the conference will include accepted papers from the first Call for Papers and these accepted papers will be published in The Visual Computer Journal (IF: 3.0) by Springer Nature. 
  
 The accepted papers from the second Call for Papers will be included either in the CGI Conference Proceedings published by LNCS, Springer, or in the VRIH Journal (Virtual Reality and Intelligent Hardware) published by Science Press, or in the CAVW Journal (Computer Animation and Virtual Worlds, SCI-indexed) published by Wiley, or in TVC Journal (The Visual Computer, SCI-indexed, JCR: Q1, IF: 3.0) published by Springer Nature. 
  
 Note that for ALL submissions, the review process is double blind, which requires the paper and all supplemental materials to be anonymous. Ensure that self-referencing is anonymous (refer to your full name rather than “I” or “we”). Avoid providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgements (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs) and in the supplemental material (e.g., titles in the movies, or attached papers). Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. Violation of any of these guidelines will lead to rejection without review.

 Aim and Scope of the Journal 
 Since 1999, the annualhref=""https://ches.iacr.org/"" - CHES conference
highlights new results in the design and analysis of cryptographic hardware and software implementations and builds a valuable bridge between the research and cryptographic engineering communities and attracts participants from industry, academia, and government organizations. Topics suitable for CHES include, but are not limited to cryptographic implementations, attacks against implementations and countermeasures, cryptographic tools and methodologies, cryptographic implementation issues and applications. To be considered for publication, they must provide an added value beyond prior work, such as novel insights or reasonably questioning previous assumptions.

The ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems is the premier international conference of Human-Computer Interaction. 
 CHI takes place in Yokohama, Japan, at thePACIFICO Yokohamafrom 26 April to 1 May 2025, while also supporting remote attendance. 
 The conference embraces the theme of Ikigai, a Japanese concept referring to what gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. In today’s world, people are facing a multitude of challenges in climate change, growing inequality, technological disruption, global conflict, and health crises. Ikigai concerns the ability of a person to find their purpose and balance their agency, their passion, their capabilities, and the impact they can have. The CHI community consists of people with many passions and talents, people from different disciplines and walks of life. In harnessing our ‘Ikigai’ into a communal ‘IkiCHI’ we can be greater than the sum of our efforts and offer unique contributions to solving the difficult challenges ahead. 
 The cherry blossom or ‘Sakura’ as depicted in the CHI’25 logo signifies a time of renewal and optimism. The conference takes place in the period of cherry blossom growth and in this environment of optimism and renewal, we wish you will find your IkiCHI.

The ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems is the premier international conference of Human-Computer Interaction. 
 CHI takes place in Yokohama, Japan, at thePACIFICO Yokohamafrom 26 April to 1 May 2025, while also supporting remote attendance. 
 The conference embraces the theme of Ikigai, a Japanese concept referring to what gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. In today’s world, people are facing a multitude of challenges in climate change, growing inequality, technological disruption, global conflict, and health crises. Ikigai concerns the ability of a person to find their purpose and balance their agency, their passion, their capabilities, and the impact they can have. The CHI community consists of people with many passions and talents, people from different disciplines and walks of life. In harnessing our ‘Ikigai’ into a communal ‘IkiCHI’ we can be greater than the sum of our efforts and offer unique contributions to solving the difficult challenges ahead. 
 The cherry blossom or ‘Sakura’ as depicted in the CHI’25 logo signifies a time of renewal and optimism. The conference takes place in the period of cherry blossom growth and in this environment of optimism and renewal, we wish you will find your IkiCHI.

 Open search barSearch for:Search for:SearchClose search barThe Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI PLAY) is the international and interdisciplinary conference (by ACM SIGCHI) for researchers and professionals across all areas of play, games and human-computer interaction (HCI). We call this area “player-computer interaction”. 
 October 13-16 2025 
 The goal of CHI PLAY is to highlight and foster discussion of current high quality research in games and HCI as foundation for the future of digital play. To this end, the conference features streams that blend academic research papers, masterclasses, interactive play demos, student game design competition, poster session and industry insights. 
 CHI PLAY grew out of the increasing work around games and play emerging from the ACM annual conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) as well as smaller conferences such as Fun and Games and Gamification. CHI PLAY is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group for Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI). All accepted submissions will be distributed in the CHI PLAY Conference Proceedings available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide.

 Mission Statement and Topics 
 Automata theory is the foundation of computer science. Its applications have spread to almost all areas of computer science and many other disciplines. In addition, there is a growing number of software systems designed to manipulate automata, regular expressions, grammars, and related structures; examples include AGL, AMORE, Automate, FADELA, FinITE, FireLite, FLAP, FSM, Grail, INR, Intex, ASTL, MONA, and Turing's World. 
 The purpose of these conferences is to bring together members of the academic, research and industrial community who have an interest in implementation and application of automata to demonstrate and analyze their work and to explain the problems they have been solving.

 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper with at most 15 pages, excluding the title page and the references. The title page consists of the title of the paper and the abstract. The first section of the paper should start on the next page. 
 The usage of the LNCS style file is mandatory. No changes to font size, page geometry, etc. are permitted. Late submissions and submissions not in the correct format will not be considered. 
 Submissions will be through EasyChair (href=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025"" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025
) 
 The paper should contain a succinct statement of the issues and their motivation, a summary of the results, a brief explanation of their significance, and a comparison to related work, accessible to non-specialists. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be put into an appendix, to be read by the PC members at their discretion. 
 Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed. 
 At least one author of each accepted paper will have to register for the conference. For authors who cannot present their paper in person for a significant reason, the possibility of remote presentation may be offered. 
 Double-Blind Reviewing 
 CIAC 2025 will implement a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way; in particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. 
 The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would (e.g., making early drafts available on their webpage, or through pre-print dissemination websites such as arXiv). 
 When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members. 
 PC submissions 
 Submissions authored or co-authored by (non-chair) members of the program committee are allowed.

 Fitness landscape analysis and manipulation in Biomedical disciplines 
  
 Aim 
 Many complex computational tasks in the bio-medical disciplines (e.g., Bioinformatics, Bioengineering, Systems Biology, Synthetic Biology, and Computational Biology) can be reformulated in terms of optimization problems, that is, the identification of the global minima (or maxima) of a given function (or multiple functions) inside a multi-dimensional search space. In global optimization techniques, which denote the algorithms leveraged to solve such problems, the data structures used to represent thecandidate solutionscan sometimes bedirectly decodedandinterpreted. Consequently, the best-fitting individuals immediately provide an explicit andhuman-readabledescription of the optimal solution. The researchers, who mainly focused on the creation of novel strategies, often aim to propose solutions able to balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the optimization algorithms. 
 Although this well-established research line is very prolific—paving the way for the design of efficient algorithms, even for large-scale problems—there is another promising direction that should be investigated, consisting in theanalysis and modification of the fitness landscape, that is the hyper-surface induced by the evaluation of the objective function for each point of the search space. Indeed, the analysis of the fitness landscape might help in the choice of the optimization algorithm to use and the choice of the space transformations to use, such as dilate, shrink, stretch, collapse, smooth, or remap the fitness landscape, leading to alternative or simplified formulations of the original optimization problem. 
 In discrete domains, a similar approach can be performed by embedding implicitor explicit assumptionsinto the structure of the candidate solutions. In such a way, the genetic operators can explore the feasible search space in a “smarter” way, reducing the overall computational effort. Examples of this technique include generative representations, techniques based on grammar, single parent techniques where example genes are incorporated, and other structured representations that starkly limit the portion of the search domain examined. 
 This special session aims to gather the researchers investigating new directions and ideas in the field ofcandidate solution representations, its dual notion offitness landscape manipulationandits analysisto tackle complex tasks, especially problems related to Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. 
 Scope 
 This Special Session welcomes any paper considering allnon-conventional candidate solution representations, including the dual perspective offitness landscape manipulation, andits analysis. 
 Examples include but are not limited to: 
 Non-conventional representations of candidate solutions 
 Dilation functions and other functions that reshape the fitness landscape 
 Generative automata 
 Alternative semantics for candidate solutions 
 Fitness landscape modification, simplification, and restriction 
 Novel closed variation/evolutionary operators 
 Implicit/relative representations 
 Generative or developmental representations 
 Self-adaptive representations 
 Parameterized manifolds of representations 
 State-conditioned representations 
 Procedural representations 
 Surrogate models 
 Highly interpretable representations

 The 18th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM 2025) 
 Objectives 
 Digital and computational solutions are the prevalent means for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of mathematical information. Separate communities have developed to investigate and build computer based systems for automated deduction, computer algebra, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user interfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their integration can lead to synergies offering significant added value. The Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM) offers a venue for discussing and developing solutions to the great challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas. 
 The conference addresses research from these areas, and it usually adds workshops and a doctoral programme.

 Welcome to Trondheim, Norway, IEEE SSCI 2025, 17th - 20th March 
 IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations. 
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia. 
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants from fast food to Michelin star and sport activities. 
 We, the Organising Committee, are thrilled to extend a heartfelt invitation to academia, industry, and government agencies alike, to actively participate in presentations and discussions in Trondheim., that will play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of Computational Intelligence. The conference program is set to showcase a vibrant lineup, including plenary and keynote addresses, oral and poster presentations, engaging panels, insightful workshops, instructive tutorials, and stimulating competitions. 
 Your participation is invaluable, and we look forward to welcoming a diverse and dynamic community to contribute to the success of both the relaunch of SSCI and the 2025 event.

The Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) was started in 2002 by Michael Stonebraker, Jim Gray, and David DeWitt to provide the database community with a venue for presenting innovative data systems architectures, as well as a prestigious publication opportunity. CIDR is complementary in its mission to the mainstream database conferences like SIGMOD and VLDB, emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR gathers researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss the latest innovative and visionary ideas in the field. CIDR mainly encourages papers about innovative and risky data management system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insight, resourceful experimental studies, provocative position statements. CIDR especially values innovation, experience-based insight, and vision. 
 The first CIDR conference was first held at Asilomar in January 2003, and has been held every other January for the first 18 years. Since 2020, the conference has a yearly cadence alternating between California and Amsterdam.The conference will be held for a sixteenth time between January 18-21, 2026 in Chaminade, USA.

Today (22 January) marks the final day of this systems-focused conference, which emphasizes a systems architecture perspective and attracts practitioners from both academia and industry. Among the authors presenting their best systems research were Peter Boncz (leader of the DA group and general co-chair of CIDR) and Hannes Mühleisen (CWI & DuckDB Labs)*. 
 Peter BonczWorking with vast amounts of data 
 href=""https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2025/keynotes.html"" - Keynote speaker Thea Klaeboe Aarrestad
(ETH) discussed the immense challenges of managing the vast amounts of data produced by the CERN Large Hadron Collider, where researchers study high-energy proton collisions to uncover fundamental particles and forces in physics. These collisions generate 10,000 exabytes of raw data annually. To handle this enormous data flow, real-time event filtering systems process millions of collisions per second, equivalent to 5% of global internet traffic, combined with unprecedented complexity. 
 Maintaining data integrity for meaningful physics analyses requires highly optimized machine learning (ML) algorithms. Klaeboe Aarrestad explained how real-time ML techniques enhance data filtering and improve the acceptance of physics signals. 
 Thea Klaeboe AarrestadEnergy trade-offs 
 href=""https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2025/keynotes.html"" - Keynote speaker Christos Kozyrakis
(Stanford University) explored the limits of semiconductor technology and emerging trends in AI training and inference that are reshaping hardware architecture. He highlighted the energy trade-offs in compute and memory, offering insights into how AI systems and chips can also accelerate other data-intensive workloads and influence the development of future hardware technology. 
 Pushing boundaries 
 In addition to keynotes, the program included an evening programme, paper and demo presentations. CIDR values bold and innovative approaches to data management system architecture, real-world systems-building experience, insightful experimental studies, and provocative position papers. The conference fosters discussions around visionary ideas that push the boundaries of what is possible in data systems.

 Scope of the Workshop 
 The International Workshop on Computational Intelligence for Multimedia Understanding (IWCIM) is the annual workshop organized by the working group Multimedia Understanding through Semantics, Computation and Learning (MUSCLE) of the European Research Consortium for Informatics and Mathematics (ERCIM). This year, IWCIM takes place as a special session in IEEE ISCAS 2025, to be held in London on May 25 - 28, 2025. 
 Multimedia understanding is an essential part of many intelligent applications in our social life, be it in our households, or in commercial, industrial, service, and scientific environments. Analyzing raw data to provide them with semantics is essential to exploit their full potential and help us manage our everyday tasks. Nowadays raw data usually come from a host of different sensors and other sources, and are different in nature, format reliability and information content. Multimodal and cross-modal analysis are the only ways to use them at their best. Besides data analysis, this problem is also relevant to data description intended to help storage and mining. Interoperability and exchangeability of heterogeneous and distributed data is a need for any practical application. Semantics is information at the highest level, and inferring it from raw data (that is from information at the lowest level) entails exploiting both data and prior information to extract structure and meaning. Computation, machine learning, statistical and Bayesian methods are tools to achieve this goal at various levels. 
 The scope of IWCIM 2025 includes, but is not limited to the following topics: 
 Multisensor systems 
 Multimodal analysis 
 Crossmodal data analysis and clustering 
 Mixed-reality applications 
 Activity and object detection and recognition 
 Text and speech recognition

 CIS'2024 was held successfully 
 Previous slideNext slideInternational Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS) is a major annual international conference to bring together researchers engineers, developers and practitioners from academia and industry working in all areas of two crucial fields in information processing: computational intelligence (CI) and information security (IS), to share the experience exchange and cross-fertilize ideas. In particular, the series of CIS conference provides an ideal platform to explore the potential applications of CI models algorithms and technologies to IS. 
 The Twentieth conference CIS’2024 serves as a forum for the dissemination of the state-of-the-art research, development, and implementations of systems, technologies and applications in these two broad fields. CIS’2024 will be held at Xiamen on 6-9 December 2024. 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit high-quality manuscripts written in English. The submission of a paper implies that the paper is original and has not been submitted to elsewhere for possible publication. All submissions will be blindly reviewed by experts in the field based on originality, significance, quality and clarity. Authors must not reveal any author information in the submitted paper(s), otherwise the paper(s) will be rejected immediately without going through the reviewing process. Authors should use the Latex style files or MS-Word templates to format their papers. 
 We shall further announce additional journals to publish a special issue for CIS’2024 in the near future.

 View PDFHTML (experimental)Abstract:mdx II is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud platform designed to accelerate data science research and foster cross-disciplinary collaborations among universities and research institutions in Japan. Unlike traditional high-performance computing systems, mdx II leverages OpenStack to provide customizable and isolated computing environments consisting of virtual machines, virtual networks, and advanced storage. This paper presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of mdx II, including a comparison to Amazon Web Services (AWS). We evaluated the performance of a 16-vCPU VM from multiple aspects including floating-point computing performance, memory throughput, network throughput, file system and object storage performance, and real-world application performance. Compared to an AWS 16-vCPU instance, the results indicated that mdx II outperforms AWS in many aspects and demonstrated that mdx II holds significant promise for high-performance data analytics (HPDA) workloads. We also evaluated the virtualization overhead using a 224-vCPU VM occupying an entire host. The results suggested that the virtualization overhead is minimal for compute-intensive benchmarks, while memory-intensive benchmarks experienced larger overheads. These findings are expected to help users of mdx II to obtain high performance for their data science workloads and offer insights to the designers of future data-centric cloud platforms.
