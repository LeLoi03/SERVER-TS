 ABZ 2025 – 11th International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods  

 Call for papers  
 The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.  
 The name ABZ goes back to the first conference in London in 2008, where the ASM, B and Z conference series were merged into a joint event. In the following years other formal methods were added, e.g. Alloy in 2010 (Orford, Canada), VDM in 2012 (Pisa, Italy), and TLA+ in 2014 (Toulouse, France). After the also successful 2016 conferences in Linz, Austria, and 2018 in Southampton, UK, it was decided to name the conference “ABZ: International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods”, to stress the openness for further state-based formal methods. We hope to continue many fruitful discussions between representatives of the individual methods in the past, which will bring us closer to the common goal of this research community: the creation of reliable and safe software and systems.  
 ABZ 2025 will have a main conference track, a case study track, a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops.

  Caution: there are some FAKE conferences that pretend to be ICFCA or ICCS conferences. The real ICFCA and ICCS conferences do not exist anymore. Fake conferences can be easily recognised because they do not have any FCA researchers on their committees. Furthermore, an internet search for the website domain name and ""scam"" or ""fake"" will provide evidence of the fake nature.

 History  
 ICFCA, CLA and ICCS are three highly relevant conferences in the field of formal concept analysis (FCA) and related areas. All three conferences contribute significantly to advancing the understanding and application of formal concept analysis. In particular:  
 On October 2023, representatives of the three conferences approved the merging of the three conferences  ICFCA,   CLA and ICCS   and creating a new joint event, the  International Joint Conference on Conceptual Knowledge Structures (CONCEPTS).   This merger aimed to create a unified and comprehensive forum for researchers, academics, and professionals from various disciplines interested in formal concept analysis, conceptual structures, and related fields to exchange ideas, present their research, and discuss the latest advancements in these areas. For this purpose, the overall organization of CONCEPTS will follow the existing rules and traditions of the three conferences.

 Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics  
 Robot algorithms are abstractions of computational processes that control or reason about motion and perception in the physical world. Because actions in the physical world are subject to physical laws and geometric constraints, the design and analysis of robot algorithms raises a unique combination of questions in control theory, computational and differential geometry, and computer science. Algorithms serve as a unifying theme in the multi-disciplinary field of robotics.  
 The Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations aims to bring together a group of about sixty researchers to discuss recent trends and important future directions of research on the algorithmic issues related to robotics and automation.

 FedCSIS 2025 Invited speakers and Keynotes   
  
 The mission   of the FedCSIS Conference Series is to provide a presentation, discussion and a reputable publication forum in computer science and intelligence systems. The forum invites researchers and practitioners from around the world to contribute their research results focused on their scientific and professional interests in a chosen area.  
 The FedCSIS conference consists of the Main Track  and Thematic Session  . Papers submitted to the Main Track can be assigned, by their authors, to Topical Areas,  which are managed by Topical Area Curators  . Based on the scope of the contribution, Topical Area Curators select its reviewers from the Main Track Program Committee  . Besides the Main Track, the authors may prefer to submit their papers to Thematic Session, which announce their own Calls for Thematic Session Papers  and are assisted by the FedCSIS Chairs in reaching out to the FedCSIS Community.  
 For all five Topical Areas, situated within a general domain of Computer Science, the continually emerging topic of Intelligence Systems stands as the common denominator. All Thematic Sessions also refer to the Intelligence Systems from different perspectives. They are regarded as a path toward introducing more Intelligence into Computer Science and IT.

 ADCOM 2024 seeks to share insights for a ‘Responsible AI’ framework to develop Artificial Intelligence safely and ethically based on the five core principles of fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy and safety. Sustainable, reliable, effective, and human-centered AI systems require responsible AI principles and perspectives not only from technological but also from ethical, legal, and socio-economic domains. This edition of ADCOM will also explore as a sub theme the democratization of access to AI with a need for Trust, Risk and Security Management (TRiSM) to enhance positive performance and societal gains that AI enables.

 Notes on the Early History of CADE 
 The 1968 meeting was organized by the mathematician Marcel-Paul Schützenberger, one of the founders of formal language theory, the logician Daniel Lacombe and the computer scientist Louis Nolin. It occurred at the just created IRIA (Institut de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique) in Rocquencourt, near Versailles. This was actually the first scientific meeting organized at IRIA (to become INRIA in 1984 when it became a national institute). Schützenberger was the father of the Parisian school of theoretical computer science, and one of the founding scientific directors of IRIA. G. Kreisel came, probably invited by D. Lacombe, a specialist of recursive functions theory, and Jean-Louis Krivine, who had been working with him on axiomatic set theory. de Bruijn gave one of the first presentations of Automath. D. Scott discussed a notion of constructive validity. Several pioneers of automated theorem-proving participated, such as Hao Wang, R. Kowalski, D. Loveland, D. Luckham and L. Wos. 
 Peter Andrews provided many details of the early CADEs. He noted … “Evidently the conference at Versailles, France, in 1968 was not considered part of the CADE sequence of conferences by the early CADE organizers (one of whom was Wolfgang Bibel).” Gérard Huet recalls … “CADE was created probably at the 1977 meeting. Retroactively, the meetings of Argonne and Oberworlfach were christened CADE-1 and CADE-2, consistently with the fact that they were organized by the automated deduction community (Wos, Robinson, Bledsoe, Loveland, Andrews, Bibel, etc).” Wolfgang Bibel confirmed … “The term CADE was used for the very first time for CADE-1980, the Fifth International Conference on Automated Deduction (the numbering added after the reconstruction of the history), held in Les Arcs, Frankreich Juli 1980. Its Program Chairs were Wolfgang Bibel and Robert Kowalski. And it was me who suggested to introduce the term in - still existing - letters to Woody Bledsoe, Bob Kowalsky and others.”. Reiner Hähnle kindly went to the TU Darmstadt archive and took photos of some of the original correspondence between Wolfgang and Bob Kowaski which are provided here with permission from Wolfgang. They area letter from Wolfgang to Bob dated 4/4/79regarding the arrangements for the 1979 conference,Wolfgang’s draft CFPfor the conference, anda letter from Bob to Wolfgang dated 20/4/79in which Bob agrees to Wolfgang’s suggestion of the CADE acronym.

 CAiSE'25 | 37th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering | Theme: Bridging Silos | Vienna, Austria  June 16-20, 2025 | Open Calls 

 Theme: Bridging Silos   
 Engineering real-world information systems requires a coherent design encompassing human, organizational, economic, societal, and technological aspects. Information systems are applied in diverse contexts such as business process management, geographical information systems, and digital twins. The discipline continually evolves with trends in data science, machine learning, process mining, blockchain, mobile computing, sustainability, new regulations, cyber warfare, and military conflicts, all influencing its development. Each application context and emerging trend can lead to specializations within information systems engineering, necessitating various research traditions and needs. While beneficial, these specializations risk creating silos. Thus, the CAiSE conference, the premier event for this discipline, aims to prevent such fragmentation.  
  Therefore, the theme for this year’s CAiSE conference is ""Bridging Silos."" We encourage submissions that consider information systems engineering as a cohesive design involving multiple aspects. Submissions focused on specific specializations should explicitly position their results within the broader context to engage researchers across different areas and avoid silo formation.

 Final version due: May 19, 2023 
 ========================================================== 

Scope 
 ----- 
 Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer 
 science. From data types to development techniques and specification 
 formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from 
 the large body of research proposed and implemented since the 
 pioneering works of the 1960s. 
  
 CALCO aims to bring together researchers with interests in both 
 foundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in 
 computer science, traditional as well as emerging ones 
  
 CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the 
 forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on 
 Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on 
 Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place 
 in Salzburg (Austria, 2021), London (UK, 2019), Ljubljana 
 (Slovenia,2017), Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015), Warsaw (Poland, 
 2013), Winchester (UK, 2011), Udine (Italy, 2009), Bergen (Norway, 
 2007), Swansea (Wales, 2005). 
  
 The 10th edition will be held in Bloomington, Indiana, co-located with 
 MFPS XXXIX. It is planned as a physical, in-person event, with 
 support for remote presence, both for speakers and for other 
 participants who are unable or unwilling to travel. 

Submission Categories 
 --------------------- 
 CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and 
 coalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four 
 categories of submissions. 
  
 1. Regular papers that report 
 * results on theoretical foundations 
 * novel methods and techniques for software development 
 * experiences with technology transfer to industry. 
  
 2. (Co)Algebraic Pearls papers that 
 * present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way. 
  
 3. Early ideas abstracts that lead to 
 * presentations of work in progress 
 * proposals for original venues of research. 
  
 4. Tool presentation papers that 
 * report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools. 

Topics of Interests 
 ------------------- 
 All topics relating to algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications 
 are of interest for CALCO, and among them 
  
 * Models and logics

Submissions Guidelines 
 ---------------------- 
 All submissions will be handled via EasyChair: 
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco2023 
  
 The format for all submissions is specified by LIPIcs. Please use the 
 latest version of the style: 
 http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/ 
  
 It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length. 
 Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. 

Regular papers 
 -------------- 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English 
 presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and 
 not submitted for publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be 
 maximum 15 pages long, excluding references. Proofs omitted due to space 
 limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix. 
  
 Proceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs Leibniz 
 International Proceedings in Informatics series. 
  
 A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in Computer 
 Science (http://www.lmcs-online.org), containing extended versions of 
 selected papers, is planned. 

(Co)algebraic pearls 
 -------------------- 
 This is a recent submission category. Explaining a known idea in a new 
 way may make as strong a contribution as inventing a new idea. We 
 encourage the submission of pearls: elegant essays that illustrate an 
 idea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing 
 an application. Pearls are typically short and concise and so should 
 not be longer than regular papers in the format specified by 
 LIPIcs. Authors who feel they need a bit more space should consult 
 with the PC co-chairs. The accepted papers will be included in the 
 final proceedings of the conference. Each submission will be evaluated 
 by at least two reviewers. 

Early ideas abstracts 
 --------------------- 
 Submissions should not exceed 2 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. 
 The volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on 
 the CALCO pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged 
 to disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere. Each 
 submission will be evaluated by at least two reviewers. 

Tool papers 
 ----------- 
 Submissions should not exceed 5 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. 
 The accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of 
 the conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the 
 time of submission for download and evaluation. Each submission will be 
 evaluated by at least three reviewers, and one or more of the reviewers 
 will be asked to download and use the tool. 

Best Paper and Best Presentation Awards 
 --------------------------------------- 
 This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose 
 recipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a 
 Best Presentation Award, elected by the participants.

About the conference 
  
 The International Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS) 
 is a premier forum for presenting research in the field of cryptology 
 and network security. The conference seeks academic, industry, and 
 government submissions on all theoretical and practical aspects of 
 cryptology and network security. This year marks the 24th iteration of 
 the conference and will be held at Osaka, Japan. Proceedings of this 
 year's conference will be published by Springer LNCS; proceedings of 
 previous iterations of the conference can be found online. 
  
 Submission guidelines 
  
 High quality papers on unpublished research and implementation 
 experiences may be submitted. All papers must be original and not 
 substantially duplicate work that has been published at, or is 
 simultaneously submitted to, a journal or another conference or workshop 
 with proceedings. All submissions must be written in English and span no 
 more than 20 pages in the Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science 
 (LNCS) format, including title, abstract, and bibliography. The 
 introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level 
 understandable by a non-expert reader and explain the context to related 
 work. 
 Submitted papers may contain supplementary material in the form of 
 well-marked appendices or a separate file archive (particularly for 
 source code, data files, etc.). Note that supplementary material will 
 not be included in the proceedings. Moreover, the main paper should be 
 intelligible without requiring the reader to consult the supplementary 
 material; the reviewers may optionally refer to the supplementary 
 material, but are also permitted to base their assessment on the main 
 paper alone. 
  
 Submissions must be anonymous (no author names, affiliations, 
 acknowledgments, or obvious references). The conference will also 
 consider short papers of up to eight pages in the LNCS format, excluding 
 the bibliography (max 2 pages), for results that are not yet fully 
 fleshed out or that simply require fewer pages to describe but still 
 make a significant contribution. 
 All submissions must be processed with LaTeX2e according to the 
 instructions given by Springer. Submitted manuscripts must be typeset in 
 plain Springer LNCS format, in particular without changing the font 
 size, margins or line spacing. Submissions not meeting these guidelines 
 may be rejected without consideration of their merits. 
 Papers must be submitted via EasyChair. The deadline for submissions is 
 17 April anywhere on earth (AoE). 
  
 Important dates 
 Submission: 17 April AoE. Papers must be submitted via EasyChair. 
 Notification: 10 July 
 Camera-ready: 14 August

 22nd Smart Card Research and Advanced Application ConferenceScope 
 CARDIS has been the venue for security experts from industry and academia to exchange on security of smart cards and related applications since 1994. Smart cards play an increasingly important role in our day-to-day live through their use in banking cards, SIM cards, electronic passports, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. It is thus naturally of utmost importance to understand their security features and to develop sound protocols and countermeasures while keeping reasonable performances. In this respect, CARDIS aims to gather security experts from industry, academia, and standardization bodies to make steps forward in the field of embedded security. 
 The 22nd edition of CARDIS is organized by thehref=""https://cci-research.nl"" - Complex Cyber Infrastructure
group of theUniversity of Amsterdamin Amsterdam, NL. CARDIS 2023 will be an in-person event, with the possibility to attend talks remotely (presenters are required to participate to the conference in presence).

 Present CFP : 2022 
 CARDIS has been the venue for security experts from industry and academia to exchange on 
 security of smart cards and related applications since 1994. Smart cards play an increasingly 
 important role in our day-to-day life through their use in banking cards, SIM cards, electronic 
 passports, and IoT devices. It is thus naturally of utmost importance to understand their security 
 features and to develop sound protocols and countermeasures while keeping reasonable 
 performance. In this respect, CARDIS aims to gather security experts from industry, academia, and 
 standardization bodies to make steps forward in the field of embedded security. 
 The 21st edition of CARDIS is organized by the Centre for Cyber Security and Privacy of the 
 University of Birmingham, UK. CARDIS 2022 will be accompanied by a one-day Fall School event, 
 with more details to be announced.

 Conference Information 
 The tools of Scientific Computing play an important role in the natural sciences and engineering. Computer Algebra Systems and the underlying algorithms for Symbolic Computation play an increasingly important role within Scientific Computation. The CASC workshop series has been running for over two decades to explore the interaction of these topics, their implementation, and their application. 
 Scope 
 The topics addressed in the workshop cover 
 1. The theory of symbolic computation and its implementation in computer algebra systems. 
 This includes, but is not limited to: 
 new methods on exact computation; 
 symbolic algorithms and their complexity; 
 automated reasoning in algebra and geometry; 
 parallel symbolic / symbolic-numeric computation; 
 symbolic / symbolic-numeric methods for differential, differential-algebraic and difference equations; 
 symbolic / symbolic-numeric methods for polynomial equations and inequalities; 
 the embedding of computer algebra technology within different software and hardware environments; 
 2. All other areas of scientific computing in regards to their benefit from or use of computer algebra methods and software. 
 This includes, but is not limited to: 
 the use of computer algebra in approximate computation; 
 computer algebra methods in big data analytics; 
 computer algebra methods for simulation and modeling; 
 3. Applications of the above throughout the natural sciences and engineering. 
 We welcome papers on both fundamental research and implementation issues. We also accept survey papers but these MUST BE CLEARLY LABELLED as such in the title. 
 Conference Participation Options 
 We encourage wide participation at the workshop. In light of this, and that the conference scope spans computer science and mathematics (with their different publication traditions), we offer a variety of participation options. 
 1. Participation with an accompanying paper inhref=""https://link.springer.com/conference/casc"" - LNCS:

CASC has a long running relationship with the Springer book series Lecture Notes in Computer Science to publish conference proceedings. Work submitted here should contain an original research result. Submissions should be prepared in theLNCS styleand not exceed 20 pages. Survey papers may have up to 25 pages. Click on the below logo to see the list of CASC proceedings published by Springer. 
 href=""https://link.springer.com/conference/casc"" - 
2. Participation with abstract only: 
  
 Participants may opt to submit an extended abstract instead. These should have at least 2 and at most 4 pages in theLNCS style.They must contain the main results of the talk (without proofs). They will be lightly reviewed and distributed locally at the conference. We see three main audiences for this option: 
 Those who wish to talk on previously published work (in which case that work should be clearly cited in the abstract). 
 Those whose work is not yet ready for publication, but wish to receive feedback. 
 Those who plan to submit a journal paper on the work shortly. 
 For the second group, there will be a subsequent journal topical collection call after the conference (see below). 
 Accompanying Topical Collection of Mathematics in Computer ScienceCASC has formed a relationship with the Springer Birkhäuser journal Mathematics in Computer Science (MCS)for an ongoing series of topical collections on topics presented at CASC workshops. Work submitted here must be of journal quality and will be reviewed to the usual standards of MCS. Submission will be opened after the conference for authors of extended abstracts presented at that years conference. There is no a priori page limit, but the length must be justified by the contents of the paper. At notification authors may be asked to revise their paper for a secondary deadline. 
 Submission Link 
 All submissions should be done via EasyChair: 
 SUBMIT:href=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=casc2025"" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=casc2025
In the EasyChair title field please prefix the paper title in the EasyChair metadata with either LNCS or EA to indicate which of the participation options is being used.

 About 
 CAV is the premier international conference on computer-aided verification. It provides a forum for a broad range of advanced research in areas ranging model checking and automated theorem proving to testing, synthesis and related fields. Research reported in CAV includes the application of formal methods to many kinds of systems,including hardware, software and communication protocols. It covers many system models, including finite-state and infinite state systems, hybrid systems and probabilistic systems. It encompasses both theory and industrial case studies. The common thread is the use of automation to help designers build more reliable systems. 
 CAV is held each year in July, and usually alternates between North America and Europe. It began as a workshop held in 1989 in Grenoble France. Subsequently, CAV was organized as a conference by Edmund Clarke, Robert Kurshan, Amir Pnueli and Joseph Sifakis. It has been held each year since 1990. A list of past and planned CAV conferences by year can be found below. 
 The current steering committee of CAV consists of: 
 Orna Grumberg, The Technion 
 Aarti Gupta, Princeton University 
 Daniel Kröning, University of Oxford 
 Ken McMillan, UT Austin

Twenty-Second International Conference on Computability and Complexity in Analysis 
 September 24-26, 2025,Kyoto, Japan 

Scope 
 The conference is concerned with the theory of computability and complexity over real-valued data. 
 Computability and complexity theory are two central areas of research in mathematical logic and theoretical computer science. Computability theory is the study of the limitations and abilities of computers in principle. Computational complexity theory provides a framework for understanding the cost of solving computational problems, as measured by the requirement for resources such as time and space. The classical approach in these areas is to consider algorithms as operating on finite strings of symbols from a finite alphabet. Such strings may represent various discrete objects such as integers or algebraic expressions, but cannot represent general real or complex numbers, unless they are rounded. 
 Most mathematical models in physics and engineering, however are based on the real number concept. Thus, a computability theory and a complexity theory over the real numbers and over more general continuous data structures is needed. Despite remarkable progress in recent years many important fundamental problems have not yet been studied, and presumably numerous unexpected and surprising results are waiting to be detected. 
 Scientists working in the area of computation on real-valued data come from different fields, such as theoretical computer science, domain theory, logic, constructive mathematics computer arithmetic, numerical mathematics and all branches of analysis. The conference provides a unique opportunity for people from such diverse areas to meet, present work in progress and exchange ideas and knowledge. 
 The topics of interest include foundational work on various models and approaches for describing computability and complexity over the real numbers. They also include complexity-theoretic investigations, both foundational and with respect to concrete problems, and new implementations of exact real arithmetic, as well as further developments of already existing software packages. We hope to gain new insights into computability-theoretic aspects of various computational questions from physics and from other fields involving computations over the real numbers.

 Computable analysis 
 Complexity on real numbers 
 Computable numbers, subsets and functions 
 Theory of representations

 CCEM Overview 
 Conference Scope 
 The top-ratedCCEMconference series, which was introduced in 2012, is now hosting theThirteenth (13th) IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing in Emerging Markets (CCEM). 
 Over the past few years, cloud computing has been a dominating and revolutionary paradigm in information technology, and it is starting to have an impact on a wide range of sectors, including government, finance, telecommunications, education, retail, energy and utilities, and transportation. The research in cloud computing has become quite active and covers a wide range of topics, such as networking, storage, security, virtualization, efficient cloud architectures, enormous multi-tenancy, cloud application and service design, and cloud service administration. With AI algorithms, evaluating massive amounts of data to create content specifically for target audiences, content production has become more dynamic and focused. 
 Cloud computing continues to remain the future with studies suggesting more than 50% of all information technology will transition to a new paradigm within the next five to ten years. AI in the media and entertainment industry has seen a rise in innovation in this area too. AI has become increasingly important in gaming, podcasts, content suggestions, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, book publishing, film production, and marketing. This transformation has great implications for emerging markets which have the potential to leapfrog mature markets in their adoption of cloud computing, combine cloud computing and mobile technologies, AI, Gen AI & Meta AI etc. to introduce unique services that can transform the lives of billions, drive a much larger scale of adoption and challenge existing price points, while presenting unique challenges in areas such as security and user interfaces to Industry 4.0.

 October 13-17, 2025 
 Taipei, Taiwan 
 Call for Papers 
 (Please helpnominate PC members) 
 The 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice. Authors are encouraged to write the abstract and introduction of their paper in a way that makes the results accessible and compelling to a general computer-security researcher. In particular, authors should bear in mind that anyone on the program committee may be asked to review any paper. 
 CCS has two review cycles in 2025. For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made: 
 Accept: Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference, possibly after making minor changes with the oversight of a shepherd. 
 Minor revision: Papers in this category are considered to be promising but need some minor additional work (e.g., minor experiments, proofs to minor lemmas). Authors will be given the opportunity to resubmit such papers, with appropriate revisions, in which case they should clearly explain in a separate note how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers. The revised paper will then be re-evaluated, and either accepted or rejected. 
 Reject: Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Papers rejected from the first review cycle may not be submitted again (even in revised form) to the second review cycle. 
 Authors of each accepted paper must ensure that at least one author registers for the conference, and that their paper is presented in-person at the conference if at all possible. 
 Paper Submission Information 
 All submissions must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the corresponding deadline. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings. All submissions should be properly anonymized. 
 Papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. In the unusual case in which a third-person reference is infeasible, authors can blind the reference itself. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.Authors may submit up to a maximum of 7 papers for Cycle B. 
 All submitted papers will be evaluated based on their merits, particularly their importance to practical aspects of computer and communications security and privacy, novelty, quality of execution, and presentation. For papers that might raise ethical concerns, authors are expected to convince reviewers that proper procedures (such as IRB approval or responsible disclosure) have been followed, and due diligence has been made to minimize potential harm. 
 Submitted papers may be rejected for being out of scope, at the discretion of the PC chairs. Authors who have questions about whether their paper is in scope are encouraged to ask the PC chairs in advance. No modifications to the author list on a paper may be made after submission. 
 Mandatory Reviewing (New!) 
 Authors submitting 3 papers or more may be required to submit reviews for other papers at CCS 2025. Authors who fall into this category will be requested to provide information for review matching and complete an attestation for reviewing ethics. 
 Authors failing to provide the requested information may see their paper desk-rejected. 
 It is expected that reviewers will submit fair and thoughtful reviews on time. Reviews that do not meet this standard, such as exceptionally short reviews, reviews generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), reviews not relevant to the paper or that miss a substantial portion of the paper will be flagged and may be grounds for desk rejection of the reviewer’s papers at the discretion of the PC chairs. 
 Withdrawing Policy (New!) 
 A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper can not be withdrawn. 
 Paper Format 
 Submissions must be a PDF file in double-columnACM formatusing""sigconf""2-column format, no more than 12 pages long, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Note that reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material. Authors should not change the font or the margins of the ACM format. The CCS information such as concepts, keywords, or rights management information (e.g., DOI and ISBN) must be retained. The teaser figure is optional. Please refer to the sample-sigconf.tex and sample-sigconf.pdf in the ACM package (also mirroredhere) as an example. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review. 
 Providing Artifacts at Submission Time 
 Submissions whose claimed contributions rely on artifacts (e.g., code, models, data sets) are expected to make these accessible to the reviewers, unless there are good reasons not to, in which case these reasons must be mentioned in the submission. Submissions whose claimed contributions do not rely on artifacts do not need to submit artifacts. An anonymous link to a resource on the web is acceptable, provided the contents in the resource are also anonymized. 
 Optional Artifact Evaluation 
 A published scientific paper consists of a constellation of artifacts that extend beyond the document itself: software, hardware, evaluation data and documentation, raw survey results, mechanized proofs, models, test suites, benchmarks, and so on. To emphasize the importance of such artifacts, the benefits to the authors and the community as a whole, and promote the reproducibility of experimental results, ACM CCS will, for the second time, introduce an optional artifact evaluation (AE) process, inspired by similar efforts at several other conferences. All authors of accepted papers (including shepherd approved and minor revisions) are encouraged to submit artifacts for AE. Each artifact submitted will be reviewed by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC); a special call for artifacts will follow. 
 Conference Tracks 
 Like last year, the ACM CCS Conference features a multi-track format. Each track operates as a separate mini-conference, with its own Track Chairs and Track Program Committee. The overall process is managed by the Program Chairs (David Lie and Véronique Cortier). At the time of submission, authors must select one track, which should be the most relevant to the topic of the paper. We understand that some papers might span multiple topics. In specific cases, PC members might be asked to provide reviews for papers outside their track, in an effort to provide the best possible reviews to the authors. The chairs may decide to move a paper to another track.

 Conflicts of Interest 
 The conference requires cooperation from both authors and program-committee members to ensure a fair review process. For this purpose, authors must report all program-committee members who, in their opinion, have a conflict of interest and therefore may not be able to provide an unbiased review. Mandatory declared conflicts of interest include current or former doctoral advisor/advisee, members of the same institution, close family members, and recent co-authors (within the past 2 years). For any other declared conflict, authors are required to explain the nature of the conflict at the time of paper submission, which will be reviewed by the Program Chairs and the Track Chairs. The chairs reserve the right to request further explanation and can remove non-mandatory conflicts at their discretion. 
 Track Chairs are allowed to submit papers, and those papers will be handled by the Program Chairs. They are only allowed to submit two papers in their own track, and any number in other tracks. 
 Program-committee members who have a genuine conflict of interest with a paper, including the Program Chairs and the Track Chairs, will be excluded from evaluation and discussion of that paper. When a Track Program Chair has a conflict, the paper will be handled by the Program Chairs. When a Program Chair is conflicted, the other Co-Chair will be responsible for managing that paper. When both Program Chairs are in conflict, a committee member will be appointed to handle the paper. Program Chairs are not allowed to be authors or co-authors of any submissions. 
 Policy for Peer-Review Integrity 
 All SIGSAC sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities (https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment) and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics). Also all authors, PC members and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc). Particularly, we require all reviewers to uphold the integrity of the peer review process and avoid conflict of interest of any form (e.g., reviewer collusion ring). Those who violate these policies will be penalized according to ACM policies (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/penalties-for-publication-violations). If you would like to report a violation, please contact program chairs of your conferences/workshops or SIGSAC officers. We are committed to protecting the confidentiality of your communication.

 Diversity and Inclusion 
 ACM CCS is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our community. If you have suggestions, concerns, or complaints related to biases or sexual harassment, we encourage you to reach out to the Program Chairs. We are committed to protecting the anonymity of such reports and helping to address your concerns. We value your feedback and ideas to help us all build a healthier and more welcoming community. 
 We encourage the authors to be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Of course, exclusionary treatment can arise unintentionally. Be vigilant and actively guard against such issues in your writing. Reviewers will also be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise in your submissions. Please check thehref=""/ccs/CCS2025/diversity-and-inclusion/"" - link
for more information. 
 Agreements 
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to allACM Publications Policies, includinghref=""https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects"" - ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects
. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
 Please ensure that you and your co-authorsobtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made ahref=""https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs"" - commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors
. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

 CDstands forCross-Domain and means the integration and appraisal of different fields and application domains (e.g. health AI, Industry 4.0, etc.) to provide an atmosphere to foster different perspectives and opinions. The conference was dedicated to offer an international platform for novel ideas and a fresh look on the methodologies to put crazy ideas into Business for the benefit of the human. Serendipity is a desired effect, and shall cross-fertilize methodologies and transfer of algorithmic developments. 
 MAKEstands forMAchine Learning &KnowledgeExtraction. 
 Machine learningdeals with understanding intelligence for the design and development of algorithms that can learn from data and improve over time. The original definition was“the artificial generation of knowledge from experience”.The challenge is to discover relevantstructuralpatterns and/ortemporalpatterns (“knowledge”) in such data, which are often hidden and not accessible to a human. Today, machine learning is the fastest growing technical field, having many application domains, e.g. health, Industry 4.0, recommender systems, speech recognition, autonomous driving, etc. The challenge is in decision making under uncertainty, and probabilistic inference enormously influenced artificial intelligence and statistical learning. The inverse probability allows to infer unknowns, learn from data and make predictions to support decision making. Whether in social networks, recommender systems, health or Industry 4.0 applications, the increasingly complex data sets require efficient, useful and useable solutions for knowledge discovery andknowledge extraction.A synergistic combination of methodologies and approaches of two domains offer ideal conditions towards unraveling these challenges and to foster new, efficient and user-friendly machine learning algorithms and knowledge extraction tools: Human-Computer Interaction(HCI)and Knowledge Discovery/Data Mining(KDD), aiming at augmentinghuman intelligence with computational intelligenceand vice versa toward ahuman-centered AIapproach. 
 Consequently, successful Machine Learning & Knowledge extraction needs a concerted international effort without boundaries, supporting collaborative and integrative cross-disciplinary research between experts from 7 (the magical number seven +/- 0) fields.
