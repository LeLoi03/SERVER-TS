 ABZ 2025 – 11th International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods  

 Call for papers  
 The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.  
 The name ABZ goes back to the first conference in London in 2008, where the ASM, B and Z conference series were merged into a joint event. In the following years other formal methods were added, e.g. Alloy in 2010 (Orford, Canada), VDM in 2012 (Pisa, Italy), and TLA+ in 2014 (Toulouse, France). After the also successful 2016 conferences in Linz, Austria, and 2018 in Southampton, UK, it was decided to name the conference “ABZ: International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods”, to stress the openness for further state-based formal methods. We hope to continue many fruitful discussions between representatives of the individual methods in the past, which will bring us closer to the common goal of this research community: the creation of reliable and safe software and systems.  
 ABZ 2025 will have a main conference track, a case study track, a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops.

  Caution: there are some FAKE conferences that pretend to be ICFCA or ICCS conferences. The real ICFCA and ICCS conferences do not exist anymore. Fake conferences can be easily recognised because they do not have any FCA researchers on their committees. Furthermore, an internet search for the website domain name and ""scam"" or ""fake"" will provide evidence of the fake nature.

 History  
 ICFCA, CLA and ICCS are three highly relevant conferences in the field of formal concept analysis (FCA) and related areas. All three conferences contribute significantly to advancing the understanding and application of formal concept analysis. In particular:  
 On October 2023, representatives of the three conferences approved the merging of the three conferences  ICFCA,   CLA and ICCS   and creating a new joint event, the  International Joint Conference on Conceptual Knowledge Structures (CONCEPTS).   This merger aimed to create a unified and comprehensive forum for researchers, academics, and professionals from various disciplines interested in formal concept analysis, conceptual structures, and related fields to exchange ideas, present their research, and discuss the latest advancements in these areas. For this purpose, the overall organization of CONCEPTS will follow the existing rules and traditions of the three conferences.

 Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics  
 Robot algorithms are abstractions of computational processes that control or reason about motion and perception in the physical world. Because actions in the physical world are subject to physical laws and geometric constraints, the design and analysis of robot algorithms raises a unique combination of questions in control theory, computational and differential geometry, and computer science. Algorithms serve as a unifying theme in the multi-disciplinary field of robotics.  
 The Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations aims to bring together a group of about sixty researchers to discuss recent trends and important future directions of research on the algorithmic issues related to robotics and automation.

 FedCSIS 2025 Invited speakers and Keynotes   
  
 The mission   of the FedCSIS Conference Series is to provide a presentation, discussion and a reputable publication forum in computer science and intelligence systems. The forum invites researchers and practitioners from around the world to contribute their research results focused on their scientific and professional interests in a chosen area.  
 The FedCSIS conference consists of the Main Track  and Thematic Session  . Papers submitted to the Main Track can be assigned, by their authors, to Topical Areas,  which are managed by Topical Area Curators  . Based on the scope of the contribution, Topical Area Curators select its reviewers from the Main Track Program Committee  . Besides the Main Track, the authors may prefer to submit their papers to Thematic Session, which announce their own Calls for Thematic Session Papers  and are assisted by the FedCSIS Chairs in reaching out to the FedCSIS Community.  
 For all five Topical Areas, situated within a general domain of Computer Science, the continually emerging topic of Intelligence Systems stands as the common denominator. All Thematic Sessions also refer to the Intelligence Systems from different perspectives. They are regarded as a path toward introducing more Intelligence into Computer Science and IT.

 ADCOM 2024 seeks to share insights for a ‘Responsible AI’ framework to develop Artificial Intelligence safely and ethically based on the five core principles of fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy and safety. Sustainable, reliable, effective, and human-centered AI systems require responsible AI principles and perspectives not only from technological but also from ethical, legal, and socio-economic domains. This edition of ADCOM will also explore as a sub theme the democratization of access to AI with a need for Trust, Risk and Security Management (TRiSM) to enhance positive performance and societal gains that AI enables.

 The aim of ALENEX is to provide a forum for the presentation of original research in the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. 
 Typical submissions will include an extensive experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. 
 Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering. 
 Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to high-performance and cloud computing. 
 Proceedings will be posted online in January 2025. ALENEX is supported by SIAM. 
 Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect that interesting synergies will develop between the co-located conferences. 
 ALENEX will be held jointly with: 
 ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) 
 SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA)

 | About the Conference 
 +-------- 
  
 The aim of ALENEX is to provide a forum for the presentation of original 
 research in the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of 
 algorithms and data structures. Typical submissions will include an extensive 
 experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the 
 gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address 
 methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of 
 algorithms and data structures. 
  
 Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to 
 databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; 
 operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and 
 computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering. 
  
 Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for 
 advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel 
 computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to 
 high-performance and cloud computing. 
  
 Proceedings will be posted online in January 2025. ALENEX is supported by SIAM. 
  
 Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning 
 detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect 
 that interesting synergies will develop between the co-located conferences.

+-------- 
 | How to Participate 
 +-------- 
  
 == Format == 
 Submissions must be PDF, formatted according to the double column macro posted 
 here. (Note that there is also a single column macro, but ALENEX uses the 
 double-column one.) Submissions must not exceed 10 pages, excluding front 
 matter (title and abstract), references, and a clearly marked appendix (further 
 described below). 
  
 == Content == 
 Papers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract, which begins 
 with the title of the paper as well as a short abstract. This should be 
 followed by the main body of the paper that begins with a precise statement of 
 the problem considered, a succinct summary of the results obtained (emphasizing 
 the significance, novelty, and potential impact of the research), and a clear 
 comparison with related work. The remainder of the extended abstract should 
 provide sufficient details to allow the program committee to evaluate the 
 validity, quality, and relevance of the contribution. Clarity of presentation 
 is very important; the entire extended abstract should be written carefully, 
 taking into consideration that it will be read and evaluated by both experts 
 and non-experts, often under tight time constraints. 
  
 == Appendix and Additional data == 
 All details needed to verify the results must be provided. Supporting 
 materials, including proofs of theoretical claims and experimental details, 
 that do not fit in the 10 page limit should be given in an appendix. If more 
 appropriate, the full version may be given as the appendix. In both cases, 
 however, the authors should include in the main part specific pointers to the 
 relevant locations in the appendix. The appendix will be read by the program 
 committee members and subreviewers at their discretion and will not be 
 published as part of the proceedings. Thus, the paper without the appendix 
 should be able to stand on its own. Experimental and implementation results 
 (independent of paper type) must be reproducible and verifiable. Authors are 
 encouraged to put accompanying software and relevant data, in a repository 
 accessible to the reviewers. Authors are asked to indicate which of the 
 supporting materials will remain publicly available if their papers are 
 accepted. 
  
 == Double-blind == 
 ALENEX will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions 
 should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, 
 authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the 
 beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any 
 references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not ""We 
 build on our previous work ..."" but rather ""We build on the work of ...""). 
 Particular care needs to be taken with accompanying software or data, which 
 need to be linked anonymously (for example, via a DropBox folder or the like). 
 Upon registering a submission, the authors will declare conflicts of interest 
 with PC members. The purpose of lightweight double-blind reviewing is to help 
 PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper 
 without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if 
 they were to try. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft 
 versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post 
 drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on 
 their research ideas. We encourage authors with further questions on 
 double-blind reviewing to contact the PC chairs. 
  
 == Previous or Simultaneous Submissions == 
 Results previously published or accepted for publication in the proceedings of 
 another conference cannot be submitted. Simultaneous submissions of the results 
 to another conference with published proceedings are not allowed. Exempted are 
 workshops and conferences without formal proceedings, but possibly with 
 handouts containing short abstracts. Results that have already been accepted 
 (with or without revision) for publication in a journal at the time of their 
 submission to the symposium are not allowed. A paper submitted to a journal but 
 not yet accepted for publication can be submitted to the symposium. In such 
 cases, the authors must mention this on the front page of the submission and 
 clearly identify the status of the journal submission at the date of the full 
 paper submission deadline. 
  
 == Accepted Papers == 
 Final proceedings versions of accepted papers must use the same double column 
 formatting macro as the submissions. Title, abstract, and body of the paper 
 altogether must not exceed 12 pages, followed by unlimited references. If any 
 supporting material (including complete proofs of theoretical claims and 
 experimental details) does not fit in the specified limit, then the full 
 version of the paper containing this information must be referenced in the 
 conference version and made available at a public repository, such as arXiv, by 
 the time the final version is submitted. Where applicable, we encourage the 
 authors to make accompanying software and/or data publicly accessible, with 
 proper references in the paper. 
  
 == Artifact Evaluation == 
 To verify and facilitate reproducibility of the results described in ALENEX 
 papers, we encourage authors of accepted papers to submit their artifacts (e.g. 
 code and data) for Artifact Evaluation (AE). The artifact submission deadline 
 for accepted papers will be Sep. 9. A separate committee will examine the 
 artifacts, with notification by Oct. 13. Participation in artifact evaluation 
 is not mandatory and will not influence paper acceptance. However, AE results 
 will be considered when inviting top papers for journal publication. Papers 
 that pass Artifact Evaluation will be awarded SIAM badges for availability and 
 reproducibility, which will be printed directly on the papers giving the 
 readers greater confidence in the results presented in them. Participation in 
 the AE phase will not be made public except for the papers that receive badges. 

The Easy Chair submission site is available: 
 ) https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alenex25 

== Proceedings == 
 The proceedings will be posted online in mid-January 2025. 
  
 == Acceptance Notification == 
 The Program Committee chairs will distribute acceptance notices and final paper 
 submission instructions to authors of accepted papers in late August 2024. 
  
 SIAM will distribute a follow-up notice in early October 2024; a list of 
 accepted papers will be posted at this time.

 Abstract 
 Thepeaceable queens problemasks to determine the maximum number\(a(n)\)such that there is a placement of\(a(n)\)white queens and\(a(n)\)black queens on an\(n\times n\)chessboard so that no queen can capture any queen of the opposite color. 
 In this paper, we consider the peaceable queens problem and its variant on the toroidal board. For the regular board, we show that\(a(n)\le 0.1716n^{2}\), for all sufficiently large\(n\). This improves on the bound\(a(n)\le 0.25n^{2}\)of van Bommel and MacEachern [16]. 
 For the toroidal board, we provide new upper and lower bounds. Somewhat surprisingly, our bounds show that there is a sharp contrast in behaviour between the odd torus and the even torus. Our lower bounds are given by explicit constructions. For the upper bounds, we formulate the problem as a non-linear optimization problem with at most 100 variables, regardless of the size of the board. We solve our non-linear program exactly using modern optimization software. 
 We also provide a local search algorithm and a software implementation which converges very rapidly to solutions which appear optimal. Our algorithm is sufficiently robust that it works on both the regular and toroidal boards. For example, for the regular board, the algorithm quickly finds the so-calledAinley construction. Thus, our work provides some further evidence that the Ainley construction is indeed optimal.

The International Conference for Artificial Life (ALife) will be held at IT University of Copenhagen, July 22-26, 2024. 
 The theme of this year isExploring new frontiers: Building on the ancient traditions of the Vikings to travel to new and strange lands and discover new cultures and traditions, we want to dedicate ALIFE 2024 to the weird and wacky of ALIFE. In particular in a time where academic research is under pressure to be more applied, we will instead dedicate ALIFE 2024 to celebrate the fundamental science of artificial life. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 There are two options for submission:full paperorextended abstract. The format is exactly the same for both options. The difference resides in the number of pages and type of contents: 
 full papers have an 8-page maximum length (not including references) and should report on new, unpublished work; 
 extended abstracts are limited to a 2-page length (not including references) and can report on previously published work or preliminary results. 
 Please see the author guidelines on the conference website for detailed instructions and manuscript templates. 
 All submissions will undergo a detailed peer review process. Full papers will be reviewed for timeliness, novelty, scientific quality, sound methodology, and use of appropriate analysis techniques. Extended abstracts will be reviewed for timeliness, novelty, and quality. 
 Accepted submissions will be considered for oral or poster presentation, without distinction between full papers and extended abstracts. 
 Accepted submissions (both full papers and extended abstracts) will be published by MIT Press as open-access electronic proceedings.

 This year’s theme is Ciphers of Life, encouraging participants to explore the many ways that life encodes information, creates internal languages, and interacts in encrypted ways with its environment. Artificial life research focuses on understanding, replicating, and extending the fundamental principles of life. Much of this research involves creating artificial systems that exhibit life-like behaviors. 
 Classically, these endeavors are divided into three categories: Hardware research, wetware research, and software research. At ALIFE 2025 conference, the newest research in all three categories will be featured alongside artistic expressions, industry vendors, public events, and more. 
 About 
 Manuel is an interdisciplinary researcher at Araya Inc. working on mathematical approaches to agency and cognition.

Call for Special Sessions 
 CALL FOR SPECIAL SESSIONS 
 Extended Deadline: 28 February 2025— PASSED 
 ‍ 
 Original Deadline: 21 February 2025 
 Special sessions will be specially-themed tracks in the main conference. The idea is to attract high-quality submissions on topics of particular interest to our community. We are particularly interested in sessions that will set new directions for future research and bring new voices into our community. These sessions will be part of the main conference and will run alongside other conference sessions. 
  
 Organizing a special session provides an opportunity to explore in depth a particular topic within the main conference, and to bring new ideas and new people into the ALife community. We are open to any ideas you might have that might create a buzz around your topic or the conference in general, such as advertising the session outside of the usual ALife community or holding panel or group discussions as part of the session. 
  
 Submissions to your session will go through the main conference review system. As a session organizer, you would set the topic of the session, attract submissions through whatever means you wish, and chair the session at the conference. 
  
 Please note that special sessions are different from workshops. The main difference is that special sessions are part of the main conference - they share its review process and accepted submissions will appear in the proceedings. There will also be workshop sessions at ALIFE 2025, and a call for workshop proposals will be sent out separately. 
 ‍ 
 We welcome session proposals on any topic. 
 Submission Process 
 Every special session proposal should include: 
 Title of the special session 
 Name(s) and affiliation(s) of the organizer(s) with contact details 
 Short bio or CV of the organizer(s) 
 Description of the session theme, including why tis session theme deserves special attention from the ALife community (about 250 words) 
 What you propose to do to support the session, such as advertising it or in terms of organisation (about 150 words) 
 List of 3-5 senior reviewers suggestions relevant for your session 
 All proposals must should be submitted through followingform 
 Call for Workshop & Tutorial Proposals 
 CALL FOR WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS 
 Deadline:7 March 2025— PASSED 
 Workshops aim to promote and discuss new ideas and topics in the field of artificial life in a more informal context. Workshops might be organised as invited talks, panel discussions, or contributed talks. Each workshop slot will be 1.5 hours long. 
  
 ALIFE will provide the on-site logistics and links from the main conference website. The tutorial and workshop organisers are responsible for all other organisational issues. 
 Submission Process 
 Every workshop proposal should include: 
 Title of the workshop 
 Name(s) and affiliation(s) of the organizer(s) with contact details 
 Short bio or CV of the organizer(s) 
 A proposal describing the content and its importance for the ALIFE community (150-250 words)) 
 Roughly approximated number of participants 
 Planned duration: one or two 90-minutes slots. 
 All proposals must be sent to:href=""mailto:program2025@alife.org"" - program2025@alife.org
Call for Papers & Summaries 
 CALL FOR PAPERS 
 Deadline: 4 May 2025 
 Note that the following submission types differ significantly from previous years: 
 Full Papers [Deadline May 4th] 
 Full Papers are 3 to 8 pages long (not including references) and should report on new, unpublished work. Full Papers will be reviewed as self-contained work, and will undergo a double-blind review process, with the same review criteria as a journal paper. Accepted papers will be published by MIT press as open access conference proceedings. Accepted submissions will be assigned an oral or poster presentation. 
 Summaries [Deadline May 4th]: 
 Summariessummarize a previously published work. These are limited to a maximum of 2 pages (not including references).Summaries must report on work that has been peer reviewed and published already, e.g. in another conference or a journal. If the work has only been published as a preprint it should be submitted as a full paper.Summaries will not be included in the proceedings.They will be made publicly available but will not receive DOIs. Summaries will be reviewed for relevance to the conference, and will undergo a double-blind review process. Accepted submissions will be assigned an oral or poster presentation, but full papers will be given priority for oral presentations. 
 Late Breaking Abstracts [Deadline July 4th]: 
 Late Breaking Abstracts are limited to a maximum of 2-pages (not including references). They can report on new ideas and work in progress. Late Breaking Abstracts will be reviewed for relevance to the conference and quality, and will undergo a double-blind review process. Late breaking abstracts will not be included in the proceedings. Accepted Late Breaking Abstracts will be presented as posters during the conference. 
 REMINDER: Papers accepted into theArtifical LifeJournal (MIT Press)are automatically accepted into the ALIFE 2025 program as oral presentations. Regular registration is still required for in-person attendance, however online participants can attend their session for free.

 ALIFE 2024: The 2024 Conference on Artificial Life 
 IT University of Copenhagen 
 Copenhagen, Denmark, July 22-26, 2024 
  
 Conference website | href=""https://2024.alife.org/"" - https://2024.alife.org/ 
 Submission link | href=""https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alife2024"" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alife2024 
 Submission deadline | April 3, 2024 
 Topics:href=""/cfp/topic.cgi?tid=8983"" - artificial life
The International Conference for Artificial Life (ALife) will be held at IT University of Copenhagen, July 22-26, 2024. 
 The theme of this year isExploring new frontiers: Building on the ancient traditions of the Vikings to travel to new and strange lands and discover new cultures and traditions, we want to dedicate ALIFE 2024 to the weird and wacky of ALIFE. In particular in a time where academic research is under pressure to be more applied, we will instead dedicate ALIFE 2024 to celebrate the fundamental science of artificial life. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 There are two options for submission:full paperorextended abstract. The format is exactly the same for both options. The difference resides in the number of pages and type of contents: 
 full papers have an 8-page maximum length (not including references) and should report on new, unpublished work; 
 extended abstracts are limited to a 2-page length (not including references) and can report on previously published work or preliminary results. 
 Please see the author guidelines on the conference website for detailed instructions and manuscript templates. 
 All submissions will undergo a detailed peer review process. Full papers will be reviewed for timeliness, novelty, scientific quality, sound methodology, and use of appropriate analysis techniques. Extended abstracts will be reviewed for timeliness, novelty, and quality. 
 Accepted submissions will be considered for oral or poster presentation, without distinction between full papers and extended abstracts. 
 Accepted submissions (both full papers and extended abstracts) will be published by MIT Press as open-access electronic proceedings. 
 List of Topics 
 ALIFE 2024 will showcase a wide range of topics in Artificial Life, bringing together world-leading researchers to discuss the latest advances in the synthesis and simulation of living systems. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following aspects of Artificial Life: 
 Complex dynamical systems and networks 
 Artificial chemistry, origins of life, computational biology 
 Synthetic biology, protocells, and wet artificial life 
 Ecology and evolution 
 Bio-inspired, cognitive and evolutionary robotics, swarms 
 Artificial intelligence and machine learning 
 Perception, cognition, behavior 
 Social systems, artificial and alternative societies 
 Evolution of language, computational linguistics

 This year’s theme is Ciphers of Life, encouraging participants to explore the many ways that life encodes information, creates internal languages, and interacts in encrypted ways with its environment. Artificial life research focuses on understanding, replicating, and extending the fundamental principles of life. Much of this research involves creating artificial systems that exhibit life-like behaviors. 
 Classically, these endeavors are divided into three categories: Hardware research, wetware research, and software research. At ALIFE 2025 conference, the newest research in all three categories will be featured alongside artistic expressions, industry vendors, public events, and more. 
 About 
 Manuel is an interdisciplinary researcher at Araya Inc. working on mathematical approaches to agency and cognition.

Association for Algorithmic Learning Theory 
 The Association for Algorithmic Learning Theory (AALT) is an international organization created in 2018 to promote learning theory, primarily through the organization of the annual conference on Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT) and other related events. 
 Learning theory is the field in computer science and mathematics that studies all theoretical aspects of machine learning, including its algorithmic and statistical aspects. 
 The AALT organization consists of asteering committee, which includes the current program committee chairs of ALT, as well as other elected members. Among other things, the organization selects the future ALT PC chairs and local organizers, determines the conference location and dates, and makes a number of decisions to help promote the conference including sponsorships, publications, co-locations, and journal publications. 
 AALT has a sister organization, theAssociation for Computational Learning(ACL), with similar goals and mission, and a similar conference, the Conference on Learning Theory (COLT).

 Present CFP : 2024 
 The Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT) 2024 conference will be held in San Diego, CA on February 25-28th 2024. The conference is dedicated to all theoretical and algorithmic aspects of machine learning. We invite submissions with contributions to new or existing learning problems including, but not limited to: 
  
 Design and analysis of learning algorithms. 
 Statistical and computational learning theory. 
 Online learning algorithms and theory. 
 Optimization methods for learning. 
 Unsupervised, semi-supervised, and active learning. 
 Interactive learning, planning and control, and reinforcement learning. 
 Privacy-preserving data analysis. 
 Learning with additional societal and strategic considerations: e.g., fairness, economics. 
 Robustness of learning algorithms to adversarial agents. 
 Artificial neural networks, including deep learning. 
 High-dimensional and non-parametric statistics. 
 Adaptive data analysis and selective inference. 
 Learning with algebraic or combinatorial structure. 
 Bayesian methods in learning. 
 Learning in distributed and streaming settings. 
 Game theory and learning. 
 Learning from complex data: e.g., networks, time series. 
 Theoretical analysis of probabilistic graphical models. 
  
 While the primary focus of the conference is theoretical, authors are welcome to support their analysis by including relevant experimental results. 
  
 Accepted papers will be published electronically in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR), and will be presented at the conference as a full-length talk. Authors of accepted papers will have the option of opting out of the proceedings in favor of a 1-page extended abstract, which will point to an open access archival version of the full paper reviewed for ALT. 

Important dates 
  
 Paper submission deadline: September 26, 2023, Anywhere On Earth 
 Author feedback: Nov 11-17, 2023 
 Author notification: Mid-December, 2023 

Conference format 
  
 The conference will be in-person and will not be hybrid. At least one author of each accepted paper will be required to present their paper in-person at the conference. When travel is not possible, we encourage authors to find alternative presenters in the community attending the conference. 

Dual submission policy 
  
 Conferences: In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings may not be submitted to ALT. 
  
 Journals: Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that are already published in a journal at the time of submission may not be submitted to ALT. 
 Rebuttal phase 
  
 This year there will be a rebuttal phase during the review process. Authors will have an opportunity to provide a short response to the initial reviews.

 The Role of Research in Language Technology 
 The cutting-edge nature of Language Technology means that research is particularly important: there are many unsolved problems in the automated processing of spoken and written language, and in many cases we have only begun to scratch the surface. Research in Language Technology, which for our purposes covers a space that also includes Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics, draws on work in a diverse array of disciplines, including linguistics, psychology, philosophy and computer science, and now, with the increasing role played by statistical methods also mathematics. 
 Research Activity in Australasia 
 Given the wide range of contributing disciplines, research in Language Technology in Australia and New Zealand is carried out in many different contexts. The listing below provides pointers to clusters of activity that involve more than one or two individual researchers.

 Association for Machine Translations in the Americas 
 First Call for Proposals for 
 Emerging AI Breakthroughs and Challenges 
 in Translation Automation 
 A virtual one-day event under the auspices of AMTA 
 Thursday, 25 September 2025 
 The Board of Directors of AMTA (the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas) is pleased to announce the first call for proposals forEmerging AI Breakthroughs and Challenges in Translation Automation, a one-day virtual event to be held on Thursday, 25 September 2025. 
 While the demand for accurate, nuanced, and scalable multilingual communication continues to increase, the language services industry is scrambling to adopt technology that is advancing at such a rate that today’s solutions are quickly outdated. At the heart of this evolution lies a technological revolution:Generative AI, Agentic AI, and Reasoning-enabled Large Language Models (LLMs). These technologies are not only reshaping the landscape of translation automation—they are also redefining what’s possible in cross-lingual understanding and interaction. 
 The event will focus on advances in technologies and processes that leverage generative AI, agentic AI, Large Language Models, reasoning LLMs, Machine Translation, and any combination of them, that address challenges in multilingual communication and the provisioning of high-quality translation or interpretation. Moving beyond the explosion of hype that began with the general availability of ChatGPT in November 2022, this event is intended as a forum for a thoughtful exchange of ideas informed by successes and failures in applying these technologies to the challenges of cross-lingual communication and data processing. 
 We invite researchers, developers, and practitioners to contribute to a substantive dialogue at the intersection ofAI innovation and multilingual challenges. This conference will explore cutting-edge approaches leveraging the power of generative and agentic AI models to tackle real-world translation issues, enhance automation pipelines, and build smarter, context-aware, and culturally sensitive systems. From low-resource language solutions to adaptive workflows and autonomous reasoning in translation tasks, this conference is a chance to exchange bold ideas, explore novel methodologies, and present impactful case studies. 
 Like all AMTA conferences, this event will bring together researchers, practitioners, and providers of cross-lingual technology from academia, industry, and government and will include a keynote talk, an expert panel discussion, individual presentations, succinct tutorials, and demonstrations from technology providers. 
 The organizing committee is seeking proposals for presentations and tutorials on all topics related to research, development, application, and evaluation of these technologies as they apply to cross- and multilingual technology(ies). Our goal is to have a program that brings real value to the various constituents of the MT community (researchers, developers, users, and language professionals). We welcome not only proposals on technical research and development topics but also on, for instance, the collection and curation of training data, best practices in training models, human/computer interaction among translators, interpreters, and the evolution of translation automation in the commercial translation production pipeline. 
 Developers, practitioners, and analysts from the R&D community, language services industry, and public sector are encouraged to submit proposals that cover leading-edge R&D and practical applications of MT, LLMs, and agentic AI as they relate to the creation or processing of cross- and multilingual content. 
 Members of the research community are encouraged to submit proposals to this non-archival event that address recent research directions, trends and concerns about the use of generative AI or suggestions for research projects. 
 We seek submissions for: 
 20-minute talks (15 minute presentations, plus 5 minutes for questions), 
 40-minute tutorials (practical descriptions or exercises concerning the use of generative AI, agentic AI, Machine Translation, and/or related tools, processes and technologies for cross- and multilingual tasks. 
 Topics of interest might include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 The use of Large Language Models for Translation, Transcreation, and other cross- and multilingual tasks: | development, deployment, and adaptation to specific use-cases. 
 Application of agentic and reasoning LLMs to translation automation: | case studies and experiments describing the application of agentive and reasoning LLMs to the generation and execution of dynamic translation workflows that optimize translation quality and/or other objectives. 
 Adaptation and customization of large language models for cross- and multilingual use cases: | case studies on applying few-shot learning, RAG, prompt-tuning and fine-tuning, comparison of methodologies used to adapt and customize foundation models for specific tasks with respect to business, technical and linguistic requirements. 
 Combining narrow and large models to improve performance of specific tasks, | such as translation, OCR, ASR and others. 
 Augmenting MT systems and other Human Language Technologies (HLT) with AI: | including approaches to leveraging TM and end-user feedback, classification, context awareness, content moderation, sentiment analysis, domain-specificity, geolocation, summarization. 
 Integrating MT into AI-powered TRS workflows: | transcription translation and optimization, domain-specific processing, multilingual entity intelligence, summarization and roundup, etc. 
 Training Data: | data sources, data preparation, terminology, knowledge graphs, data augmentation, multimodal data, etc. 
 Output quality and confidence scoring for cross- and multilingual tasks: | tools, methods and metrics, such as human evaluations, automatic scoring, reference-based and source-only scoring. 
 Challenges to adopting AI in cross- and multilingual use cases: | Responsible deployment and regulatory considerations of generative AI (such as technical, ethical, social, legal, and environmental challenges). 
 Generative and agentive AI use for professional translation: | Approaches, success and failure stories, fair pricing models, and cognitive load. 
 Business Cases: | making the business case for or against adopting AI to drive business requirements. 
 Future research directions: | open problems that researchers are/should be considering in this area. 
 Important dates 
 Submission deadline: 23 June 2025 
 Notification of acceptance: 21 July 2025 
 Submission Instructions 
 Proposals should be submitted in PDF format by23 June 2025, tohref=""mailto:submissions@amtaweb.org"" - submissions@amtaweb.org

 Any special technical requirements you may have 
 Publication and recording 
 Presentation proposals will be reviewed and selected by an AMTA-selected program committee based on submitted, non-anonymous abstracts. Accepted abstracts will be available to conference attendees on the conference platform and will otherwise not be published. Any research papers submitted for presentation will also follow this same process and will not follow a double-blind peer review process. Video recordings will be made of each presentation and will be made available to association members on the AMTA website. Submission of a proposal will be understood by the Organizing Committee as your tacit permission for AMTA to create an audio and video recording of your presentation and make it available to conference attendees and, through archiving, to members of AMTA, EAMT, and AAMT. 
 Background 
 AMTA, the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas, is well known for its biennial conferences, held since 1994, and for its sponsorship and organization of the MT Summit in 1991, 1997, 2003, 2009, 2015, and 2021. Although the next in-person AMTA conference will not be held until 2026, the board of directors unanimously agreed that the pace of development in and rapid adoption of AI warranted the organizing and hosting of our second one-day virtual event. 
 We look forward to receiving your proposal!

 to ANT 2025 
 The 16th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies (ANT 2025) is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies related areas. ANT 2025 will be held in conjunction withthe 8th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40). 
 Ambient systems can be viewed as interconnected systems that exist anywhere and everywhere in the environment. These systems are able to work together in the network collaboratively or competitively to provide human users with their daily technological needs, during which these systems remain invisible. This concept has emerged as a major research area with many potential applications. This is because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the themes required such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, networks and communications, data science, Internet of Things, Smart Entities, etc. 
 ANT will be held in Patra Greece. Patra is Greece's third largest, and the regional capital and largest city of western Greece, in the northern Peloponnese, 215 km west of Athens. As of the 2021 census, the municipality of Patras has a population of 215,922, while the urban population is 173.600. Patras and its region are home to various Ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine Monuments including the Roman Odeon, the Fortress of Rio, and the Castle of Patras. Patras is a relatively newly built city, as its medieval buildings were destroyed in the Greek War of Independence. The Patras Carnival is the largest event of its kind in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe, with a heritage reaching back 160 years. 
 Patras is an important educational center in Greece, home to several institutions of higher education, including the prestigious University of Patras, which is the third largest university in Greece with the respect to the size of the student body, the staff, and the number of departments. and most respected universities. The university of Patras is considered one of the top-ranked universities in Greece and has been placed in the top 200 universities in subject areas. In 2019, the student population was more than 33,000 (29,901 at the undergraduate level and 3,931 at the postgraduate level). 
 All ANT 2025 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series on-line. Procedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), and will be freely available worldwide. All papers in Procedia will be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and by Thomson Reuters' Conference Proceeding Citation Index (https://thomsonreuters.com/conference-proceedings-citation-index/). All papers in Procedia will also be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and Engineering Village (Ei) (www.engineeringvillage.com). This includes EI Compendex (www.ei.org/compendex). Moreover, all accepted papers will be indexed in DBLP (https://dblp.uni-trier.de/). The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers.

 2025 International Conference on Probabilistic, Combinatorial and Asymptotic Methods for the Analysis of Algorithms (AofA 2025)  
 May 5 - 9, 2025  , The Fields Institute Location:  Fields Institute, Room 230  

 Description  
 Analysis of Algorithms (AofA) is a field at the boundary of computer science and mathematics. The goal is to obtain a precise understanding of the asymptotic, average-case characteristics of algorithms and data structures. A unifying theme is the use of probabilistic, combinatorial, and analytic methods. The objects to be studied include random branching processes, graphs, permutations, trees, and strings.  
 The area of Analysis of Algorithms is frequently traced to 27 July 1963, when Donald E. Knuth wrote ""Notes on Open Addressing"". His fundamental books, The Art of Computer Programming, established ties between areas of study that include discrete mathematics, combinatorics, probability theory, analytic number theory, asymptotic analysis, and complexity theory.  
 Thirty years after Knuth's pioneering paper, the first seminar entirely devoted to the Analysis of Algorithms was held at Dagstuhl, Germany, in 1993. Since 1993, several series of seminars related to the analysis of algorithms have been established. These take place on an annual schedule. The rich history of meetings in this research area can be seen at https://www.math.aau.at/AofA/meetings/ This is the 36th edition of the conference and just the second one in Canada (the 23rd AofA was in Montreal in 2012). The organizing committee has selected the Fields Institute as the best place in Canada to welcome these worldwide experts and showcase the Canadian research environment.  
 In this research area we aim at studying discrete objects that appear as data structures or algorithms (including graphs, networks, and so on) by mathematical methods, in particular by probabilistic, combinatorial and asymptotic methods. The topics include but are not limited to:  
 • Properties of large random data structures  
  • Probabilistic methods for the analysis of algorithms  
  • Combinatorial methods for the analysis of algorithms  
  • Analytic tools for the analysis of algorithms  
  • Average case analysis of classical or new algorithms  
  • Analytic and enumerative combinatorics  
  • Random trees and graphs  
  • Branching processes  
  • Stochastic processes in relation with random discrete structures  
  • Random walks  
  • Discrete probabilities  
  • Random generation of combinatorial structures  
  • Performance evaluation, and more.  
 We will encourage participation from students and early-career researchers – both domestic and international – and expect that the topics presented in this workshop will positively influence their future careers, both in terms of opening new scientific avenues and also providing them with exposure to top-level research and professors in these areas.

 Fringe Trees for Random Trees with Given Vertex Degrees  
 Authors:  Gabriel Berzunza Ojeda, Cecilia Holmgren, and Svante Janson  
  Abstract    
 We prove that the number of fringe subtrees, isomorphic to a given tree, in uniformly random trees with given vertex degrees, asymptotically follows a normal distribution. As an application, we establish the same asymptotic normality for random simply generated trees (conditioned Galton-Watson trees). Our approach relies on an extension of Gao and Wormald’s (2004) theorem to the multivariate setting.

 Enumeration and Succinct Encoding of AVL Trees  
 Authors:  Jeremy Chizewer, Stephen Melczer, J. Ian Munro, and Ava Pun  
  Abstract    
 We use a novel decomposition to create succinct data structures - supporting a wide range of operations on static trees in constant time - for a variety of tree classes, extending results of Munro, Nicholson, Benkner, and Wild. Motivated by the class of AVL trees, we further derive asymptotics for the information-theoretic lower bound on the number of bits needed to store tree classes whose generating functions satisfy certain functional equations. In particular, we prove that AVL trees require approximately 0.938 bits per node to encode.

 Maximal Number of Subword Occurrences in a Word  
 Authors:  Wenjie Fang  
  Abstract    
 We consider the number of occurrences of subwords (non-consecutive sub-sequences) in a given word. We first define the notion of subword entropy of a given word that measures the maximal number of occurrences among all possible subwords. We then give upper and lower bounds of minimal subword entropy for words of fixed length in a fixed alphabet, and also showing that minimal subword entropy per letter has a limit value. A better upper bound of minimal subword entropy for a binary alphabet is then given by looking at certain families of periodic words. We also give some conjectures based on experimental observations.

 Sparsification of Phylogenetic Covariance Matrices of k-Regular Trees  
 Authors:  Sean Svihla and Manuel E. Lladser  
  Abstract    
 Consider a tree T = (V,E) with root ∘ and an edge length function 𝓁:E → ℝ_+. The phylogenetic covariance matrix of T is the matrix C with rows and columns indexed by L, the leaf set of T, with entries C(i,j): = ∑_{e ∈ [i∧ j,o]}𝓁(e), for each i,j ∈ L. Recent work [Gorman & Lladser 2023] has shown that the phylogenetic covariance matrix of a large but random binary tree T is significantly sparsified, with overwhelmingly high probability, under a change-of-basis to the so-called Haar-like wavelets of T. Notably, this finding enables manipulating the spectrum of covariance matrices of large binary trees without the necessity to store them in computer memory but instead performing two post-order traversals of the tree [Gorman & Lladser 2023]. Building on the methods of the aforesaid paper, this manuscript further advances their sparsification result to encompass the broader class of k-regular trees, for any given k ≥ 2. This extension is achieved by refining existing asymptotic formulas for the mean and variance of the internal path length of random k-regular trees, utilizing hypergeometric function properties and identities.

 Bit-Array-Based Alternatives to HyperLogLog  
 Authors:  Svante Janson, Jérémie Lumbroso, and Robert Sedgewick  
  Abstract    
 We present a family of algorithms for the problem of estimating the number of distinct items in an input stream that are simple to implement and are appropriate for practical applications. Our algorithms are a logical extension of the series of algorithms developed by Flajolet and his coauthors starting in 1983 that culminated in the widely used HyperLogLog algorithm. These algorithms divide the input stream into M substreams and lead to a time-accuracy tradeoff where a constant number of bits per substream are saved to achieve a relative accuracy proportional to 1/√M. Our algorithms use just one or two bits per substream. Their effectiveness is demonstrated by a proof of approximate normality, with explicit expressions for standard errors that inform parameter settings and allow proper quantitative comparisons with other methods. Hypotheses about performance are validated through experiments using a realistic input stream, with the conclusion that our algorithms are more accurate than HyperLogLog when using the same amount of memory, and they use two-thirds as much memory as HyperLogLog to achieve a given accuracy.

 Phase Transition for Tree-Rooted Maps  
 Authors:  Marie Albenque, Éric Fusy, and Zéphyr Salvy  
  Abstract    
 We introduce a model of tree-rooted planar maps weighted by their number of 2-connected blocks. We study its enumerative properties and prove that it undergoes a phase transition. We give the distribution of the size of the largest 2-connected blocks in the three regimes (subcritical, critical and supercritical) and further establish that the scaling limit is the Brownian Continuum Random Tree in the critical and supercritical regimes, with respective rescalings √{n/log(n)} and √n.

 Composition Schemes: q-Enumerations and Phase Transitions in Gibbs Models  
 Authors:  Cyril Banderier, Markus Kuba, Stephan Wagner, and Michael Wallner  
  Abstract    
 Composition schemes are ubiquitous in combinatorics, statistical mechanics and probability theory. We give a unifying explanation to various phenomena observed in the combinatorial and statistical physics literature in the context of q-enumeration (this is a model where objects with a parameter of value k have a Gibbs measure/Boltzmann weight q^k). For structures enumerated by a composition scheme, we prove a phase transition for any parameter having such a Gibbs measure: for a critical value q = q_c, the limit law of the parameter is a two-parameter Mittag-Leffler distribution, while it is Gaussian in the supercritical regime (q > q_c), and it is a Boltzmann distribution in the subcritical regime (0 < q < q_c). We apply our results to fundamental statistics of lattice paths and quarter-plane walks. We also explain previously observed limit laws for pattern-restricted permutations, and a phenomenon uncovered by Krattenthaler for the wall contacts in watermelons.

 Galled Tree-Child Networks  
 Authors:  Yu-Sheng Chang, Michael Fuchs, and Guan-Ru Yu  
  Abstract    
 We propose the class of galled tree-child networks which is obtained as intersection of the classes of galled networks and tree-child networks. For the latter two classes, (asymptotic) counting results and stochastic results have been proved with very different methods. We show that a counting result for the class of galled tree-child networks follows with similar tools as used for galled networks, however, the result has a similar pattern as the one for tree-child networks. In addition, we also consider the (suitably scaled) numbers of reticulation nodes of random galled tree-child networks and show that they are asymptotically normal distributed. This is in contrast to the limit laws of the corresponding quantities for galled networks and tree-child networks which have been both shown to be discrete.

 On Fluctuations of Complexity Measures for the FIND Algorithm  
 Authors:  Jasper Ischebeck and Ralph Neininger  
  Abstract    
 The FIND algorithm (also called Quickselect) is a fundamental algorithm to select ranks or quantiles within a set of data. It was shown by Grübel and Rösler that the number of key comparisons required by FIND as a process of the quantiles α ∈ [0,1] in a natural probabilistic model converges after normalization in distribution within the càdlàg space D[0,1] endowed with the Skorokhod metric. We show that the process of the residuals in the latter convergence after normalization converges in distribution to a mixture of Gaussian processes in D[0,1] and identify the limit’s conditional covariance functions. A similar result holds for the related algorithm QuickVal. Our method extends to other cost measures such as the number of swaps (key exchanges) required by FIND or cost measures which are based on key comparisons but take into account that the cost of a comparison between two keys may depend on their values, an example being the number of bit comparisons needed to compare keys given by their bit expansions.

 A Bijection for the Evolution of B-Trees  
 Authors:  Fabian Burghart and Stephan Wagner  
  Abstract    
 A B-tree is a type of search tree where every node (except possibly for the root) contains between m and 2m keys for some positive integer m, and all leaves have the same distance to the root. We study sequences of B-trees that can arise from successively inserting keys, and in particular present a bijection between such sequences (which we call histories) and a special type of increasing trees. We describe the set of permutations for the keys that belong to a given history, and also show how to use this bijection to analyse statistics associated with B-trees.

 Tree Walks and the Spectrum of Random Graphs  
 Authors:  Eva-Maria Hainzl and Élie de Panafieu  
  Abstract    
 It is a classic result in spectral theory that the limit distribution of the spectral measure of random graphs G(n,p) converges to the semicircle law in case np tends to infinity with n. The spectral measure for random graphs G(n,c/n) however is less understood. In this work, we combine and extend two combinatorial approaches by Bauer and Golinelli (2001) and Enriquez and Menard (2016) and approximate the moments of the spectral measure by counting walks that span trees.

 Asymptotics of Weighted Reflectable Walks in A₂  
 Authors:  Torin Greenwood and Samuel Simon  
  Abstract    
 Lattice walks are used to model various physical phenomena. In particular, walks within Weyl chambers connect directly to representation theory via the Littelmann path model. We derive asymptotics for centrally weighted lattice walks within the Weyl chamber corresponding to A₂ by using tools from analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV). We find universality classes depending on the weights of the walks, in line with prior results on the weighted Gouyou-Beauchamps model. Along the way, we identify a type of singularity within a multivariate rational generating function that is not yet covered by the theory of ACSV. We conjecture asymptotics for this type of singularity.

 On the Number of Distinct Fringe Subtrees in Binary Search Trees  
 Authors:  Stephan Wagner  
  Abstract    
 A fringe subtree of a rooted tree is a subtree that consists of a vertex and all its descendants. The number of distinct fringe subtrees in random trees has been studied by several authors, notably because of its connection to tree compaction algorithms. Here, we obtain a very precise result for binary search trees: it is shown that the number of distinct fringe subtrees in a binary search tree with n leaves is asymptotically equal to (c₁n)/(log n) for a constant c₁ ≈ 2.4071298335, both in expectation and with high probability. This was previously shown to be a lower bound, our main contribution is to prove a matching upper bound. The method is quite general and can also be applied to similar problems for other tree models.

 Early Typical Vertices in Subcritical Random Graphs of Preferential Attachment Type  
 Authors:  Peter Mörters and Nick Schleicher  
  Abstract    
 We study the size of the connected component of early typical vertices in a subcritical inhomogeneous random graph with a kernel of preferential attachment type. The principal tools in our analysis are, first, a coupling of the neighbourhood of a typical vertex in the graph to a killed branching random walk and, second, an asymptotic result for the number of particles absorbed at the killing barrier in this branching random walk.

 Asymptotics of Relaxed k-Ary Trees  
 Authors:  Manosij Ghosh Dastidar and Michael Wallner  
  Abstract    
 A relaxed k-ary tree is an ordered directed acyclic graph with a unique source and sink in which every node has out-degree k. These objects arise in the compression of trees in which some repeated subtrees are factored and repeated appearances are replaced by pointers. We prove an asymptotic theta-result for the number of relaxed k-ary tree with n nodes for n → ∞. This generalizes the previously proved binary case to arbitrary finite arity, and shows that the seldom observed phenomenon of a stretched exponential term e^{c n^{1/3}} appears in all these cases. We also derive the recurrences for compacted k-ary trees in which all subtrees are unique and minimal deterministic finite automata accepting a finite language over a finite alphabet.

 Matching Algorithms in the Sparse Stochastic Block Model  
 Authors:  Anna Brandenberger, Byron Chin, Nathan S. Sheffield, and Divya Shyamal  
  Abstract    
 In sparse Erdős-Rényi graphs, it is known that a linear-time algorithm of Karp and Sipser achieves near-optimal matching sizes asymptotically almost surely, giving a law-of-large numbers for the matching numbers of such graphs in terms of solutions to an ODE [Jonathan Aronson et al., 1998]. We provide an extension of this analysis, identifying broad ranges of stochastic block model parameters for which the Karp-Sipser algorithm achieves near-optimal matching sizes, but demonstrating that it cannot perform optimally on general stochastic block model instances. We also consider the problem of constructing a matching online, in which the vertices of one half of a bipartite stochastic block model arrive one-at-a-time, and must be matched as they arrive. We show that, when the expected degrees in all communities are equal, the competitive ratio lower bound of 0.837 found by Mastin and Jaillet for the Erdős-Rényi case [Andrew Mastin and Patrick Jaillet, 2013] is achieved by a simple greedy algorithm, and this competitive ratio is optimal. We then propose and analyze a linear-time online matching algorithm with better performance in general stochastic block models.

 Lexicographic Unranking Algorithms for the Twelvefold Way  
 Authors:  Amaury Curiel and Antoine Genitrini  
  Abstract    
 The Twelvefold Way represents Rota’s classification, addressing the most fundamental enumeration problems and their associated combinatorial counting formulas. These distinct problems are connected to enumerating functions defined from a set of elements denoted by 𝒩 into another one 𝒦. The counting solutions for the twelve problems are well known. We are interested in unranking algorithms. Such an algorithm is based on an underlying total order on the set of structures we aim at constructing. By taking the rank of an object, i.e. its number according to the total order, the algorithm outputs the structure itself after having built it. One famous total order is the lexicographic order: it is probably the one that is the most used by people when one wants to order things. While the counting solutions for Rota’s classification have been known for years it is interesting to note that three among the problems have yet no lexicographic unranking algorithm. In this paper we aim at providing algorithms for the last three cases that remain without such algorithms. After presenting in detail the solution for set partitions associated with the famous Stirling numbers of the second kind, we explicitly explain how to adapt the algorithm for the two remaining cases. Additionally, we propose a detailed and fine-grained complexity analysis based on the number of bitwise arithmetic operations.

 Periodic Behavior of the Minimal Colijn-Plazzotta Rank for Trees with a Fixed Number of Leaves  
 Authors:  Michael R. Doboli, Hsien-Kuei Hwang, and Noah A. Rosenberg  
  Abstract    
 The Colijn-Plazzotta ranking is a certain bijection between the unlabeled binary rooted trees and the positive integers, such that the integer associated with a tree is determined from the integers associated with the two immediate subtrees of its root. Letting a_n denote the minimal Colijn-Plazzotta rank among all trees with a specified number of leaves n, the sequence {a_n} begins 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 11, 20, 22, 28, 29, 53, 56, 66, 67 (OEIS A354970). Here we show that a_n ∼ 2 [2^{P(log₂ n)}]ⁿ, where P varies as a periodic function dependent on {log₂ n} and satisfies 1.24602 < 2^{P(log₂ n)} < 1.33429.

 Binomial Sums and Mellin Asymptotics with Explicit Error Bounds: A Case Study  
 Authors:  Benjamin Hackl and Stephan Wagner  
  Abstract    
 Making use of a newly developed package in the computer algebra system SageMath, we show how to perform a full asymptotic analysis by means of the Mellin transform with explicit error bounds. As an application of the method, we answer a question of Bóna and DeJonge on 132-avoiding permutations with a unique longest increasing subsequence that can be translated into an inequality for a certain binomial sum.

 Multicoloured Hardcore Model: Fast Mixing and Its Applications as a Scheduling Algorithm  
 Authors:  Sam Olesker-Taylor  
  Abstract    
 In the hardcore model, certain vertices in a graph are active: the active vertices must form an independent set. We extend this to a multicoloured version: instead of simply being active or not, the active vertices are assigned a colour; active vertices of the same colour must not be adjacent. This models a scenario in which two neighbouring resources may interfere when active - eg, short-range radio communication. However, there are multiple channels (colours) available; they only interfere if both use the same channel. Other applications include routing in fibreoptic networks. We analyse Glauber dynamics. Vertices update their status at random times, at which a uniform colour is proposed: the vertex is assigned that colour if it is available; otherwise, it is set inactive. We find conditions for fast mixing of these dynamics. We also use them to model a queueing system: vertices only serve customers in their queue whilst active. The mixing estimates are applied to establish positive recurrence of the queue lengths, and bound their expectation in equilibrium.

 Binary Search Trees of Permuton Samples  
 Authors:  Benoît Corsini, Victor Dubach, and Valentin Féray  
  Abstract    
 Binary search trees (BST) are a popular type of structure when dealing with ordered data. They allow efficient access and modification of data, with their height corresponding to the worst retrieval time. From a probabilistic point of view, BSTs associated with data arriving in a uniform random order are well understood, but less is known when the input is a non-uniform permutation. We consider here the case where the input comes from i.i.d. random points in the plane with law μ, a model which we refer to as a permuton sample. Our results show that the asymptotic proportion of nodes in each subtree only depends on the behavior of the measure μ at its left boundary, while the height of the BST has a universal asymptotic behavior for a large family of measures μ. Our approach involves a mix of combinatorial and probabilistic tools, namely combinatorial properties of binary search trees, coupling arguments, and deviation estimates.

 The Recurrence/Transience of Random Walks on a Bounded Grid in an Increasing Dimension  
 Authors:  Shuma Kumamoto, Shuji Kijima, and Tomoyuki Shirai  
  Abstract    
 It is celebrated that a simple random walk on ℤ and ℤ² returns to the initial vertex v infinitely many times during infinitely many transitions, which is said recurrent, while it returns to v only finite times on ℤ^d for d ≥ 3, which is said transient. It is also known that a simple random walk on a growing region on ℤ^d can be recurrent depending on growing speed for any fixed d. This paper shows that a simple random walk on {0,1,…,N}ⁿ with an increasing n and a fixed N can be recurrent depending on the increasing speed of n. Precisely, we are concerned with a specific model of a random walk on a growing graph (RWoGG) and show a phase transition between the recurrence and transience of the random walk regarding the growth speed of the graph. For the proof, we develop a pausing coupling argument introducing the notion of weakly less homesick as graph growing (weakly LHaGG).

 The Alternating Normal Form of Braids and Its Minimal Automaton  
 Authors:  Vincent Jugé and June Roupin  
  Abstract    
 The alternating normal form of braids is a well-known normal form on standard braid monoids. This normal form is regular: the language it identifies with is regular. We give a characterisation of the minimal automaton of this language and compute its size, both in terms of number of states and of transitions, depending on the number of generators of the monoid.

 Analysis of Regular Sequences: Summatory Functions and Divide-And-Conquer Recurrences  
 Authors:  Clemens Heuberger, Daniel Krenn, and Tobias Lechner  
  Abstract    
 In the asymptotic analysis of regular sequences as defined by Allouche and Shallit, it is usually advisable to study their summatory function because the original sequence has a too fluctuating behaviour. It might be that the process of taking the summatory function has to be repeated if the sequence is fluctuating too much. In this paper we show that for all regular sequences except for some degenerate cases, repeating this process finitely many times leads to a ""nice"" asymptotic expansion containing periodic fluctuations whose Fourier coefficients can be computed using the results on the asymptotics of the summatory function of regular sequences by the first two authors of this paper. In a recent paper, Hwang, Janson, and Tsai perform a thorough investigation of divide-and-conquer recurrences. These can be seen as 2-regular sequences. By considering them as the summatory function of their forward difference, the results on the asymptotics of the summatory function of regular sequences become applicable. We thoroughly investigate the case of a polynomial toll function.

 Patricia’s Bad Distributions  
 Authors:  Louigi Addario-Berry, Pat Morin, and Ralph Neininger  
  Abstract    
 The height of a random PATRICIA tree built from independent, identically distributed infinite binary strings with arbitrary diffuse probability distribution μ on {0,1}^ℕ is studied. We show that the expected height grows asymptotically sublinearly in the number of leaves for any such μ, but can be made to exceed any specific sublinear growth rate by choosing μ appropriately.

 Limit Laws for Critical Dispersion on Complete Graphs  
 Authors:  Umberto De Ambroggio, Tamás Makai, Konstantinos Panagiotou, and Annika Steibel  
  Abstract    
 We consider a synchronous process of particles moving on the vertices of a graph G, introduced by Cooper, McDowell, Radzik, Rivera and Shiraga (2018). Initially, M particles are placed on a vertex of G. In subsequent time steps, all particles that are located on a vertex inhabited by at least two particles jump independently to a neighbour chosen uniformly at random. The process ends at the first step when no vertex is inhabited by more than one particle; we call this (random) time step the dispersion time. In this work we study the case where G is the complete graph on n vertices and the number of particles is M = n/2+α n^{1/2} + o(n^{1/2}), α ∈ ℝ. This choice of M corresponds to the critical window of the process, with respect to the dispersion time. We show that the dispersion time, if rescaled by n^{-1/2}, converges in p-th mean, as n → ∞ and for any p ∈ ℝ, to a continuous and almost surely positive random variable T_α. We find that T_α is the absorption time of a standard logistic branching process, thoroughly investigated by Lambert (2005), and we determine its expectation. In particular, in the middle of the critical window we show that 𝔼[T₀] = π^{3/2}/√7, and furthermore we formulate explicit asymptotics when |α| gets large that quantify the transition into and out of the critical window. We also study the random variable counting the total number of jumps that are performed by the particles until the dispersion time is reached and prove that, if rescaled by nln(n), it converges to 2/7 in probability.

 Asymptotic Enumeration of Rooted Binary Unlabeled Galled Trees with a Fixed Number of Galls  
 Authors:  Lily Agranat-Tamir, Michael Fuchs, Bernhard Gittenberger, and Noah A. Rosenberg  
  Abstract    
 Galled trees appear in problems concerning admixture, horizontal gene transfer, hybridization, and recombination. Building on a recursive enumerative construction, we study the asymptotic behavior of the number of rooted binary unlabeled (normal) galled trees as the number of leaves n increases, maintaining a fixed number of galls g. We find that the exponential growth with n of the number of rooted binary unlabeled normal galled trees with g galls has the same value irrespective of the value of g ≥ 0. The subexponential growth, however, depends on g; it follows c_g n^{2g-3/2}, where c_g is a constant dependent on g. Although for each g, the exponential growth is approximately 2.4833ⁿ, summing across all g, the exponential growth is instead approximated by the much larger 4.8230ⁿ.

 Sharpened Localization of the Trailing Point of the Pareto Record Frontier  
 Authors:  James Allen Fill, Daniel Q. Naiman, and Ao Sun  
  Abstract    
 For d ≥ 2 and i.i.d. d-dimensional observations X^{(1)}, X^{(2)}, … with independent Exponential(1) coordinates, we revisit the study by Fill and Naiman (Electron. J. Probab., 25:Paper No. 92, 24 pp., 2020) of the boundary (relative to the closed positive orthant), or ""frontier"", F_n of the closed Pareto record-setting (RS) region RS_n := {0 ≤ x ∈ R^d: x ⊀ X^(i) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n} at time n, where 0 ≤ x means that 0 ≤ x_j for 1 ≤ j ≤ d and x ≺ y means that x_j < y_j for 1 ≤ j ≤ d. With x_+ : = ∑_{j = 1}^d x_j = ‖x‖₁, let F_n^- := min{x_+: x ∈ F_n} and F_n^+ : = max{x_+: x ∈ F_n}. Almost surely, there are for each n unique vectors λ_n ∈ F_n and τ_n ∈ F_n such that F_n^+ = (λ_n)_+ and F_n^- = (τ_n)_+; we refer to λ_n and τ_n as the leading and trailing points, respectively, of the frontier. Fill and Naiman provided rather sharp information about the typical and almost sure behavior of F^+, but somewhat crude information about F^-, namely, that for any ε > 0 and c_n → ∞ we have P(F_n^- - ln n ∈ (- (2 + ε) ln ln ln n, c_n)) → 1 (describing typical behavior) and almost surely limsup (F_n^- - ln n)/(ln ln n) ≤ 0 and liminf (F_n^- - ln n)/(ln ln ln n) ∈ [-2, -1]. In this extended abstract we use the theory of generators (minima of F_n) together with the first- and second-moment methods to improve considerably the trailing-point location results to F_n^- - (ln n - ln ln ln n) ⟶P -ln(d - 1) (describing typical behavior) and, for d ≥ 3, almost surely limsup [F_n^- -(ln n - ln ln ln n)] ≤ -ln(d - 2) + ln 2 and liminf [F_n^- -(ln n - ln ln ln n)] ≥ -ln d - ln 2.

 Statistics of Parking Functions and Labeled Forests  
 Authors:  Stephan Wagner and Mei Yin  
  Abstract    
 In this paper we obtain some new results on the enumeration of parking functions and labeled forests. We introduce new statistics both for parking functions and for labeled forests that are connected to each other by means of a bijection. We determine the joint distribution of two statistics on parking functions and their counterparts on labeled forests. Our results on labeled forests also serve to explain the mysterious equidistribution between two seemingly unrelated statistics in parking functions recently identified by Stanley and Yin and give an explicit bijection between the two statistics.

 Depth-First Search Performance in Random Digraphs  
 Authors:  Philippe Jacquet and Svante Janson  
  Abstract    
 We present an analysis of the depth-first search algorithm in a random digraph model with independent outdegrees having an arbitrary distribution with finite variance. The results include asymptotics for the distribution of the stack index and depths of the search. The search yields a series of trees of finite size before and after the exploration of a giant tree. Our analysis mainly concerns the giant tree. Most results are first order. This analysis proposed by Donald Knuth in his next to appear volume of The Art of Computer Programming gives interesting insight in one of the most elegant and efficient algorithm for graph analysis due to Tarjan.

 Analysis of Algorithms  
 Analysis of Algorithms (AofA) is a field at the boundary of computer science and mathematics. The goal is to obtain a precise understanding of the asymptotic, average-case characteristics of algorithms and data structures. A unifying theme is the use of probabilistic, combinatorial and analytic methods. The objects to be studied include random branching processes, graphs permutations, trees, and strings.  
 The area of Analysis of Algorithms is frequently traced to 27 July 1963, when Donald E. Knuth wrote ""Notes on Open Addressing"". His fundamental books, The Art of Computer Programming , established ties between areas of study that include discrete mathematics, combinatorics probability theory, analytic number theory, asymptotic analysis, and complexity theory.  
 Thirty years after Knuth's pioneering paper, the first seminar entirely devoted to the Analysis of Algorithms was held at Dagstuhl, Germany, in 1993. Since 1993, several series of seminars related to the analysis of algorithms have been established. These take place on an annual or biennial schedule; see the meetings page for links to some of these meetings.

 This year, the 29th APCC,also known as APCC 2024, is coming to Indonesia for the fourth time, thanks to the great effort and strong support from IEEE Comsoc Indonesia Chapter. One of the main purposes of the APCC conference series is to provide researchers and engineers in the AP region with an opportunity to discuss topics related to advanced communication technologies and services, while opening the door to the world. Through those interactive face-to-face discussions, APCC series, as a regular international conference in the AP region, can effectively stimulate research collaborations and developments in future communication technologies. 
 This year, we are excited to hold APCC 2024 in Bali – Indonesia.

 Mission  
 The Asia-Pacific Conference on Conceptual Modelling provides an annual forum for disseminating the results of innovative research in information modelling and related areas. Topics of conference vary from conceptual modeling research and practice to all related areas that are mentioned in prime essay and scientific journals.  
 The amount, complexity and diversity of information held in computer systems are constantly on the increase, and so are the requirements and challenges to be met for useful access and manipulation of this information. Conceptual modelling is fundamental to the development of up-to-date information and knowledge-based systems. The conference series aims on bringing together experts from all areas of computer science and information systems with a common interest in the subject.  
 Upcoming Conference  
 The Tenth Asia-Pacific Conference on Conceptual Modelling (APCCM 2014) will take place in Auckland, New Zealand from January 20th to 23rd, 2014.  
 The 2014 conference will be held as part of the Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW 2014).

 Applying ontologies is the most promising approach to semantically enrich Web services. To facilitate this, two efforts contributed the most in enabling the creation of ontologies: OWL-S from the US and WSMO in Europe. These two compete and promote their ontologies from the design perspective, reflecting their inventors’ bias but not offering much help to Web service developers using them. To bypass existing biases and enable evaluation of ontologies expressed in these two languages, this paper provides a study of the two important facilitators, OWL-S and WSMO, surveying their usage in several SWS Projects and identifying their respective and outstanding gaps. The paper then proposes a set of evaluation criteria for usage measurement on the two prominent SWS ontologies.

 Title:KyrgyzNLP: Challenges, Progress, and Future

 View PDFHTML (experimental)Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) have excelled in numerous benchmarks, advancing AI applications in both linguistic and non-linguistic tasks. However, this has primarily benefited well-resourced languages, leaving less-resourced ones (LRLs) at a disadvantage. In this paper, we highlight the current state of the NLP field in the specific LRL: kyrgyz tili. 
 Human evaluation, including annotated datasets created by native speakers, remains an irreplaceable component of reliable NLP performance, especially for LRLs where automatic evaluations can fall short. In recent assessments of the resources for Turkic languages, Kyrgyz is labeled with the status 'Scraping By', a severely under-resourced language spoken by millions. This is concerning given the growing importance of the language, not only in Kyrgyzstan but also among diaspora communities where it holds no official status. 
 We review prior efforts in the field, noting that many of the publicly available resources have only recently been developed, with few exceptions beyond dictionaries (the processed data used for the analysis is presented atthis https URL). While recent papers have made some headway, much more remains to be done. Despite interest and support from both business and government sectors in the Kyrgyz Republic, the situation for Kyrgyz language resources remains challenging. We stress the importance of community-driven efforts to build these resources, ensuring the future advancement sustainability. We then share our view of the most pressing challenges in Kyrgyz NLP. Finally, we propose a roadmap for future development in terms of research topics and language resources.

 About the Conference 
 The aim of ALENEX is to provide a forum for the presentation of original research in the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. 
 Typical submissions will include an extensive experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. 
 Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering. 
 Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to high-performance and cloud computing. 
 Proceedings will be posted online in January 2025. ALENEX is supported by SIAM. 
 Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect that interesting synergies will develop between the co-located conferences. 
 ALENEX will be held jointly with: 
 ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) 
 SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA)

 experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the 
 gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address 
 methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of 
 algorithms and data structures. 
  
 Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to 
 databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; 
 operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and 
 computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering. 
  
 Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for 
 advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel 
 computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to 
 high-performance and cloud computing. 
  
 Proceedings will be posted online in January 2025. ALENEX is supported by SIAM. 
  
 Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning 
 detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect 
 that interesting synergies will develop between the co-located conferences. 
  
 The following conferences will be held jointly: 
 - ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) 
 ) https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda25 
 - SIAM Symposium on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX) 
 ) https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/alenex25 
 - SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA) 
 ) https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/sosa25

 | How to Participate 
 +-------- 
  
 == Format == 
 Submissions must be PDF, formatted according to the double column macro posted 
 here. (Note that there is also a single column macro, but ALENEX uses the 
 double-column one.) Submissions must not exceed 10 pages, excluding front 
 matter (title and abstract), references, and a clearly marked appendix (further 
 described below). 
  
 == Content == 
 Papers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract, which begins 
 with the title of the paper as well as a short abstract. This should be 
 followed by the main body of the paper that begins with a precise statement of 
 the problem considered, a succinct summary of the results obtained (emphasizing 
 the significance, novelty, and potential impact of the research), and a clear 
 comparison with related work. The remainder of the extended abstract should 
 provide sufficient details to allow the program committee to evaluate the 
 validity, quality, and relevance of the contribution. Clarity of presentation 
 is very important; the entire extended abstract should be written carefully, 
 taking into consideration that it will be read and evaluated by both experts 
 and non-experts, often under tight time constraints. 
  
 == Appendix and Additional data == 
 All details needed to verify the results must be provided. Supporting 
 materials, including proofs of theoretical claims and experimental details, 
 that do not fit in the 10 page limit should be given in an appendix. If more 
 appropriate, the full version may be given as the appendix. In both cases, 
 however, the authors should include in the main part specific pointers to the 
 relevant locations in the appendix. The appendix will be read by the program 
 committee members and subreviewers at their discretion and will not be 
 published as part of the proceedings. Thus, the paper without the appendix 
 should be able to stand on its own. Experimental and implementation results 
 (independent of paper type) must be reproducible and verifiable. Authors are 
 encouraged to put accompanying software and relevant data, in a repository 
 accessible to the reviewers. Authors are asked to indicate which of the 
 supporting materials will remain publicly available if their papers are 
 accepted. 
  
 == Double-blind == 
 ALENEX will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions 
 should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, 
 authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the 
 beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any 
 references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not ""We 
 build on our previous work ..."" but rather ""We build on the work of ...""). 
 Particular care needs to be taken with accompanying software or data, which 
 need to be linked anonymously (for example, via a DropBox folder or the like). 
 Upon registering a submission, the authors will declare conflicts of interest 
 with PC members. The purpose of lightweight double-blind reviewing is to help 
 PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper 
 without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if 
 they were to try. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft 
 versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post 
 drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on 
 their research ideas. We encourage authors with further questions on 
 double-blind reviewing to contact the PC chairs. 
  
 == Previous or Simultaneous Submissions == 
 Results previously published or accepted for publication in the proceedings of 
 another conference cannot be submitted. Simultaneous submissions of the results 
 to another conference with published proceedings are not allowed. Exempted are 
 workshops and conferences without formal proceedings, but possibly with 
 handouts containing short abstracts. Results that have already been accepted 
 (with or without revision) for publication in a journal at the time of their 
 submission to the symposium are not allowed. A paper submitted to a journal but 
 not yet accepted for publication can be submitted to the symposium. In such 
 cases, the authors must mention this on the front page of the submission and 
 clearly identify the status of the journal submission at the date of the full 
 paper submission deadline. 
  
 == Accepted Papers == 
 Final proceedings versions of accepted papers must use the same double column 
 formatting macro as the submissions. Title, abstract, and body of the paper 
 altogether must not exceed 12 pages, followed by unlimited references. If any 
 supporting material (including complete proofs of theoretical claims and 
 experimental details) does not fit in the specified limit, then the full 
 version of the paper containing this information must be referenced in the 
 conference version and made available at a public repository, such as arXiv, by 
 the time the final version is submitted. Where applicable, we encourage the 
 authors to make accompanying software and/or data publicly accessible, with 
 proper references in the paper. 
  
 == Artifact Evaluation == 
 To verify and facilitate reproducibility of the results described in ALENEX 
 papers, we encourage authors of accepted papers to submit their artifacts (e.g. 
 code and data) for Artifact Evaluation (AE). The artifact submission deadline 
 for accepted papers will be Sep. 9. A separate committee will examine the 
 artifacts, with notification by Oct. 13. Participation in artifact evaluation 
 is not mandatory and will not influence paper acceptance. However, AE results 
 will be considered when inviting top papers for journal publication. Papers 
 that pass Artifact Evaluation will be awarded SIAM badges for availability and 
 reproducibility, which will be printed directly on the papers giving the 
 readers greater confidence in the results presented in them. Participation in 
 the AE phase will not be made public except for the papers that receive badges. 

The Easy Chair submission site is available: 
 ) https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alenex25 

== Proceedings == 
 The proceedings will be posted online in mid-January 2025. 
  
 == Acceptance Notification == 
 The Program Committee chairs will distribute acceptance notices and final paper 
 submission instructions to authors of accepted papers in late August 2024. 
  
 SIAM will distribute a follow-up notice in early October 2024; a list of 
 accepted papers will be posted at this time.

 Abstract 
 Thepeaceable queens problemasks to determine the maximum number\(a(n)\)such that there is a placement of\(a(n)\)white queens and\(a(n)\)black queens on an\(n\times n\)chessboard so that no queen can capture any queen of the opposite color. 
 In this paper, we consider the peaceable queens problem and its variant on the toroidal board. For the regular board, we show that\(a(n)\le 0.1716n^{2}\), for all sufficiently large\(n\). This improves on the bound\(a(n)\le 0.25n^{2}\)of van Bommel and MacEachern [16]. 
 For the toroidal board, we provide new upper and lower bounds. Somewhat surprisingly, our bounds show that there is a sharp contrast in behaviour between the odd torus and the even torus. Our lower bounds are given by explicit constructions. For the upper bounds, we formulate the problem as a non-linear optimization problem with at most 100 variables, regardless of the size of the board. We solve our non-linear program exactly using modern optimization software. 
 We also provide a local search algorithm and a software implementation which converges very rapidly to solutions which appear optimal. Our algorithm is sufficiently robust that it works on both the regular and toroidal boards. For example, for the regular board, the algorithm quickly finds the so-calledAinley construction. Thus, our work provides some further evidence that the Ainley construction is indeed optimal.

 Present CFP : 2024 
 APLAS 2024 aims to bring together programming language researchers, 
 practitioners and implementors *worldwide*, to present and discuss the 
 latest results and exchange ideas in all areas of programming 
 languages and systems. APLAS 2024 is co-located with the 
 22nd International Symposium on Automated Technology for Verification 
 and Analysis (ATVA). 
  
 We solicit submissions in the form of regular research papers 
 describing original scientific research results, including system 
 development and case studies. Among others, solicited topics include: 
 programming paradigms and styles; methods and tools to specify and 
 reason about programs and languages; programming language foundations; 
 methods and tools for implementation; concurrency and distribution; 
 applications, case studies and emerging topics. 
  
 Submissions should not exceed 17 pages, excluding bibliography, in the 
 Springer LNCS format. The reviewing process is light double-blind, 
 with a rebuttal phase to address factual errors and minor 
 misunderstandings. 
  
 Proceedings of APLAS 2024 will be published by Springer as part of 
 Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). 
 https://link.springer.com/conference/aplas 
  
 APLAS 2024 continues the tradition of the best paper award.

 Where does humanity come from? The Human Intelligence Evolved from Cis-regulatory Saltations  
 The divergence rate between the alignable genomes of humans and chimpanzees is as little as 1.23%. This raises a fundamental question: what genetic changes account for their dramatic phenotypical difference. Researchers from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science (AMSS) at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have discovered that the saltation (jump change) of cis-regulatory element frequency (CREF) modules can explain the cognition and intelligence unique to humans.  

 AMSS Events   

 Prof. Yu-Hong Dai nominated and elected as Vice President of the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS)  
 The 14th Triennial Conference of the Association of Asia-Pacific Operations Research Societies (APORS 2024) was held in Hangzhou from November 15 to 18, 2024. More than 200 delegates from APORS member societies including China, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, Australia, Malaysia, Nepal, and the Philippines participated in the conference. During the event, the APORS council meeting was called and Professor Yu-Hong Dai, the current President of the Operations Research Society of China and serving APORS President, was nominated and elected as Vice President of the International Federation of Operational Research Societies (IFORS) for the 2025–2027 term.

 EAI ArtsIT 2025 
 November, 2025 
 Dubai, UAE 
 “Event Update: 
 This event is being relocated. 
 More details coming soon.” 
 ArtsITbrings together a diverse international community of researchers, practitioners, artists, and academics from various disciplines to explore the dynamic relationship between art and information technology across a range of distinct domains. Since its inception in 2009, ArtsIT has been established as a prominent scientific platform for sharing cutting-edge research findings at the convergence of art, science, culture, performing arts, media, and technology. Artistic practice utilizing digital media serves not only as a means of analyzing and critically reflecting on the influence of technology on our lives, culture, and society but also as a tool for fostering discussions on sustainability, responsibility, and human dignity. In addition to the main track that includes topics such digital artworks and cultural heritage, audio art, games and gamification, immersive technologies and interactive art installations, the event dedicates attention to recent advancements that have made significant contributions to the field in recent years, such as virtualization, artificial intelligence and big data, virtual reality and the metaverse, with dedicated sessions. In an attempt to bridge the gap between research in art and technology, this interdisciplinary conference aims to enrich both fields and contribute to the development of new ideas, experiences, and global societal advancements. The convergence of Art and Tech can cultivate innovation and stimulate imaginative thought. 
 The conference aims to bring together artists and technologists to join forces to challenge the limitations within their respective domains, while through the merging artistic expression with technological progress, novel concepts, methodologies, and modes of creative expression can arise.

Welcome to ArtsIT 2025! 
 We are excited to have you join us for the 2025 edition of the International Conference on Arts and Technology (ArtsIT 2025), where we continue to explore the dynamic intersection of arts, technology, and innovation. As the Steering Chair, and an international artist in this contemporary field, I am proud to guide this year’s conference, which promises to bring together groundbreaking research, inspiring talks, and transformative collaborations. This year we have increased special track offerings (under “Calls”) and authors are recommended to browse these initially to see if fitting your topic as the track chair and committee members are experts in their fields, thus act as expert reviewers for submissions and offering special session presentations to raise authors’ profile. 
 Reflecting on last year’s event, also hosted in UAE at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), we were delighted by the enthusiasm and impactful discussions shared by our many participants. High quality paper presentations by attending delegates were cojoined by six luminary keynote speaker talks, workshops, performances, demonstrations, posters, and a panel discussion chaired by the Australian Network for Art and Technology (ANAT). As one attendee shared, “ArtsIT 2024 was a remarkable experience, fostering a deep exchange of ideas that will resonate for years.” We look forward to building on this momentum and seeing what new insights this year will bring as we again evolve the growing ArtsIT global community.

 href="""" - Scope and Topics
ArtsITbrings together a diverse international community of researchers, practitioners, artists, and academics from various disciplines to explore the dynamic relationship between art and information technology across a range of distinct domains. Since its inception in 2009, ArtsIT has been established as a prominent scientific platform for sharing cutting-edge research findings at the convergence of art, science, culture, performing arts, media, and technology. Artistic practice utilizing digital media serves not only as a means of analyzing and critically reflecting on the influence of technology on our lives, culture, and society but also as a tool for fostering discussions on sustainability, responsibility, and human dignity. In addition to the main track that includes topics such digital artworks and cultural heritage, audio art, games and gamification, immersive technologies and interactive art installations, the event dedicates attention to recent advancements that have made significant contributions to the field in recent years, such as virtualization, artificial intelligence and big data, virtual reality and the metaverse, with dedicated sessions. In an attempt to bridge the gap between research in art and technology, this interdisciplinary conference aims to enrich both fields and contribute to the development of new ideas, experiences, and global societal advancements. The convergence of Art and Tech can cultivate innovation and stimulate imaginative thought. The conference aims to bring together artists and technologists to join forces to challenge the limitations within their respective domains, while through the merging artistic expression with technological progress, novel concepts, methodologies, and modes of creative expression can arise.

 Welcome to ASONAM 2025 
 The 17th International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining -ASONAM-2025 
  
 The study of social networks originated in social and business communities. In recent years, social network research has advanced significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine learning techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social medium that fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences and knowledge, group activities, community formation and evolution. This has led to a rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics homeland security and business. This follows the pattern of known entities of our society that have evolved into networks in which actors are increasingly dependent on their structural embedding. 
 The international conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2025) will primarily provide an interdisciplinary venue that will bring together practitioners and researchers from a variety of SNAM fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices. ASONAM 2025 is intended to address important aspects with a specific focus on the emerging trends and industry needs associated with social networking analysis and mining. The conference solicits experimental and theoretical works on social network analysis and mining along with their application to real life situations. 
 Full papers will be reviewed and assessed by the program committee and a ""Best Paper Award"" ceremony will be organized at the banquet. 
 News 
 - Good news: ASONAM is now included in the prestigious CORE Conference Portal in Australia.

 The 17th International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining -ASONAM-2025 
  
 The study of social networks originated in social and business communities. In recent years, social network research has advanced significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine learning techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social medium that fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences and knowledge, group activities, community formation and evolution. This has led to a rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics, homeland security and business. This follows the pattern of known entities of our society that have evolved into networks in which actors are increasingly dependent on their structural embedding. 
  
 The international conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2025) will primarily provide an interdisciplinary venue that will bring together practitioners and researchers from a variety of SNAM fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices. ASONAM 2025 is intended to address important aspects with a specific focus on the emerging trends and industry needs associated with social networking analysis and mining. The conference solicits experimental and theoretical works on social network analysis and mining along with their application to real life situations. 
  
 Full papers will be reviewed and assessed by the program committee and a ""Best Paper Award"" ceremony will be organized at the banquet.
