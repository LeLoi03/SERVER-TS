The 45th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (IEEE ICDCS 2025) is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners to present, discuss, and exchange cutting-edge ideas and the latest findings on topics related to all aspects of distributed computing systems. The conference will be held from **July 20-23, 2025, in Glasgow, Scotland, UK**.

## Paper Submission

The Paper strand provides the opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.

Papers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. All paper submissions should follow the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template ([https://template-selector.ieee.org/](https://template-selector.ieee.org/)). Each submission can have up to eleven (11) pages (including figures, tables, appendices, and references). Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review.

The paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content. To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymized GitHub repository with all source code, scripts, and data needed for the reproduction of their results.

For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference in-person to present their work on-site. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.

Note that the authors should adhere to ethics and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer to IEEE Code of Ethics and IEEE Policy of AI-Generated Text ([https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/#ai-generated-text](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/#ai-generated-text)).

The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) is an annual programming language conference that provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming.  This year, for the first time in history, ICFP will be co-located with SPLASH and its satellite events as a part of the joint ICFP/SPLASH 2025 conference.

## Call for Papers

PACMPL issue ICFP 2025 seeks original papers on the art and science of functional programming. Submissions are invited on all topics from principles to practice, from foundations to features, and from abstraction to application. The scope includes all languages that encourage functional programming, including both purely applicative and imperative languages, as well as languages with objects, concurrency, or parallelism.

## Topics of Interest

*   Language Design
*   Implementation
*   Software-Development Techniques
*   Foundations
*   Analysis and Transformation
*   Applications
*   Education

## Special Categories of Papers

In addition to research papers, PACMPL issue ICFP solicits two kinds of papers that do not require original research contributions: Functional Pearls, which are full papers, and Experience Reports, which are limited to half the length of a full paper.

### Functional Pearls

A Functional Pearl is an elegant essay about something related to functional programming.  A submission that is intended to be treated as a pearl must be marked as such on the submission web page and should contain the words “Functional Pearl” somewhere in its title or subtitle.

### Experience Reports

The purpose of an Experience Report is to describe the experience of using functional programming in practice.  Both in the papers and in any citations, the title of each accepted Experience Report must end with the words “(Experience Report)” in parentheses.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Submissions must be in PDF format, printable in black and white on US Letter sized paper and interpretable by common PDF tools.
*   All submissions must adhere to the “ACM Small” template.
*   There is a limit of 25 pages for a full paper or Functional Pearl and 12 pages for an Experience Report; in either case, the bibliography and an optional clearly marked appendix will not be counted against these limits.
*   Submissions will be accepted at [https://icfp25.hotcrp.com/](https://icfp25.hotcrp.com/)

## Double-Blind Reviewing Process

ICFP 2025 will use a full double-blind reviewing process. This means that identities of authors will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted papers.

## Important Dates

*   **Submission Deadline:** February 27, 2025
*   **Author Response:** April 28 - May 1, 2025

The 18th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2025) will be held in **Koblenz, Germany, from June 11-12, 2025**, co-located with STAF 2025.

## Aims and Scope

The use of graphs and graph-like structures as a formalism for specification and modelling is widespread in all areas of computer science as well as in many fields of computational research and engineering.  ICGT aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas.

## Tracks

ICGT 2025 has two tracks:

*   ICGT Research Papers
*   ICGT Journal-First

## Submission Types

Authors are invited to submit research papers in three possible categories. The accepted papers will be published as an LNCS volume.

1.  **Regular research papers:** including papers describing applications and case studies. Papers will be evaluated with respect to their originality, significance, and technical soundness. Additional material intended for reviewers (but not publication) may be included in a clearly marked appendix. **16 pages** in the LNCS style, excluding references and appendices.
2.  **Tool presentation papers:** which demonstrate the main features and functionality of graph-based tools. A tool presentation may have an appendix with a detailed demo description which will be reviewed but not included in the proceedings. **8 pages** in the LNCS style, excluding references and appendices.
3.  **Blue Skies:** reporting on new research directions or ideas which are not yet sufficiently developed to fit in other categories. **8 pages** in the LNCS style, excluding references and appendices.

## Policies

### Deadlines

Abstract and paper submission deadlines are strict. In no circumstances will extensions be given.

### Changes to abstract/title/authorship

Authors should include a full title for their paper, complete author list, and complete abstract in the submission form by the abstract submission deadline. While it is possible to edit the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts that are substantially rewritten for the full submission risk being removed without consideration. The author list cannot be changed after the abstract deadline.

### Reciprocal Reviewing Requirement

New this year: Qualified authors are required to review for ICML, according to the policies below.

### Double-Blind Review

All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any information with the intention or consequence of violating the double-blind reviewing policy.

### Dual Submission

Authors may not submit papers that are identical, or substantially similar, to versions that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals.

### Reviewing Criteria

Submissions should report original and rigorous research of significant interest to the machine learning community. All claims must be clearly stated and supported by reproducible experiments and/or sound theoretical analysis.

### Use of Generative AI

Authors are allowed to use generative AI tools such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in writing or research. However, authors must take full responsibility for all content in their paper, including any content generated by AI tools that might be construed as plagiarism or scientific misconduct. We encourage authors to explain any notable ways in which these tools were used in their research methodology. LLMs are not eligible for authorship.

### Ethical Conduct for Peer Review

Authors are expected to follow standard ethical conduct for peer review.

### Impact Statements

Authors are required to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences.

### Lay Summaries

New this year: Authors of accepted papers will be required to submit a short “lay summary” of their work (also called ""plain language summary"") in OpenReview when submitting their camera-ready paper."
