 The ACM International Systems and Storage Conference (SYSTOR) is an international forum for interaction across the systems research community. The program includes innovative, peer-reviewed research papers in the broad area of systems, as well as distinguished keynote lecturers, and a poster session. ACM SYSTOR is designed to engage academic and industrial researchers and practitioners, welcoming both students and seasoned professionals. 
 Call for Papers 
 SYSTOR has traditionally welcomed academic and industrial papers in systems, including storage, cloud and distributed systems, networking, and systems security, broadly construed. SYSTOR encourages submissions that describe results from experimental system prototypes, as well as experience papers describing practical deployments and valuable lessons learned from them. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Systems and workload optimization for AI/ML systems 
 Sustainability/carbon footprint of computer and network systems 
 System security and trust 
 Big Data infrastructure 
 Cloud, edge, data center, and distributed systems 
 Embedded and real-time systems 
 Fault tolerance, reliability, and availability 
 File and storage systems 
 Networked, mobile, wireless, peer-to-peer, and sensor systems 
 Operating systems, computer architecture, and their interactions 
 Performance evaluation and workload characterization 
 Runtime systems and compiler/programming-language support 
 System deployment, usage, and experience 
 System design or adaptation for emerging storage technologies 
 Virtualization and containers 
 Storage 3.0 
 Systems for AI and AI for Systems 
 SYSTOR 2025 solicits submissions in two separate categories: 
 href="#full-papers" - Full Papers Track | – original research, at most 12 pages, excluding references 
 href="#full-papers" - Short Papers Track | – original research, at most 5 pages, excluding references 
 href="#posters" - Posters with Extended Abstract Track | – original work presented as a poster, accompanied by an extended abstract in the conference proceedings 
 Attendance 
 Systor 2025 will be held virtually on September 8–9,followed by theIsraeli Systems & AI Workshop (ISW),which will be held physically in Haifa onSeptember 10

 // Research Track 
 SYSTOR accepts both full-length and short papers. A short paper is intended for an idea that can be described and evaluated in fewer pages; the goal of the short paper is not for preliminary work or workshop-style position papers. 
 A good SYSTOR paper should present a novel, compelling solution to a well-motivated problem. The evaluation should demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the solution in settings that are as realistic as possible, including test applications workloads, system parameters, and assumed constraints. Authors should clearly describe their contribution in the context of prior work, and draw meaningful conclusions from their work. 
 The program committee also encourages submissions that describe lessons learned from operational (especially large-scale) system deployments. Such submissions are expected to include sufficient details of the system, its design goals, and the methods used for evaluating whether these goals were met. 
 The program committee will value submissions accompanied by supplemental material such as traces and open-source code that can help reproduce the reported results, and advance additional research in the field. 
 A small set of outstanding papers will be forwarded to a suitable journal, such as ACM journal Transactions on Storage (TOS) or Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS), for a fast-tracked review process for an expanded version of the paper. 
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to allACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s newhref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" - Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects
. 
 POSTERS TRACK 
 SYSTOR also welcomes academic and industrial posters. See “Call for Papers” above for focus and relevant areas. 
 A good poster submission will articulate and motivate an interesting problem and describe a new insight or approach to addressing this problem. It will clearly present the work in progress (or attained results), and the expected outcomes from future work. The poster should present these details in a manner that is clear and captivating. 
 Poster submissions should include a one-page extended abstract, and a draft of the poster. The extended abstracts of accepted posters will be included in the online conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. The program committee will review poster submissions in a single-blind manner.

 Please follow thehref="https://www.systor.org/2024/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/06/sample-systor2024-poster.pdf" - poster formatting instructions
. The author kit, which contains the Latex style and template,href="https://www.systor.org/2024/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/06/systor2024_poster_template.zip" - is available here
. 
 Accepted posters can opt-in for physical presentation at the Israeli Systems & AI Workshop in person. 
 // Submission Instructions 
 Research papers (full and short) should be submitted through:href="https://systor25.hotcrp.com/" - https://systor25.hotcrp.com/
Review Process 
 The program committee will review submissions in a double-blind manner. All submissions should be properly anonymized, and all identifiable information should be removed whenever possible, including obvious self-references. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. 
  
 Any submissions accompanied by a non-disclosure agreement will be returned without review. 
 Copyright and originality of the work 
 SYSTOR will enforceACM’s plagiarism policyregarding copying and resubmitting prior work. Simultaneous submissions are not allowed: any work submitted to SYSTOR must not be under consideration for another workshop, conference, or journal. 
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:The official publication date is the earlier of either the first day of the conference or the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up totwo weeks beforethe first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. 
 Formatting instructions 
 Submissions must be printable PDF files. When creating your submission, you must use the sigplan proceedings template ofACM’s acmart Latex class, which is available on the official ACM site. Your main LaTeX file should have the following structure: 
  
 % use the base acmart.cls% use the sigplan proceeding template with the default 10 pt fonts 
 % nonacm option removes ACM-related text in the submission. 
 \documentclass[sigplan,nonacm]{acmart} 
 % enable page numbers 
 \settopmatter{printfolios=true} 
 \begin{document} 
 \title{…} 
 \begin{abstract} 
 … 
 \end{abstract} 
 \maketitle % should come after the abstract 
 % Add the paper content here 
 % use the ACM bibliography style 
 \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format} 
 \bibliography{…} 
 \end{document} 
  
 Please ensure that your paper satisfies all the above requirements for content and formatting before submission; if you have a question about any of these issues, please email the program chairs. 
  
 Additional instructions regarding camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be sent directly to the corresponding authors and will appear here after the authors have been notified. 
 Arxiv 
 A paper submitted to SYSTOR can be submitted simultaneously to Arxiv, with some changes. We would like the authors to make an honest effort to preserve anonymity. Please ensure the SYSTOR submission uses a different title and a different system name from the Arxiv version. It would be useful to let the chairs know if there is an Arxiv paper so that we can intervene if PC members find it accidentally and think the submission is plagiarizing the Arxiv paper. 
 Open Source 
 The authors of a SYSTOR submission are encouraged to associate a source code repo with their submission, but this repo must be completely anonymized. It is alright if a named (= not anonymized) source code repo exists, so long as it isn’t associated/linked with the submission in any way. An anonymized repo can be a clone of the named repo, which is modified to be anonymous. Another way to do this ishttps://anonymous.4open.science/.
