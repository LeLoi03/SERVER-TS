JELIA - European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence 
 About JELIA 
 Logics have, for many years, laid claim to providing a formal basis for the study and development of applications and systems in Artificial Intelligence. With the depth and maturity of formalisms, methodologies, and logic-based systems today, this claim is stronger than ever. 
 The European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence (or Journées Européennes sur la Logique en Intelligence Artificielle - JELIA) began back in 1988, as a workshop, in response to the need for a European forum for the discussion of emerging work in this field. Since then, JELIA has been organised biennially, with English as official language, and with proceedings published in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series. Previous meetings took place in Roscoff, France (1988), Amsterdam, Netherlands (1990), Berlin, Germany (1992), York, UK (1994), Évora, Portugal (1996), Dagstuhl, Germany (1998), Málaga, Spain (2000), Cosenza, Italy (2002), Lisbon, Portugal (2004), Liverpool, UK (2006), Dresden, Germany (2008), Helsinki, Finland (2010), Toulouse, France (2012), Funchal, Madeira, Portugal (2014), Larnaca, Cyprus (2016), Rende, Italy (2019) and Klagenfurt, Austria (2021). 
 The increasing interest in this forum, its international level with growing participation from researchers outside Europe, and the overall technical quality, has turned JELIA into a major biennial forum for the discussion of logic-based approaches to artificial intelligence.

 1 - 5 September 2025, 19th European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence (JELIA 2025), Kutaisi, Georgia 
 Date: 1 - 5 September 2025 
 Location: Kutaisi, Georgia 
 Deadline: Friday 2 May 2025 
 The aim of JELIA 2025 is to bring together active researchers interested in the use of logics in Artificial Intelligence, in order to discuss current research, results, problems, and applications of both theoretical and practical nature. JELIA strives to foster links and facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers from various disciplines, among researchers from academia and industry, and between theoreticians and practitioners. 
 This year we will include a Special Track on Logics for Explainable and Trustworthy AI. The track aims to draw attention to this timely topic and create a space for discussing the role of logic. Also there will be Best Paper and Best Student Paper Prizes sponsored by Springer, each is a cash prize amounting to EUR 500. 
 Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished research in all areas related to the use of logics in Artificial Intelligence. Submissions describing implemented systems/applications and their application area(s) are also welcome. Submissions must not have been previously published or be simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere. All submissions should not exceed 13 pages for long papers and 6 pages for short papers, and should be written in English.
