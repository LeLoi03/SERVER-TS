 The ECCO annual conference aim to bring together researchers in the field of Combinatorial Optimization to present their work, share experiences, and discuss recent advances in theory and applications. The primary objectives are: 
 exchanging results and experiences in solving real-world combinatorial optimization problems 
 reporting on development and implementation of appropriate models and efficient solution methods for combinatorial optimization problems 
 establishing networking contacts between individuals and research groups working on related topics 
 promoting the work on combinatorial optimization (theory and applications) to the broader scientific community 
 identifying challenging research problems for the field, as well as promising research outlets (both in theory and applications) 
 promoting interactions with researchers in other related fields 
 A special issue of theJournal of Combinatorial Optimizationwill be devoted to work presented at the conference. 
 All articles will be refereed according to the high standards of the journal. Details of the process will be given during the conference. | Important dates

 News and FAQ | TheEUROWorking Group on Combinatorial Optimization,ECCO(European Chapter on Combinatorial Optimization) provides an excellent opportunity to discuss recent and important issues in Combinatorial Optimization and its applications with European combinatorialists; most European countries are represented.Purpose and history 
 The group was created in 1987 by C. Roucairol, D. de Werra and A. Rinnooy Kan. C. Roucairol chaired for the first 10 years and now it's chaired byS. Martello. This group provides an excellent opportunity to discuss recent and important issues in Combinatorial Optimization and its applications with European combinatorialists; most European countries are represented.The groupe is suitable for people who are presently engaged in Combinatorial Optimization (CO), either in theoritical aspects or in business, industry or public administration applications ... All the fields are taken in consideration: operations management - logistics, production scheduling location and distribution problem, ressource allocation, flexible manufacturing ..., - engineering, VLSI design and computer design, network design, ... Recent sessions in last ECCOs have attached a particular emphasis to metaheuristics or new local search methods (tabu, genetic algorithm, ...), polyhedra approaches to difficult problems, recent developments in classical optimization problems (scheduling, assignmentn knapsack partitioning, ...). 
 The meetings are held on a regular basis (once a year during Spring) and nicely combine scientific work and the exchange of new ideas with an exciting atmosphere, as in Paris, May 1988; Venice June 1989; Barcelona, May 1990; Dubrovnik, May 1991 (canceled); Graz April 1992; Brussels, April 1993; Milan, February 1994; Poznan, May 1995; Dublin, April 1996; Tenerife, May 1997; Copenhagen, May 1998; Bendor May 1999; Capri, May 2000; Bonn, May 2001; Lugano, May-June 2002; Molde June 2003; Beirut, June 2004; Minsk, May 2005; Porto (joinlty with CO), May 2006; Cyprus, May 2007; Dubrovnik, May 2008; Jerusalem, May 2009; Malaga (joinlty with CO), May 2010; Amsterdam, May-June 2011; Antalya, April 2012; Paris, May-June 2013; Munich (joinlty with CO), May 2014; Catania, May 2015; Budapest, May 2016; Koper, May 2017; Fribourg (joinlty with CO), June 2018; St. Julian in Malta, May-June 2019; St. Peterburg, June 2020 (canceled); Madrid@online, June 2021; @online (joinlty with CO), June 2022; Chania in Crete, May 2023; Ghent, June 2024.

conference will be organized and hosted Marrakech, Morocco. 
 It is scheduled for May 08-10, 2025. 
 Abstract submission deadline has been extended to February 28, 2025. 
 An abstract booklet is distributed to the participants at each meeting. 
 News logos starting from summer 2016 
 According to the newEURO Branding initiative, new logos were created for EURO and all EURO Working Groups as one may remark on the left of this page. For the memory, here are the old logos.
