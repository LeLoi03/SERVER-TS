 Submission Guidelines 
 Authors are invited to submit papers describing original research of theoretical or practical significance to algorithms and computation and must not simultaneously submit it to another journal or conference. Papers should not exceed 14 pages (including references, but excluding the optional appendix) in LNCS style. It can be downloaded fromLNCS conference proceedings guidelines. If the authors feel that more details are essential to substantiate the main claim of the paper, they may include a clearly marked appendix that will be read at the discretion of the Program Committee. 
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work and surveys of important results. At the time the paper is submitted to WALCOM 2025, and for the entire review period, the paper (or essentially the same paper) should not be under review by any other conference with published proceedings or by a scientific journal. At least one author of each accepted paper will be expected to attend the conference and present the paper onsite. 
 Only electronic submissions via Easychair will be allowed. Clickhref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=walcom2025" - here
