Important: PRO-VE 2025 Submissions
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is deeply transforming working modes, opening new ways to achieve a very large diversity of operational tasks where human expertise and artificial intelligence work synergistically. In a worldwide interconnected economy, where collaboration is constantly re-inforced as a key pillar of development, the design, support, management and supervision of hybrid human-AI organization networks open strong scientific challenges. At the organizational level, hybrid intelligence requires (i) the integration of artificial systems in the redefinition of organizational and human goals, roles and skills distribution, (ii) the consistent alignment of AI with the ambition of human-centric organizations or (iii) the management of new hybrid collaborative processes including overcoming human-resistances. At the technological level, hybrid organization first require enhance interoperability at the level of cognitive processes with strong challenges of data quality and availability, scalability and adaptability of algorithms, as well as trust and transparency in decision making. 
 The 25 years of scientific background developed by PRO-VE in designing and managing collaborative networks stand as the basis to build hybrid collaborative intelligence. The multisciplinarity of the science of collaborative networks make possible addressing a range of organizational and technical challenges, each of which demands careful thought and innovative solutions. On the technical side, ensuring effective human-AI integration, scaling AI systems, and fostering trust are key hurdles. Organizationally, addressing the need for skills development, managing change, and creating governance frameworks are all critical components. Balancing these challenges while maintaining ethical standards is essential for long-term success. 
 PRO-VE 2025is a forum for sharing and discussing current developments and experiences regarding the role of collaborative networks in the age of synergic intelligence between human and AI. Contributions are invited from multiple and diverse disciplines such as Engineering, Managerial and Socio-Human sciences: industrial engineering, computer science, manufacturing, organization science, logistics, management, and social sciences, among others.
