☰The 32ndIEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces 
 Ten years after the 2015 edition in Arles, located in the south of France, the conference is now exploring the west of France by landing in the historic city of Saint-Malo, in Brittany. 
 This exciting new edition of IEEE VR will be hosted at the Palais du Grand Large. This beachside congress center is designed to accommodate large-scale events like the IEEE VR conference. 
 Saint-Malo, a city known for its rich history of sea explorers and its openness to the world, perfectly embodies the spirit of the IEEE VR conference. It is a place that resonates deeply with our community as we continue to explore new scientific and technological challenges, with an open-minded approach. 
 Our IEEE VR community is renowned for its creativity and innovation. In line with this, we are thrilled to introduce a new track dedicated to artistic creation this year. This track will offer a unique venue for artists and students to showcase works that push the boundaries of traditional art forms, demonstrating how immersive technologies can transform and revisit artistic expressions. 
 Moreover, as a forward-thinking community, we recognize the importance of addressing the pressing issues of our world today. This year, we will place a special emphasis on sustainability, reflecting our commitment to making a positive impact on the world. Various initiatives and actions will be proposed to highlight and tackle environmental challenges, ensuring that our conference not only advances research and technology but also promotes a more sustainable future. 
 Join us in Saint-Malo for an unforgettable IEEE VR conference. Engage with leading experts, explore cutting-edge innovations, and be part of a vibrant community dedicated to shaping the future of immersive technologies. We look forward to seeing you there!

 The IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (IEEE VR) is the premier international event for the presentation of research results in the broad areas of virtual, augmented, and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR). Since 1993, IEEE VR has presented groundbreaking research and accomplishments by virtual reality pioneers: scientists, engineers, designers, and artists, paving the way for the future. Soon, IEEE VR expanded its scope to also include augmented, mixed, and other forms of mediated reality. Similarly, the IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces (3DUI), which started as a workshop at IEEE VR in 2004, has become the premier venue for 3D user interfaces and 3D interaction in virtual environments. In 2018, VR and 3DUI were merged into the IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces, with the short name IEEE VR. In 2020, VR was the first major IEEE conference to be held entirely online and in a virtual environment. 
 About Saint-Malo, Brittany, France 
 Saint-Malo is a port city located in the Brittany region of northwestern France, about 2 to 3 hours from Paris. It enchants visitors with its rich history, captivating architecture, and picturesque landscapes. Enclosed within formidable granite walls, it was once a pirate stronghold (corsairs approved by the King of France) strongly fortified against Norman and English attacks. This fortified port city exudes an old-world charm, offering a glimpse into its maritime past. Wander through the narrow cobblestone streets of the intra-muros (walled city) and discover charming cafes, boutiques, and historic landmarks such as the imposing Saint-Malo Cathedral. Beyond the city walls, visitors can explore stunning beaches, including the renowned Plage du Sillon, or embark on a journey to the nearby Mont Saint-Michel, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Whether strolling along the ramparts, indulging in fresh seafood, or simply soaking in the maritime ambiance, Saint-Malo offers a captivating blend of history, culture, and natural beauty that leaves a lasting impression on all who visit. 
 We are looking forward to welcoming you in France! 
 À bientôt à Saint-Malo !(See you in Saint-Malo)
