 Call for Papers 
 The annual IEEE Conference on Games (IEEE CoG) is a leading scientific research venue for game researchers and practitioners. Games are a great domain in which to study and develop novel ideas in design, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, psychology, education, sociology, and creativity, as well as their applications in real-world problems. IEEE CoG 2025 will take place at the University of Lisbon in Lisbon, Portugal. 
  
 We invite contributions related to all aspects of games and game development, including, but not limited to: 
  
 Accessibility and inclusivity in games (e.g., computer games, board games, LARPs) 
 AI for game development (automated playtesting, adaptation/personalization in games, etc.) 
 Esports and live-streaming 
 Extended reality (virtual reality, mixed reality, and augmented reality) 
 Game AI 
 Game analytics, game data science, and data visualization 
 Games as test-beds for algorithms 
 Game design (frameworks, game mechanics, etc.) 
 Game editors and authoring tools 
 Game technology (game engines, graphics, audio, animation, physics, controls, etc.) 
 Game user research (player/opponent modeling, player experience studies, psychology of play and player types, etc.) 
 Generative AI for games 
 Procedural content generation 
 Serious/applied games (for education, health, sustainability, etc.) 
 User interfaces in game 
  
 We invite authors to choose from six tracks: 1) AI and Game-playing, 2) Procedural Content Generation (PCG), 3) Designing Games, Serious Games and Playful Experience, 4) Game Technology, 5) Game HCI, Player Experience, Game Analytics, e-sports, and 6) Robots in Games. The authors should select the track that best matches the expertise needed to assess your research and that you believe will most fully appreciate the contribution of your paper to the field of games research. Descriptions for each track are listed below. 
  
 Please note:CoG is not a conference about game theory and does not accept papers about game theory unless they are applied to games people would play, such as video games or board games. 
 Auxiliary Papers 
 We invite the submission ofshortanddemoandcompetitionpapers. We continue to invitevisionpapers. Auxiliary papers will be included in the conference proceedings. 
  
 Shortpapers (2-4 pages) describe work in progress, smaller projects that are not yet ready to be published as a full paper, or new progress on projects that have been reported elsewhere. 
  
 Demopapers (2 pages) describe works to be presented during a demo session. Competition papers (8 pages) describe research related to one of the competitions in the Games community, including the design of new competitions and in particular submissions to existing competitions. 
  
 Competitionpapers (8 pages) describe research related to one of the competitions in the Games community, including the design of new competitions and in particular submissions to existing competitions. 
  
 Fullvisionpapers should describe a vision for the future of the Games field or some part of it, be based on extensive research, and include a comprehensive bibliography. Please notice that the standards for vision papers are high: literature reviews and opinion papers with speculations not grounded in research are immediately rejected. 
  
 All page limits include references and appendices. 
 Call for Papers 
 Full papers have an8-page limit in IEEE 2-column format(including references and appendices) and should constitute a technical or empirical contribution to scientific, technical, or engineering aspects of games.

 All submitted papers will be fully peer-reviewed, and accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and on IEEE Xplore. CoG will use adouble-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from their submissions and avoid obvious identifying statements. Submissions not abiding by anonymity requirements will be desk rejected. 
 Short papers may be allocated to either poster presentations or short oral presentations if time and space permit. Demo papers will be allocated to a demo session. Competition papers will be allocated to oral presentations. 
 Track Description 
 We invite authors to select the track that best matches the expertise needed to assess your research and that you believe will most fully appreciate the contribution of your paper to the field of games research. 
 AI and Game-playingThis track is suitable for computational and artificial intelligence applications in digital and non-digital games, except for procedural content generation (see below). Topics include but are not limited to general game-playing AI, mixed-initiative authoring tools, believable agents, and AI-assisted game design and testing. 
  
 Track chairs:Diego-Perez Liebana (diego.perez@qmul.ac.uk) and Kyung-Joong Kim (kjkim@gist.ac.kr) 
 Procedural Content Generation (PCG)This track focuses on advancing research on developing and evaluating algorithms that automatically create game design and content such as levels, maps, characters, stories, textures, and music. We welcome theoretical papers on the subject. 
  
 Track chairs:Antonios Liapis (an.liapis@gmail.com) and Ahmed Khalifa (ahmed.khalifa@um.edu.mt) 
 Designing Games, Serious Games and Playful ExperienceThis track welcomes papers that make a designerly contribution to games, playful interaction, and other playable media. We welcome a broad range of submissions that aim to advance practical or theoretical understanding of designing games, playful interactions, and player experience in various contexts. 
  
 Track chairs:Casper Harteveld (c.harteveld@northeastern.edu) 
 Game TechnologyThis track invites papers that improve the technical aspects of game design and development besides AI and robotics. Typical contributions include game engines, benchmarks, computer graphics techniques, animation, networking, and novel interaction technology (e.g., XR and alternative control). If the main contribution of a paper is designing playful experiences enabled by novel technology, it should be submitted to the design track. Papers about game competitions are also a good fit for this track. 
  
 Track chairs:Christopher Salge (C.Salge@herts.ac.uk) and Johannes Pfau (j.pfau@uu.nl) 
 Game HCI, Player Experience, Game Analytics, e-sportsThis track is suitable for submissions that seek to understand people in the context of play. Example topics include player experience evaluation (player psychology, games user research, and game analytics), the study of player and developer communities, and understanding humans in the context of play.
