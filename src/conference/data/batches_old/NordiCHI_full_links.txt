 The University of Vaasa and Åbo Akademi University are jointly organizing the international NordiCHI 2026 conference in Vaasa from October 3-7, 2026. Held every two years, the NordiCHI conference is one of the key events in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in Europe. 
 The conference theme, “Pulse – exploring the energy that drives us,” provides a forum to present the latest research in HCI from various perspectives. The organizing institutions’ focus on sustainable business, energy, and society, caring for the society of today and the future, creates an excellent framework for discussion. 
 The conference is expected to bring over 300 experts from academia and various organizations across Europe to Vaasa. The conference will feature two to three parallel sessions for presenting research papers, as well as workshops, tutorials, a doctoral consortium, poster presentations, an industry session showcasing company cases, and a session focused on arts-based approaches. 
 The organizing units include the School of Technology and Innovations and the School of Marketing and Communication at the University of Vaasa, as well as the Experience Lab and Informationsteknologienheten at Åbo Akademi University. The conference will further strengthen the HCI research and collaboration of the organizing institutions, while also providing an opportunity for local students and companies in the energy cluster to participate in discussions in the field. The General Chairs of the conference are Laura Havinen, a university teacher in information systems at the University of Vaasa, and Susanne Hägglund, a research project coordinator at Åbo Akademi University’s Experience Lab. The organizing team includes members from both institutions, with a total organizing committee of over 40 researchers from across Europe.

 Welcome to NordiCHI 2026: Pulse – exploring the energy that drives us 
 We invite you to join us in Vaasa, Finland, 3-7 October 2026 for NordiCHI 2026, an international conference bringing together the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community. NordiCHI 2026 offers a platform to engage in state-of-the-art discussions that propel HCI forward. 
 Our conference theme,Pulse – exploring the energy that drives us, represents the dynamic highs and calm lows of life, keeping us thriving. Vaasa is known for both its vibrant energy industry as the Nordic energy cluster and the tranquility of its surrounding nature and UNESCO World Heritage site. Thus, it serves as the perfect backdrop for exploring the elements of life in the coming ages of HCI.Our program will include sessions that reflect a wide range of perspectives—from theoretical and practical insights to creative explorations. We invite you to participate in insightful panels, dynamic workshops and tutorials, and demonstrations that highlight innovative research and applications in HCI. 
 The program will feature engaging sessions, including arts-based approaches that integrate creative expression with HCI research, informal coffee-table discussions for reflection and idea exchange, and industry sessions that connect practitioners with researchers to share practical insights. These sessions, along with thought-provoking critiques and poster presentations showing the late-breaking work, provide ample opportunities for collaboration and engagement.We look forward to welcoming you to Vaasa and to a conference experience that is as intellectually stimulating as it is socially enriching!
