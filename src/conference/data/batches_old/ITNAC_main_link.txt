 Optical Communications 
 Optical communication technologies will continue to be increasingly important in supporting the future Internet's expected scaling requirements of billions of users, their IT needs and aggregated huge bandwidths. Over the last two decades, optical communication technologies have increased the transmission capacity per fiber by several orders of magnitude, achieving Tbit/s transmissions. If the data traffic usage continues to increase at the current rate, a further increase in the transmission capacity of several orders of magnitude will be needed over the coming decades. This implies that future optical systems and networks should be able to support capacities well over Peta bit/s. However, the current technologies have already begun to reveal several fundamental limits; the electronic speed limit, the Shannon and quantum limit, and the IPbottleneck. The future technologies must overcome these limits ensuring sustainable growth of network traffic. The optical communications theme aims to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of significant progress of research, development and applications of cutting-edge technologies in optical communication devices, subsystems, systems and networks.

 Wireless Sensor Networks 
 The field of wireless sensor networks is now getting more and more mature, but new design concepts, experimental and theoretical findings, and applications continue to emerge at a rapid pace. Furthermore, there are still significant challenges for the theoretical understanding and practical application of sensor networks. 
 The goal of the sensor networking track is to bring together people from academia and industry who have interest in the area of wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. We seek papers describing original, previously unpublished research results. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Networking protocols: MAC, routing, transport, next generation 
 Cooperative communication approaches 
 Cross-layer design and optimization 
 Broadcasting, multicasting, geocasting 
 Quality-of-service, reliability and fault tolerance, coverage and connectivity 
 Security 
 Supplementary services: localization, time synchronization 
 Body sensor networks 
 Operating Systems and Software 
 Middleware and Macroprogramming 
 Information and query processing 
 Prototypes, field experiments, testbeds 
 Theoretical limits, network scaling 
 Novel applications 
 Networks and Management 
 Telecommunications and networking policy, regulation and management are an important aspect of deregulation and competition policy formulation. There are significant challenges for the development of an understanding of the dynamics of telecommunications markets. The introduction of solutions and case studies provide an opportunity to analyse outcomes and to learn from research into policy and management practices. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 General topics related to networks and applications 
 Broadband Network Management 
 Regional and Remote Networks 
 Next generation network regulation 
 Communication technology fundamentals
