 IFIP WG 1.10: String Algorithmics & Applications 
 Overview 
 IFIP Working Group 1.10 is one of theten working groupsof theTechnical Committee 1of theInternational Federation for Information Processing (IFIP). IFIP, the leading multinational and apolitical organization in Information & Communications Technologies and Sciences, represents IT Societies from 56 countries or regions, covering all 5 continents with a total membership of over half a million. 
 Aims and Scope 
 The Working Group has been founded in 2015 with the main aim to focus in String Algorithmics (combinatorics on words, string algorithms) and applications. It proposes a unique forum for the best available research that will provide sustained inspiration within the stringological community for still better research. We intend to take advantage of the applied nature of a very theoretical topic to encourage both theory and practice in the group. At both ends our main concern is to promote relevant research of the very highest quality. 
 The scope for such a group is paradoxically both well-focussed and broad: well-focussed because the underlying combinatorial object is text, a simple word, a piece of string; broad because of the numerous applications (combinatorics on words, finite automata), but also algorithms on strings, and so the application areas for those algorithms, of which a partial list follows: 
 computational biology (including system biology, biology/PPI networks) 
 text compression 
 natural language processing 
 information retrieval, both on and off the Internet (including search engines, massive indexing applications) 
 data mining 
 pattern recognition 
 software engineering 
 cryptology 
 computational geometry 
 computational musicology
