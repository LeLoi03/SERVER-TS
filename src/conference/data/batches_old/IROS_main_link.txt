 More information on generative AI usage can be found atthe IEEE RAS publication website. 

FAQ 
  
 lIs the IROS review process single-blind or double-blind? 
  
 The IROS review process is single-blind (reviewers stay anonymous, but author information is visible). Therefore, manuscripts should include author names and their affiliations. 
  
 lWill there be an extension to the paper submission deadline? 
  
 There is no plan to extend the paper submission deadline. 
  
 lWhat is the format of the conference? 
  
 IROS 2025 will be held in person in Hangzhou, China. The Organizing Committee is committed to delivering technical programs that offer conference attendees a rewarding experience both professionally and personally. All accepted paper will be offered oral presentation opportunities. The presentation style will be oral + poster. More details will be posted later. 
  
 lIf I cannot attend IROS in person due to some reasons, can my paper be presented in an alternative way? 
  
 Yes. We will accommodate authors whose papers are accepted but could not join us in person. Alternative ways to present the paper will be provided, such as video presentation. 
  
 lHow can I transfer an accepted paper from T-ASE/T-FR/RA-P for presentation at IROS? 
  
 If you want to transfer an accepted paper from one of the journals T-ASE, T-FR, or RA-P to IROS, the paper should be submitted in paperplaza in the relevant submission category of IROS, but not as regular IROS paper. For the paper upload, you will need to enter a code, which can be obtained from the Editor-In-Chief of the journal. 
  
 Notice that papers from T-RO, RA-M, and RA-L follow a different process and do not require a code. Authors of accepted papers will receive an email from PaperCept regarding the transfer of their paper to a conference at which they wish to present their paper.
