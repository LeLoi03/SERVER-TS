 Call for Papers 
 Papers on original research unpublished elsewhere in all areas related to combinatorial pattern matching and its applications are sought. 
 The proceedings will be published by LIPIcs (of Dagstuhl). 
 A selection of the best papers will be invited to be submitted to Algorithmica 
 Topics of Interest 
 Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics: 
 Bioinformatics and computational biology 
 Coding and data compression 
 Combinatorics on words 
 Data mining 
 Information retrieval 
 Natural language processing 
 Pattern discovery 
 String algorithms 
 String processing in databases 
 Symbolic computing 
 Text searching and indexing 
 Keynote speakers 
 Inge Li Gørtz (Technical University of Denmark, Denmark) 
 Nicola Prezza (Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, Italy) 
 Kunihiko Sadakane (The University of Tokyo, Japan) 
 Important dates 
 This edition is piloting a two rounds system: The first round call aims to select half of the papers and the second round call the rest. Revised versions of the papers rejected in the first round call can be resubmitted in the second round call, competing with the solicited fresh submissions. 
 First round submission deadline: November 16, 2024 (AoE) 
 Author notification: December 23, 2024 
 Second round submission deadline: February 21, 2025 (AoE) 
 Author notification: | March 21, 2025 | March 31, 2025 (new date) 
 Camera-ready due: | April 14, 2025 
 Conference: June 17-19, 2025 
 Submission 
 Submission is through the EasyChair conference system, by following thehref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpm2025" - link
. The submission process requires registration to create an EasyChair account prior to submission. 
 Submission format 
 The authors should submit an extended abstract not exceeding 12 single-spaced pages on A4 paper, excluding the title page (containing title, authors, affiliations, e-mail addresses, a short abstract, and keywords) and the references. The authors are required to use thehref="https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author" - LaTeX style file supplied
by Dagstuhl (LIPIcs). Papers must be submitted as a single file in PDF format. 
 Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication in the final version - for example details of proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. The program code of experimental papers should be made public, with reasonable documentation, such that the PC may evaluate replicability of experimental results. 
 Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work and surveys of important results. At the time the extended abstract is submitted to CPM, and for the entire review period, the paper (or essentially the same paper) should not be under review by any other conference with published proceedings or by a scientific journal. 
 At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference as a registered participant. The conference will be held in person at the University of Milano-Bicocca, within easy reach from the city center of Milan, Italy.
