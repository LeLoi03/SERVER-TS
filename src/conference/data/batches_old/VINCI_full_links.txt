 The 18th International Symposium on 
 Visual Information Communication and Interaction 
 Visual communication through graphical or sign languages has long been conducted among human beings of different backgrounds or cultures, and in recent decades between humans and machines. In today’s digital world, visual information is typically encoded with various metaphors commonly used in daily life to facilitate rapid comprehension and easy analysis during the communication process. Visual information communication generally encompasses information visualization, graphical user interfaces, visual analytics, and visual languages. Visual information is increasingly being used to facilitate human-human communication through the Internet and mobile devices. 
 VINCI is the premier international forum for researchers and industrial practitioners to discuss the state of the art in visual communication theories, designs, and applications.The 18th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction (VINCI ’25)will be held in Linz, Austria. 
 VINCI ’25 invites a variety of submissions, includingTechnical Papers,Art Papers, andArt and Media Galleries.

 VINCI 2024 
 Visual communication through graphical or sign languages has long been conducted among human beings of different backgrounds or cultures, and in recent decades between humans and machines. In today's digital world, visual information is typically encoded with various metaphors commonly used in daily life to facilitate rapid comprehension and easy analysis during the communication process. Visual information communication generally encompasses information visualization, graphical user interfaces, visual analytics, and visual languages. Visual information is increasingly being used to facilitate human-human communication through the Internet and mobile devices. 
 VINCI is the premier international forum for researchers and industrial practitioners to discuss the state of the art in visual communication theories, designs, and applications.The 17th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction (VINCI'24)will be held during December 11-13, 2024, in Hsinchu, Taiwan. 
 VINCI'24 includes tracks ofTechnical Papers,Art Papers, andArt and Media Galleries. All accepted papers will be included in the ACM Proceedings as formal publications and EI-indexed. Selected papers will be invited to be extended for publication in special issues ofPRESENCE: Virtual and Augmented Reality(SCI-indexed; MIT Press; 3-4 papers for fast-tracked review in 2 months) andInternational Journal of Digital Media Design(Taiwan Humanities Core Index). 
 Paper Submission 
 Submissions that address research and development and experience reports on the above topics are strongly encouraged. Papers can be submitted as full papers, short papers and posters. Art and Media Galleries can be submitted as media demos and artworks. Each submitted symposium paper will be peer-reviewed by at least three International Program Committee members. You are welcome to submit a paper to VINCI 2024. All accepted papers and posters will appear in the proceedings of VINCI 2024 published by ACM ICPS and made available in theACM Digital Library(EI indexed). Authors of a number of selected full papers of high quality will be invited to prepare extended versions for submission to thespecial issues ofPRESENCE: Virtual and Augmented Reality(SCI-indexed; MIT Press; 3-4 papers for fast-tracked review in 2 months) andInternational Journal of Digital Media Design(Taiwan Humanities Core Index). 
 All paper submissions should be made through thehref="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/VINCI2024/Submission/Index" - CMT
conference management system. The review process will be single-blind. We encourage to submit an anonymized version of your manuscript by removing all author and affiliation information from submissions and supplemental files as well as substituting your paper's ID number for the author's name. All submissions must be written in English and formatted according to thehref="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow" - ACM Proceedings Template
(using sigconf format/template double-column style) and should consist of a single PDF file. 
 Please note: the authors of accepted papers will be later requested to submit source Latex or Word files during camera-ready version submission. We appreciate the submission of videos or other supplemental material. Please provide supplemental videos in MPEG-4, and use PNG for supplemental images, both in sufficient resolution. In case of any questions related to the submission process or conference program, please contact the program chairs viavinciconference2024@gmail.com.

 Abstract 
 Online social media has revolutionized human interaction by fostering unparalleled cooperation and connectivity, surpassing the bounds of conventional, location-based methods. Despite their inherent limitations—such as physical boundaries, ongoing maintenance expenses, and rigidity—traditional methods impart a vital local context often neglected by digital platforms, potentially overshadowing local environmental engagement in favor of broader online networks. To mitigate this imbalance, it is essential to revitalize the significance of location-specific interactions. Augmented Reality (AR) stands out as a powerful means to enhance the accessibility and allure of such engagements. In this context, our research involved a detailed review and synthesis of existing location-based interactive services, pinpointing prevalent obstacles as well as offering strategic recommendations. Building upon these findings, we innovated ARMessageBoard, a prototype fusing AR with users’ immediate surroundings to craft virtual message boards. Our within-subjects study comprised 15 participants with an average age of 21.2 years (SD=5.5), systematically comparing ARMessageBoard with standard location-based mechanisms. Furthermore, we deliberated how blending AR with online social media could positively influence the convergence of virtual and real-world interaction landscapes, potentially enriching the individual’s role in shaping socio-digital exchanges.

 EVLers Present “Hummingbird: Live Theater Adventure Empowering Collaboration in Virtual Reality” & Win Best Art Paper Award at VINCI 2024 
 December 11th, 2024-December 13th, 2024Categories:Multimedia,Software,VR,VR Art,Human Computer Interaction (HCI),New Media Arts 
 AboutEVL alumni Sai Priya Jyothula and Arthur Nishimoto presented their Virtual Reality (VR) research at the 17th International Symposium on Visual Information Communication and Interaction (VINCI'24) held December 11-13, 2024, in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The VR project “Hummingbird: Collaborative Virtual Reality for Tele-Immersive Interactive Theater” was developed by Daria Tsoupikova, Sai Priya Jyothula, Arthur Nishimoto, Jo Cattell, Andrew Johnson and Lance Long. Their publication documenting the ’adventure’ over the years of developing, demonstrating, and engaging audiences in an innovative theater experience is recognized as the “Best Art Paper” of the Conference. 
  
 VINCI is the premier international forum for researchers and industrial practitioners to discuss the state of the art in visual communication theories, designs, and applications. Visual communication through graphical or sign languages has long been conducted among humans of different backgrounds or cultures and, in recent decades, between humans and machines. In today's digital world, visual information is typically encoded with various metaphors commonly used in daily life to facilitate rapid comprehension and easy analysis during the communication process. Visual information communication generally encompasses information visualization, graphical user interfaces, visual analytics, and visual languages.
