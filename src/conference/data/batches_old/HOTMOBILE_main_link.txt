 Welcome to HotMobile 2025 
 The Twenty-sixth International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (ACM HotMobile 2025) continues the series of highly selective, interactive workshops focused on mobile applications, systems, and environments, as well as their underlying state-of-the-art technologies. HotMobile's small workshop format makes it ideal for processing and discussing new directions or controversial approaches.

 The 26th Annual International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications 
 (ACM HotMobile 2026) 
  
 Sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE 
 February 26-27, 2025 
 Palm Springs, CA 
 HotMobile'25 continues the series of highly selective, interactive workshops focused on mobile applications, systems, and environments, as well as their underlying state-of-the-art technologies. HotMobile's small workshop format makes it ideal for presenting and discussing new directions or controversial approaches. HotMobile seeks proposals for posters and live demonstrations describing novel work on mobile systems, applications, and services. Posters and demonstrations will be presented during a reception at the workshop. 
 The poster/demo session is meant to introduce new or ongoing work and provide opportunities for authors to interact directly with workshop attendees. Posters are well suited to controversial work that can generate discussion or promising new ideas that have not been thoroughly evaluated. Live demos provide an opportunity to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of your research. 
 Accepted posters and demos will be published in the proceedings. This year's poster/demo session will feature a Best Poster/Demo award. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 Submissions must include an extended abstract no longer than one 8.5x11-inch page, including all figures and references. The poster/demo should be uploaded tohref="https://hotmobile25-posterdemo.hotcrp.com/" - https://hotmobile25-posterdemo.hotcrp.com/
. 
 More details on the submission process 
 Please set up your page to be US letter size, 8.5x11 inches, two columns, using 10-pt font size for the text body, with at least one-inch margin on all sides. Submissions must be in Adobe PDF format. Please include the title of the poster/demo and the author list, including affiliations in both the PDF file and in the body of the email. Prefix your title with “Poster:” for a poster submission and “Demo:” for a demo submission. Please do not anonymize your submissions. The accepted posters and demos will need to submit a one-page version using 9-pt font size, which will provide more space for authors to accommodate reviewer feedback. 
 For demo submissions, we encourage the submission of an optional companion video that illustrates the demo. The companion video should highlight the technical contributions of the demo and should be no more than one minute in length. Include the YouTube URL of the companion video in the extended abstract. 
 Important dates 
 Paper submission (hard deadline):October 11, 2024, 11:59pm AoE

 Palm Springs, CA 
 ACM HotMobile 2025, the Twenty-sixth International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications continues the series of highly selective, interactive workshops focused on mobile applications, systems, and environments, as well as their underlying state-of-the-art technologies. HotMobile's small workshop format makes it ideal for presenting and discussing new directions or controversial approaches. 
 We solicit submissions of papers that (1) focus primarily on systems and applications and (2) propose new directions of research, advocate non-traditional approaches to old (or new) ideas, or generate controversy and discussion. We especially encourage papers that identify fundamental open questions, advocate a new approach, offer a constructive critique of the state-of-the-art, debunk existing assumptions, report unexpected early results, report on promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Novel ideas need not be supported by full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations suffice. The program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion over a “6-pages conference paper.” 
 We take a broad view of Mobile Systems research. This includes: 
 Novel applications, environments, and devices supporting mobility. 
 Operating system and distributed system support for mobile computing. 
 Wearable computing, internet of things, edge computing, sensing, and context-awareness. 
 HCI issues related to mobile computing. 
 Security and privacy of mobile computing. 
 Management, configuration, and deployment of systems supporting mobility. 
 Wireless technology, as it pertains to mobile systems and applications. 
 Social issues related to mobile computing. 
 System and application support for the use of ML and AI on mobile platforms. 
 Important dates: 
 Hard | deadline for submissions: | October 11th, 2024, 11:59pm AoE 
 Acceptance notification: | December 16th, 2024 
 Presenting at HotMobile is a good way to get early feedback on research ideas at least one year away from a full-fledged conference submission to ACM MobiSys or other high-quality conferences. A full-length paper on the same topic submitted to a conference in less than a year is unlikely to include sufficient new material and mature ideas to warrant publication. 
 As is customary, papers must not have been published elsewhere and may not be simultaneously under submission at another venue. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be returned to the author(s) unread. As customary with the scientific peer review process, submissions will be handled as confidential material during the review. 
 Submissions should contain 6 or fewer U.S. letter pages in PDF format, including all references, figures and tables. The submissions shouldnot be anonymous.The submissions must meet the following formatting requirements: 
 Font size no smaller than 10pt. 
 Font size of the bibliography no smaller than 9pt. 
 Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column. 
 Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches x 11 inches). 
 We recommend the use of the "sigconf" ACM proceedings template, available at:http://www.acm.org/, with the font size of the main body amended to 10pt. An example Tex document can be foundhref="http://hotmobile.org/2018/downloads/sample-sigconf.tex" - here
. For more submission guidelines, please visit the conference website. Please note that it is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that the submissions are meeting all formatting requirements. 
 The papers accepted to HotMobile 2025 will be publicly available from the workshop's website for a limited time window, as per ACM's Digital Library's Policy.
