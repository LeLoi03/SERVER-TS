 Research Track 
 ADMA 2025 provides an international platform fororiginal research in data mining, covering applications, algorithms, software, and systems. Submissions will undergo double-blind peer review and should contribute to theoretical or applied advancements in data mining. 
 Industry Track 
 This track focuses on applied research and real-world implementations of data mining solutions. Submissions should highlightpractical value, industrial significance, and innovative deployments, such as best practices, novel systems, and large-scale dataset analyses in industry.The single-blind review process allows authors to include identity and affiliation details.

 Submission Guidelines 
 CMT Acknowledgment 
 The Microsoft CMT service was used for managing the peer-reviewing process for this conference. This service was provided for free by Microsoft and they bore all expenses, including costs for Azure cloud services as well as for software development and support. 
 Submission Site 
 href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADMA2025" - https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADMA2025
Formatting Guidelines 
 The paper should be in English and contain unpublished contributions to the data mining and related fields. 
 Manuscripts must be prepared in accordance with the LNAI (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence) format. For the template and details on the LNCS style, seehref="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" - Springer's Author Instructions 
 The paper should NOT exceed 15 pages in LNAI format. 
 Submissions are reviewed in adouble-blindmanner. For ADMA2025 the double-blind means that: 
 Author identities and affiliations are not disclosed to reviewers during the review process. 
 Authors should prepare and submit suitably blinded manuscripts that do not reveal author and affiliation information. Specific requirements to this end are detailed below. 
 Authors and reviewers alike make an honest effort to avoid accidentally de-blinding any submission. 
 The list of authors at the time of submission is final and cannot be changed. 
 "Submitted papers" must comply with all of the rules below. Any violation may result in an"desk reject". 
 Manuscript Preparation 
 Authors must submit PDFs without author names and affiliations. Submitted PDFs must also not contain any metadata that could reveal author identities or affiliations. 
 Authors should aim to avoid copy&pasting substantial amounts of text from their own prior publications, as such text blocks may be readily recognized by experts familiar with the state of the art and recent papers in the area. 
 Similarly, authors should not directly reuse figures from their own prior publications without attribution. Ideally, “fresh” figures should be prepared and used whenever possible. If that is not a viable option, that is, if a figure must be reused, then a citation should be included giving credit to the original paper from which the illustration has been adapted. 
 Authors must refrain from using any specific formatting tricks linguistic mannerisms, figure styles, or other stylistic idioms that could hint at or disclose the author identity or affiliation. 
 Submitted papers should not include an acknowledgements section or funding acknowledgements (even when blinded) since it can indicate the country of residence of (some of) the authors. (Such acknowledgements of course may be added to the camera-ready version.) 
 Authors who seek to refer to an online appendix or to supplemental materials (e.g., source code, videos, etc.) may still do so. However, instead of directly providing a URL or tech report number, authors should include a note that the appendices and/or supplemental materials in question are available from the track chair upon request. 
 Authors must provide all supplemental materials and/or appendices that a submission refers to in blinded form and sent them to the PC chair by email (or other approaches appointed by the PC chair) before the submission deadline. 
 The track chair will retain a copy of all submitted materials for the duration of the reviewing process. Any such provided appendices or supplemental materials are not subject to review and may be consulted by the reviewers at their own discretion. 
 It is imperative to acknowledge the contributions of AI models in the generation of textual content. Authors utilizing AI-generated text in their manuscripts are required to assume full responsibility for the accuracy, integrity, and originality of the material presented. Furthermore, any section of the paper employing AI-generated text should include clear documentation and description of the AI system utilized. This transparency ensures that readers can discern between human-authored content and text generated by AI, fostering a culture of accountability and integrity within the scholarly community. 
 Own Prior Work, Well-Known Projects, and Research Artifacts 
 Authors should not upload their manuscript to preprint servers (such as arXiv) or their personal websites while the paper is under review, or otherwise publicly reveal their authorship of the manuscript under review. 
 As an exception to the previous rule, if a prior version of the manuscript has already been uploaded to a public preprint server prior to submission (e.g., if the paper is a re-submission of a paper previously rejected at another single-blind conference), then the paper may still be submitted to ADMA2025. However, such papers must be blinded when submitted to ADMA2025. 
 In exceptional circumstances that force a violation of the above two rules (e.g., a technical report or thesis must be filed in order for a student to graduate), the authors should contact the Program Chair prior to publicizing their manuscript content to avoid misunderstandings. 
 When submitting or extending a prior workshop publication, the workshop paper is treated as an online preprint for the purpose of the double-blind peer-review process. However, authors must proactively disclose the existence of a prior workshop version of a submitted paper. Such information should be emailed to the Program Chair. Failure to disclose a prior workshop publication is considered self-plagiarism. 
 After communicating with the Program Chair, submissions with conditions 2., 3., or 4. above are recommended to add a headline (or footer) on the first page with the following information: “This submission is based on Preprints, Paper Announcements, and Prior Workshop Papers. The information has been communicated with the Program Chair. The author(s) and the Program Chair request the reviewers not to actively search for the author names to ensure fairness of the double-blind review process.” Please contact the Program Chair at least 24 hours before the submission deadline if this applies to your submission. If the paper is accepted, the above text should be removed and appropriate citations if any should be added (e.g., citation for prior workshop paper, technical report or thesis and its relation to the accepted paper). 
 If your submission is an extended version of a workshop paper with DOI, you will be asked to provide a blinded version of the workshop paper as supplementary material. This will be used by the reviewers to verify that there is sufficient amount of new material in the extended version to warrant a publication at ADMA2025. 
 Conflicts of Interest 
 We use CMT’s conflict management system, through which authors should flag conflicts with members of the Program Committee. X and Y have a conflict of interest if any of the following applies: 
 X and Y have worked in the same university or company in the past two years, or will be doing so in the next six months on account of an accepted job offer. Different campuses within the same university system do not count as the same university for this purpose - UC Berkeley does not have a conflict with UC Santa Barbara. 
 X has been a co-author of a paper with Y in the last three years. 
 X has been a collaborator within the past two years, as evidenced in a joint publication (subsumed by the stricter rule on co-authorship above), joint research project, or co-organizing events (e.g., co-chairs of conferences), or are collaborating now (including co-authorship on papers not resulted in final publication yet). 
 X is the master’s/PhD thesis advisor of Y or vice versa, irrespective of how long ago this was. 
 X is a relative or close personal friend of Y. 
 It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify and declare all COIs with members of the Program Committee (reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs) prior to the submission deadline. Submissions with undeclared conflicts or spurious conflicts will be desk-rejected.
