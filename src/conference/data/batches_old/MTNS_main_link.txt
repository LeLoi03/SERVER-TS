 Announcements 
 MTNSis a major symposium in the general area of mathematical systems theory, networks and control. The symposium is interdisciplinary and attracts mathematicians, engineers and researchers working in all aspects of systems theory and its applications. The symposium is held every two years. Mathematical methods which play a role in the areas mentioned above stem from a broad range of fields of pure and applied mathematics, including ordinary and partial differential equations, real and complex analysis, numerical analysis, probability theory and stochastic analysis, operator theory, linear and commutative algebra as well as algebraic and differential geometry. Application areas range from biology, communications and mathematical finance to problems in electrical, mechanical, aerospace and chemical engineering, and robotics. The associatedInternational Workshop on Operator Theory and its Applications (IWOTA 2024)takes place at the University of Kent, Canterbury UK, 12-16 August 2024. 
 MTNS is co-sponsored by IFAC
