 IEEE International Conference on E-health Networking, Application & Services 
 Welcome to IEEE Healthcom 2025 
 At IEEE HealthCom 2025 conference, we will explore the transformative power of AI and digital health in revolutionizing healthcare delivery. 
 Our theme, "AI and Digital Health: Innovations, Challenges, and Future Perspectives" highlights the synergy between AI and digital health, focusing on their impact on improving healthcare services, enhancing communication systems, and creating more efficient, accessible, and patient-centred care. 
 AI, combined with Digital Health tools like telemedicine, mobile health apps, wearable devices, and data analytics platforms, is revolutionizing healthcare by enabling seamless interactions between patients and providers. These technologies empower individuals to manage their health more effectively, with real-time monitoring, personalized treatment recommendations, and instant communication becoming the new norm, thereby improving both clinical outcomes and patient experiences. 
 At IEEE HealthCom 2025, we will explore cutting-edge innovations in AI-driven healthcare communication technologies, address the challenges of integrating digital health solutions into existing infrastructures, and explore the future of a connected, data-driven health ecosystem. Key issues such as interoperability, data security, privacy concerns, and the ethical dimensions of using AI in healthcare communications will be discussed, ensuring that these innovations contribute to a more inclusive and equitable healthcare system. 
 Join us in shaping the future of eHealth, where AI and digital health are bridging gaps in communication, enhancing care, and addressing the healthcare challenges of tomorrow. Together, let's create a more resilient and equitable healthcare landscape for all.
