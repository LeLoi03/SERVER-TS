 About the conference 
 The International Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS) is a premier forum for presenting research in the field of cryptology and network security. The conference seeks academic, industry, and government submissions on all theoretical and practical aspects of cryptology and network security, and its extended domains in modern computing systems (see below for Topic Areas). This year marks the 24th iteration of the conference and will be held at Osaka, Japan.Proceedings of this yearâ€™s conference will be published by Springer LNCS; proceedings ofhref="https://link.springer.com/conference/cans" - previous iterations of the conference
can be found online. 
 Submission guidelines 
 High-quality papers on unpublished research and implementation experiences may be submitted. All papers must be original and not substantially duplicated work that has been published at, or is simultaneously submitted to, a journal or another conference or workshop. All submissions must be written in English and span no more than 20 pages in Springerâ€™s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format (a Springer template can be found in Overleaf), including title, abstract, and bibliography. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level understandable by a non-expert reader and explain the context to related work. 
 Submitted papers may contain supplementary material in the form of well-marked appendices or a separate file archive (particularly for source code, data files, etc.). Note that supplementary material will not be included in the proceedings. Moreover, the main paper should be intelligible without requiring the reader to consult the supplementary material; the reviewers may optionally refer to the supplementary material, but are also permitted to base their assessment on the main paper alone. 
 Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper.The conference will also consider short papers of up to eight pages in the LNCS format, excluding the bibliography (max 2 pages), for results that are not yet fully fleshed out or that simply require fewer pages to describe but still make a significant contribution. 
 All submissions must be processed with LaTeX2e according to the instructions given by Springer. Submitted manuscripts must be typeset in plain Springer LNCS format, in particular without changing the font size, margins or line spacing. Submissions not meeting these guidelines may be rejected without consideration of their merits.
