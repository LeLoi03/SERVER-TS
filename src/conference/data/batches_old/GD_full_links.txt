About Graph Drawing 2025href="#about-graph-drawing-2025" - Permalink
Graph Drawing is concerned with the geometric representation of graphs and constitutes the algorithmic core of Network Visualization. Graph Drawing and Network Visualization are motivated by applications where it is crucial to visually analyze and interact with relational datasets. Examples of such application areas include data science, social sciences, Web computing, information systems, biology, geography, business intelligence, information security and software engineering. 
 The symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization has been the main annual event in this area for more than 30 years. Its focus is on combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of graph drawing as well as the design of network visualization systems and interfaces.

The International Symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization 
 Graph Drawingis concerned with the geometric representation of graphs and networks and is motivated by those applications where it is crucial to visualize structural information as graphs. Since graph drawing methods form the algorithmic core of network visualization, bridging the gap between theoretical advances and implemented solutions is an important aspect. This site is a collection of resources mostly related to the annualInternational Symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualizationand to the area of Graph Drawing and Network Visualization more in general.

GD Steering Committee 
 Effective since the beginning of 2025, the steering committee consists of four types of members: 
 the founding members with unlimited terms (until they decide to retire from the committee) 
 three elected members with 3-year terms (elected by the GD community) 
 one appointed members with 3-year terms (selected by the steering committee) 
 some rotating members with 3-year terms (the program committee chairs of the previous, current and next GD conference) 
 Details are specified in thehref="./doc/GD-bylaws-v2024.pdf" - bylaws

 href="" - GD Advisory Board
The advisory board provides perspectives for GD and advises the steering committee on strategic issues. Members are appointed by unanimous vote of the steering committee for an unbounded term (until resignation or revocation with an 8/9 majority vote of the steering committee). Membership is considered an exceptional honor to persons who have contributed very substantially to the development of the field or can fulfill the aforementioned role for other reasons.
