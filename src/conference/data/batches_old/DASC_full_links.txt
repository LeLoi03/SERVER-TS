 The 23rd IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing (DASC 2025) 
 Hybrid Conference Mode (In-Presence/Virtual) 
 October 21-24, 2025 - Hakodate City, Hokkaido, Japan 
 As computer and communication systems, as well as other systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and Autonomous Robotic Systems, become increasingly large and complex, their Dependability and Security play critical roles in supporting next-generation science, engineering, and commercial applications. It remains a challenge to design, analyze, evaluate, and improve the dependability and security of a large-scale computing environment. Trusted and autonomic computing/autonomous systems need synergistic research efforts covering many disciplines, from natural sciences to social sciences. It requires scientific and technological advances in a variety of fields, as well as new software, architectures, communication, and data platform technology that support the integration of the constituent technologies. 
 IEEE DASC 2025 will be held during October 21-24, 2025, in Hakodate City, Hokkaido, Japan, co-located withhref="http://cyber-science.org/2025/cyberscitech/" - IEEE CyberSciTech 2025

, andhref="http://cyber-science.org/2025/cbdcom/" - IEEE CBDCom 2025
. It aims to bring together computer scientists, industrial engineers, and researchers to discuss and exchange theoretical and implementation results, novel designs, work-in-progress, experience, case studies, and trend-setting ideas in the areas of dependability, security, trust, and/or autonomic computing, and autonomous systems.

 2024 (English)In:Proceedings - 2024 IEEE Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing, DASC 2024, IEEE Computer Society, 2024, p. 65-72Conference paper, Published paper (Refereed)Abstract [en] 
 This position paper presents the preliminary results from a research study focusing on cryptographic agility for consumers of open-source cryptographic libraries. We provide a concise overview of frontiers and recent advancements in cryptographic agility research frontier, examining the utilized approaches and emphasizing the perception of application layer encryption in end-to-end encryption systems. The paper delves into the state of practice of cryptographic libraries and programming interfaces, outlining recognized challenges and knowledge gaps that warrant exploration through new scientific research. Furthermore, we outline the values of cryptographic agility in a manifesto and propose a survey structure to validate our assumptions.
