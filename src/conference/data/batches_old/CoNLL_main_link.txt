 CoNLL 2025Vienna, Austria, July 31 - August 1, 2025 (co-located with ACL) 
 Welcome to the 29th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2025). CoNLL is a yearly conference organized by SIGNLL (ACL's Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning), focusing on theoretically, cognitively, and scientifically motivated approaches to computational linguistics. In particular, it seeks to explore the interaction between theoretical issues inlinguistics and cognition, on the one hand, andcomputational modeling, on the other. Questions that CoNLL addresses are e.g.: How do computational models inform us about how language and cognition work? Which phenomena do they capture, which do they not capture? Conversely, how do linguistics and cognitive science contribute to understanding, and possibly improving, AI models? 
 We welcome work targeting any aspect of language and its computational modeling, including but not only: 
 Computational Psycholinguistics, Cognition and Linguistics 
 Computational Social Science and Sociolinguistics 
 Interaction and Dialogue 
 Language Acquisition, Learning, Emergence, and Evolution 
 Multimodality and Grounding 
 Typology and Multilinguality 
 Speech and Phonology 
 Syntax and Morphology 
 Semantics and Pragmatics 
 Theoretical Analysis and Interpretation of ML Models for NLP 
 Resources and Tools for Scientifically Motivated Research 
 Invited Speakers 
 Raquel Fernández, University of Amsterdam 
 Jean-Rémi King, CNRS / Meta AI 
 Timeline 
 (All deadlines are 11:59pm UTC-12h, AoE) 
 Submission deadline (archival andnon-archival): March 14 2025
