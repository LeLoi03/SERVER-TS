 A Message From the Conference Chair 
 Welcome to SIGGRAPH 2025 
 Every day we find ourselves more deeply immersed in the technology we create. Where computers and data once existed apart from us, they are now interwoven in our lives, powered by the drive of human expression, creativity, and need. The relationship between humanity and technology transforms our world, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. As a community of excellence in technical skill and artistry, we at SIGGRAPH can lead this transformation by shaping a future that unites the physical and digital worlds for the better. 
 At SIGGRAPH 2025, we stand at the forefront of this progress, embracing it, sharing it, and creating it. We are not just passive participants — we are active co-creators of the future. From the art we bring to life, to the stories we tell across media and unprecedented levels of immersion transforming how we experience the world, SIGGRAPH 2025 is a celebration of our collective drive to connect, comprehend, and express the essence of human experience. 
 The human story has always fueled technological breakthroughs, and together, we are writing the next chapter in a legacy that spans over five decades. For 52 years, SIGGRAPH has nurtured the brightest minds and boldest ideas in computer graphics and interactive techniques. This year, we return to Vancouver, whose modern, urban landscape meets an inspiring nature setting, reminding us that technology, at its best, complements and enhances our world. 
 We are thrilled to welcome you to SIGGRAPH 2025, where you will discover and embrace how human ingenuity and technological marvels unite to shape our trajectory toward a better future.
