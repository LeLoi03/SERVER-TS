 Following a feature of ICDAR2019 through ICDAR2024, ICDAR 2025 will again include the option of a journal track that offers the rapid turnaround and dissemination times of a conference while providing the paper length, scientific rigor, and careful review process of an archival journal. 
 The ICDAR-IJDAR journal track invites high-quality submissions that present original work in the areas of Document Analysis and Recognition appropriate to both the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR) and the International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition (IJDAR). Accepted papers will be published in a special issue of IJDAR and will receive an oral presentation slot at the ICDAR 2025 conference. 
 Authors who submit their work to the journal track commit themselves to present their results at the ICDAR conference in case of acceptance. Springer Nature, the publisher of IJDAR, will make the papers accepted for the journal track freely available in a time frame of four weeks around the conference, beyond being available in the archival journal. 
 Format:Papers submitted to the journal track should followhref="https://www.springer.com/journal/10032" - the format of IJDAR submissions and all of the standard guidelines
. 
 Procedure and Deadlines: 
 We permit a second round of submissions for the ICDAR-IJDAR journal track only for revised papers from the 1st round of submissions. It must be understood by all authors that the full journal review process will be required for all ICDAR-IJDAR track submissions — there is no “short cut.” Papers submitted late in the second round run a risk of the review process not completing in time. In such cases, authors should know that: 
 (1) The submitted paper can still continue under review as an IJDAR paper. 
 (2) The authors always have the option of preparing a shorter version of the paper to submit as a regular ICDAR conference paper. 
 Questions regarding the status of a paper that is under review for the IJDAR-ICDAR journal track should be directed toMs. Katherine Moretti @Springer.The guest editors have full authority to determine that the journal review process will not complete in time, and to decline submissions that arrive too late. In which case they will immediately notify the authors who can decide to leave the paper in the standard journal reviewing system or withdraw their manuscript from the journal. 
 Inquiries: 
 For additional information, please email one of the editors of this special issue or consult the FAQ that will be posted on the IJDAR website. 
 Submission Guidelines: 
 Authors should submit their papers via thehref="https://link.springer.com/collections/jbhcbfjhde" - ICDAR 2025 collection
on the IJDAR website. Please choose ICDAR 2025 from the collection dropdown on the “Details” page of the submission process. Submitted papers should present original, unpublished work, relevant to one of the topics of the Special Issue. All submitted papers will be evaluated on the basis of relevance, significance of contribution, technical quality, scholarship, and quality of presentation, by at least three independent reviewers. It is the policy of the journal that no submission, or substantially overlapping submission, be published or be under review at another journal or conference at any time during the review process. Manuscripts will be subject to a peer reviewing process and must conform to the author guide lines available on the IJDAR website at:href="https://link.springer.com/journal/10032/updates/27412600" - https://link.springer.com/journal/10032/updates/27412600
