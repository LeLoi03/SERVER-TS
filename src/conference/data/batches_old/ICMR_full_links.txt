 GOALS & MISSION 
 ACM ICMR is the premier scientific conference for multimedia retrieval worldwide. Its mission is to illuminate the state of the art in multimedia retrieval by bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field of multimedia retrieval. It is essential to ensure that the conference includes sessions for presenting high-quality research papers and for sharing practitioner experience. Sessions discussing the current state of the art, directions for the future, large-scale media evaluations, and demonstrations of current technology are encouraged. ICMR is intended to be international and in general will not be held on the same continent for two consecutive years in a row. 
 The main objectives of ICMR are the following: 
 To provide a setting for the presentation and discussion of high-quality original research papers in all aspects of multimedia retrieval. 
 To provide a forum for the exchange of ideas between researchers and practitioners in the field, ideally by maintaining a separate "industry" track. 
 To provide a range of complementary events such as panel sessions, exhibitions, workshops, and large-scale media evaluations. 
 To provide suitable facilities for informal networking and exchange of ideas between delegates.
