 Parallel, distributed, and federated machine learning have emerged as prevalent paradigms in contemporary AI technology. The fusion of rapidly evolving machine learning techniques with the extensive literature on parallel and distributed computing has inspired many vivid research topics, including algorithm complexity, architecture, and privacy. Given that machine learning algorithms frequently demand significant computational resources, it becomes imperative to employ proficient parallel and distributed machine learning algorithms to expedite the execution time. Large amount of data communicates through the network during the parallel execution of machine learning algorithms. Consequently, there exists a pressing need for an efficient distributed parallel architecture to reduce the communication time, and also urgent demand for the mechanism to ensure the data privacy. 
 Fundamental challenges persist in these topics and many other related ones in algorithms, complexity, and applicational technologies in parallel and distributed machine learning. The objective of this special issue is to publish and overview recent trends in these interdisciplinary areas. We organize the conference of the 25th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies (PDCAT 2024), which will be held in Hongkong, China during December 14-16, 2024 (href="https://hpcc.siat.ac.cn/meeting/pdcat2024/index.html" - https://hpcc.siat.ac.cn/meeting/pdcat2024/index.html
