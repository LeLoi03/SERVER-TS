 The conference will focus on both traditional and emerging trends in computer vision, pattern recognition, and image processing, addressing both theoretical and practical aspects. Special emphasis will be placed on the following topics: 
  
 Video Analysis and Understanding 
 Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning 
 Deep Learning 
 Multiview Geometry and 3D Computer Vision 
 Image Analysis, Detection, and Recognition 
 Multimedia 
 Biomedical and Assistive Technology

The conference will take place in Rome, Italy, from September 15-19, 2025. 
  
 The conference aims to serve as a stimulating discussion forum for researchers to meet, present their work, and exchange ideas, including oral and poster sessions, and offering invited keynote talks by distinguished speakers. The conference will also include satellite workshops and tutorials. 
 Submission Instructions 
 All submissions will be handled electronically via the conference’s CMT Websiteat the following link:

Authors candownloadthe template, togetherwith theinstructions, from the following link: 
 Template Download 
 In addition, authors who want to write their manuscripts on Overleaf, can use this template: 
 Overleaf Template 
 The maximum number of pages is12 including references. 
 Papers will be selected through adouble-blindreview process, taking into account originality, significance, clarity, soundness, relevance and technical contents. 
 Each submission will be managed by two Area Chairs and reviewed by at least three reviewers. 
 Accepted papers will be included in the ICIAP 2025 Conference Proceedings, which will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (LNCS). 
 Additional Author Guidelines 
 They are inherited from other conferences such a CVPR and ICCV. 
 Double blind review:ICIAP25 reviewing isdouble blind, in that authors do not know the names of the area chairs or reviewers for their papers, and the area chairs/reviewers cannot, beyond a reasonable doubt, infer the names of the authors from the submission and the additional material.Do not provide information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments(e.g., co-workers and grant IDs) or in any other part of the paper. Please, use the provide template above properly anonymized. Alsodo not provide links to websites that identify the authors even github repository etc. Violation of any of these guidelines may lead to rejection without review. 
 Dual submissions:The goals of ICIAP25 are to publish excitingnew workfor the first time and to avoid duplicating the effort of reviewers. By registering or submitting a manuscript to ICIAP25, the authors acknowledge that it has not been previously published or accepted for publication in substantially similar form in any peer-reviewed venue including journal, conference or workshop, or archival forum. Furthermore, no publication substantially similar in content (defined as having 20 percent or more overlap) has been or will be registered or submitted to this or another conference, workshop, or journal during the review period. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection, and will be reported to the other venue to which the submission was sent. 
 A publication, for the purposes of this policy, is defined to be a written work longer than four pages (excluding references) that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, was accepted. In particular, this definition of publication does not depend upon whether such an accepted written work appears in a formal proceedings or whether the organizers declare that such work “counts as a publication.” 
 arXiv preprints: Under the above definition, arXiv preprints and university technical reports arenotconsidered as publications. However, peer-reviewed workshop papers are considered as publications if their length is more than four pages (excluding references), even if they do not appear in a proceedings. 
 Note that a technical report (departmental, arXiv, etc.) version of the submission that is put up without any form of direct peer-review is NOT considered prior art and does NOT NEED to be cited in the submission; authors may cite such material, but cannot be penalized for not citing it. 
 Please note:Authors of accepted papers must register before submitting the final camera-ready version and include the abstract code in the registration form. Each accepted paper must be covered by at least one full (regular or member) registration. For authors with more than one accepted paper, the papers exceeding the first can be covered by the "additional paper" fee at 150.00€ each
