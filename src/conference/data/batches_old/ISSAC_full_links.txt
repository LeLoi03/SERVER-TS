 Conference topics 
 All areas of computer algebra and symbolic computation are of interest at ISSAC 2025. These include, but are not limited to: 
 Algorithmic aspects: 
 Exact and symbolic linear, polynomial and differential algebra 
 Symbolic-numeric, homotopy, perturbation and series methods 
 Computational algebraic geometry, polynomial and semialgebraic optimization 
 Computational group theory and number theory, quantifier elimination and logic 
 Computer arithmetic 
 Summation, recurrence equations, integration, solution of ODEs & PDEs 
 Symbolic methods in other areas of pure and applied mathematics 
 Complexity of algebraic algorithms and algebraic complexity 
 Software aspects: 
 Design of symbolic computation packages and systems 
 Language design and type systems for symbolic computation 
 Data representation 
 Considerations for modern hardware 
 Algorithm implementation and performance tuning 
 Mathematical user interfaces 
 Use with systems such as digital libraries, courseware, simulation and optimization, automated theorem-proving, computer-aided design, and automatic differentiation. 
 Application aspects: 
 Applications that stretch the current limits of computer algebra algorithms or systems, use computer algebra in new areas or new ways, or apply it in situations with broad impact.
