 SEquences and Their Applications (SETA) 2024 
 July 01-05, 2024, Colchester, United KingdomCall for Papers 
 Sequences play important roles in numerous critical domains, encompassing areas such as spread spectrum communication systems, global positioning systems, ranging systems, circuit testing, software testing, channel estimation, cryptographic schemes, and beyond. 
 SEquences and Their Applications (SETA) is an internationally leading conference, aiming to foster fruitful interactions among sequences, signals, and waveforms designers, mathematicians, coding theorists cryptographic researchers, and communications practitioners from all over the world. This esteemed conference has been hosted in a variety of international locales:href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4471-0551-0" - SETA-1998
