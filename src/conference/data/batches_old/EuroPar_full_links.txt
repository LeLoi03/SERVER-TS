 Dresden - Art and Culture, Elbe Valley and Scientific Hub 
 Dresden is the capital of the Free State of Saxony and the easternmost city in Germany. Dresden is internationally renowned as a city of art and culture, with numerous important buildings, more than 50 museums and at least 30 theaters. The Saxon State Orchestra, based in the Semperoper, is one of the best classical orchestras in the world. Several major musical events are important highlights in the European music calendar every year. Dresden has a long history as the capital and royal residence for the Electors and Kings of Saxony. 
 Dresden is also famous for its unique scenic location in the Elbe Valley. The Elbe riverside meadows characterize the city, as for example the foothills of the Eastern Ore Mountains visible on the horizon and the proximity of Saxon Switzerland. 
 The scientific landscape of Dresden is diverse and varied. There are over 40 research institutions in the city, and all four major German research organizations have facilities here. 
 TUD Dresden University of Technology is one of the largest Universities of Technology in Germany and is among the leading and most dynamic universities in the country. Since 2012, TUD has been one of the eleven German Universities of Excellence.

 The Conference Series 
 Euro-Par is an annual series of international conferences dedicated to the promotion and advancement of all aspects of parallel and distributed computing. 
 Euro-Par covers a wide spectrum of topics from algorithms and theory to software technology and hardware-related issues, with application areas ranging from scientific to mobile and cloud computing. 
 Euro-Par provides a forum for the introduction, presentation and discussion of the latest scientific and technical advances, extending the frontier of both the state of the art and the state of the practice. 
 The main audience of Euro-Par are the researchers in academic institutions, government laboratories and industrial organisations. Euro-Par's objective is to be the primary choice of such professionals for the presentation of new results in their specific areas. As a wide-spectrum conference, Euro-Par fosters the synergy of different topics in parallel and distributed computing. Of special interest are applications which demonstrate the effectiveness of the main Euro-Par topics. 
 In addition, Euro-Par conferences provide a platform for a number of accompanying, technical workshops. Thus, smaller and emerging communities can meet and develop more focussed topics or as yet less established topics. The unique organizational structure of a Euro-Par conference, which puts the hosting team in charge of both the scientific programme and the local organization, makes it a particularly lively and stimulating experience. 
 The next Euro-Par conference will behref="https://2025.euro-par.org/" - Euro-Par 2025
in Dresden, Germany.

 29.08.2024: | Franck Cappello | is the recipient of the Euro-Par Achievement Award 2024. Franck Cappello is a Senior Computer Scientist at the Argonne National Labs. He was the initiator and director the French National Project Grid 5000. In conjunction with Marc Snir he created the Joint Laboratory on Extreme Scale Computing (JLESC), gathering seven of the most prominent international research and production centers in supercomputing, namely, NCSA, Inria, ANL, BSC, JSC, Riken CCS and UTK. Since 2016, Cappello has been the director of two exascale computing projects related to resilience and lossy compression of scientific data. Throughout his 25-year research career, he has directed the development of several high-impact software tools. Cappello appears 19 times in the proceedings of Euro-Par, three of them in workshops. He was the local chair of topic “Peer-to-Peer Computing” in 2003.

 01.11.2022: | The | href="https://series.euro-par.org/about-euro-par/call-for-bids" - call for bids to host Euro-Par 2025 | is open. Deadline for statements of intent: 31.01.2023. 
 25.08.2022:Ewa Deelman | is the recipient of the Euro-Par Achievement Award 2022. She has pioneered the systematic design and optimization of scientific workflows in HPC and distributed computing environments to enable scientists to handle efficiently massive amounts of data using large-scale infrastructures. She established and has led since 2000 the Pegasus workflow management project, whose biggest success was its use by the LIGO consortium for the detection of gravitational waves (2017 Nobel Prize). Pegasus has been used by computational scientists across different domains (e.g., astronomy, earth science, bioinformatics, climate science, etc). Through Pegasus, Deelman’s own research has shaped the field in relation to managing scientific workflows on HPC and large-scale infrastructures. Deelman has participated in a number of Euro-Par workshops and delivered two Euro-Par keynotes (2012 and 2020). 
 20.08.2022: | The Proceedings of Euro-Par 2022 are available as | Springer LNCS 13440 
 01.07.2022: | The Proceedings of Euro-Par Workshops 2021 are available as | Springer LNCS 13098
