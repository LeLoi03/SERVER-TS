 Biography 
 I am an Associate Professor at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) where I am heading the Coding and Cryptography (COD) group. I am a recipient of an ERC Starting Grant and the DFG Heinz Maier-Leibnitz-Preis. 
 From 2016 to 2020, I was a Rudolf Mößbauer Tenure Track Assistant Professor at TUM and a Fellow at the TUM Institute for Advanced Study (TUM IAS). 
 From 2013 to 2016, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Computer Science Department of the Technion---Israel Institute of Technology in the group of Tuvi Etzion, Ronny Roth, and Eitan Yaakobi. 
 From 2009 to 2013, I was a PhD student and teaching assistant under the co-supervision of Martin Bossert at the Institute of Communications Engineering, Ulm University, Germany, and Pierre Loidreau at the Institut de Recherche Mathématique de Rennes (IRMAR), Université de Rennes 1, Rennes, France. 
 My main research interests are coding theory, post-quantum cryptography (code- and lattice-based), efficient algorithms, security, privacy, machine learning, and applying error-correcting codes to communications, security, and storage in general, in particular to coded computing, DNA storage, network coding, non-volatile memories, distributed data storage, machine learning, and physical unclonable functions.

 Research Topics 
 Post-Quantum Cryptography 
 The recent developments of a quantum supercomputers has motivated research on post-quantum cryptography. Assuming an attack of a sufficiently large quantum computer, several classical public-key algorithms as RSA and elliptic curve cryptography become insecure since computationally intensive mathematical problems become easy-to-solve. It is therefore necessary to design techniques which are secure against an attack of a quantum computer. One approach to achieve this security is code-based cryptography, where encryption and decryption is based on encoding and decoding an algebraic code; another one is based on hard problems in lattices. We investigate and improve post-quantum cryptographic schemes.

 Coding for Insertions/Deletions and DNA Storage 
 The Levenshtein distance, also known as the edit distance, is a measure of similarity between two strings evaluated based on the minimum number of insertion/deletion operations required to transform one string into the other. Codes for correcting insertions and deletions were first proposed for communication applications in the presence of synchronization or sampling errors. However, insertions, deletions, and duplications have particular importance also for numerous applications in bioinformatics such as DNA storage. DNA storage is recently attracting attention as a dense and robust concept for archival storage. The data is written on DNA strands by synthesis and read by DNA sequencing. DNA storage has to cope with sequence losses, loss of ordering of the sequences, and symbol errors such as insertions, deletions and subtitutions.

 Coding for Storage 
 Data storage media like flash memories (used in USB flash drives or solid state drives) suffer from manufacturing imperfections, wearout, and fluctuating read/write errors. In distributed data storage (necessary for cloud storage systems), the most common problem are failures of servers and the task is to reconstruct the lost data efficiently. It is therefore necessary to design coding solutions tailored to these storage applications.

 Network Coding and Rank-Metric Codes 
 The principle of network coding has been attracting growing attention in the recent years as a technique to disseminate information in data networks. The reason for this interest is that network coding achieves higher throughput than routing. In routing, the packets are simply forwarded at each node of the network, whereas in network coding, the nodes perform linear combinations of all packets received so far. Fundamental questions in the area of network coding include assigning appropriate linear combinations to the nodes and choosing a suitable error-correcting code for the case when erroneous packets occur or packets are lost. Rank-metric codes are thereby of relevance, not only for network coding but also for space time codes and code-based cryptography.

 List Decoding 
 List decoding is a major technique for increasing the error correcting capability of codes. The basic idea of list decoding is to return not only a unique decoding result (which is only possible up to half the minimum distance of the corresponding code), but to return all codewords in a certain radius around the received word. This enables us to decode more errors at the cost of a usually small list. Practically, list decoding is used in concatenated coding schemes. Apart from explicit list decoding algorithms, a fundamental question is whether list decoding in a certain metric up to a certain radius can be done in polynomial time.

 Private Information Retrieval 
 Private information retrieval (PIR) studies the problem when a user wants to retrieve a file from a storage system without revealing the identity of the file in question to the storage servers. Private information retrieval (PIR) studies the problem when a user wants to retrieve a file from a storage system without revealing the identity of the file in question to the storage servers. The files that are stored on the servers might be coded (e.g., to prevent server failures) and some servers might be communicating with each other. We investigate PIR schemes that guarantee either information-theoretic privacy or computational privacy.

 Fast Algorithms

 Physical Unclonable Functions 
 A Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is a digital circuit that possesses an intrinsic randomness resulting from process variations. This randomness is exploited to generate random keys for cryptographic applications which can be reproduced on demand. Thus, no embedded physically secure non-volatile memory is needed. However, the regeneration of a key is not perfect due to environmental factors such as temperature variations and aging effects of the digital circuit. These variations can be seen as an erroneous channel and therefore error-correcting codes increase the reliability of key regenerations.

·O. Kabbouch, E. Mouloua, M. Najmeddine, N. Aydin, L. Tran, T Nguyen,On the algebraic structure of (Sigma, a)-polycyclic codes, accepted for publication in J. Applied Mathematics and Computing. 2025, 
 Undergraduate ResearchThere are many problems and projects in Algebraic Coding Theory that are accessible to undergraduates. In general, we combine algebraic theory with programming skills to search for new codes, codes with better parameters than currently best known codes. This is one of the main problems of coding theory. One of the interesting feature of the problem is that it can be approached from many different perspectives using a variety of tools, some very sophisticated (e.g. advanced algebraic geometry), some rather elementary (e.g. elementary but insightful search algorithms). If you are interested in doing research in this area I encourage you to contact me. Projects are available for beginners and experts. Below is a list of undergradute projects, papers and presentations produced by Kenyon students. Minimal background needed to get started is a course on Linear Algebra and some programming experience. Additionally, courses on Abstract Algebra, Combinatorics, and advanced programming (e.g. Data Structures) are highly recommended.In addition to our active undergraduate research program with Kenyon students, I also mentor highly motivated and exceptionally strong international high school students for research in coding theory and cryptography offered byPioneer Academics. This unique program connects talented high school students from all around the world with resources to conduct research. We have also published papers with Pioneer scholars such asthis.Research Projects with Kenyon Students
