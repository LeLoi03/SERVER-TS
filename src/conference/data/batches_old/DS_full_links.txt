 The Data Science for Health Discovery and Innovation in Africa (DS-I Africa) Initiative aims to leverage data science technologies to transform biomedical and public health research and develop solutions that would lead to improved health for individuals and populations. 
 To accomplish this, the DS-I Africa Initiative aims to contribute to the development of the necessary expertise among African scientists, and to establish networks of African investigators. 
 The vision of DS-I Africa is to create and support a robust pan-continental network of data scientists and technologies that will be equipped to apply advanced data science skills to transform health.

 Training & Education Working Group 
 Training is an essential component of all DS-I Africa projects to build data science capacity in Africa. The Training and Education Working Group therefore aims to coordinate and harmonize training efforts, identify gaps, optimize the use of available resources, and increase training opportunities. 
 READ MOREData Management Working Group 
 Technical expertise required to translate data into solutions to improve health care is indispensable in this era of data science enabled by exponential growth of diverse data available for biomedical research. The DS-I Africa Data Management Working Group focuses on the more technical aspects of data use and analysis. We discuss data management plans, data models, data storage, data standards, data harmonization, analysis tools, compute infrastructure for data analysis and the interoperability of data and machines.

DS-I Africa Steering Committee 
 The Steering Committee (SC) provides strategic leadership to achieve the overarching program goals. The SC will develop and adopt various governance policies and guidelines that facilitate collaboration promote sharing and accessibility of resources and new discoveries. Continuous assessments allow for readjustments of ongoing activities. 
 Membership 
 Principal investigators, project and data managers from each grant and NIH program staff constitute the Steering Committee membership. Participants are bound by policies and procedures developed by the Steering Committee. 
 Adoption of such policies and procedures requires a majority vote each funded project has one vote. The Steering Committee chair and co chair are elected by majority vote, and together with the Coordinating Centre prepares meeting agendas and fulfills all related administrative and management tasks.

 LLNL is issuing a call for proposals for experiments in the Discovery Science (DS) program on the NIF starting nominally in FY2026 and extending into FY2027. We expect to allocate 14 days of facility time for DS experiments beginning in FY2026; this is necessary to accommodate disruptions to planned campaigns. As in previous years, if the FY25 or FY26 enacted budgets contain a significant cut to LLNL’s ICF Program, the time awarded to Discovery Science under this call may be reduced. 
 The application process is as follows: 
 Applicants shall enter a title and upload a Letter of Intent (LOI) via the | NIF User Portal | (link is external) | by | June 26, 2024. | The template for the LOI is available for download from the NIF User Portal. The LOI should be no more than three pages in length, including references and figures. The LOI should emphasize what capabilities are required from the facility to support the experiments, and should provide enough detail of the proposed investigations to allow the NIF User Office and the DS Program Leader to provide meaningful feedback. Applicants are free to submit as many proposals as they wish. A separate LOI must be submitted for each proposed campaign. 
 After NIF User Office and DS Program Leader feedback on the LOI is provided, applicants so invited may submit the full written proposal via the | NIF User Portal | (link is external) | by | September 18, 2024 | . Based on a review of the full proposal by the DS Technical Review Committee (TRC), the NIF Director will invite submitters of the top proposals to prepare an oral presentation in support of their proposal, which will be presented in the late-October time frame, via remote access. Decisions on the proposals are expected to be communicated before the end of December. Format and other relevant details for the oral presentation will be provided at the time invitations are made. 
 Facility access is allocated in units of time (typically “shot days”). The number of shots that can be accomplished per day is a function of experimental complexity. Awards will be made commensurate with the science needs of the proposal. Awards to date have been for one to three days per campaign. All researchers are welcome to apply, including those who have been awarded time in previous solicitations. The NIF DS TRC will use its discretion in evaluating new proposals from teams that have previously been awarded time but have not yet taken shots or produced and published data. Teams that have previously been awarded time and have taken shots will need to provide a description of what has been learned, the status of the analysis, and a list of any publications from previous NIF DS shots that have appeared or have been submitted for publication. 
 A resource for potential applicants is the NIF User Guide, which is available online at thislink.Any questions regarding this process or details regarding the NIF facility should be directed to NIF User Office staff. We are providing a single point of contact for facility questions;only responses from the NIF User Office Director, Kevin Fournier, should be taken as the facility guidance on capabilities. 
 Proposal subject areas: 
 Researchers may apply for NIF facility time to execute experiments in any area of science accessible on the NIF. Proposals will be judged on their scientific merit and technical achievability. Science relevant to fusion ignition will be considered but will be judged solely on the basis of its quality as fundamental science. In particular, the results of the experiment must be of significant interest in other fields, consistent with guidelines for publication in a highly ranked journal. Examples of previously awarded successful proposals are available for prioryears through 2023. 
 All researchers involved in NIF experiments will be required to follow LLNL policies and procedures regarding site access, computer use, and related topics. The PI for each research team that is awarded facility time through this call is encouraged to present their proposed research program at the NIF User Group Meeting that will take place in February 2024. (An award of shot time does not come with funding to support the PI’s travel to the NIF User Group Meeting.) 
 The facility welcomes proposals that use existing platforms, diagnostics, target fabrication and other capabilities. We also welcome proposals to develop new platforms that will use existing diagnostic capabilities in new ways or develop new capabilities. It is no longer necessary to choose one of these categories when creating a record in the NIF User Portal. 
 Research groups that have a novel idea that they think will make a good proposal in the future are invited to contact theNIF User Officeto request guidance on developing their ideas into concepts that can be pursued at the NIF or proposed in subsequent calls for DS proposals. 
 Eligible applicants: 
 Principal Investigators, Experimental Leads, and team members may be associated with a national laboratory, academic institution, or the private sector, and may be from the United States (US) or outside the US. Each LOI will undergo both technical review as well as a national security review consistent with LLNL and NNSA policies. Invitations to submit full proposals following the LOI review will reflect the outcome of that review. (Proposals submitted in response to this call will undergo both technical and national security reviews as well.) 
 How to apply:Applicants will upload a completed LOI template via theNIF User Portal(link is external)byJune 26, 2024. Full proposals must be completed and submitted electronically bySeptember 18, 2024. Proposal instructions can be found on thehref="https://lasers.llnl.gov/for-users/call-for-proposals" - Call for Proposal Website.
Further information regarding the LOI submission is available by contacting the NIF User Office: (925) 422-2179,nifuseroffice@llnl.gov.
