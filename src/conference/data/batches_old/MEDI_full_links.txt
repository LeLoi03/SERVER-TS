 Present CFP : 2023 
 Overview 
 ------------------------ 
 The Eleventh International Conference on Model & Data Engineering (MEDI) will be held from 2 to 4 November 2023 in Sousse, Tunisia. Its main objective is to provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and to promote the interaction and collaboration between the models and data research communities. MEDI 2023 provides an international platform for the presentation of research on models and data theory, development of advanced technologies related to models and data and their advanced applications. This international scientific event, initiated by researchers from Euro-Mediterranean countries, aims also at promoting the creation of north-south scientific networks, projects and faculty/student exchanges.

 ------------------------------ 
 Important Dates 
 ------------------------------ 
 Full-paper submission: July 22, 2023 
 Acceptance notification: September 8, 2023 
 Early bird registration: September 18, 2023 
 Camera-ready: September 18, 2023 
  
 ------------------------------ 
 Submission Guidelines 
 ------------------------------ 
 Authors are invited to submit English-language research and application papers representing original, previously unpublished work. Duplicate submissions are not allowed. Papers must be submitted as a single PDF document, via the Easychair system (https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=medi2023). 
  
 Submissions must conform to Springer's LNCS style (Latex style only for camera-ready papers) and should not exceed 14 pages. Submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. 
  
 The program committee may decide to accept a submission as a short paper if it reports interesting results but does not justify a publication as a full paper. 
  
 As for the previous edition of MEDI, all accepted papers including short papers will be published in Springer LNCS series. The book metrics available on SpringerLink to previous MEDI proceedings, https://link.springer.com/conference/medi give details on the number of citations, downloads, and readers at paper level and at book level. 
  
 One author of an accepted paper must register to MEDI 2023 in order to have the paper published. Each accepted paper must be presented at the conference by one of the authors.

Dear EMBS friends and colleagues, 
 The IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society is pleased to announce the 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society, to be held in Bella Center, Copenhagen, Denmark, July 14-17, 2025. 
 The overarching conference theme, “Engineering Medicine, Innovating Healthcare”, underscores the pivotal role of interdisciplinary collaboration and new ways of working in driving transformative advancements in healthcare delivery and patient outcomes. Under this theme, we aim to drive the dynamic convergence of clinical practice, technology, and Artificial Intelligence with a focus on innovation, 
 entrepreneurship, and translation. 
 We will have a strong industry presence at the conference and explore entrepreneurial and translational aspects of biomedical engineering. 
 We will have a strong representation of women in engineering, recognizing their diverse and dynamic role in advancing innovation and positive transformations within the healthcare sector. We want to make the EMBC 2025 attractive for students and junior scientists by facilitating networking, science talks and career path discussions. 
 The conference will be the place to present your excellent research 
 and the scientific topics will span a wide spectrum, including but not limited to, medical imaging and diagnostics, wearables and ubiquitous computing, telemedicine, precision medicine, predictive analytics, robotic surgery and rehabilitation, and assistive technologies. By bringing together researchers, engineers, clinicians, and industry leaders, our conference will facilitate the exchange of ideas, insights, and best practices. 
 Attendees will have the opportunity to engage in interactive sessions, workshops, and demonstrations showcasing the latest breakthroughs in healthcare technology and AI applications. Together, we will delve into the possibilities of leveraging AI and cutting-edge technologies to address healthcare challenges, improve patient care, and enhance population health outcomes. Join us as we embark on a journey to revolutionize healthcare through innovation, AI, and technology integration. 
 We look forward to seeing you in Copenhagen in July 2025!
