Modeling and Optimization: Theory and Applications (MOPTA)aims at bringing together a diverse group of people from both discrete and continuous optimization, working on both theoretical and applied aspects. There will be a small number of invited talks from distinguished speakers and contributed talks, spread over three days. Our target is to present a diverse set of exciting new developments from different optimization areas while at the same time providing a setting which will allow increased interaction among the participants. We aim to bring together researchers from both the theoretical and applied communities who do not usually have the chance to interact in the framework of a medium-scale event. 

MOPTA 2025 Announcement 
 The Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) at Lehigh University invites you to contribute and participate in thehref="https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/mopta2025/" - Modeling and Optimization: Theory and Applications (MOPTA) 2025
Conference, which will take place inPonta Delgada, Azores, PortugalfromJune 17-20, 2025, and in theAIMMS/MOPTA Competition. 
 We are celebrating the70th Birthday of Professor Tamás Terlaky. MOPTA is the Lehigh ISE flagship conference, founded by Prof. Terlaky, 25 years ago. There will be aTamas-70 Session and Dinnerfrom June 18, 2025, to celebrate the impactful and long lasting contributions of Tamás to the fields and communities of optimization, operations research, and industrial engineering. 
 We will be also celebratingLehigh ISE 100 Anniversary. 
 MOPTA 2025 will take place in the historic center of Ponta Delgada, on the beautiful Azorean island of São Miguel.Attendees will have sufficient time to visit São Miguelwhile participating in technical sessions and engaging in discussions on the latest developments in optimization and its applications. 
 There will be a satellite event, thePortuguese American Optimization Workshop (PAOW), which will take place inHorta, Azores, PortugalfromJune 13-15, 2025. PAOW will take place in the historic center of Horta, on the beautiful Azorean island of Faial. PAOW is primarily focused on continuous optimization and its applications to machine learning.

 Bio 
 Tommaso Giovannelli is an Assistant Professor in the Industrial and Systems Engineering program within the Department of Mechanical and Materials Engineering at the University of Cincinnati. Previously, he was a postdoctoral researcher and an adjunct faculty member in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) at Lehigh University. He received his Ph.D. in Operations Research in May 2021 from SAPIENZA University of Rome, where he obtained his B.S. and M.S. in Engineering Management in 2015 and 2017, respectively. From January 2020 to May 2021, he was a visiting scholar at Lehigh ISE. In July 2019, he won a doctoral award at the Doctoral Consortium ORAHS 2019 (EURO Working Group within IFORS) in Karlsruhe, Germany, for his research in simulation-based optimization applied to emergency department management. His research interests span several sub-fields of nonlinear optimization, including stochastic bilevel and multi-objective optimization and simulation-based and derivative-free optimization. His main application areas include machine learning, transportation systems, and healthcare management, all motivated by important problems for social good. Tommaso has been actively contributing to the academic community by serving on the local organizing committee for ICCOPT 2022, chairing the organizing committees for the MOPTA 2023 and 2024 conferences, serving as a guest editor for the MOPTA 2024 Special Issue in Optimization and Engineering, and co-chairing the organizing committees for the MOPTA 2025 conference and PAOW workshop.
