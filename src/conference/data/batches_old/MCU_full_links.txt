 MCU 2024 
 10th conference on Machines, Computations and Universality 
 5-7 June 2024 in Nice, France 
 The Internationalconference series MCUtraces its roots back to themid 1990's, and has always been concerned with gaining a deeper understanding ofcomputation and universalitythrough the study ofmodels of general purpose computation.Last edition took place in Debrecen, Hungary (2022). The before last edition was canceled because of COVID-19 pandemic (2020). 
 Aims and scope 
 Thescope of the conferencetopicsincludes, but is not limited to, computation in the setting ofvarious discrete models(Turing machines, register machines, cellular automata, tile assembly systems, rewriting systems, molecular computing models, neural models...),analog and hybrid models(BSS machines, infinite time cellular automata, real machines, quantum computing...) and themeaning and implantation of universalityin these contexts. Particular emphasis is given towards search forfrontiers between decidability and undecidabilityin the various models, search for thesimplest universal models, computationalcomplexity of predicting the evolutionof computations in the various models.Parallel computingmodels and their connections todecidability, complexity and universality. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 - Analog computation 
 - Automata theory 
 - Cellular automata 
 - Classical computability and degree structures 
 - Computability theoretic aspects of programs

 - Proof theory and computability 
 - Randomness and Kolmogorov complexity 
 - Relativistic computation 
 - Swarm intelligence and self-organisation 
 - Theory of Petri nets 
 - Turing, Counter, Register, Signal machines 
 - Universality of systems 
 Anti-harassment policy 
 We believe that the advancement of research is best accomplished in an environment that is open, diverse and respectful to all participants. During the conference, we will follow theanti-harassment policy of ACM. Anyone witnessing or subject to unacceptable behaviour should notify the conference chairs.
