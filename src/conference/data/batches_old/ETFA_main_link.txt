 Manuscript Submission 
 Initial Author Instructions - Full Paper Preparation, Technical Tracks, Special Session and Workshop Papers 
 Authors are invited to submit full regular papers (6-8 pages) of their work, reporting original research using the online submission system. The working language of the conference is English. Regular papers are typically 6-8 pages long, and are anyway limited to maximum eight (8) pages. Submissions of papers shorter than 5 pages may be automatically rejected. 
 The author must submit the draft version of the paper for review before the due submission deadline (href="https://etfa2025.ieee-ies.org/for_authors/index.html#important-dates" - Important Dates
). Authors of accepted papers must submit the final paper version according to the deadline, register for the conference, and attend to present their paper(s). The maximum length for final papers is 8 pages without exceptions. 
 IEEE is strict about the requirements for PDF files for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. We strongly recommend to use the set oftemplates in MS Word and LaTeXprovided by IEEE. Please use them to create your paper, without modifying the style or format under any circumstances. A4 page size is preferred, and letter size can also be used. To learn more about formatting of papers for IEEE IES conferences, please visit thispage. We will be checking pdf compliance internally through our software. 
 Use of the IEEE PDF eXpress service will only be required and made available for the final version of accepted papers. This service allows you to transform your document from text editor to pdf format as well as checking the conformance of any pdf file to IEEE formatting rules. The number of attempts provided to each author is limited in number so reserve its use for the final version of your paper. When using this service the conference ID will need to be specified - the ETFA 2025 conference ID will be made public once the submission of final papers opens. 
 Please ensure that you submit only original work that has not been previously published or copyrighted. As a prospective author, you are expected to submit only your own original work. The Conference will be using the CrossCheck automated screening system to verify the originality of papers. Submitted works may be compared to over 20 million articles in databases worldwide. Papers that violate IEEE's publication principles may be summarily rejected. If the violation is deemed severe, disciplinary actions may also be taken by IEEE. 
 Initial Author Instructions - Work-In-Progress Papers, Technical Tracks and Special Session Papers 
 The submissions in the Work in Progress papers category describe research that have not yet produced the results required for a regular paper, but that due to its novelty and potential impact deserves to be shared with the community at an early stage. These submissions need to follow the guidelines for the regular and special session but limited to four (4) pages (total length including references). 
 WiP contributors are expected to give a short presentation of their work and to prepare a poster for the discussion forum that will take place after the presentations. More specifically, each WiP paper shall be presented by one of the authors in a very short oral presentation of 3 minutes, without any ensuing discussion, in its respective session. 
 Accepted and presented papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings and in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. 
 Submission System Instructions 
 In the case you are using the new IES submission system for the first time, you will need to register at the ConfCommLogin page. After registering wait for the confirmation email and verify your email address. If you don't get the confirmation email or have some problem with your submission, please contact us. 
 In case you already have an account with the IEC submission system you canhref="https://confcomm.ieee-ies.org/app/general/conferences/ETFA25/initial-submission" - submit a paper to ETFA2025 here
. 
 When submitting papers in the submission system, please select the correct track:TT01 ... TT11 – technical tracks (regular papers). 
 SS01 … SS12 – special sessions (regular papers) 
 WS01, WS02, WS03 – workshops based on solicited papers (regular papers) 
 WIP TT01 … WIP TT11 – technical tracks (work-in-progress papers) 
 WIP SS01 … WIP SS12 – special sessions (work-in-progress papers) 
 Papers are solicited for regular Technical Tracks and Special Session tracks both as Regular papers and Work in progress (WIP) papers. Workshops based on solicited papers are instead accepting only regular papers (no WiP submissions will be accepted).
