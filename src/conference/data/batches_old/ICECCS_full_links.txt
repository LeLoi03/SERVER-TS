Welcome to ICECCS 2025 
 Driven by advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence, distributed systems, autonomous intelligent systems, and cyber-physical systems, complex computer systems increasingly shape every aspect of human life, from manufacturing and communications to healthcare, defense, transportation, and energy, the demand for advanced methodologies and tools is growing. These systems are often distributed across heterogeneous networks, leveraging vast amounts of data alongside emerging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques. Recent trends, including the rise of large language models (LLMs) and embodied intelligence, have introduced additional challenges and opportunities in the engineering of such systems. The complexity of modern systems arises from dynamic operating environments, diverse functional requirements, and conflicting needs such as performance, scalability, security, dependability, and adaptability. These challenges are compounded by factors like real-time behavior, fault tolerance, robustness, and long-term sustainability, making the engineering of these systems a multidisciplinary effort. 
 The 29th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS 2025) is a well-established event that has been held around the world for over 29 years. It aims to bring together experts from industry, academia, and government to exchange ideas on the engineering of intricate systems. We encourage contributions that tackle both theoretical and practical challenges, from long-term research agendas to near-term industry needs. 
 ICECCS is recognized as a CCF-C conference by the China Computer Federation (CCF) and holds a B ranking in the 2023 rankings of the Computing Research and Education Association of Australasia (CORE).

The ultimate goal is to build a rich and comprehensive conference program that can fit the interests and needs of different classes of attendees: professionals, researchers, managers, and students. A program goal is to organize several sessions that include both academic and industrial papers on a given topic and culminate panels to discuss relationships between industrial and academic research. 
  
 Submission and Publication 
 ICECCS 2025 accepts both full papers and short papers. 
 Full papers are divided into two categories: Technical Papers and Experience Reports. The papers submitted to both categories will be reviewed by the program committee members, and papers accepted in either category will be published in the conference proceedings. Technical papers should describe original research, and experience reports should present practical projects carried out in the industry, and reflect on the lessons learnt from them. 
 Short paper submissions describe early-stage, ongoing or PhD research. All short papers will be reviewed by the program committee members, and accepted short papers will be published in the conference proceedings. 
 Submissions to the conference must not have been published or be concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference. 
 Proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Submitted manuscripts should be in English and formatted in the style of LNCS format. Full papers should not exceed 20 pages (including bibliography, etc.), and short papers should not exceed 11 pages (including bibliography, etc.). All submissions should be in PDF format. Submissions not adhering to the specified format and length may be rejected immediately without review. Please prepare your manuscripts in accordance with the Springer LNCS guidelines:https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelinesWe invite all prospective authors to submit their manuscripts via the ICECCS 2025 portal, hosted by the EasyChair conference management system:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iceccs2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iceccs2025

WELCOME 
 Recent years have witnessed a rapidly rising emphasis on the design, implementation and management of complex computer systems which are present in every aspect of human activities, such as manufacturing, communications, defence, transportation, aerospace, hazardous environments, energy, and healthcare. These complex systems are frequently distributed over heterogeneous networks and process a large amount of data, leveraging emerging artificial intelligence (AI), large language models, and machine learning techniques. Complexity arises from many factors, including the dynamic environment and the scenarios these systems operate in, demanding and sometimes conflicting requirements in functionality, efficiency, scalability, security, dependability and adaptability, data heterogeneity, as well as the wide range of development methodologies, programming languages and implementation details. Performance, real-time behaviour, fault tolerance, robustness, security, adaptability, development time and cost, and long life concerns are some of the key issues arising in the development of such systems. 
 The International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems (ICECCS) is a well-established event that has been held around the world for over 25 years. The goal of this conference is to bring together industrial, academic, and government experts from a variety of application domains and software disciplines, to discuss how the disciplines’ problems and solution techniques interact within the whole system. Researchers, practitioners, tool developers and users, and technology transfer experts are all welcome. The scope of the conference includes long-term research issues, near-term requirements and challenges, established complex systems, emerging promising tools, and retrospective and prospective reflections of research and development into complex systems
