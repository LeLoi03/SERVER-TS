 About QRS 
 This year is the 25th anniversary of the QRS Conference.The first edition of the conference was held in Hong Kong, China in 2000 under the name of Asia-Pacific Conference on Quality Software. Since then, the conference has grown significantly. In 2015, the SERE conference (IEEE International Conference on Software Security and Reliability) and the QSIC conference (IEEE International Conference on Quality Software) were combined into a single conference, QRS, withQrepresentingQuality,RforReliability, andSforSecurity. This conference gives engineers and scientists from both industry and academia a platform to present their ongoing work, relate their research outcomes and experiences, and discuss the best and most efficient techniques for the development of reliable, secure, and trustworthy systems. It also represents an excellent opportunity for the academic community to become more aware of subject areas critical to the software industry as practitioners bring their needs to the table. The 25th QRS conference will go back to the country where the first conference was organized. It will be in Hangzhou, China from July 16-20, 2025.
