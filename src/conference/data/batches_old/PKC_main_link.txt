 Call for Papers 
 General information 
 PKC 2025 will take place in Røros, Norway on May 12-15, 2025. PKC 2025 is organized byhref="https://iacr.org/" - the International Association for
            Cryptologic Research
(IACR). The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series. 
 Original research papers on all aspects of public-key cryptography, covering theory, implementations and applications, and related fields, are solicited for submission to PKC 2025, the The International Conference on Practice and Theory in Public Key Cryptography. In more detail, areas of interest include research on: 
 public key schemes, such as their design and analysis (including side channel attacks), from its math to actual systems 
 the design, proposal, and analysis of cryptographic primitives and protocols 
 public-key techniques in MPC or other protocols 
 Please note that pure information-theoretic and symmetric-key subjects, e.g. block cipher design and attacks, are not in scope. This year, we particularly welcome submissions on the theme of “Real-world public-key cryptography.” These submissions must still meet the acceptance criteria for PKC above. 
 Program committee members are permitted to submit either 3 co-authored papers, or at most 4 co-authored papers all with students. 
 How to submit 
 Author instructions for paper submission may be found on the submission page.

 Schedule 
 PKC 2025 will operate a two-round review system with rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee selects the submissions which are considered of value for proceeding to the second round, and the authors receive the first round notification with review comments. The authors of the selected submissions are invited to submit a text-based rebuttal letter to the review comments. 
 The submissions that have not been selected during the first round of reviews may be submitted in other conferences after the first round notification date. 
 In the second round the program committee further reviews the selected submissions by taking into account their rebuttal letter. They then make the final decision of acceptance or rejection. 
 Awards 
 The Program Committee may choose a paper to receive an overall best paper award. In a continuing effort to promote independent work by researchers at an early stage in their career, the Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper authored exclusively by early-career researchers. To be eligible, all co-authors must be studying full/part-time or have received their degree in 2019 or later. As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified. 
 Stipends 
 Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration waived. A limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students, whose papers are accepted and who will present the paper themselves, are encouraged to apply if such assistance is needed. Requests for stipends should be sent to the general chair.
