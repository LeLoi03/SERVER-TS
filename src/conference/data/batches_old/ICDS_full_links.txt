 It is with great pleasure that we welcome you to the 2nd International Conference on Digital Sovereignty (ICDS 2025), organized by the Institute for Energy Technology (IFE) from October 29 to 31, 2025, in Oslo, Norway. Building on the success of ICDS 2024, this second edition will continue to serve as a premier forum for thought leaders, researchers, and industry pioneers to address the growing challenges and opportunities in digital sovereignty. As nations strive to protect their digital infrastructure, critical assets, and economic resilience, the urgency for robust policies and frameworks to uphold national interests in the digital realm has never been greater. 
 ICDS 2025 will bring together renowned experts from academia, industry, and policy-making bodies to explore key dimensions of cybersecurity, decentralized architectures, data governance, and the ethical deployment of emerging technologies. Attendees will gain valuable insights from cutting-edge research and real-world case studies, engage in thought-provoking discussions, and collaborate with key stakeholders to develop innovative strategies for digital autonomy. Join us in Oslo to shape the future of digital sovereignty and contribute to building a more secure, autonomous, and resilient digital world. 
 We are looking forward to welcoming you!
