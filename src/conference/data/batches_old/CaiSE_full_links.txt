 CAiSE'25 | 37th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering | Theme: Bridging Silos | Vienna, AustriaJune 16-20, 2025 | Register 
 Theme: Bridging Silos 
 Engineering real-world information systems requires a coherent design encompassing human, organizational, economic, societal, and technological aspects. Information systems are applied in diverse contexts such as business process management, geographical information systems, and digital twins. The discipline continually evolves with trends in data science, machine learning, process mining, blockchain, mobile computing, sustainability, new regulations, cyber warfare, and military conflicts, all influencing its development. Each application context and emerging trend can lead to specializations within information systems engineering, necessitating various research traditions and needs. While beneficial, these specializations risk creating silos. Thus, the CAiSE conference, the premier event for this discipline, aims to prevent such fragmentation. 
 Therefore, the theme for this year’s CAiSE conference is "Bridging Silos." We encourage submissions that consider information systems engineering as a cohesive design involving multiple aspects. Submissions focused on specific specializations should explicitly position their results within the broader context to engage researchers across different areas and avoid silo formation.

 *** Final Call for Papers *** 
  
 36th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering 
 (CAiSE'24) 
  
 June 3-7, 2024, 5* St. Raphael Resort and Marina, Limassol, Cyprus

 (*** Submission Deadline: Abstract: December 1, 2023 AoE; Paper: December 8, 2023 AoE ***) 

The CAiSE’24 organization calls for full papers with a special emphasis on the theme of 
 Information Systems in the Age of Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged 
 as a transformative technology, revolutionizing various industries, and its significance in 
 Information Systems cannot be overstated. AI-powered systems have the potential to 
 streamline operations, enhance decision-making processes, and drive innovation across 
 organizations. From data analysis to automated processes, AI is reshaping the way we leverage 
 information in the digital age. The relevance of AI in IS extends beyond internal operations. 
 AI-powered predictive analytics enables organizations to forecast trends, anticipate customer 
 needs, and optimize resource allocation. This empowers businesses to adapt swiftly to 
 changing market dynamics, gain a competitive edge, and make proactive decisions. AI 
 algorithms can also detect anomalies and patterns that indicate potential security breaches, 
 contributing to robust cybersecurity measures in information systems. However, while 
 acknowledging the benefits, it is essential to consider the ethical implications of AI in 
 information systems. Ensuring data privacy, addressing bias in algorithms, and maintaining 
 transparency are vital aspects that need to be carefully managed and regulated to foster trust 
 and accountability. 
  
 In addition to offering an exciting scientific program, CAiSE’24 will feature a best paper award, 
 a journal special issue, and a PhD-thesis award: 
  
 • Best Paper Award‚ prize EUR 1000 (sponsored by Springer) 
  
 • A small selection of best papers will be invited to submit enhanced versions for 
 consideration in a special issue of Elsevier Information Systems journal dedicated to this 
 conference. 
  
 • PhD-Thesis Award 
  
 • Best PhD thesis of a past CAiSE Doctoral Consortium author (co-sponsored by the CAiSE 
 Steering Committee and Springer) 
  
 Papers should be submitted in PDF format. Submissions must conform to Springer‚ LNCS 
 format and should not exceed 15 pages, including all text, figures, references, and appendices. 
 Submissions not conforming to the LNCS format, exceeding 15 pages, or being obviously out 
 of the scope of the conference, will be rejected without review. See the guidelines here: 
 https://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html . 
  
 The results described must be unpublished and must not be under review elsewhere. Three to 
 five keywords characterizing the paper should be listed at the end of the abstract. Each paper 
 will be reviewed by at least two program committee members and, if positively evaluated, by 
 one additional program board member. The selected papers will be discussed among the paper 
 reviewers online and during the program board meeting. As the review process is not blind, 
 please indicate your name and affiliation on your submission. Accepted papers will be 
 presented at CAiSE’24 and published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) 
 conference proceedings. 
  
 We invite three types of original and scientific papers. The type of submission must be 
 indicated in the submission system. Each contribution should explicitly address the 
 engineering or the operation of information systems, clearly identify the information systems 
 problem addressed, the expected impact of the contribution to information system engineering 
 or operation, and the research method used. We strongly advise authors to clearly emphasize 
 these aspects in their paper, including the abstract. 
  
 Technical papers describe original solutions (theoretical, methodological or conceptual) in the 
 field of IS Engineering. A technical paper should clearly describe the situation or problem 
 tackled, the relevant state of the art, the position or solution suggested and its potential‚ as 
 well as demonstrate the benefits of the contribution through a rigorous evaluation. 
  
 Empirical papers evaluate existing problem situations including problems encountered in 
 practice, or validate proposed solutions with scientific means, i.e., by empirical studies, 
 experiments, case studies, experience reports, simulations, etc. Scientific reflection on 
 problems and practices in industry also falls into this category. The topic of the evaluation 
 presented in the paper as well as its causal or logical properties must be clearly stated. The 
 research method must be sound and appropriate. 
  
 Exploratory papers describe completely new research positions or approaches, in order to face 
 a generic situation arising because of new ICT tools, new kinds of activities, or new IS 
 challenges. They must precisely describe the situation and demonstrate why current methods, 
 tools, ways of reasoning, or meta-models are inadequate. They must also rigorously present 
 their approach and demonstrate its pertinence and correctness in addressing the identified 
 situation.

 • Novel Approaches to IS Engineering 
 ◦ Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
