Call for Papers 
 The Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL) is an annual international conference aiming to bring together the robotics and machine learning research communities. It focuses on the increasingly important role of learning in robotics and its interaction with other areas of robotics. The aim of CoRL 2025 is to publish significant original research at the intersection of robotics and machine learning. CoRL is a selective, single-track international conference addressing theory and practice of machine learning for robots. CoRL welcomes papers in areas such as: 
  
 Learning representations for robotic perception and control 
 Learning robot foundation models or general-purpose knowledge systems for robotics 
 Imitation learning for robotics, e.g. by behavioral cloning and/or inverse reinforcement learning 
 Reinforcement learning for control of physical robots 
 Model-based and model-free learning for robotic control and decision-making 
 Combination of learning- and planning-based approaches in robotics 
 Probabilistic learning and representation of uncertainty in robotics 
 Automatic robotic data generation for learning methods in robotic 
 Learning for Robot Task and Motion Planning 
 Learning for multimodal robot perception, sensor fusion, and robot vision 
 Learning for human-robot interaction and robot instruction by natural language, gestures as well as alternative devices 
 Learning for hardware design and optimization 
 Learning approaches to robot safety and safety approaches applicable to learning based robotic systems. 
 Applications of robot learning in robot manipulation, navigation, locomotion, driving, flight, and other areas of robotics 
 Robot systems, hardware, and sensors for learning and data-driven approaches 
  
 Submissions should focus on a core robotics problem and demonstrate the relevance of proposed models, algorithms, datasets, and benchmarks to robotics. Authors are encouraged to report real-robot experiments or provide convincing evidence that simulation experiments are transferable to real robots. Submissions without a robotics focus will be returned without review. 
 All Submissions should include a Limitations section, explicitly describing limiting assumptions, failure modes, and other limitations of the results and experiments and how these might be addressed in the future. 
 Authors are also encouraged to submit video, code and data as supplementary materials.
