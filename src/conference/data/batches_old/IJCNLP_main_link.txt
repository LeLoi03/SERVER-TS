 010203Welcome toICNLP 2025 
  
 Natural Language Processing (NLP), as a significant branch of artificial intelligence, focuses on enabling computer systems to analyze, understand, and generate human language. With the rapid development of big data and deep learning technologies, NLP has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in areas such as language translation, text understanding, knowledge base construction, summarization, and human-computer interaction. Today, NLP technologies have deeply integrated into daily life, playing a vital role in fields such as entertainment, healthcare, database management, and e-governance, making it one of the core drivers of modern technology. 
  
 The 7th International Conference on Natural Language Processing (ICNLP 2025) will be held in Guangzhou, China from March 21 to 23, 2025. The conference is mainly hosted by National Community of Key Data Elements for Industry-Education Harmonization, organized by Guangdong University of Finance and Economics and Guangzhou Huashang College, Co-organised by South China Normal University, Iflytek Co.,Ltd, Guangdong Polytechnic of Science and Technology, Guangzhou College of Commerce and Excellence Information Technology Corp., Ltd. 
  
 Since its inception, the ICNLP conference series has been dedicated to advancing academic research and technological applications in NLP, providing a vital platform for researchers, students, developers, and practitioners worldwide to exchange innovative ideas and showcase cutting-edge achievements. 
  
 ICNLP 2025 will cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to natural language understanding, speech recognition, text generation, knowledge graphs, sentiment analysis, and cross-lingual information processing. The conference will feature keynote speeches by renowned experts from around the world, multiple academic discussions, and technical sharing sessions, providing participants with opportunities for in-depth exploration and collaboration. We warmly invite experts and scholars from the NLP community worldwide to join us in Guangzhou to share their latest research achievements and collaboratively discuss the future directions of natural language processing.
