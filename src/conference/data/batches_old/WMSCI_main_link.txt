About the Conference 
  
 PurposeThe purpose of WMSCI 2025 is to promote discussions and interactions between researchers and practitioners focused on disciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary issues, ideas, concepts, theories, methodologies and applications. We are particularly interested in fostering the exchange of concepts, prototypes, research ideas, and other results which could contribute to the academic arena and also benefit business, and the industrial community. 
 What is WMSCI 2025?WMSCI 2025 is an international forum for scientists and engineers, researchers and consultants, theoreticians and practitioners in the fields of Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics. The forum focuses into specific disciplinary research, and also in multi, inter, and trans-disciplinary studies and projects. One of its aims is to relate disciplines, fostering analogical thinking and, hence, producing input to the logical thinking. 
 A Metaphor 
  
 Through WMSCI conferences, we are trying to relate theanalyticthinking, required infocusedconference´s sessions, with thesyntheticthinking, required for analogies generation, which calls a formulti-focusdomain anddivergentthinking. We are trying to promote synergic relationships between analytically and synthetically oriented minds, as it is found between left and right brain hemispheres, by means of the corpus callosum. Then, WMSCI 2025 might be perceived as aresearch corpus callosum, trying to bridge analytical with synthetically oriented efforts, convergent with divergent thinking, and focused specialists with non-focused or multi-focused generalists | A Metaphor

We are trying to promote synergic relationships between analytically and synthetically oriented minds, as it is found between left and right brain hemispheres, by means of the corpus callosum.

 PurposeThe purpose of WMSCI 2025 is to promote discussions and interactions between researchers and practitioners focused on disciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary issues, ideas, concepts, theories, methodologies and applications. We are particularly interested in fostering the exchange of concepts, prototypes, research ideas, and other results which could contribute to the academic arena and also benefit business, and the industrial community. 
 What is WMSCI 2025?WMSCI 2025 is an international forum for scientists and engineers, researchers and consultants, theoreticians and practitioners in the fields of Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics. The forum focuses into specific disciplinary research, and also in multi, inter, and trans-disciplinary studies and projects. One of its aims is to relate disciplines, fostering analogical thinking and, hence, producing input to the logical thinking.

Why WMSCI 2025? 
  
 There are many goodfocusedconferences in any one of the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also very good conferences even in the morespecificareas included in the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also goodgeneralconferences, which have a wider scope and are more comprehensive. Each one of these kinds of conferences has its typical audience. WMSCI 2025 will bring together both kinds of audiences, so participants, with a focused research, will be able to: 
 1. Present their focused research in a specific area for scholars/researchersspecializedin their paper discipline and, perhaps, for specialists from otherrelated disciplinesandgeneralistswith a more comprehensive intellectual outlook. 
 2. Get feedback from researchers with the same specific background, as is usual in focused conferences. 
 3. Get possible feedback from scholars/researchers in related disciplines, thereby opening the possibility ofanalogies generation,newapplicationsto/from different disciplines, business or industrial areas; and, possibly,new modelsfor re-thinking anew some of their research problems. 
 4. Organize sessions where papers from related areas are presented, in order to increase the probability of getting the benefits mentioned in (3). 
 5. Attract speakers with a wider intellectual interest in order to get a more comprehensive conceptual framework and to give context to their research effort. 
 This would allow specialists and focused researchers, to see the forest besides the tree of their discipline, and to be aware about the neighboring trees. 
 WMSCI 2025 participants, with non-focused or multi-focused research or with a comprehensive intellectual, industrial or business interest, will be able to: 
 1. Present their research, ideas, reflections, new concepts/designs or industrial/business innovations to a similar or a specialized audience, so suggestions about possible improvements could emerge and possibly new research or development projects could come out into view. 
 2. Present ideas that would require multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary efforts to be researched or developed in action-research programs. 
 3. Constituteinternational, multi- and/or inter-disciplinary teamsor workgroups in order to conduct research requiring synergic relationships among different kinds of talents, cognitive styles, intellectual faculties and/or research/industrial interests. 
 4. Create new research areas, based on both: a general framework and various disciplines or focused research areas. This could be done by means of international research teamwork and/or by the elaboration and edition of a multiple-authors book in the Newly Created Field. The newly created Informing Sciences Field is one example on this issue. Our past conferences served to support the initial efforts of their proponents, and now the group has its own yearly conference, newsletter, etc. 
 Invited Sessions can be organized in a specific or a general theme. These Invited Sessions may grow to Focus Symposia, workshops, satellite events, micro-conferences or even conferences by their own in the context of WMSCI or as independent or associated spin offs from WMSCI. At least two independent yearly conferences and several associated conferences are actually spin offs from WMSCI conferences. 
 Organizational, Reviewing, and Selection of Best Papers Policies 
 Virtual sessions 
 Face-to-face sessions of all events will have associated virtual pre- and post-conference sessions where registered participants can comment each paper in a forum associated to it. Registered participant at any event will have a password to access any virtual session of any collocated event. 
 Technical Keynote Speakers 
 Technical keynote speakers will be selected from early submissions because this selection requires an additional evaluation according to the quality of the paper, assessed by its reviewers, the authors' CV and the paper's topic. 
 Reviewing Process 
 All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, and (3) participative peer reviews. Final acceptance depends of the three kinds of reviews but a paper should be recommended by non-blind reviewers AND blind reviewers in order to be accepted for presentation at the conference and to be included in the respective conference proceedings. A recommendation to accept made by non-blind reviewers is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient one. A submission, to be accepted, should also have a majority of its double-blind reviewers recommending its acceptance. This double necessary conditions generate a more reliable and rigorous reviewing than a those reviewing methods based on just one of the indicated methods, or just on the traditional double-blind reviewing. More details regarding this issue can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/PeerReviewing.asp. 
 The three kinds of reviews mentioned above will support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details regarding the Acceptance Policy can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/AcceptancePolicy.asp. 
 Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions. 
 Virtual Participation 
 Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing process and the accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings. 
 Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic forums) will be held for each session included in the conference program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and authors presenting at the same session can interact three days before and during the conference, as well as up to three weeks after the conference is over. Authors can also participate in peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions. | There are many goodfocusedconferences in any one of the major themes of WMSCI Conferences.

 1. Present their research, ideas, reflections, new concepts/designs or industrial/business innovations to a similar or a specialized audience, so suggestions about possible improvements could emerge and possibly new research or development projects could come out into view. 
 2. Present ideas that would require multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary efforts to be researched or developed in action-research programs. 
 3. Constituteinternational, multi- and/or inter-disciplinary teamsor workgroups in order to conduct research requiring synergic relationships among different kinds of talents, cognitive styles, intellectual faculties and/or research/industrial interests. 
 4. Create new research areas, based on both: a general framework and various disciplines or focused research areas. This could be done by means of international research teamwork and/or by the elaboration and edition of a multiple-authors book in the Newly Created Field. The newly created Informing Sciences Field is one example on this issue. Our past conferences served to support the initial efforts of their proponents, and now the group has its own yearly conference, newsletter, etc. 
 Invited Sessions can be organized in a specific or a general theme. These Invited Sessions may grow to Focus Symposia, workshops, satellite events, micro-conferences or even conferences by their own in the context of WMSCI or as independent or associated spin offs from WMSCI. At least two independent yearly conferences and several associated conferences are actually spin offs from WMSCI conferences. 
 Organizational, Reviewing, and Selection of Best Papers Policies 
 Virtual sessions 
 Face-to-face sessions of all events will have associated virtual pre- and post-conference sessions where registered participants can comment each paper in a forum associated to it. Registered participant at any event will have a password to access any virtual session of any collocated event. 
 Technical Keynote Speakers 
 Technical keynote speakers will be selected from early submissions because this selection requires an additional evaluation according to the quality of the paper, assessed by its reviewers, the authors' CV and the paper's topic. 
 Reviewing Process 
 All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, and (3) participative peer reviews. Final acceptance depends of the three kinds of reviews but a paper should be recommended by non-blind reviewers AND blind reviewers in order to be accepted for presentation at the conference and to be included in the respective conference proceedings. A recommendation to accept made by non-blind reviewers is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient one. A submission, to be accepted, should also have a majority of its double-blind reviewers recommending its acceptance. This double necessary conditions generate a more reliable and rigorous reviewing than a those reviewing methods based on just one of the indicated methods, or just on the traditional double-blind reviewing. More details regarding this issue can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/PeerReviewing.asp. 
 The three kinds of reviews mentioned above will support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details regarding the Acceptance Policy can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/AcceptancePolicy.asp. 
 Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions. 
 Virtual Participation 
 Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing process and the accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings. 
 Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic forums) will be held for each session included in the conference program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and authors presenting at the same session can interact three days before and during the conference, as well as up to three weeks after the conference is over. Authors can also participate in peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions. 
 There are many goodfocusedconferences in any one of the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also very good conferences even in the morespecificareas included in the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also goodgeneralconferences, which have a wider scope and are more comprehensive. Each one of these kinds of conferences has its typical audience. WMSCI 2025 will bring together both kinds of audiences, so participants, with a focused research, will be able to: 
 1. Present their focused research in a specific area for scholars/researchersspecializedin their paper discipline and, perhaps, for specialists from otherrelated disciplinesandgeneralistswith a more comprehensive intellectual outlook. 
 2. Get feedback from researchers with the same specific background, as is usual in focused conferences. 
 3. Get possible feedback from scholars/researchers in related disciplines, thereby opening the possibility ofanalogies generation,newapplicationsto/from different disciplines, business or industrial areas; and, possibly,new modelsfor re-thinking anew some of their research problems. 
 4. Organize sessions where papers from related areas are presented, in order to increase the probability of getting the benefits mentioned in (3).

 Technical keynote speakers will be selected from early submissions because this selection requires an additional evaluation according to the quality of the paper, assessed by its reviewers, the authors' CV and the paper's topic. 
 Reviewing Process 
 All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, and (3) participative peer reviews. Final acceptance depends of the three kinds of reviews but a paper should be recommended by non-blind reviewers AND blind reviewers in order to be accepted for presentation at the conference and to be included in the respective conference proceedings. A recommendation to accept made by non-blind reviewers is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient one. A submission, to be accepted, should also have a majority of its double-blind reviewers recommending its acceptance. This double necessary conditions generate a more reliable and rigorous reviewing than a those reviewing methods based on just one of the indicated methods, or just on the traditional double-blind reviewing. More details regarding this issue can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/PeerReviewing.asp. 
 The three kinds of reviews mentioned above will support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details regarding the Acceptance Policy can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/AcceptancePolicy.asp. 
 Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions. 
 Virtual Participation 
 Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing process and the accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings. 
 Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic forums) will be held for each session included in the conference program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and authors presenting at the same session can interact three days before and during the conference, as well as up to three weeks after the conference is over. Authors can also participate in peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions. | Why WMSCI 2025? | There are many goodfocusedconferences in any one of the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also very good conferences even in the morespecificareas included in the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also goodgeneralconferences, which have a wider scope and are more comprehensive. Each one of these kinds of conferences has its typical audience. WMSCI 2025 will bring together both kinds of audiences, so participants, with a focused research, will be able to: 
 1. Present their focused research in a specific area for scholars/researchersspecializedin their paper discipline and, perhaps, for specialists from otherrelated disciplinesandgeneralistswith a more comprehensive intellectual outlook. 
 2. Get feedback from researchers with the same specific background, as is usual in focused conferences. 
 3. Get possible feedback from scholars/researchers in related disciplines, thereby opening the possibility ofanalogies generation,newapplicationsto/from different disciplines, business or industrial areas; and, possibly,new modelsfor re-thinking anew some of their research problems. 
 4. Organize sessions where papers from related areas are presented, in order to increase the probability of getting the benefits mentioned in (3). 
 5. Attract speakers with a wider intellectual interest in order to get a more comprehensive conceptual framework and to give context to their research effort. 
 This would allow specialists and focused researchers, to see the forest besides the tree of their discipline, and to be aware about the neighboring trees. 
 WMSCI 2025 participants, with non-focused or multi-focused research or with a comprehensive intellectual, industrial or business interest, will be able to: 
 1. Present their research, ideas, reflections, new concepts/designs or industrial/business innovations to a similar or a specialized audience, so suggestions about possible improvements could emerge and possibly new research or development projects could come out into view. 
 2. Present ideas that would require multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary efforts to be researched or developed in action-research programs. 
 3. Constituteinternational, multi- and/or inter-disciplinary teamsor workgroups in order to conduct research requiring synergic relationships among different kinds of talents, cognitive styles, intellectual faculties and/or research/industrial interests. 
 4. Create new research areas, based on both: a general framework and various disciplines or focused research areas. This could be done by means of international research teamwork and/or by the elaboration and edition of a multiple-authors book in the Newly Created Field. The newly created Informing Sciences Field is one example on this issue. Our past conferences served to support the initial efforts of their proponents, and now the group has its own yearly conference, newsletter, etc. 
 Invited Sessions can be organized in a specific or a general theme. These Invited Sessions may grow to Focus Symposia, workshops, satellite events, micro-conferences or even conferences by their own in the context of WMSCI or as independent or associated spin offs from WMSCI. At least two independent yearly conferences and several associated conferences are actually spin offs from WMSCI conferences.

 Virtual Participation 
 Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing process and the accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings. 
 Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic forums) will be held for each session included in the conference program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and authors presenting at the same session can interact three days before and during the conference, as well as up to three weeks after the conference is over. Authors can also participate in peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions. | There are many goodfocusedconferences in any one of the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also very good conferences even in the morespecificareas included in the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also goodgeneralconferences, which have a wider scope and are more comprehensive. Each one of these kinds of conferences has its typical audience. WMSCI 2025 will bring together both kinds of audiences, so participants, with a focused research, will be able to: 
 1. Present their focused research in a specific area for scholars/researchersspecializedin their paper discipline and, perhaps, for specialists from otherrelated disciplinesandgeneralistswith a more comprehensive intellectual outlook. 
 2. Get feedback from researchers with the same specific background, as is usual in focused conferences. 
 3. Get possible feedback from scholars/researchers in related disciplines, thereby opening the possibility ofanalogies generation,newapplicationsto/from different disciplines, business or industrial areas; and, possibly,new modelsfor re-thinking anew some of their research problems. 
 4. Organize sessions where papers from related areas are presented, in order to increase the probability of getting the benefits mentioned in (3). 
 5. Attract speakers with a wider intellectual interest in order to get a more comprehensive conceptual framework and to give context to their research effort. 
 This would allow specialists and focused researchers, to see the forest besides the tree of their discipline, and to be aware about the neighboring trees. 
 WMSCI 2025 participants, with non-focused or multi-focused research or with a comprehensive intellectual, industrial or business interest, will be able to: 
 1. Present their research, ideas, reflections, new concepts/designs or industrial/business innovations to a similar or a specialized audience, so suggestions about possible improvements could emerge and possibly new research or development projects could come out into view. 
 2. Present ideas that would require multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary efforts to be researched or developed in action-research programs. 
 3. Constituteinternational, multi- and/or inter-disciplinary teamsor workgroups in order to conduct research requiring synergic relationships among different kinds of talents, cognitive styles, intellectual faculties and/or research/industrial interests. 
 4. Create new research areas, based on both: a general framework and various disciplines or focused research areas. This could be done by means of international research teamwork and/or by the elaboration and edition of a multiple-authors book in the Newly Created Field. The newly created Informing Sciences Field is one example on this issue. Our past conferences served to support the initial efforts of their proponents, and now the group has its own yearly conference, newsletter, etc. 
 Invited Sessions can be organized in a specific or a general theme. These Invited Sessions may grow to Focus Symposia, workshops, satellite events, micro-conferences or even conferences by their own in the context of WMSCI or as independent or associated spin offs from WMSCI. At least two independent yearly conferences and several associated conferences are actually spin offs from WMSCI conferences. 
 Organizational, Reviewing, and Selection of Best Papers Policies 
 Virtual sessions 
 Face-to-face sessions of all events will have associated virtual pre- and post-conference sessions where registered participants can comment each paper in a forum associated to it. Registered participant at any event will have a password to access any virtual session of any collocated event. 
 Technical Keynote Speakers 
 Technical keynote speakers will be selected from early submissions because this selection requires an additional evaluation according to the quality of the paper, assessed by its reviewers, the authors' CV and the paper's topic. 
 Reviewing Process 
 All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, and (3) participative peer reviews. Final acceptance depends of the three kinds of reviews but a paper should be recommended by non-blind reviewers AND blind reviewers in order to be accepted for presentation at the conference and to be included in the respective conference proceedings. A recommendation to accept made by non-blind reviewers is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient one. A submission, to be accepted, should also have a majority of its double-blind reviewers recommending its acceptance. This double necessary conditions generate a more reliable and rigorous reviewing than a those reviewing methods based on just one of the indicated methods, or just on the traditional double-blind reviewing. More details regarding this issue can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/PeerReviewing.asp. 
 The three kinds of reviews mentioned above will support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal.

 5. Attract speakers with a wider intellectual interest in order to get a more comprehensive conceptual framework and to give context to their research effort. 
 This would allow specialists and focused researchers, to see the forest besides the tree of their discipline, and to be aware about the neighboring trees. 
 WMSCI 2025 participants, with non-focused or multi-focused research or with a comprehensive intellectual, industrial or business interest, will be able to: 
 1. Present their research, ideas, reflections, new concepts/designs or industrial/business innovations to a similar or a specialized audience, so suggestions about possible improvements could emerge and possibly new research or development projects could come out into view. 
 2. Present ideas that would require multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary efforts to be researched or developed in action-research programs. 
 3. Constituteinternational, multi- and/or inter-disciplinary teamsor workgroups in order to conduct research requiring synergic relationships among different kinds of talents, cognitive styles, intellectual faculties and/or research/industrial interests. 
 4. Create new research areas, based on both: a general framework and various disciplines or focused research areas. This could be done by means of international research teamwork and/or by the elaboration and edition of a multiple-authors book in the Newly Created Field. The newly created Informing Sciences Field is one example on this issue. Our past conferences served to support the initial efforts of their proponents, and now the group has its own yearly conference, newsletter, etc. 
 Invited Sessions can be organized in a specific or a general theme. These Invited Sessions may grow to Focus Symposia, workshops, satellite events, micro-conferences or even conferences by their own in the context of WMSCI or as independent or associated spin offs from WMSCI. At least two independent yearly conferences and several associated conferences are actually spin offs from WMSCI conferences. 
 Organizational, Reviewing, and Selection of Best Papers Policies 
 Virtual sessions 
 Face-to-face sessions of all events will have associated virtual pre- and post-conference sessions where registered participants can comment each paper in a forum associated to it. Registered participant at any event will have a password to access any virtual session of any collocated event. 
 Technical Keynote Speakers 
 Technical keynote speakers will be selected from early submissions because this selection requires an additional evaluation according to the quality of the paper, assessed by its reviewers, the authors' CV and the paper's topic. 
 Reviewing Process 
 All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, and (3) participative peer reviews. Final acceptance depends of the three kinds of reviews but a paper should be recommended by non-blind reviewers AND blind reviewers in order to be accepted for presentation at the conference and to be included in the respective conference proceedings. A recommendation to accept made by non-blind reviewers is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient one. A submission, to be accepted, should also have a majority of its double-blind reviewers recommending its acceptance. This double necessary conditions generate a more reliable and rigorous reviewing than a those reviewing methods based on just one of the indicated methods, or just on the traditional double-blind reviewing. More details regarding this issue can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/PeerReviewing.asp. 
 The three kinds of reviews mentioned above will support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details regarding the Acceptance Policy can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/AcceptancePolicy.asp. 
 Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions. 
 Virtual Participation 
 Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing process and the accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings. 
 Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic forums) will be held for each session included in the conference program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and authors presenting at the same session can interact three days before and during the conference, as well as up to three weeks after the conference is over. Authors can also participate in peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions. | SUBMISSIONS FOR VIRTUAL PARTICIPATION ARE NOW OPEN

 PurposeThe purpose of WMSCI 2025 is to promote discussions and interactions between researchers and practitioners focused on disciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary issues, ideas, concepts, theories, methodologies and applications. We are particularly interested in fostering the exchange of concepts, prototypes, research ideas, and other results which could contribute to the academic arena and also benefit business, and the industrial community. 
 What is WMSCI 2025?WMSCI 2025 is an international forum for scientists and engineers, researchers and consultants, theoreticians and practitioners in the fields of Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics. The forum focuses into specific disciplinary research, and also in multi, inter, and trans-disciplinary studies and projects. One of its aims is to relate disciplines, fostering analogical thinking and, hence, producing input to the logical thinking.

 Through WMSCI conferences, we are trying to relate theanalyticthinking, required infocusedconference´s sessions, with thesyntheticthinking, required for analogies generation, which calls a formulti-focusdomain anddivergentthinking. We are trying to promote synergic relationships between analytically and synthetically oriented minds, as it is found between left and right brain hemispheres, by means of the corpus callosum. Then, WMSCI 2025 might be perceived as aresearch corpus callosum, trying to bridge analytical with synthetically oriented efforts, convergent with divergent thinking, and focused specialists with non-focused or multi-focused generalists | A Metaphor

We are trying to promote synergic relationships between analytically and synthetically oriented minds, as it is found between left and right brain hemispheres, by means of the corpus callosum.

Then, WMSCI 2025 might be perceived as aresearch corpus callosum, trying to bridge analytical with synthetically oriented efforts, convergent with divergent thinking, and focused specialists with non-focused or multi-focused generalists | PurposeThe purpose of WMSCI 2025 is to promote discussions and interactions between researchers and practitioners focused on disciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary issues, ideas, concepts, theories, methodologies and applications. We are particularly interested in fostering the exchange of concepts, prototypes, research ideas, and other results which could contribute to the academic arena and also benefit business, and the industrial community. 
 What is WMSCI 2025?WMSCI 2025 is an international forum for scientists and engineers, researchers and consultants, theoreticians and practitioners in the fields of Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics. The forum focuses into specific disciplinary research, and also in multi, inter, and trans-disciplinary studies and projects. One of its aims is to relate disciplines, fostering analogical thinking and, hence, producing input to the logical thinking. | A Metaphor

 There are many goodfocusedconferences in any one of the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also very good conferences even in the morespecificareas included in the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also goodgeneralconferences, which have a wider scope and are more comprehensive. Each one of these kinds of conferences has its typical audience. WMSCI 2025 will bring together both kinds of audiences, so participants, with a focused research, will be able to: 
 1. Present their focused research in a specific area for scholars/researchersspecializedin their paper discipline and, perhaps, for specialists from otherrelated disciplinesandgeneralistswith a more comprehensive intellectual outlook. 
 2. Get feedback from researchers with the same specific background, as is usual in focused conferences. 
 3. Get possible feedback from scholars/researchers in related disciplines, thereby opening the possibility ofanalogies generation,newapplicationsto/from different disciplines, business or industrial areas; and, possibly,new modelsfor re-thinking anew some of their research problems. 
 4. Organize sessions where papers from related areas are presented, in order to increase the probability of getting the benefits mentioned in (3). 
 5. Attract speakers with a wider intellectual interest in order to get a more comprehensive conceptual framework and to give context to their research effort. 
 This would allow specialists and focused researchers, to see the forest besides the tree of their discipline, and to be aware about the neighboring trees. 
 WMSCI 2025 participants, with non-focused or multi-focused research or with a comprehensive intellectual, industrial or business interest, will be able to: 
 1. Present their research, ideas, reflections, new concepts/designs or industrial/business innovations to a similar or a specialized audience, so suggestions about possible improvements could emerge and possibly new research or development projects could come out into view. 
 2. Present ideas that would require multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary efforts to be researched or developed in action-research programs. 
 3. Constituteinternational, multi- and/or inter-disciplinary teamsor workgroups in order to conduct research requiring synergic relationships among different kinds of talents, cognitive styles, intellectual faculties and/or research/industrial interests. 
 4. Create new research areas, based on both: a general framework and various disciplines or focused research areas. This could be done by means of international research teamwork and/or by the elaboration and edition of a multiple-authors book in the Newly Created Field. The newly created Informing Sciences Field is one example on this issue. Our past conferences served to support the initial efforts of their proponents, and now the group has its own yearly conference, newsletter, etc. 
 Invited Sessions can be organized in a specific or a general theme. These Invited Sessions may grow to Focus Symposia, workshops, satellite events, micro-conferences or even conferences by their own in the context of WMSCI or as independent or associated spin offs from WMSCI. At least two independent yearly conferences and several associated conferences are actually spin offs from WMSCI conferences. 
 Organizational, Reviewing, and Selection of Best Papers Policies 
 Virtual sessions 
 Face-to-face sessions of all events will have associated virtual pre- and post-conference sessions where registered participants can comment each paper in a forum associated to it. Registered participant at any event will have a password to access any virtual session of any collocated event. 
 Technical Keynote Speakers 
 Technical keynote speakers will be selected from early submissions because this selection requires an additional evaluation according to the quality of the paper, assessed by its reviewers, the authors' CV and the paper's topic. 
 Reviewing Process 
 All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, and (3) participative peer reviews. Final acceptance depends of the three kinds of reviews but a paper should be recommended by non-blind reviewers AND blind reviewers in order to be accepted for presentation at the conference and to be included in the respective conference proceedings. A recommendation to accept made by non-blind reviewers is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient one. A submission, to be accepted, should also have a majority of its double-blind reviewers recommending its acceptance. This double necessary conditions generate a more reliable and rigorous reviewing than a those reviewing methods based on just one of the indicated methods, or just on the traditional double-blind reviewing. More details regarding this issue can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/PeerReviewing.asp. 
 The three kinds of reviews mentioned above will support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details regarding the Acceptance Policy can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/AcceptancePolicy.asp. 
 Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions. 
 Virtual Participation 
 Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing process and the accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings. 
 Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic forums) will be held for each session included in the conference program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and authors presenting at the same session can interact three days before and during the conference, as well as up to three weeks after the conference is over. Authors can also participate in peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions. | There are many goodfocusedconferences in any one of the major themes of WMSCI Conferences.

This double necessary conditions generate a more reliable and rigorous reviewing than a those reviewing methods based on just one of the indicated methods, or just on the traditional double-blind reviewing. More details regarding this issue can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/PeerReviewing.asp. 
 The three kinds of reviews mentioned above will support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details regarding the Acceptance Policy can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/AcceptancePolicy.asp. 
 Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions. 
 Virtual Participation 
 Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing process and the accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings. 
 Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic forums) will be held for each session included in the conference program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and authors presenting at the same session can interact three days before and during the conference, as well as up to three weeks after the conference is over. Authors can also participate in peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions. | There are many goodfocusedconferences in any one of the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also very good conferences even in the morespecificareas included in the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also goodgeneralconferences, which have a wider scope and are more comprehensive. Each one of these kinds of conferences has its typical audience. WMSCI 2025 will bring together both kinds of audiences, so participants, with a focused research, will be able to: 
 1. Present their focused research in a specific area for scholars/researchersspecializedin their paper discipline and, perhaps, for specialists from otherrelated disciplinesandgeneralistswith a more comprehensive intellectual outlook. 
 2. Get feedback from researchers with the same specific background, as is usual in focused conferences. 
 3. Get possible feedback from scholars/researchers in related disciplines, thereby opening the possibility ofanalogies generation,newapplicationsto/from different disciplines, business or industrial areas; and, possibly,new modelsfor re-thinking anew some of their research problems. 
 4. Organize sessions where papers from related areas are presented, in order to increase the probability of getting the benefits mentioned in (3). 
 5. Attract speakers with a wider intellectual interest in order to get a more comprehensive conceptual framework and to give context to their research effort. 
 This would allow specialists and focused researchers, to see the forest besides the tree of their discipline, and to be aware about the neighboring trees. 
 WMSCI 2025 participants, with non-focused or multi-focused research or with a comprehensive intellectual, industrial or business interest, will be able to: 
 1. Present their research, ideas, reflections, new concepts/designs or industrial/business innovations to a similar or a specialized audience, so suggestions about possible improvements could emerge and possibly new research or development projects could come out into view. 
 2. Present ideas that would require multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary efforts to be researched or developed in action-research programs. 
 3. Constituteinternational, multi- and/or inter-disciplinary teamsor workgroups in order to conduct research requiring synergic relationships among different kinds of talents, cognitive styles, intellectual faculties and/or research/industrial interests. 
 4. Create new research areas, based on both: a general framework and various disciplines or focused research areas. This could be done by means of international research teamwork and/or by the elaboration and edition of a multiple-authors book in the Newly Created Field. The newly created Informing Sciences Field is one example on this issue. Our past conferences served to support the initial efforts of their proponents, and now the group has its own yearly conference, newsletter, etc. 
 Invited Sessions can be organized in a specific or a general theme. These Invited Sessions may grow to Focus Symposia, workshops, satellite events, micro-conferences or even conferences by their own in the context of WMSCI or as independent or associated spin offs from WMSCI. At least two independent yearly conferences and several associated conferences are actually spin offs from WMSCI conferences. 
 Organizational, Reviewing, and Selection of Best Papers Policies 
 Virtual sessions 
 Face-to-face sessions of all events will have associated virtual pre- and post-conference sessions where registered participants can comment each paper in a forum associated to it. Registered participant at any event will have a password to access any virtual session of any collocated event. 
 Technical Keynote Speakers 
 Technical keynote speakers will be selected from early submissions because this selection requires an additional evaluation according to the quality of the paper, assessed by its reviewers, the authors' CV and the paper's topic. 
 Reviewing Process 
 All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, and (3) participative peer reviews.

WMSCI 2025 will bring together both kinds of audiences, so participants, with a focused research, will be able to: 
 1. Present their focused research in a specific area for scholars/researchersspecializedin their paper discipline and, perhaps, for specialists from otherrelated disciplinesandgeneralistswith a more comprehensive intellectual outlook. 
 2. Get feedback from researchers with the same specific background, as is usual in focused conferences. 
 3. Get possible feedback from scholars/researchers in related disciplines, thereby opening the possibility ofanalogies generation,newapplicationsto/from different disciplines, business or industrial areas; and, possibly,new modelsfor re-thinking anew some of their research problems. 
 4. Organize sessions where papers from related areas are presented, in order to increase the probability of getting the benefits mentioned in (3). 
 5. Attract speakers with a wider intellectual interest in order to get a more comprehensive conceptual framework and to give context to their research effort. 
 This would allow specialists and focused researchers, to see the forest besides the tree of their discipline, and to be aware about the neighboring trees. 
 WMSCI 2025 participants, with non-focused or multi-focused research or with a comprehensive intellectual, industrial or business interest, will be able to: 
 1. Present their research, ideas, reflections, new concepts/designs or industrial/business innovations to a similar or a specialized audience, so suggestions about possible improvements could emerge and possibly new research or development projects could come out into view. 
 2. Present ideas that would require multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary efforts to be researched or developed in action-research programs. 
 3. Constituteinternational, multi- and/or inter-disciplinary teamsor workgroups in order to conduct research requiring synergic relationships among different kinds of talents, cognitive styles, intellectual faculties and/or research/industrial interests. 
 4. Create new research areas, based on both: a general framework and various disciplines or focused research areas. This could be done by means of international research teamwork and/or by the elaboration and edition of a multiple-authors book in the Newly Created Field. The newly created Informing Sciences Field is one example on this issue. Our past conferences served to support the initial efforts of their proponents, and now the group has its own yearly conference, newsletter, etc. 
 Invited Sessions can be organized in a specific or a general theme. These Invited Sessions may grow to Focus Symposia, workshops, satellite events, micro-conferences or even conferences by their own in the context of WMSCI or as independent or associated spin offs from WMSCI. At least two independent yearly conferences and several associated conferences are actually spin offs from WMSCI conferences. 
 Organizational, Reviewing, and Selection of Best Papers Policies 
 Virtual sessions 
 Face-to-face sessions of all events will have associated virtual pre- and post-conference sessions where registered participants can comment each paper in a forum associated to it. Registered participant at any event will have a password to access any virtual session of any collocated event. 
 Technical Keynote Speakers 
 Technical keynote speakers will be selected from early submissions because this selection requires an additional evaluation according to the quality of the paper, assessed by its reviewers, the authors' CV and the paper's topic. 
 Reviewing Process 
 All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, and (3) participative peer reviews. Final acceptance depends of the three kinds of reviews but a paper should be recommended by non-blind reviewers AND blind reviewers in order to be accepted for presentation at the conference and to be included in the respective conference proceedings. A recommendation to accept made by non-blind reviewers is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient one. A submission, to be accepted, should also have a majority of its double-blind reviewers recommending its acceptance. This double necessary conditions generate a more reliable and rigorous reviewing than a those reviewing methods based on just one of the indicated methods, or just on the traditional double-blind reviewing. More details regarding this issue can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/PeerReviewing.asp. 
 The three kinds of reviews mentioned above will support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details regarding the Acceptance Policy can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/AcceptancePolicy.asp. 
 Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions. 
 Virtual Participation 
 Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing process and the accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings. 
 Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic forums) will be held for each session included in the conference program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and authors presenting at the same session can interact three days before and during the conference, as well as up to three weeks after the conference is over. Authors can also participate in peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions. | Special Tracks

 About the Conference 
  
 PurposeThe purpose of WMSCI 2025 is to promote discussions and interactions between researchers and practitioners focused on disciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary issues, ideas, concepts, theories, methodologies and applications. We are particularly interested in fostering the exchange of concepts, prototypes, research ideas, and other results which could contribute to the academic arena and also benefit business, and the industrial community. 
 What is WMSCI 2025?WMSCI 2025 is an international forum for scientists and engineers, researchers and consultants, theoreticians and practitioners in the fields of Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics. The forum focuses into specific disciplinary research, and also in multi, inter, and trans-disciplinary studies and projects. One of its aims is to relate disciplines, fostering analogical thinking and, hence, producing input to the logical thinking.

 Through WMSCI conferences, we are trying to relate theanalyticthinking, required infocusedconference´s sessions, with thesyntheticthinking, required for analogies generation, which calls a formulti-focusdomain anddivergentthinking. We are trying to promote synergic relationships between analytically and synthetically oriented minds, as it is found between left and right brain hemispheres, by means of the corpus callosum. Then, WMSCI 2025 might be perceived as aresearch corpus callosum, trying to bridge analytical with synthetically oriented efforts, convergent with divergent thinking, and focused specialists with non-focused or multi-focused generalists | A Metaphor

We are trying to promote synergic relationships between analytically and synthetically oriented minds, as it is found between left and right brain hemispheres, by means of the corpus callosum. Then, WMSCI 2025 might be perceived as aresearch corpus callosum, trying to bridge analytical with synthetically oriented efforts, convergent with divergent thinking, and focused specialists with non-focused or multi-focused generalists 
 PurposeThe purpose of WMSCI 2025 is to promote discussions and interactions between researchers and practitioners focused on disciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary issues, ideas, concepts, theories, methodologies and applications. We are particularly interested in fostering the exchange of concepts, prototypes, research ideas, and other results which could contribute to the academic arena and also benefit business, and the industrial community. 
 What is WMSCI 2025?WMSCI 2025 is an international forum for scientists and engineers, researchers and consultants, theoreticians and practitioners in the fields of Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics. The forum focuses into specific disciplinary research, and also in multi, inter, and trans-disciplinary studies and projects. One of its aims is to relate disciplines, fostering analogical thinking and, hence, producing input to the logical thinking.

 Why WMSCI 2025? 
  
 There are many goodfocusedconferences in any one of the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also very good conferences even in the morespecificareas included in the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also goodgeneralconferences, which have a wider scope and are more comprehensive. Each one of these kinds of conferences has its typical audience. WMSCI 2025 will bring together both kinds of audiences, so participants, with a focused research, will be able to: 
 1. Present their focused research in a specific area for scholars/researchersspecializedin their paper discipline and, perhaps, for specialists from otherrelated disciplinesandgeneralistswith a more comprehensive intellectual outlook. 
 2. Get feedback from researchers with the same specific background, as is usual in focused conferences. 
 3. Get possible feedback from scholars/researchers in related disciplines, thereby opening the possibility ofanalogies generation,newapplicationsto/from different disciplines, business or industrial areas; and, possibly,new modelsfor re-thinking anew some of their research problems. 
 4. Organize sessions where papers from related areas are presented, in order to increase the probability of getting the benefits mentioned in (3). 
 5. Attract speakers with a wider intellectual interest in order to get a more comprehensive conceptual framework and to give context to their research effort. 
 This would allow specialists and focused researchers, to see the forest besides the tree of their discipline, and to be aware about the neighboring trees. 
 WMSCI 2025 participants, with non-focused or multi-focused research or with a comprehensive intellectual, industrial or business interest, will be able to: 
 1. Present their research, ideas, reflections, new concepts/designs or industrial/business innovations to a similar or a specialized audience, so suggestions about possible improvements could emerge and possibly new research or development projects could come out into view. 
 2. Present ideas that would require multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary efforts to be researched or developed in action-research programs. 
 3. Constituteinternational, multi- and/or inter-disciplinary teamsor workgroups in order to conduct research requiring synergic relationships among different kinds of talents, cognitive styles, intellectual faculties and/or research/industrial interests. 
 4. Create new research areas, based on both: a general framework and various disciplines or focused research areas. This could be done by means of international research teamwork and/or by the elaboration and edition of a multiple-authors book in the Newly Created Field. The newly created Informing Sciences Field is one example on this issue. Our past conferences served to support the initial efforts of their proponents, and now the group has its own yearly conference, newsletter, etc. 
 Invited Sessions can be organized in a specific or a general theme. These Invited Sessions may grow to Focus Symposia, workshops, satellite events, micro-conferences or even conferences by their own in the context of WMSCI or as independent or associated spin offs from WMSCI. At least two independent yearly conferences and several associated conferences are actually spin offs from WMSCI conferences. 
 Organizational, Reviewing, and Selection of Best Papers Policies 
 Virtual sessions 
 Face-to-face sessions of all events will have associated virtual pre- and post-conference sessions where registered participants can comment each paper in a forum associated to it. Registered participant at any event will have a password to access any virtual session of any collocated event. 
 Technical Keynote Speakers 
 Technical keynote speakers will be selected from early submissions because this selection requires an additional evaluation according to the quality of the paper, assessed by its reviewers, the authors' CV and the paper's topic. 
 Reviewing Process 
 All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, and (3) participative peer reviews. Final acceptance depends of the three kinds of reviews but a paper should be recommended by non-blind reviewers AND blind reviewers in order to be accepted for presentation at the conference and to be included in the respective conference proceedings. A recommendation to accept made by non-blind reviewers is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient one. A submission, to be accepted, should also have a majority of its double-blind reviewers recommending its acceptance. This double necessary conditions generate a more reliable and rigorous reviewing than a those reviewing methods based on just one of the indicated methods, or just on the traditional double-blind reviewing. More details regarding this issue can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/PeerReviewing.asp. 
 The three kinds of reviews mentioned above will support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details regarding the Acceptance Policy can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/AcceptancePolicy.asp. 
 Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions. 
 Virtual Participation 
 Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing process and the accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings. 
 Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic forums) will be held for each session included in the conference program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and authors presenting at the same session can interact three days before and during the conference, as well as up to three weeks after the conference is over. Authors can also participate in peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions. | There are many goodfocusedconferences in any one of the major themes of WMSCI Conferences.

 4. Create new research areas, based on both: a general framework and various disciplines or focused research areas. This could be done by means of international research teamwork and/or by the elaboration and edition of a multiple-authors book in the Newly Created Field. The newly created Informing Sciences Field is one example on this issue. Our past conferences served to support the initial efforts of their proponents, and now the group has its own yearly conference, newsletter, etc. 
 Invited Sessions can be organized in a specific or a general theme. These Invited Sessions may grow to Focus Symposia, workshops, satellite events, micro-conferences or even conferences by their own in the context of WMSCI or as independent or associated spin offs from WMSCI. At least two independent yearly conferences and several associated conferences are actually spin offs from WMSCI conferences. 
 Organizational, Reviewing, and Selection of Best Papers Policies 
 Virtual sessions 
 Face-to-face sessions of all events will have associated virtual pre- and post-conference sessions where registered participants can comment each paper in a forum associated to it. Registered participant at any event will have a password to access any virtual session of any collocated event. 
 Technical Keynote Speakers 
 Technical keynote speakers will be selected from early submissions because this selection requires an additional evaluation according to the quality of the paper, assessed by its reviewers, the authors' CV and the paper's topic. 
 Reviewing Process 
 All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, and (3) participative peer reviews. Final acceptance depends of the three kinds of reviews but a paper should be recommended by non-blind reviewers AND blind reviewers in order to be accepted for presentation at the conference and to be included in the respective conference proceedings. A recommendation to accept made by non-blind reviewers is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient one. A submission, to be accepted, should also have a majority of its double-blind reviewers recommending its acceptance. This double necessary conditions generate a more reliable and rigorous reviewing than a those reviewing methods based on just one of the indicated methods, or just on the traditional double-blind reviewing. More details regarding this issue can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/PeerReviewing.asp. 
 The three kinds of reviews mentioned above will support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details regarding the Acceptance Policy can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/AcceptancePolicy.asp. 
 Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions. 
 Virtual Participation 
 Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing process and the accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings. 
 Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic forums) will be held for each session included in the conference program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and authors presenting at the same session can interact three days before and during the conference, as well as up to three weeks after the conference is over. Authors can also participate in peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions. 
 There are many goodfocusedconferences in any one of the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also very good conferences even in the morespecificareas included in the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also goodgeneralconferences, which have a wider scope and are more comprehensive. Each one of these kinds of conferences has its typical audience. WMSCI 2025 will bring together both kinds of audiences, so participants, with a focused research, will be able to: 
 1. Present their focused research in a specific area for scholars/researchersspecializedin their paper discipline and, perhaps, for specialists from otherrelated disciplinesandgeneralistswith a more comprehensive intellectual outlook. 
 2. Get feedback from researchers with the same specific background, as is usual in focused conferences. 
 3. Get possible feedback from scholars/researchers in related disciplines, thereby opening the possibility ofanalogies generation,newapplicationsto/from different disciplines, business or industrial areas; and, possibly,new modelsfor re-thinking anew some of their research problems. 
 4. Organize sessions where papers from related areas are presented, in order to increase the probability of getting the benefits mentioned in (3). 
 5. Attract speakers with a wider intellectual interest in order to get a more comprehensive conceptual framework and to give context to their research effort. 
 This would allow specialists and focused researchers, to see the forest besides the tree of their discipline, and to be aware about the neighboring trees. 
 WMSCI 2025 participants, with non-focused or multi-focused research or with a comprehensive intellectual, industrial or business interest, will be able to: 
 1. Present their research, ideas, reflections, new concepts/designs or industrial/business innovations to a similar or a specialized audience, so suggestions about possible improvements could emerge and possibly new research or development projects could come out into view. 
 2. Present ideas that would require multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary efforts to be researched or developed in action-research programs.

A recommendation to accept made by non-blind reviewers is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient one. A submission, to be accepted, should also have a majority of its double-blind reviewers recommending its acceptance. This double necessary conditions generate a more reliable and rigorous reviewing than a those reviewing methods based on just one of the indicated methods, or just on the traditional double-blind reviewing. More details regarding this issue can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/PeerReviewing.asp. 
 The three kinds of reviews mentioned above will support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details regarding the Acceptance Policy can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/AcceptancePolicy.asp. 
 Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions. 
 Virtual Participation 
 Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing process and the accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings. 
 Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic forums) will be held for each session included in the conference program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and authors presenting at the same session can interact three days before and during the conference, as well as up to three weeks after the conference is over. Authors can also participate in peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions. | Why WMSCI 2025? | There are many goodfocusedconferences in any one of the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also very good conferences even in the morespecificareas included in the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also goodgeneralconferences, which have a wider scope and are more comprehensive. Each one of these kinds of conferences has its typical audience. WMSCI 2025 will bring together both kinds of audiences, so participants, with a focused research, will be able to: 
 1. Present their focused research in a specific area for scholars/researchersspecializedin their paper discipline and, perhaps, for specialists from otherrelated disciplinesandgeneralistswith a more comprehensive intellectual outlook. 
 2. Get feedback from researchers with the same specific background, as is usual in focused conferences. 
 3. Get possible feedback from scholars/researchers in related disciplines, thereby opening the possibility ofanalogies generation,newapplicationsto/from different disciplines, business or industrial areas; and, possibly,new modelsfor re-thinking anew some of their research problems. 
 4. Organize sessions where papers from related areas are presented, in order to increase the probability of getting the benefits mentioned in (3). 
 5. Attract speakers with a wider intellectual interest in order to get a more comprehensive conceptual framework and to give context to their research effort. 
 This would allow specialists and focused researchers, to see the forest besides the tree of their discipline, and to be aware about the neighboring trees. 
 WMSCI 2025 participants, with non-focused or multi-focused research or with a comprehensive intellectual, industrial or business interest, will be able to: 
 1. Present their research, ideas, reflections, new concepts/designs or industrial/business innovations to a similar or a specialized audience, so suggestions about possible improvements could emerge and possibly new research or development projects could come out into view. 
 2. Present ideas that would require multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary efforts to be researched or developed in action-research programs. 
 3. Constituteinternational, multi- and/or inter-disciplinary teamsor workgroups in order to conduct research requiring synergic relationships among different kinds of talents, cognitive styles, intellectual faculties and/or research/industrial interests. 
 4. Create new research areas, based on both: a general framework and various disciplines or focused research areas. This could be done by means of international research teamwork and/or by the elaboration and edition of a multiple-authors book in the Newly Created Field. The newly created Informing Sciences Field is one example on this issue. Our past conferences served to support the initial efforts of their proponents, and now the group has its own yearly conference, newsletter, etc. 
 Invited Sessions can be organized in a specific or a general theme. These Invited Sessions may grow to Focus Symposia, workshops, satellite events, micro-conferences or even conferences by their own in the context of WMSCI or as independent or associated spin offs from WMSCI. At least two independent yearly conferences and several associated conferences are actually spin offs from WMSCI conferences. 
 Organizational, Reviewing, and Selection of Best Papers Policies 
 Virtual sessions 
 Face-to-face sessions of all events will have associated virtual pre- and post-conference sessions where registered participants can comment each paper in a forum associated to it. Registered participant at any event will have a password to access any virtual session of any collocated event. 
 Technical Keynote Speakers 
 Technical keynote speakers will be selected from early submissions because this selection requires an additional evaluation according to the quality of the paper, assessed by its reviewers, the authors' CV and the paper's topic.

Authors can also participate in peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions. | There are many goodfocusedconferences in any one of the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also very good conferences even in the morespecificareas included in the major themes of WMSCI Conferences. There are also goodgeneralconferences, which have a wider scope and are more comprehensive. Each one of these kinds of conferences has its typical audience. WMSCI 2025 will bring together both kinds of audiences, so participants, with a focused research, will be able to: 
 1. Present their focused research in a specific area for scholars/researchersspecializedin their paper discipline and, perhaps, for specialists from otherrelated disciplinesandgeneralistswith a more comprehensive intellectual outlook. 
 2. Get feedback from researchers with the same specific background, as is usual in focused conferences. 
 3. Get possible feedback from scholars/researchers in related disciplines, thereby opening the possibility ofanalogies generation,newapplicationsto/from different disciplines, business or industrial areas; and, possibly,new modelsfor re-thinking anew some of their research problems. 
 4. Organize sessions where papers from related areas are presented, in order to increase the probability of getting the benefits mentioned in (3). 
 5. Attract speakers with a wider intellectual interest in order to get a more comprehensive conceptual framework and to give context to their research effort. 
 This would allow specialists and focused researchers, to see the forest besides the tree of their discipline, and to be aware about the neighboring trees. 
 WMSCI 2025 participants, with non-focused or multi-focused research or with a comprehensive intellectual, industrial or business interest, will be able to: 
 1. Present their research, ideas, reflections, new concepts/designs or industrial/business innovations to a similar or a specialized audience, so suggestions about possible improvements could emerge and possibly new research or development projects could come out into view. 
 2. Present ideas that would require multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary efforts to be researched or developed in action-research programs. 
 3. Constituteinternational, multi- and/or inter-disciplinary teamsor workgroups in order to conduct research requiring synergic relationships among different kinds of talents, cognitive styles, intellectual faculties and/or research/industrial interests. 
 4. Create new research areas, based on both: a general framework and various disciplines or focused research areas. This could be done by means of international research teamwork and/or by the elaboration and edition of a multiple-authors book in the Newly Created Field. The newly created Informing Sciences Field is one example on this issue. Our past conferences served to support the initial efforts of their proponents, and now the group has its own yearly conference, newsletter, etc. 
 Invited Sessions can be organized in a specific or a general theme. These Invited Sessions may grow to Focus Symposia, workshops, satellite events, micro-conferences or even conferences by their own in the context of WMSCI or as independent or associated spin offs from WMSCI. At least two independent yearly conferences and several associated conferences are actually spin offs from WMSCI conferences. 
 Organizational, Reviewing, and Selection of Best Papers Policies 
 Virtual sessions 
 Face-to-face sessions of all events will have associated virtual pre- and post-conference sessions where registered participants can comment each paper in a forum associated to it. Registered participant at any event will have a password to access any virtual session of any collocated event. 
 Technical Keynote Speakers 
 Technical keynote speakers will be selected from early submissions because this selection requires an additional evaluation according to the quality of the paper, assessed by its reviewers, the authors' CV and the paper's topic. 
 Reviewing Process 
 All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, and (3) participative peer reviews. Final acceptance depends of the three kinds of reviews but a paper should be recommended by non-blind reviewers AND blind reviewers in order to be accepted for presentation at the conference and to be included in the respective conference proceedings. A recommendation to accept made by non-blind reviewers is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient one. A submission, to be accepted, should also have a majority of its double-blind reviewers recommending its acceptance. This double necessary conditions generate a more reliable and rigorous reviewing than a those reviewing methods based on just one of the indicated methods, or just on the traditional double-blind reviewing. More details regarding this issue can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/PeerReviewing.asp. 
 The three kinds of reviews mentioned above will support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details regarding the Acceptance Policy can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/AcceptancePolicy.asp. 
 Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions.

 WMSCI 2025 participants, with non-focused or multi-focused research or with a comprehensive intellectual, industrial or business interest, will be able to: 
 1. Present their research, ideas, reflections, new concepts/designs or industrial/business innovations to a similar or a specialized audience, so suggestions about possible improvements could emerge and possibly new research or development projects could come out into view. 
 2. Present ideas that would require multi-disciplinary or interdisciplinary efforts to be researched or developed in action-research programs. 
 3. Constituteinternational, multi- and/or inter-disciplinary teamsor workgroups in order to conduct research requiring synergic relationships among different kinds of talents, cognitive styles, intellectual faculties and/or research/industrial interests. 
 4. Create new research areas, based on both: a general framework and various disciplines or focused research areas. This could be done by means of international research teamwork and/or by the elaboration and edition of a multiple-authors book in the Newly Created Field. The newly created Informing Sciences Field is one example on this issue. Our past conferences served to support the initial efforts of their proponents, and now the group has its own yearly conference, newsletter, etc. 
 Invited Sessions can be organized in a specific or a general theme. These Invited Sessions may grow to Focus Symposia, workshops, satellite events, micro-conferences or even conferences by their own in the context of WMSCI or as independent or associated spin offs from WMSCI. At least two independent yearly conferences and several associated conferences are actually spin offs from WMSCI conferences. 
 Organizational, Reviewing, and Selection of Best Papers Policies 
 Virtual sessions 
 Face-to-face sessions of all events will have associated virtual pre- and post-conference sessions where registered participants can comment each paper in a forum associated to it. Registered participant at any event will have a password to access any virtual session of any collocated event. 
 Technical Keynote Speakers 
 Technical keynote speakers will be selected from early submissions because this selection requires an additional evaluation according to the quality of the paper, assessed by its reviewers, the authors' CV and the paper's topic. 
 Reviewing Process 
 All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, and (3) participative peer reviews. Final acceptance depends of the three kinds of reviews but a paper should be recommended by non-blind reviewers AND blind reviewers in order to be accepted for presentation at the conference and to be included in the respective conference proceedings. A recommendation to accept made by non-blind reviewers is a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient one. A submission, to be accepted, should also have a majority of its double-blind reviewers recommending its acceptance. This double necessary conditions generate a more reliable and rigorous reviewing than a those reviewing methods based on just one of the indicated methods, or just on the traditional double-blind reviewing. More details regarding this issue can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/PeerReviewing.asp. 
 The three kinds of reviews mentioned above will support the selection process of those papers/abstracts that will be accepted for their presentation at the conference, as well as those to be selected for their publication in JSCI Journal. Details regarding the Acceptance Policy can be found athttps://www.iiis.org/iiis/AcceptancePolicy.asp. 
 Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions. 
 Virtual Participation 
 Submissions for Face-to-Face or for Virtual Participation are both accepted. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing process and the accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings. 
 Pre-Conference and Post-conference Virtual sessions (via electronic forums) will be held for each session included in the conference program, so that sessions papers can be read before the conference, and authors presenting at the same session can interact three days before and during the conference, as well as up to three weeks after the conference is over. Authors can also participate in peer-to-peer reviewing in virtual sessions.

Multi-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions 
  
 AMulti-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions sent to aMulti- andInter-Disciplinary ConferenceConsidering the multi- and inter-disciplinary nature of WMSCI 2025 and the fact that there are different kinds of epistemological values, disciplinary rigors, reviewing standards, and conference organizational models, the WMSCI 2025's Organizing Committee considered as highly desirable to have different kinds of submissions to the conference with different methods of their respective reviewing. Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FC. | An Abstract written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication (300-600 words), for face-to-face participation (authors may suggest up to 3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 Authors should fulfill certain requirements for each of these five options as indicated below: 
 href="../Submission/SubmissionFA.asp?vc=1&types=4" - FA.
href="../Submission/SubmissionFA.asp?vc=1&types=4" - Full Draft papers
(2000-5000 words) submitted for their presentation at the conference and for inclusion in the conference proceedings. This kind of submissions will be reviewed by aModified Kaplan's Method, where the submission's author should suggest at least two scholars (and up to three), researchers and/or professionals for theopen, non-blindreview of his/her paper. Each paper will also be sent to at least 3 reviewers for itsdouble-blindreview as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviews: Non-blind and double-blind ones.

href="../Submission/SubmissionFC.asp?vc=1&types=1" - Abstracts, written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication
(300-600 words), may be submitted for presentation at the conference and for inclusion in the conference proceedings. The purpose the Organizing Committee seeks by allowing this kind of submissions is to foster communications among different knowledge domains, different disciplines, and different kinds of experiences, as for example between academic and corporate knowledge/experience. Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines. Analogical thinking is suggested for these articles as complement of the usual logical-disciplinary one. Consequently, this kind of articles may contain inter-disciplinary analogies, expressional metaphors, analogical inferences, communicational analogies, analogy-based hypothesis formulations, design proposals, etc.Authors submittingAbstractsmay suggest up to 3 scholars, researchers, or professionals for open, non-blind reviewing of their respective abstract. Each abstract will also be sent to at least three reviewers for its double-blind reviewing as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviewing: non-blind and double-blind. The submission should be similar to the abstracts or introductions usually written at the beginning of a full paper, containing "a scholarly [or a professional] exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work" (as it is indicated for submissions to be made to the Annual IEEE Symposia on Foundations of Computer Science: FOCS).href="../Submission/SubmissionVA.asp?vc=1&types=6" - VA.

 AMulti-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions sent to aMulti- andInter-Disciplinary ConferenceConsidering the multi- and inter-disciplinary nature of WMSCI 2025 and the fact that there are different kinds of epistemological values, disciplinary rigors, reviewing standards, and conference organizational models, the WMSCI 2025's Organizing Committee considered as highly desirable to have different kinds of submissions to the conference with different methods of their respective reviewing. Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below):

 AMulti-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions sent to aMulti- andInter-Disciplinary ConferenceConsidering the multi- and inter-disciplinary nature of WMSCI 2025 and the fact that there are different kinds of epistemological values, disciplinary rigors, reviewing standards, and conference organizational models, the WMSCI 2025's Organizing Committee considered as highly desirable to have different kinds of submissions to the conference with different methods of their respective reviewing. Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers)

Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers)

Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers)

Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers)

The purpose the Organizing Committee seeks by allowing this kind of submissions is to foster communications among different knowledge domains, different disciplines, and different kinds of experiences, as for example between academic and corporate knowledge/experience. Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines. Analogical thinking is suggested for these articles as complement of the usual logical-disciplinary one. Consequently, this kind of articles may contain inter-disciplinary analogies, expressional metaphors, analogical inferences, communicational analogies, analogy-based hypothesis formulations, design proposals, etc.Authors submittingAbstractsmay suggest up to 3 scholars, researchers, or professionals for open, non-blind reviewing of their respective abstract. Each abstract will also be sent to at least three reviewers for its double-blind reviewing as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviewing: non-blind and double-blind.

Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers)

Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines.

 AMulti-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions sent to aMulti- andInter-Disciplinary ConferenceConsidering the multi- and inter-disciplinary nature of WMSCI 2025 and the fact that there are different kinds of epistemological values, disciplinary rigors, reviewing standards, and conference organizational models, the WMSCI 2025's Organizing Committee considered as highly desirable to have different kinds of submissions to the conference with different methods of their respective reviewing. Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FC. | An Abstract written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication (300-600 words), for face-to-face participation (authors may suggest up to 3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 Authors should fulfill certain requirements for each of these five options as indicated below: 
 href="../Submission/SubmissionFA.asp?vc=1&types=4" - FA.
href="../Submission/SubmissionFA.asp?vc=1&types=4" - Full Draft papers
(2000-5000 words) submitted for their presentation at the conference and for inclusion in the conference proceedings. This kind of submissions will be reviewed by aModified Kaplan's Method, where the submission's author should suggest at least two scholars (and up to three), researchers and/or professionals for theopen, non-blindreview of his/her paper. Each paper will also be sent to at least 3 reviewers for itsdouble-blindreview as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviews: Non-blind and double-blind ones.

href="../Submission/SubmissionFC.asp?vc=1&types=1" - Abstracts, written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication
(300-600 words), may be submitted for presentation at the conference and for inclusion in the conference proceedings. The purpose the Organizing Committee seeks by allowing this kind of submissions is to foster communications among different knowledge domains, different disciplines, and different kinds of experiences, as for example between academic and corporate knowledge/experience. Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines. Analogical thinking is suggested for these articles as complement of the usual logical-disciplinary one. Consequently, this kind of articles may contain inter-disciplinary analogies, expressional metaphors, analogical inferences, communicational analogies, analogy-based hypothesis formulations, design proposals, etc.Authors submittingAbstractsmay suggest up to 3 scholars, researchers, or professionals for open, non-blind reviewing of their respective abstract. Each abstract will also be sent to at least three reviewers for its double-blind reviewing as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviewing: non-blind and double-blind. The submission should be similar to the abstracts or introductions usually written at the beginning of a full paper, containing "a scholarly [or a professional] exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work" (as it is indicated for submissions to be made to the Annual IEEE Symposia on Foundations of Computer Science: FOCS).href="../Submission/SubmissionVA.asp?vc=1&types=6" - VA.

 AMulti-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions sent to aMulti- andInter-Disciplinary ConferenceConsidering the multi- and inter-disciplinary nature of WMSCI 2025 and the fact that there are different kinds of epistemological values, disciplinary rigors, reviewing standards, and conference organizational models, the WMSCI 2025's Organizing Committee considered as highly desirable to have different kinds of submissions to the conference with different methods of their respective reviewing. Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FC. | An Abstract written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication (300-600 words), for face-to-face participation (authors may suggest up to 3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 Authors should fulfill certain requirements for each of these five options as indicated below: 
 href="../Submission/SubmissionFA.asp?vc=1&types=4" - FA.
href="../Submission/SubmissionFA.asp?vc=1&types=4" - Full Draft papers
(2000-5000 words) submitted for their presentation at the conference and for inclusion in the conference proceedings. This kind of submissions will be reviewed by aModified Kaplan's Method, where the submission's author should suggest at least two scholars (and up to three), researchers and/or professionals for theopen, non-blindreview of his/her paper. Each paper will also be sent to at least 3 reviewers for itsdouble-blindreview as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviews: Non-blind and double-blind ones.

href="../Submission/SubmissionFC.asp?vc=1&types=1" - Abstracts, written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication
(300-600 words), may be submitted for presentation at the conference and for inclusion in the conference proceedings. The purpose the Organizing Committee seeks by allowing this kind of submissions is to foster communications among different knowledge domains, different disciplines, and different kinds of experiences, as for example between academic and corporate knowledge/experience. Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines. Analogical thinking is suggested for these articles as complement of the usual logical-disciplinary one. Consequently, this kind of articles may contain inter-disciplinary analogies, expressional metaphors, analogical inferences, communicational analogies, analogy-based hypothesis formulations, design proposals, etc.Authors submittingAbstractsmay suggest up to 3 scholars, researchers, or professionals for open, non-blind reviewing of their respective abstract. Each abstract will also be sent to at least three reviewers for its double-blind reviewing as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviewing: non-blind and double-blind. The submission should be similar to the abstracts or introductions usually written at the beginning of a full paper, containing "a scholarly [or a professional] exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work" (as it is indicated for submissions to be made to the Annual IEEE Symposia on Foundations of Computer Science: FOCS).href="../Submission/SubmissionVA.asp?vc=1&types=6" - VA.

 AMulti-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions sent to aMulti- andInter-Disciplinary ConferenceConsidering the multi- and inter-disciplinary nature of WMSCI 2025 and the fact that there are different kinds of epistemological values, disciplinary rigors, reviewing standards, and conference organizational models, the WMSCI 2025's Organizing Committee considered as highly desirable to have different kinds of submissions to the conference with different methods of their respective reviewing. Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FC. | An Abstract written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication (300-600 words), for face-to-face participation (authors may suggest up to 3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers)

Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines.

 AMulti-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions sent to aMulti- andInter-Disciplinary ConferenceConsidering the multi- and inter-disciplinary nature of WMSCI 2025 and the fact that there are different kinds of epistemological values, disciplinary rigors, reviewing standards, and conference organizational models, the WMSCI 2025's Organizing Committee considered as highly desirable to have different kinds of submissions to the conference with different methods of their respective reviewing. Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FC. | An Abstract written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication (300-600 words), for face-to-face participation (authors may suggest up to 3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers)

The purpose the Organizing Committee seeks by allowing this kind of submissions is to foster communications among different knowledge domains, different disciplines, and different kinds of experiences, as for example between academic and corporate knowledge/experience. Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines. Analogical thinking is suggested for these articles as complement of the usual logical-disciplinary one. Consequently, this kind of articles may contain inter-disciplinary analogies, expressional metaphors, analogical inferences, communicational analogies, analogy-based hypothesis formulations, design proposals, etc.Authors submittingAbstractsmay suggest up to 3 scholars, researchers, or professionals for open, non-blind reviewing of their respective abstract. Each abstract will also be sent to at least three reviewers for its double-blind reviewing as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviewing: non-blind and double-blind.

 VB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) | Multi-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions | AMulti-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions sent to aMulti- andInter-Disciplinary ConferenceConsidering the multi- and inter-disciplinary nature of WMSCI 2025 and the fact that there are different kinds of epistemological values, disciplinary rigors, reviewing standards, and conference organizational models, the WMSCI 2025's Organizing Committee considered as highly desirable to have different kinds of submissions to the conference with different methods of their respective reviewing. Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers)

The purpose the Organizing Committee seeks by allowing this kind of submissions is to foster communications among different knowledge domains, different disciplines, and different kinds of experiences, as for example between academic and corporate knowledge/experience. Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines. Analogical thinking is suggested for these articles as complement of the usual logical-disciplinary one. Consequently, this kind of articles may contain inter-disciplinary analogies, expressional metaphors, analogical inferences, communicational analogies, analogy-based hypothesis formulations, design proposals, etc.Authors submittingAbstractsmay suggest up to 3 scholars, researchers, or professionals for open, non-blind reviewing of their respective abstract.

Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FC. | An Abstract written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication (300-600 words), for face-to-face participation (authors may suggest up to 3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 Authors should fulfill certain requirements for each of these five options as indicated below:

(2000-5000 words) submitted for their presentation at the conference and for inclusion in the conference proceedings. This kind of submissions will be reviewed by aModified Kaplan's Method, where the submission's author should suggest at least two scholars (and up to three), researchers and/or professionals for theopen, non-blindreview of his/her paper. Each paper will also be sent to at least 3 reviewers for itsdouble-blindreview as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviews: Non-blind and double-blind ones.

href="../Submission/SubmissionFC.asp?vc=1&types=1" - Abstracts, written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication
(300-600 words), may be submitted for presentation at the conference and for inclusion in the conference proceedings. The purpose the Organizing Committee seeks by allowing this kind of submissions is to foster communications among different knowledge domains, different disciplines, and different kinds of experiences, as for example between academic and corporate knowledge/experience. Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines. Analogical thinking is suggested for these articles as complement of the usual logical-disciplinary one. Consequently, this kind of articles may contain inter-disciplinary analogies, expressional metaphors, analogical inferences, communicational analogies, analogy-based hypothesis formulations, design proposals, etc.Authors submittingAbstractsmay suggest up to 3 scholars, researchers, or professionals for open, non-blind reviewing of their respective abstract. Each abstract will also be sent to at least three reviewers for its double-blind reviewing as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviewing: non-blind and double-blind. The submission should be similar to the abstracts or introductions usually written at the beginning of a full paper, containing "a scholarly [or a professional] exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work" (as it is indicated for submissions to be made to the Annual IEEE Symposia on Foundations of Computer Science: FOCS).href="../Submission/SubmissionVA.asp?vc=1&types=6" - VA.

Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model.

 Multi-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions 
  
 AMulti-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions sent to aMulti- andInter-Disciplinary ConferenceConsidering the multi- and inter-disciplinary nature of WMSCI 2025 and the fact that there are different kinds of epistemological values, disciplinary rigors, reviewing standards, and conference organizational models, the WMSCI 2025's Organizing Committee considered as highly desirable to have different kinds of submissions to the conference with different methods of their respective reviewing. Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FC. | An Abstract written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication (300-600 words), for face-to-face participation (authors may suggest up to 3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 Authors should fulfill certain requirements for each of these five options as indicated below: 
 href="../Submission/SubmissionFA.asp?vc=1&types=4" - FA.
href="../Submission/SubmissionFA.asp?vc=1&types=4" - Full Draft papers
(2000-5000 words) submitted for their presentation at the conference and for inclusion in the conference proceedings. This kind of submissions will be reviewed by aModified Kaplan's Method, where the submission's author should suggest at least two scholars (and up to three), researchers and/or professionals for theopen, non-blindreview of his/her paper. Each paper will also be sent to at least 3 reviewers for itsdouble-blindreview as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviews: Non-blind and double-blind ones.

(300-600 words), may be submitted for presentation at the conference and for inclusion in the conference proceedings. The purpose the Organizing Committee seeks by allowing this kind of submissions is to foster communications among different knowledge domains, different disciplines, and different kinds of experiences, as for example between academic and corporate knowledge/experience. Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines. Analogical thinking is suggested for these articles as complement of the usual logical-disciplinary one. Consequently, this kind of articles may contain inter-disciplinary analogies, expressional metaphors, analogical inferences, communicational analogies, analogy-based hypothesis formulations, design proposals, etc.Authors submittingAbstractsmay suggest up to 3 scholars, researchers, or professionals for open, non-blind reviewing of their respective abstract. Each abstract will also be sent to at least three reviewers for its double-blind reviewing as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviewing: non-blind and double-blind.

Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers)

Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines. Analogical thinking is suggested for these articles as complement of the usual logical-disciplinary one. Consequently, this kind of articles may contain inter-disciplinary analogies, expressional metaphors, analogical inferences, communicational analogies, analogy-based hypothesis formulations, design proposals, etc.Authors submittingAbstractsmay suggest up to 3 scholars, researchers, or professionals for open, non-blind reviewing of their respective abstract. Each abstract will also be sent to at least three reviewers for its double-blind reviewing as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviewing: non-blind and double-blind. The submission should be similar to the abstracts or introductions usually written at the beginning of a full paper, containing "a scholarly [or a professional] exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work" (as it is indicated for submissions to be made to the Annual IEEE Symposia on Foundations of Computer Science: FOCS).href="../Submission/SubmissionVA.asp?vc=1&types=6" - VA.

Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers)

 AMulti-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions sent to aMulti- andInter-Disciplinary ConferenceConsidering the multi- and inter-disciplinary nature of WMSCI 2025 and the fact that there are different kinds of epistemological values, disciplinary rigors, reviewing standards, and conference organizational models, the WMSCI 2025's Organizing Committee considered as highly desirable to have different kinds of submissions to the conference with different methods of their respective reviewing. Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers)

 AMulti-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions sent to aMulti- andInter-Disciplinary ConferenceConsidering the multi- and inter-disciplinary nature of WMSCI 2025 and the fact that there are different kinds of epistemological values, disciplinary rigors, reviewing standards, and conference organizational models, the WMSCI 2025's Organizing Committee considered as highly desirable to have different kinds of submissions to the conference with different methods of their respective reviewing. Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FC. | An Abstract written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication (300-600 words), for face-to-face participation (authors may suggest up to 3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers)

Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines.

 Multi-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions 
 AMulti-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions sent to aMulti- andInter-Disciplinary ConferenceConsidering the multi- and inter-disciplinary nature of WMSCI 2025 and the fact that there are different kinds of epistemological values, disciplinary rigors, reviewing standards, and conference organizational models, the WMSCI 2025's Organizing Committee considered as highly desirable to have different kinds of submissions to the conference with different methods of their respective reviewing. Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FC. | An Abstract written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication (300-600 words), for face-to-face participation (authors may suggest up to 3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers)

(300-600 words), may be submitted for presentation at the conference and for inclusion in the conference proceedings. The purpose the Organizing Committee seeks by allowing this kind of submissions is to foster communications among different knowledge domains, different disciplines, and different kinds of experiences, as for example between academic and corporate knowledge/experience. Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines. Analogical thinking is suggested for these articles as complement of the usual logical-disciplinary one. Consequently, this kind of articles may contain inter-disciplinary analogies, expressional metaphors, analogical inferences, communicational analogies, analogy-based hypothesis formulations, design proposals, etc.Authors submittingAbstractsmay suggest up to 3 scholars, researchers, or professionals for open, non-blind reviewing of their respective abstract. Each abstract will also be sent to at least three reviewers for its double-blind reviewing as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviewing: non-blind and double-blind.

 VB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) | AMulti-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions sent to aMulti- andInter-Disciplinary ConferenceConsidering the multi- and inter-disciplinary nature of WMSCI 2025 and the fact that there are different kinds of epistemological values, disciplinary rigors, reviewing standards, and conference organizational models, the WMSCI 2025's Organizing Committee considered as highly desirable to have different kinds of submissions to the conference with different methods of their respective reviewing. Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers)

The purpose the Organizing Committee seeks by allowing this kind of submissions is to foster communications among different knowledge domains, different disciplines, and different kinds of experiences, as for example between academic and corporate knowledge/experience. Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines. Analogical thinking is suggested for these articles as complement of the usual logical-disciplinary one. Consequently, this kind of articles may contain inter-disciplinary analogies, expressional metaphors, analogical inferences, communicational analogies, analogy-based hypothesis formulations, design proposals, etc.Authors submittingAbstractsmay suggest up to 3 scholars, researchers, or professionals for open, non-blind reviewing of their respective abstract. Each abstract will also be sent to at least three reviewers for its double-blind reviewing as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviewing: non-blind and double-blind.

In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process. Consequently, authors will have different ways of making their submissions, and these ways will be highly related to different conference organizational models followed by prestigious scholar societies or suggested by highly cited authors.Three kinds of reviewing processes will be applied to submissions made for their presentation at the conference and their inclusion in the conference proceedings. These three kinds are: 1) double-blinded reviews; 2) open, non-blind reviews; and 3) participative peer-to-peer reviews by authors who made submissions to the same topic or area in the conference.Virtual ParticipationThinking of those scholars, researchers and professionals related with the conference topics but unable to attend it personally (usually due to insufficient funding for the traveling costs) aVirtual Participationmode has been established, with the same peer reviewing and validity than face-to-face ones.Submissions made for Virtual Participation will go trought the same reviewing processes of the regular papers (double-blind, non-blind, and participative peer reviewing) and, if accepted (according to the same acceptance policy), they will be included in the proceedings and will be eligible for journal publication,with no additional cost, if they are, according to their reviewers, among the best 25%-30% of those physically and virtually presented at the conference.Each regular session, included in the conference program, will be associated to a corresponding virtual session where all final versions of the articles to be presented will be displayed and authors can comment them via electronic forums. Registered authors of virtual participations will have access to all conference program sessions (and papers).Their article will be displayed as the regular ones. Virtual authors also have the option of sending, besides the final version of their article in a PDF document, an electronic presentation (PowerPoint, flash, etc. and/or a 15-20 minutes video).After paying the respective shipping and handling costs, registered authors of virtual participation, who have paid their registration fee, can get delivered the same conference material that the regular attendees receive at the registration desk.Registration fee is the same for face-to-face and virtual participation.Submission OptionsThere are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation. These options are the following (and are explained in more detail below): 
 FA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for face-to-face participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 FC. | An Abstract written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication (300-600 words), for face-to-face participation (authors may suggest up to 3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VA. | A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 2-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 VB. | An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for virtual participation (authors should suggest 1-3 non-anonymous reviewers) 
 Authors should fulfill certain requirements for each of these five options as indicated below:

href="../Submission/SubmissionFA.asp?vc=1&types=4" - Full Draft papers
(2000-5000 words) submitted for their presentation at the conference and for inclusion in the conference proceedings. This kind of submissions will be reviewed by aModified Kaplan's Method, where the submission's author should suggest at least two scholars (and up to three), researchers and/or professionals for theopen, non-blindreview of his/her paper. Each paper will also be sent to at least 3 reviewers for itsdouble-blindreview as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviews: Non-blind and double-blind ones.

href="../Submission/SubmissionFC.asp?vc=1&types=1" - Abstracts, written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication
(300-600 words), may be submitted for presentation at the conference and for inclusion in the conference proceedings. The purpose the Organizing Committee seeks by allowing this kind of submissions is to foster communications among different knowledge domains, different disciplines, and different kinds of experiences, as for example between academic and corporate knowledge/experience. Authors submitting abstracts for Inter-Disciplinary Communication should write both, the abstract and the full paper in a way as to be understood by scholars from other disciplines, i.e. they should be written in non-technical, non-disciplinary terms, and should clearly state the contributions the authors are making in their respective disciplinary or interdisciplinary field, and/or the potential impact of the article's content in other disciplines. Analogical thinking is suggested for these articles as complement of the usual logical-disciplinary one. Consequently, this kind of articles may contain inter-disciplinary analogies, expressional metaphors, analogical inferences, communicational analogies, analogy-based hypothesis formulations, design proposals, etc.Authors submittingAbstractsmay suggest up to 3 scholars, researchers, or professionals for open, non-blind reviewing of their respective abstract. Each abstract will also be sent to at least three reviewers for its double-blind reviewing as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviewing: non-blind and double-blind. The submission should be similar to the abstracts or introductions usually written at the beginning of a full paper, containing "a scholarly [or a professional] exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work" (as it is indicated for submissions to be made to the Annual IEEE Symposia on Foundations of Computer Science: FOCS).href="../Submission/SubmissionVA.asp?vc=1&types=6" - VA.

 AMulti-Methodological Approach for Reviewing Submissions sent to aMulti- andInter-Disciplinary ConferenceConsidering the multi- and inter-disciplinary nature of WMSCI 2025 and the fact that there are different kinds of epistemological values, disciplinary rigors, reviewing standards, and conference organizational models, the WMSCI 2025's Organizing Committee considered as highly desirable to have different kinds of submissions to the conference with different methods of their respective reviewing. Accordingly, submissions of draft papers will be differentiated from abstracts' submissions. Each kind of submission will have two different reviewing methods as well. Consequently, authors will have the opportunity to choose the way of submitting their paper that best fits their disciplinary rigor and their organization's requirements with regards to the conference organizational model. In any kind of submissionauthors should clearly indicate the contribution made by them.Accordingly, there will be different reviewing methods, going from the most formal one, to less formal methods followed by those who conceive the knowledge communication made through conferences as a more informal process.
