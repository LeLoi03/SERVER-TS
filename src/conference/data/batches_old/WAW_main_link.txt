 PreviousNextOverview 
 Virtually every human-technology interaction, or sensor network, generates observations that are in some relation with each other. As a result, many data science problems can be viewed as a study of some properties of complex networks in which nodes represent the entities that are being studied and edges represent relations between these entities. Such networks are often large-scale, decentralized, and evolve dynamically over time. Modeling and mining complex networks in order to understand the principles governing the organization and the behaviour of such networks is crucial for a broad range of fields of study, including information and social sciences, economics, biology, and neuroscience. 
 The aim of the20th Workshop on Modelling and Mining Networks (WAW 2025)is to further the understanding of networks that arise in theoretical as well as applied domains. The goal is also to stimulate the development of high-performance and scalable algorithms that exploit these networks. The workshop welcomes the researchers who are working on graph-theoretic and algorithmic aspects of networks represented as graphs or hypergraphs and other higher order structures. 
 WAW 2025will be held at theVilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.

Venue and Local Information 
 WAW 2025will take place at the Faculty of Philosophy, Vilnius University (Universiteto 9, Vilnius). The venue is conveniently located in the Old Town, within walking distance of numerous hotels. 
  
 Getting to Vilnius: 
 Vilnius is well-connected internationally via Vilnius Airport, located within the city. Alternatively, you can fly to Kaunas Airport (approximately 100 km from Vilnius) and either a shuttle bus to Vilnius (visitollex.lt/enfor details) or ask ChatGPT for help. Direct train connections are available from Warsaw, Krakow and Riga (visitltglink.lt), and there are also extensive international bus options (seeomio.com). 
  
 Getting around Vilnius: 
 For public transportation within the city, we recommend using the Trafi app or visitingstops.ltfor route planning. You can purchase a 60-minute ticket (allowing transfers) for €0.90 directly on buses or trolleybuses using a contactless bank card (see alsojudu.lt). Ride-hailing apps such as Bolt and Uber are widely available. For information on traditional taxis, visitGo Vilnius. 
  
 Official currency in Lithuania is Euro. Electronic payments with MasterCard and Visa are accepted in majority of shops and other points of interest. Currency exchange services are relatively uncommon. It is recommended to withdraw cash from ATMs operated by local banks, such as Šiaulių bankas, Citadele, Swedbank, Luminor, or SEB. 
  
 Within the European Economic Area (EEA), there are no mobile roaming charges. This means you can use your calls and data at domestic rates when using an EEA SIM card. Prepaid SIM cards (EZYS, LABAS, PILDYK) can be purchased at supermarkets and newsagents, but registration requires providing personal information. 
  
 Vilnius University was founded in 1579 by king Stephen Báthory of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth it was closed down in 1832 by Tsar Nikolas I of Russia after the November uprising. The university was reopened in 1919 and operates since then with a short break of 1943-1944, when it was closed by the Nazis. The first university campus shaped in the 16th century in an old city quarter is open for visitors.
