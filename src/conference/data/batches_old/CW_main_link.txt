 Publication Policy 
 By submitting a paper the authors confirm that their paper represents original previously unpublished work, and that if accepted, at least one of the authors will register for the conference and present the paper/poster. 
 CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS with all accepted papers are planned to be published by Conference Publishing Services (pending approval of CPS). Note that we require at least one non-student registration for each paper. This registration policy is not for each presenter : i.e., we require two registrations if a single presenter has talks for two papers. The accepted poster papers and posters will require a one-minute fast-forward oral presentation by the presenting author(s) who also have to display and present during the poster session a printed poster (A0 size). The poster authors are also encouraged to set up demos of their works. 
 JOURNAL PUBLICATION The extended version of best FULL papers will be considered for publication in special issues of journals. The information on journal publications of past CW conferences can be found athref="https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/assourin/CW/cw-conferences.htm" - https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/assourin/CW/cw-conferences.htm
