 Publication 
 All accepted DEXA2025 papers will be published by Springer in their Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). LNCS volumes are indexed in Scopus; EI Engineering Index; Google Scholar; DBLP; etc. and submitted for indexing in the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI), part of Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science. Selected high-quality papers, after revision and extension, will be invited to be published, in a special issue of Knowledge and Information Systems (KAIS), Springer (IF=3.2), and Data & Knowledge Engineering (DKE), Elsevier (IF=2.7). 
 Scope 
 Data engineering and data analytics have been important R&D areas for years, with applications in multiple sectors (e.g., finance, energy, manufacturing, health care, security), but there still exist unsolved research and technological issues. Data engineering techniques are widely applied to store and manage data. New types of highly heterogeneous data of large volumes (referred to as big data) created every second, require a continuous development of new techniques to handle these new types of data. On the one hand, more and more frequently, these techniques need to be supported by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, commonly called Artificial Intelligence (AI). These algorithms allow to provide solutions for difficult data management problems. Moreover, data science and data analytics rely on AI in the process of discovering dependency patterns, building complex prediction models, and processing natural language. On the other hand, data engineering techniques are indispensable for pre-processing data for AI. Thus, worlds of AI, data engineering, and data analytics are strongly interconnected. 
  
 Since 1990, DEXA has been an annual international conference which showcases state-of-the-art research activities in databases, data integration, advanced data anlytics, and knowledge systems. With the recent advances of big data and ML/AI DEXA covers these broad topics as well, to provide a forum to present research results and to examine advanced applications in the field. The conference and its associated workshops offer an opportunity for developers, scientists, and users to extensively discuss requirements, problems, and solutions in standard and just emerging research and technological topics on data and knowledge management.

 Submission Guidelines 
 DEXA 2025 follows asingle-blind reviewpolicy. Authors are invited to electronically submit original research contributions or experience reports in English. DEXA will accept submissions of both short (up to 6 pages) and full papers (up to 15 pages including references and appendixes). DEXA reserves the right to accept submitted full papers only as short papers, in which papers describe interesting and innovative ideas which still require further technical development. 
 Any submission that significantly exceeds length limits or deviates from formatting requirements may be rejected without review. Please refer tohref="./papers-submission.html" - paper submission
page. 
 Submission Procedure 
 Authors should first consulthref="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" - Springer’s authors’ instructions
and use the proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. 
 Papers submission will be managed usinghref="https://dexa2025.iiwas.org" - HotCRP
. To submit a paper, create an account or sign in if you already have an account. To create an account, you only need to enter a valid email address. You will receive an email with a link to change the password and fill in your name, affiliation, etc., You can start the submission process by clicking on "new submission". 
 Review Process 
 Submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. Duplicate submissions are not allowed and will be rejected immediately without further review. Authors are expected to agree to the following terms: "I understand that the submission must not overlap substantially with any other paper that I am a co-author of or that is currently submitted elsewhere. Furthermore, previously published papers with any overlap are cited prominently in this submission." 
 Questions about this policy or how it applies to a specific paper should be directed to the PC chairs. 
 Accepted Papers 
 All accepted conference papers will be published in a volume of "Lecture Notes in Computer Science" (LNCS) by Springer. Authors of all accepted papers must sign a Springer copyright release form. Papers are accepted with the understanding that at least one author will register for the conference to present the paper. Selected high-quality papers, after revision and extension, will be invited to be published, in a special issue of Knowledge and Information Systems (KAIS), Springer (IF=3.2), and Data & Knowledge Engineering (DKE), Elsevier (IF=2.7).
