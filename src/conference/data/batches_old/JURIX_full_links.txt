 In recent years, interest within the research community and the legal industry regarding technological advances in legal knowledge representation and processing has been growing. This relates to areas such as computational models of legal reasoning, cybersecurity, privacy, trust and blockchain methods, among other things. 
 This book presents the proceedings of JURIX 2022, the 35thInternational Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems, held from 14 –16 December in Saarbrücken, Germany, under the auspices of the Dutch Foundation for Legal Knowledge Based Systems and hosted by Saarland University. The annual JURIX conference has become an international forum for academics and professionals to exchange knowledge and experiences at the intersection of law and artificial intelligence (AI). For this edition, 62 submissions were received from 163 authors in 24 countries.Following a rigorous review process, carried out by a programme committee of 72 experts recognised in the field, 14 submissions were selected for publication as long papers, 22 as short papers and 5 as demo papers, making a total of 41 papers altogether and representing a 22.5% acceptance rate for long papers (66.1% overall). The broad array of topics covered includes argumentation and legal reasoning, legal ontologies and the semantic web, machine and deep learning and natural language processing for legal knowledge extraction, as well as argument mining, translation of legal texts, defeasible logic, legal compliance, explainable AI, alternative dispute resolution, legal drafting and smart contracts. 
 Providing an overview of recent advances, the book will be of interest to all those working at the interface between the law and AI.

 AI for Access to Justice Workshop – Jurix 2024 
 Over the last 2 years, we have seen an explosion of interest in applying artificial intelligence to help solve the biggest challenges in law. Yet many of the best tools remain out of reach of the practitioners on the front line of civil legal needs: legal aid workers and unrepresented litigants. 
 We invite legal technologists, researchers, and practitioners to join us inBrno, Czechia on December 11thfor a full-day,hybrid workshopon innovations in AI for helping close theaccess to justice gap: the majority of legal problems that go unsolved around the world because potential litigants lack the time, money, or ability to participate in court processes to solve their problems. 
 What is the access to justice gap? 
 Around the world, up tohref="https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/research-and-data/access-justice/measuring-justice-gap#:~:text=An%20estimated%205%20billion%20people,in%20extreme%20conditions%20of%20injustice." - 5 billion people have unmet legal needs
. This number represents the access to justice gap. The needs range from survivors of domestic violence, people navigating custody or the right to make basic decisions about their own wellbeing, to people facing eviction from their home, to others dealing with unfair treatment in accessing basic government services. 
 Approaches to close the access to justice gap range from offering direct legal representation to self-help and DIY solutions that can help individuals at scale. 
 Who 
 TheSuffolk LIT Labwill be collaborating withStanford’s Legal Design Laband thehref="https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/law/research/law-and-tech-lab" - Maastricht Law and Tech Lab
to lead the workshop. The workshop is part of the largerhref="https://jurix2024.law.muni.cz/" - Jurix 2024 conference
, hosted at Masaryk University in Brno, Czechia. 
 The workshop committee is: 
 Quinten Steenhuis, Suffolk University Law School 
 Margaret Hagan, Stanford Law School 
 Hannes Westermann, Maastricht University Faculty of Law 
 Submission format 
 We invite contributors to submit: 
 short papers (5-10 pages), or 
 proposals for demos or interactive workshop exercises 
 We welcome works in progress, although depending on interest, we will give a preference to complete ideas that can be evaluated, shared and discussed. 
 The focus of submissions should be on AI tools, datasets, and approaches, whetherlarge language models, traditionalmachine learning, orrules based systems, that solve the real world problems of unrepresented litigants or legal aid programs. Papers discussing the ethical implications, limits, and policy implications of AI in law are also welcome. 
 Other topics may include: 
 findings of research about how AI is affecting access to justice, 
 evaluation of AI models and tools intended to benefit access to justice, 
 outcomes of new interventions intended to deploy AI for access to justice, 
 proposals of future work to use AI or hold AI initiatives accountable, 
 principles & frameworks to guide work in this area, or 
 other topics related to AI & access to justice 
 Papers should follow the formatting instructions ofCEUR-WS. (ceurart) 
 Submissions will be subject to peer review with an aim to possible publication as a workshop proceeding. Submissions will be evaluated on overall quality, technical depth, relevance, and the diversity of topics to ensure an engaging and high quality workshop. 
 You can download templates for the ceurart style inhref="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/wqyfdgftmcfw" - LaTeX
