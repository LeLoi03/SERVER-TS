 Welcome to IVCNZ 2025 
 Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ)is a long-standing and leading international conference, focusing on all aspects of computer vision, image processing, computer graphics, virtual and augmented reality, visualization, and human-computer interaction (HCI) applications within these fields. 
 The40th International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ 2025)will be hosted in Wellington, New Zealand's vibrant capital, situated at the southern tip of the North Island. Nestled between a sparkling harbor and lush green hills, Wellington is celebrated for its rich arts, culture, and natural beauty. Visitors can enjoy Oriental Bay's beach, vibrant museums, cozy cafes, and exceptional coffee. Outdoor enthusiasts can enjoy mountain biking, sea kayaking, and scenic walks along the harbor and hills. The city is also a hub for innovation atTe Herenga Waka—Victoria University of Wellingtonand globally recognized creative technology companies like Weta Digital and Sidhe. 
 IVCNZ 2025will be held in a hybrid format, supporting both online and in-person participation. 
 Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. These proceedings will typically be indexed by leading databases, including Engineering Index (Compendex), ISI Proceedings/ISTP, and DBLP.

 In submitting a paper, the authors warrant that should the paper be accepted, the final paper will be prepared in time for inclusion into the published proceedings and that one of the authors will attend the conference and present the paper. The proceedings will be published after the conference – we endeavour to submit to IEEEXplore; the committee reserves the right to withdraw any paper from the proceedings that is not presented at the conference. 
 The conference will consist of a mix of oral and poster sessions. No distinction will be made between the two types of presentation in the proceedings: authors may request the type of presentation they consider most appropriate for their paper; however, the final decision will be made by the program committee.See the submission pagehref="https://ecs.wgtn.ac.nz/Events/IVCNZ2025/CallForPapers" - here
