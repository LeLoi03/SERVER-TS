 28th International Conference on Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering 
 General Information 
 FASE is concerned with the foundations on which software engineering is built. 
 Submissions should make novel contributions to making software engineering a more mature and soundly-based discipline. Contributions should be supported by appropriate arguments and validation. Contributions that combine the development of conceptual and methodological advances with their formal foundations and tool support are particularly encouraged. We welcome contributions to all such fundamental approaches, including: 
 applications of AI to software engineering, including search-based, learning-based approaches, and advances in code generation and program synthesis, automated testing and debugging, software documentation and program understanding intelligent code review and refactoring, DevOps and AIOps, and applications of large language models (LLMs). 
 software engineering foundations for AI-based systems, for example with focus on: explainability, transparency and trust, data management, testing and verification, lifecycle management, system architecture; 
 software quality and testing: validation and verification of functional and non-functional software properties ( including security and data privacy) using techniques such as theorem proving, model checking, testing, analysis simulation, refinement methods, metrics or visualization techniques; 
 software engineering as an engineering discipline, including its interaction with and impact on society and economics; 
 ethical and responsible software engineering: prioritizing fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI and software systems while addressing societal concerns like inequality and bias; 
 requirements engineering: capture, consistency, and change management of software requirements, natural language processing for requirement elicitation; 
 software architectures: description and analysis of the architecture, e.g., SOA, microservice architectures cloud-native architectures, event-driven architectures, model-driven architectures, or software product lines; 
 specification, design, and implementation of particular classes of systems: (self-)adaptive, autonomous collaborative, intelligent, embedded, distributed, mobile, pervasive, cyber-physical, data-centric, service-oriented applications, multi-agent systems, safety-critical, real-time, blockchain-based, mixed-reality systems human-in-the-loop systems or digital twins; 
 model-driven engineering: model transformation, meta-modelling, design and semantics of domain-specific languages consistency and synchronization of models, generative architectures, low-code and no-code development; 
 software processes: support for iterative, agile, and open source development; 
 software evolution: refactoring, reverse and re-engineering, configuration management and architectural change, mining software repositories.

 Submission Categories 
 FASE 2025 solicits four types of submissions: research papers, empirical evaluation papers, new ideas and emerging results (NIER) papers, tool demonstration papers and data showcase papers. Submissions must follow the formatting guidelines of Springer’s LNCS (use the llncs.cls class) and be submitted electronically in pdf through thehref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fase2025" - Easychair author interface
. 
 Research papersclearly identify and justify a principled advance to the fundamentals of software engineering. Research papers should clearly articulate their contribution, and provide sufficient evidence for the soundness and applicability of the proposed approach. Research papers are expected to be 15–18 pp (excluding bibliography). Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version may be included in a clearly marked appendix. 
 Empirical evaluation papersevaluate existing software challenges or critically validate current proposed solutions with scientific means, i.e., by empirical studies, controlled experiments, rigorous case studies, simulations, etc. Scientific reflection on problems and practices in the software industry also falls into this category. We also encourage authors to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper, but should at least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs, and clearly report on results that the authors were able to replicate as well as on aspects of the work that were not replicable. Empirical evaluation papers are expected to be 15–18 pp (excluding bibliography). Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version may be included in a clearly marked appendix. 
 New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) papersseek to disrupt the status quo with forward-looking, thought-provoking innovative research on the foundations of software engineering, as well as lessons learned from the past. Our aim is to accelerate the exposure of the ETAPS community to early yet potentially ground-breaking research results, and to techniques and perspectives that challenge the status quo. To broadly capture this goal, the NIER track at FASE 2025 will publish the following types of papers: 
 Innovative or groundbreaking new ideas at early stages of research, supported by promising initial results and intuitions; 
 Visions of new directions: synergies with other fields or foundational approaches to problems that currently lack foundations in software engineering; 
 Lessons from the past: thoughtful observations on past or current research directions that may be somehow misguided or that let us see current research directions from a new perspective. 
 NIER papers are expected to be 6–8 pp (excluding bibliography). NIER papers will be assessed primarily on their level of originality, relevance, and potential for impact on the field in terms of promoting innovative thinking. Hence inadequacies in the state-of-the-art and the pertinence, correctness, and impact of the idea/vision/lesson must be described clearly. A full evaluation is not required for FASE NIER papers, but preliminary evaluation results may help the reviewers understand the scope of the work better. 
 Tool demonstration papersanddata showcase paperspresent a new tool, a new tool component, novel extensions to an existing tool, or a new dataset. They should provide a short description of the theoretical foundations and emphasize the design and implementation concerns, including software architecture. Tool papers should give a clear account of the tool’s functionality and discuss the tool’s practical capabilities with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their tools publicly available, preferably on the web. Experimental evaluation is not required for tools, however, a motivation as to why the tool is interesting and significant should be provided. Dataset papers should describe the curation of datasets essential for software engineering research, replication studies, reporting of negative results, and insights gleaned from mining software repositories. Papers in this category are expected to be 6–8 pp (excluding bibliography). They should have an appendix of up to 6 additional pages with details on the actual demonstration.

 FASE is an established series of international conferences on Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering with more than 30 years of tradition. 
 Conference Name and History 
 FASE has assumed its current name and format in 1998, when the ETAPS conferences have been created. 
 The first FASE was held in Lisbon, chaired by professor Egidio Astesiano at ETAPS 1998. However, FASE is older than ETAPS. The acronym FASE was first used in 1993 but with a different meaning than today. FASE builds on the traditions ofColloquim on Software Engineering(CSE), of theAdvanced Seminar on Foundations of Innovative Software Development, and theColloquium on Formal Approaches of Software Engineering(FASE!) organized as part of the TAPSOFT brand until 1997. The European Association of Software Science and Technology (EASST) was the driving force behind creating and developing FASE. 
 Scope of Interest 
 FASE has a broad scope of interest. 
 As the field of the Software Engineering is broad, the scope of FASE is broad as well, including requirements, design architecture, modeling, refactoring, software transformation, generation and synthesis, test verification, validation, development methods and processes (agile), and so on. Thanks to its origins FASE has been traditionally focused primarily on formal models and methods, often involving reasoning about code, design, and the associated processes. However, these are not the only topics of interest. Agile methods, object-orientation search-based software engineering have been discussed in the past. Crucially, the letter “F” in FASE stands for “fundamental” not formal, and all research asking basic foundational questions about developing software is welcomed. 
 FASE is strongly affected by new developments in the technical landscape: AI and machine learning, security, block chain, quantum computing. FASE will continue to shift its interest along with the needs of the society and the interests of the research community. Wherever we go, we will continue asking what are the principles of developing systems in these areas, and what techniques help to reason about them, supporting new engineering methods and tools. 
 25 Anniversary Celebration 
 In 2022, FASE celebrated its 25 anniversary. Watch the talk of Gabriele Taentzer and Eduard Kamburjan about the conference history!

 After making a selection, click one of the export format buttons. The amount of items that will be exported is indicated in the bubble next to export format.
