 The 25th European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimisation is a multidisciplinary conference that brings together researchers working on applications and theory of evolutionary computation methods and other metaheuristics for solving difficult combinatorial optimisation problems appearing in various industrial, economic, and scientific domains. 
 Successfully solved problems include, but are not limited to, multi-objective, uncertain, dynamic and stochastic problems in the context of scheduling, timetabling, network design, transportation and distribution, vehicle routing, stringology, graphs, satisfiability, energy optimisation, cutting, packing, planning and search-based software engineering. 
 Successfully addressed theoretical and translational challenges encompass, but are not limited to, the development and analysis of novel (components of) evolutionary and other metaheuristic algorithms, work on neighbourhood and landscape structures, problem-agnostic and problem-specific variation operators, parallelisation strategies, and hybridizations. ⁠ 
 The EvoCOP 2025 conference will be held together with EuroGP (the 28th European Conference on Genetic Programming), EvoMUSART (the 14th European conference on evolutionary and biologically inspired music, sound, art and design) and EvoApplications (the 28th European Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation), in a joint event collectively known as EvoStar (Evo*). 
 Accepted papers will be published by Springer Nature in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Previous proceedings can be found in thehref="https://link.springer.com/conference/evocop" - EvoCOP Conference Proceedings in SpringerLink

 Areas of Interest and Contributions 
 EvoCOP welcomes submissions in all experimental and theoretical aspects of evolutionary computation and other metaheuristics to combinatorial optimisation problems, including (but not limited to) the following areas: 
 Applications of metaheuristics to combinatorial optimization problems 
 Theoretical developments 
 Neighbourhoods and efficient algorithms for searching them 
 Variation operators for stochastic search methods 
 Constraint-handling techniques 
 Parallelisation and grid computing 
 Search space and landscape analyses 
 Comparisons between different (also exact) methods 
 Automatic algorithm configuration and design 
 Prominent examples of metaheuristics include (but are not limited to): 
 Evolutionary algorithms 
 Estimation of distribution algorithms 
 Swarm intelligence methods such as ant colony and particle swarm optimisation 
 Artificial immune systems 
 Local search methods such as simulated annealing, tabu search, variable neighbourhood search, iterated local search, scatter search and path relinking 
 Hybrid methods such as memetic algorithms 
 Matheuristics (hybrids of exact and heuristic methods) 
 Hyper-heuristics and autonomous search 
 Surrogate-model-based methods 
 Notice that, by tradition, continuous/numerical optimisation is *not* part of the topics of interest of EvoCOP. Interested authors might consider submitting to other EvoStar conferences such as EvoApplications.

 Submission Details 
 Accepted papers will be published by Springer Nature in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Submissions must be original and not published elsewhere. They will be peer reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The reviewing process will bedouble-blind, so please omit information about the authors in the submitted paper. 
 Page limit: 14 + unlimited references pages OR 6 + unlimited references pages 
 If your paper has at most 6 pages of content (plus additional pages for references), then we consider it a short paper. If your paper has between 7 and 14 pages of content (plus additional pages for references), then we consider it as a full paper. In case of acceptance, a short paper will get a shorter time slot for presentation at EvoCOP than a full paper; exact durations are yet to be decided.

 The front matter of each GECCO proceeding 
 Note 
 This table provides statistics of two-page poster papers, not full papers. Unlike other conferences in the field of evolutionary computation (e.g., CEC, EMO, and Evo*), poster papers and full papers are published individually in GECCO. While full papers are published in the main volume, poster papers are published in the companion volume (dblp). 
 It is not obvious how to calculate the acceptance rates of GECCO poster papers. I calculated the acceptance rate for each year as follows: (x + y) / z, where x is the number of full paper acceptances, y is the number of poster paper acceptances, and z is the number of submissions. I believe that the acceptance rate obtained in this way is inexact, but a good approximation.
