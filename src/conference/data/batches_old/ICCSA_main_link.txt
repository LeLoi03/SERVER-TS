The first ICCSA conference was co-organized by C.J.K. Tan (UK) and M. Gavrilova (U of Calgary, Canada) in 2003. 
 Computational Science is a main pillar of most present research, industrial and commercial activities and plays a unique role in exploiting innovative Information and Communication Technologies. 
 The ICCSA Conference offers an opportunity to discuss new issues, tackle complex problems and find advanced solutions to enable shaping new trends in Computational Science. 
 Submitted papers will be subject to stringent peer review by at least three experts and carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. 
 All accepted papers will be included in the SpringerLecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)series which is indexed by Scopus, EI Engineering Index, Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in ISI Web of Science), and several other indexing services. The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers. 
 You can check all ICCSA Conference volumes published by Springer since 2003at the following URL:href="https://link.springer.com/conference/iccsa" - https://link.springer.com/conference/iccsa
Springer is able to manage ORCID related to the authors and the Proceedings Volumes Editors! Please add the ORCID related to each author of your submitted paper to avoid mismatches in bibliometric mapping!!!Warning: Fake ICCSA Conference by WASET 
 We have noticed the existence of organisations such as WASET that run fake “conferences” in order to make profit with the registration fees, often spoofing the names of real conferences. WASET claims to be organising a conference called ICCSA next year, which is a FAKE ICCSA conference. 
 The Real ICCSA conference has been organised by the ICCSA Society since 2003. We do not have any involvement with WASET. Please spread this news to your contacts and communities so that nobody mistakenly participates to such fake conferences. 
 WASET is predator publisher. Go to this Wiki Link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Academy_of_Science,_Engineering_and_TechnologyThe conference is organized in cooperation with: 
 Galatasaray University, Türkiye
