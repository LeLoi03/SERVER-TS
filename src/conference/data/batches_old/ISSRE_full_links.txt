 Welcome to ISSRE 2025 
 The Organizing Committee warmly welcomes you to the 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE, 2025) in São Paulo, Brazil. Over the years, ISSRE has evolved into a venue for presenting the greatest global research on software reliability. We are looking forward to a conference full of ideas from industry and academia. 
 ISSRE 2025 will be held in São Paulo from October 21st to 24th, 2025. São Paulo is a major city in South America with a considerable global impact on trade, economics, arts, and entertainment. Greater São Paulo is the most populated region in Brazil and one of the world's, with approximately 20 million people. The city is a cultural hub in Latin America, with monuments, parks, and museums including the Latin America Memorial, Ibirapuera Park, Ipiranga Museum, Pinacoteca, Cinemateca, Itaú Cultural, São Paulo Art Museum, Catavent Museum, Football Museum, Portuguese Language Museum, and Image and Sound Museum. 
 It also hosts events including the São Paulo International Art Biennial, Sao Paulo Fashion Week, Sao Paulo Jazz Festival, Lollapalooza, Spring Sound, The Town Festival, and Comic Con Experience. The diversity of peoples and cultures that founded the city also makes the region's rich gastronomy a major tourist attraction. This statement is supported by the city's diverse gastronomic offerings, which include over 50 different types of cuisine, and several of its restaurants are among the best in the world, ranking it among the top 10 dining destinations on the planet. 
 We look forward to meeting you in São Paulo, Brazil!
