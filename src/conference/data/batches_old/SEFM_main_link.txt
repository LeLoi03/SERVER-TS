23rd International Conference on 
 Software Engineering and Formal Methods 
 10-14 November 2025 
 Organised by University of Castilla-La Mancha and University Complutensis of Madrid, Spain 
 Welcome to SEFM 2025 
 The 23nd edition of the International Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods will be held between 10 and 14 November 2025. 
 The conference aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia industry and government, to advance the state of the art in formal methods to facilitate their uptake in the software industry, and to encourage their integration within practical software engineering methods and tools.

 Overview and Scope 
 The conference aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government, to advance the state of the art in formal methods, to facilitate their uptake in the software industry, and to encourage their integration within practical software engineering methods and tools. 
 The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following aspects of software engineering and formal methods. 
 Software Development Methods 
 Formal modelling, specification, and design 
 Software evolution, maintenance, re-engineering, and reuse 
 Design Principles 
 Programming languages 
 Domain-specific languages 
 Type theory 
 Abstraction and refinement 
 Software Testing, Validation, and Verification 
 Model checking, theorem proving, and decision procedures 
 Testing and runtime verification 
 Statistical and probabilistic analysis 
 Synthesis 
 Performance estimation and analysis of other non-functional properties 
 Other light-weight and scalable formal methods 
 Security and Safety 
 Security, privacy, and trust 
 Safety-critical, fault-tolerant, and secure systems 
 Software certification 
 Applications and Technology Transfer 
 Service-oriented and cloud computing systems, Internet of Things 
 Component, object, multi-agent and self-adaptive systems 
 Real-time, hybrid, and cyber-physical systems 
 Intelligent systems and machine learning 
 Quantum systems 
 HCI, interactive systems, and human error analysis 
 Education 
 Case studies, best practices, and experience reports 
 Paper submission 
 We solicit two categories of papers:
