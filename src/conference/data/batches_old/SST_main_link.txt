 University of MelbourneThe Australasian Speech Science and Technology Association (ASSTA) is a scientific association which aims to advance the understanding of speech science and its application to speech technology in a way that is appropriate for Australia and New Zealand. 
 In order to fulfil these aims the Association seeks to provide significant exchange between those actively involved in speech science and technology research and practice, between this multidisciplinary body of professionals and the community in general as well as other national and international bodies having related aims.
