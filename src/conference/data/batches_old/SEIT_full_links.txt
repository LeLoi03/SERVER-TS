 SEIT 2025 will be held in the city of Leuven.Leuvenis the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in Belgium. It is located about 25 kilometres (16 miles) east of Brussels. It is the 10th largest municipality in Belgium and the fourth in Flanders. Leuven is home to the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, the largest and oldest university of the Low Countries and the oldest Catholic university still in existence. The related university hospital of UZ Leuven, is one of the largest hospitals of Europe. The city is also known for being the headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer and one of the five largest consumer-goods companies in the world. 
 Leuven's Town Hall is one of the best-known Gothic town halls worldwide and Leuven's pride and joy. It took three architects and thirty years to build it. Leuven's 'Hall of Fame' features 236 statues, which were only added to the façade after 1850. There are 220 men and 16 women in total. On the bottom floor are famous Leuven scientists, artists and historical figures, dressed in Burgundian garb. The first floor is reserved for the patron saints of the various parishes of Leuven. Above them the façade is adorned by the counts and dukes of Brabant while the towers primarily feature biblical figures.

 Abstract 
 Smart grids are two-way communications grids that converge Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT) to transfer energy-related information between different industry components within the grid. Smart grids have changed the energy sector by increasing sustainability, efficiency and integrating renewable energy sources. However, smart grids are vulnerable to IT-related attacks because they rely on Information and Communication Technology (ICT). By surveying relevant papers and evaluating accessible statistics, this study explores cybersecurity in smart grids by examining current communication protocols and standards. We carefully compile various datasets with general information about four of the most smart grid-related datasets. Our study and conclusions address the key components of a smart grid and offer information that can help create cybersecurity plans specifically for smart grids. This research contributes to the discourse on smart grid security, which is important for preserving the stability of contemporary energy systems.

What is it about?Research in networks and communication technologies requires very significant investments of stakeholders for enabling our future networking society. Research in network communication has made several possible innovations having a strong influence on people's lives. Mobile communications and the Internet are two outstanding examples. Future Networks and Communications technologies, including mobile broadband and all optical networks are the key to the ground-breaking inventions to our future technologies. It will enable us to design and build the future communication infrastructure interconnecting and empowering the next generation enabling platforms. 
 While the technology itself develops faster and faster, the deployment and implementation of a new network infrastructure technology can take up to ten years. The future networks communication research will deliver the next generation of network technologies enabling smart connectivity for all, anywhere, and at any time at the highest speed and efficiency so as to meet the overwhelming demand by today's society. This is why we need to enable a very reliable and dependable future networks and communication to ensure that industries; businesses and consumers can access and use the most advanced content and services they call for.
