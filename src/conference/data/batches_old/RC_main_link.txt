 Welcome to the 
 17th Conference on Reversible Computation 
 July 3 - July 4, 2025, Odense, Denmark 
 The Conference on Reversible Computation will bring together researchers from computer science, mathematics, engineering, and physics to discuss new developments and directions for future research in the emerging area of Reversible Computation. This particularly includes applications of reversibility in quantum computation. Research papers, tool demonstrations and work-in-progress reports are within the scope of the conference. 
 Previous editions of this event took place as workshops in York (2009), Bremen (2010), Gent (2011), Copenhagen (2012), and as conference in Victoria (2013), Kyoto (2014), Grenoble (2015), Bologna (2016), Kolkata (2017), Leicester (2018), Lausanne (2019), Oslo (2020), Nagoya (2021), Urbino (2022), Giessen (2023), and Toruń (2024).

 Call for Papers 
 Reversible computation has a growing number of promising application areas such as low power design coding/decoding, debugging, testing and verification database recovery, discrete event simulation, reversible algorithms, reversible specification formalisms reversible programming languages, process algebras, and the modeling of biochemical systems. Furthermore reversible logic provides a basis for quantum computation with its applications, for example, in cryptography and in the development of highly efficient algorithms. First reversible circuits and quantum circuits have been implemented and are seen as promising alternatives to conventional CMOS technology. 
 The conference will bring together researchers from computer science, mathematics, and physics to discuss new developments and directions for future research in Reversible Computation. This includes applications of reversibility in quantum computation. Research papers tutorials, tool demonstrations, and work-in-progress reports are within the scope of the conference. Invited talks by leading international experts will complete the program. Contributions on all areas of Reversible Computation are welcome, including---but not limited to---the following topics: 
 Applications 
 Architectures 
 Algorithms 
 Bidirectional transformations 
 Circuit Design 
 Debugging 
 Fault Tolerance and Error Correction 
 Hardware 
 Information Theory 
 Physical Realizations 
 Programming Languages 
 Program Transformation and Optimisation 
 Quantum Computation 
 Software 
 Synthesis 
 Theoretical Results 
 Testing 
 Verification 
 In order to submit a paper to the Reversible Computation conference, please follow these guidelines:You can submit 
 full research papers (15 pages maximum, not including references), 
 tutorials (15 pages maximum, not including references), 
 work-in-progress or tool demonstration papers (6 pages maximum, not including references). 
 Please do not forget to clearly indicate the type of your submission by choosing the proper category on the submission page. Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version — for example, details of proofs — may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. Reviewers are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers must be understandable without them. 
 The paper submission will be accepted as a PDF file using the LNCS style. Further information and templates are availablehere. Authors are encouraged to include their ORCID's in the paper. 
 At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference. We would appreciate if one person would not present more than two papers at the conference: if more than two papers are accepted by a group of authors, we kindly ask that the papers be presented by different co-authors, as far as possible. PC chairs and general chairs are not permitted to submit papers to the conference. 
 All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volume.
