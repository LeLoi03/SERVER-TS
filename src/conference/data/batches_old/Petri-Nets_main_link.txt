 Welcome 
 The46th International Conference on Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency(Petri Nets 2025) is organized by theSAFERteam from Laboratoire d’Informatique de Paris Nord (LIPN),Université Sorbonne Paris Nordjointly with members of theMeFoSyLoMagroup. 
 The conference takes place at theCampus Condorcet, Paris-Aubervilliers, France (métro line 12).
