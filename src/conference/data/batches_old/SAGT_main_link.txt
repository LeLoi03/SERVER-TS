Thesubmission deadlinehas been extended: 
 Abstract submission deadline: May 22, 2024, 23:59 AoE 
 Full paper submission deadline: May 26, 2024, 23:59 AoE 
 NOTE:An empty paper is sufficient to register the paper before the abstract submission deadline. However, a full abstract is required and only minor changes will be allowed to that before the full paper deadline. Only papers that have been registered before the abstract submission deadline will be considered. 
 The expectation is that at least one of the authors of each accepted paper will attend SAGT and give a presentation for the work. However, we are open to consider the possibility of remote talks in exceptional circumstances (due to, e.g., visa/travel issues) provided that at least one author has registered to the conference. 
  
 Submission Format 
 Submissions may be up to 18 pages long (excluding title page and references) in single-column format, using at least 11-point fonts, single-spacing between lines, and at least 1-inch margins all around. In addition, an appendix may be included at the end of the paper and will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines may be rejected without review. Please note that, as for all previous editions, SAGT 2024 implements a single-blind peer-review process. 
 Authors are strongly encouraged to structure their paper in a way that includes a clear presentation of the merits of the paper and a discussion of the importance of the results, as well as an exposition of the key conceptual and technical ideas. 
 The symposium proceedings will be published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) proceedings volume in the ARCoSS subline. Accepted papers will be allocated at most 18 pages (including title page and references) in LNCS format in the proceedings. Please note that the LNCS format has much wider page margins. We recommend that authors use the LNCS format (provided as part of Springer'sLaTeX2e package) to prepare their submission, but this is not a requirement for the submission. Please refer tohref="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" - Springer's Information for Authors
for detailed guidelines on how to prepare the final manuscript. 
 To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can choose to publish a one-page abstract of their paper in the proceedings. The paper must then provide a URL referring to the full version of the paper; authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. Such papers must be formatted and submitted just like regular papers (as described above). 
 Results previously published or presented at another archival conference prior to SAGT, or published (or accepted for publication) at a journal prior to the submission deadline, will not be considered for publication as regular papers. Simultaneous submission of regular papers to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed. Simultaneous submission of results to a journal is allowed only if the authors intend to publish the paper as a one-page abstract in SAGT 2024.

 Ambiguous Contracts 
  
 Contract theory captures situations where two parties—a principal and an agent— can benefit from mutual cooperation. The prototypical situation is one in which the principal seeks to delegate the execution of a job to an agent. The agent can take different costly actions, and his choice of action entails a stochastic outcome (with attached reward) for the principal. The principal cannot directly observe the agent’s choice of action but can influence the agent’s decision through a contract that specifies outcome-contingent payments. Given a contract, the agent aims to maximize his expected payment minus cost. The goal of the principal is to maximize her expected utility given by expected reward minus payment, under the action chosen by the agent. 
 One feature of real-life contracts that is not captured (or explained) by this classic model is that practical contracts are often ambiguous. For example, the promotion guidelines of a university may require a candidate to demonstrate “research productivity and excellence.” Similarly, a professional services contract may require that a provider exert “due diligence.” This ambiguity may be due to an inability of the two parties to provide more precise specification. In contrast, we explore the deliberate infusion of ambiguity as a tool to enhance the principal’s contracting power over the agent. 
 Towards this goal we propose an extension of the classic (hidden action) principal-agent model. In this model, an ambiguous contract consists of a set of classic contracts, which the agent evaluates by considering the minimum utility a given action yields against any contract in the support of the ambiguous contract. At the same time, we require that the principal’s utility—under the action chosen by the agent—is the same for all contracts in the support of the ambiguous contract. We show that this expands the set of actions that the principal can implement, and that the principal’s gain from using an ambiguous contract can be arbitrarily large. We further characterize the structure of optimal ambiguous contracts, showing that ambiguity drives optimal contracts towards simplicity. We also provide a characterization of ambiguity-proof classes of contracts, where the principal cannot gain by infusing ambiguity. Finally, we show that when the agent can engage in mixed actions, the advantages of ambiguous contracts disappear.

 Learning-Augmented Mechanism Design 
  
 For more than half a century, the dominant approach for the mathematical analysis of algorithms in computer science has been worst-case analysis. While worst-case analysis provides a useful signal regarding the robustness of an algorithm, it can be overly pessimistic, and it often leads to uninformative bounds or impossibility results that may not reflect real-world obstacles. Meanwhile, advances in machine learning have led to very practical algorithms, most of which do not provide any non-trivial worst-case performance guarantees. Motivated by the tension between worst-case analysis and machine learning, a surge of recent work focuses on the design algorithms that are guided by machine-learned predictions, aiming to perform better in practice, while maintaining their robustness. Specifically, the goal of this literature on “learning-augmented algorithms” is to design algorithms that simultaneously provide two types of guarantees: “robustness” (which corresponds to the classic worst-case guarantees, even if the predictions that the algorithm is provided with are arbitrarily bad) and “consistency” (i.e., stronger performance guarantees when the predictions are accurate). This “learning-augmented framework” has been used successfully in a variety of settings, e.g., toward a refined analysis of competitive ratios in online algorithms and running times in traditional algorithms. 
  
 A recent line of work on “learning-augmented mechanism design” has deployed this learning augmented framework in settings involving strategic agents. In such settings, the designer often faces additional obstacles which further limit their ability to reach desired outcomes. For example, some of the input that the designer needs may be private information held by the participating agents, and the agents could strategically misreport this information, aiming to maximize their own utility. In other settings, the agents may even have direct control over some aspects of the outcome. The long literature on mechanism design has proposed a variety of solutions for these types of problems, aiming to align the incentives of the agents with those of the designer, but the worst-case guarantees of these solutions are often underwhelming from a practical perspective. This talk will introduce the “learning-augmented mechanism design” model and provide an overview of some of the results in this line of work.

 Actually, Data is a Rival Good 
  
 There is a tendency in many fields, including computer science, economics, and industry, to model data as a non-rival good, meaning that one entity using a particular piece of data doesn’t impinge on its use by others. Food is a classic rival good (if I eat the apple, you cannot); digital music is a classic non-rival good (my listening to the song has no effect on your listening experience). Data might, at first blush, seem more like digital music than like an apple. In this talk, I will give arguments from three fields—economics, privacy, and statistics—for why modeling data as non-rival is problematic, and will argue that we need a new paradigm. 
 The core of the economic argument is that generative AI has transformed the market for data, making competition (and rivalrousness) for and around data newly central. The privacy and statistical validity arguments rely on mathematical frameworks that help us understand how repeated uses of a dataset accumulate and interact. All of these arguments suggest new models and metaphors for data, and directions for further work.

 Proportionality in Multi-Winner Voting: Axioms, Voting Rules and Equilibria 
  
 Voting is one of the oldest and most studied forms of collective decision making. In this tutorial, I will focus on a specific form of voting, namely multi-winner voting, where a set of voters must elect a committee of k candidates out of a larger set of available alternatives. One of the central requirements in multi-winner voting is that the chosen committee represents the electorate’s preferences in a proportional manner. While proportionality is well understood in traditional parliamentary elections, it is not immediately clear what it means without a rigid party structure. However, recent advances in computational social choice theory have allowed us to develop a new and deeper understanding of fairness and proportionality in multi-winner voting, even without explicitly defined parties. 
  
 In the first part of the tutorial I will give an introduction to this recent literature on proportionality in multi-winner voting, presenting some axioms that have developed to formally capture the intuitive idea of proportionality, examine some voting rules designed to provide proportional committees, and look at some computational aspects of finding fair committees. In the second part of the tutorial, I will link multi-winner voting with game theory by showing that many of the axioms and rules touched on in the first part can be understood in terms of equilibria in normal-form games or in markets for public goods. To conclude, I will discuss important open questions in multi-winner voting and how methods from (algorithmic) game theory might be used to answer them.

 Prophet Inequalities with Limited Information 
  
 Many applications require assigning resources in an online fashion: decisions on incoming bids have to be made immediately, and before seeing all n bids in the sequence. 
 A fundamental hardness inherent to this setting limits online strategies to perform no better than the one that simply picks a random winner for each good, so additional assumptions are needed. Famously, in prophet inequalities, one assumes access to all n (independent) distributions that the participant’s bids will be drawn from, achieving exp. competitive guarantees of up to half the expected offline optimum. 
  
 Recently, considerable interest has been drawn to the fact that full prior distributional knowledge is in general not actually necessary to circumvent the impossibility. 
 Instead, one can often achieve similar (or even equally good) approximations with access to just a few samples from each distribution. This data-driven approach poses a clear advantage in practical settings, where full distributions are rarely available (but one might, for example, know the bids the same participant placed in a few previous auctions). 
  
 The tutorial gives an overview of such results, with a focus on the edge case of ‘minimal’ prior knowledge, i.e. the online algorithm only has access to one single sample from each distribution. We first derive how and why constant ratios can be obtained for simple settings, and then show how the same principle surprisingly generalizes up to very recent results on XOS combinatorial assignments. Then, we consider the design of truthful mechanisms, a central goal whenever agents might bid strategically, and discuss the existing results as well as known obstacles to extending them.
