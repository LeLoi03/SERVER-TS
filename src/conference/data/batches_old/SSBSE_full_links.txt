 SSBSE 2025 
 Welcome to the website of the 17th Symposium on Search-Based Software Engineering 2025 (SSBSE 2025). SSBSE 2025 will take place on November 16th in Seoul, Republic of Korea, co-located with ASE 2025. 
 Search-based Software Engineering (SBSE) is a research area focused on the formulation of software engineering problems as search problems, and the subsequent use of complex heuristic techniques to attain optimal solutions to such problems. A wealth of engineering challenges – from test generation, to design refactoring, to process organization – can be solved efficiently through the application of automated optimization techniques. SBSE is a growing field – sitting at the crossroads between AI, machine learning, and software engineering – and SBSE techniques have begun to attain human-competitive results. 
 href="http://ssbse.com" - The Symposium on Search-Based Software Engineering
is a venue dedicated to the SBSE research field. We invite the submission of high-quality papers describing novel and original work in all areas of SBSE including, but not limited to, applications of SBSE to novel problems, theoretical analyses of search algorithms for software engineering, rigorous empirical evaluations of SBSE techniques, and reports of industrial experiences.

Symposium on Search Based Software Engineering 
 SSBSE HomepageThe objective of the Symposium on Search Based Software Engineering (SSBSE) is to bring the rapidly growing international search based software engineering community together in a welcoming forum for discussion and dissemination, as well as to sustain the flourishing of interest in the field from researchers and practitioners in software engineering and metaheuristic search alike. SSBSE has a well-documented charter and organises itself with an open democratic process. 
 If you are interested in being general chair for a future edition of SSBSE, please feel free to reach out to steering committee members. 
 SSBSE is ranked in CORE (B ranking)http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/2283/.

About 
  
 SBSE: Search Based Software Engineering 
 Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) is the reformulation of software engineering tasks as optimisation problems. 
 The objective of the search becomes that of locating, from among all possible solutions to the problem, one that is sufficiently good according to an appropriate fitness metric. This reformulation enables previously manually intensive and costly tasks to be partially or fully automated, solves problems that are intractable by other methods, and often leads to innovative and insightful solutions. 
 The combination of readily available, high-performance computing power, and new, more efficient, search algorithms has made SBSE a practical solution method for many software engineering problems. This is reflected in the interest in this field from both academia and industry, and the very wide range of applications throughout the software engineering lifecycle, to which it has been successfully applied.
