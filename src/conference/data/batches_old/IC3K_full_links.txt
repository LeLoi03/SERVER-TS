 Registration to IC3K allows free access to the ICINCO, WEBIST, IN4PL, IJCCI and CoopIS conferences (as a non-speaker). 
  
 The purpose of the IC3K is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners on the areas of Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management. IC3K is composed of three co-located conferences, each specialized in at least one of the aforementioned main knowledge areas. 

Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).

Knowledge Engineering (KE) encompasses the technical, scientific, and social aspects of building, maintaining, and utilizing knowledge-based systems. It draws on AI, databases, expert systems, decision support systems, and software engineering, while integrating insights from logic, cognitive science, and socio-cognitive engineering. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Low-code/No-code Platforms have expanded KE’s reach by enabling automated ontology generation and greater accessibility. 
  
 Ontology Development (OD) focuses on creating reusable semantic structures like vocabularies, glossaries, and formal ontologies. These structures are essential in applications such as knowledge graphs, digital twins, explainable AI (XAI), cybersecurity, and IoT interoperability. Ontologies also play a crucial role in ensuring ethical AI development, mitigating bias, and enhancing transparency. 
  
 KEOD serves as a key venue for researchers and practitioners to explore traditional and cutting-edge topics like LLM-based Ontology Development, Ontology-driven Digital Twins, and Ontology-enhanced Low-code Platforms, fostering innovation in KE and OD across academia and industry.

Knowledge Discovery (KD) is an interdisciplinary domain focusing upon methodologies for identifying valid, hidden, novel, potentially actionable and meaningful information, from within data of all kinds. Knowledge discovery encompasses an end-to-end process involving: data preparation, the application of learning techniques and the presentation of the acquired knowledge in a manner that is both meaningful and (importantly) explainable. The learning techniques used range from statistically-based data mining, through sophisticated machine learning models to deep learning. Current trends in the field of KD include Explainable AI, Hybrid-learning, and the application of knowledge discovery to ever increasingly diverse data sets. Information Retrieval (IR), in turn, is concerned with the gathering of relevant information, from unstructured and semantically fuzzy data in texts and other media, typically in response to a user query. This encompasses searching for information within data sources (such as documents and images) and for metadata about those data sources, as well as searching within databases of all kinds and the Web. Automation of IR enables the reduction of information overload. The tools and techniques of KD are increasingly used to enhance and automate IR processes. Current trends in IR include learning to rank models, data representation using embedding techniques, and the use of knowledge graph technology. The scope of the KDIR conference covers all aspect KD and IR, and the overlap between the two.
