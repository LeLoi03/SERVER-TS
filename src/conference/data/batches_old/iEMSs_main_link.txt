 Dr. Pouyan Nejadhashemi named director of MSU Institute of Water Research effecti 
 href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/new-director-named-for-msu-institute-of-water-research" - New director named for MSU Institute of Water Research
Michigan State University Research Foundation Professor Pouyan Nejadhashemi has been named director of the MSU Institute of Water Research (IWR) effective Oct. 15, 2024. The position is a 50% appointment, and Nejadhashemi will continue to serves as a professor in the departments of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering and Plant, Soil and Microbial Sciences. His work is also supported in part by MSU AgBioResearch. As an expert in ecohydrology, which delves into how water interacts with ecological systems, his research uses leading-edge tools to model water use and address issues such as monitoring per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) chemicals in Michigan drinking water using machine learning. 
 Nejadhashemi’s world-renowned research program has received significant funding, including grants from the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Institute of Food and Agriculture, and the U.S. Agency for International Development. As IWR director, Nejadhashemi will deliver strategic vision and oversight of institute initiatives, increase the scholarly activity of IWR and strengthen its reputation at the local, state and national levels. One of his primary responsibilities is to foster a culture within IWR of transparency, diversity, equity and inclusion. 
 He will collaborate with the water research community at MSU and externally — in addition to state and federal agencies, nongovernmental organizations, tribal groups and other stakeholders — on challenges related to water use, availability and quality in Michigan, the Great Lakes region and beyond. On top of his administrative duties, Nejadhashemi will be tasked with obtaining and increasing funding to IWR efforts, as well as serving as the principal investigator on new research projects. 
 “We’re fortunate to bring Pouyan into this position given his vast expertise in water research and ecohydrology,” said George Smith, director of AgBioResearch, who will supervise Nejadhashemi in his IWR role. “He has demonstrated success in developing impactful water research, and his leadership will be critical to IWR’s growth and future. I look forward to partnering with him to broaden IWR’s reach.” 
 The IWR is one of 54 water institutes across the country created under the Water Resources Research Act of 1964 and receives funding from the U.S. Geological Survey. 
 The organization is dedicated to developing science-based technology, research, educational programs and partnerships to help understand and address critical water issues. Current IWR research and outreach explores risks and opportunities with groundwater management, develops methods to improve water quality for agriculture and local communities, examines PFAS risks and mitigation, reduces nutrient runoff and harmful algal blooms, and protects Michigan’s lakes and streams, among other topics. 
 “It’s an honor to be named IWR director, a position of great strategic importance to current and future MSU research and outreach,” Nejadhashemi said. “Understanding more about how we use water and the threats to water availability and quality are paramount to Michigan and around the world. With our state’s proximity to an abundance of fresh water in the Great Lakes region, it’s our responsibility to ensure this precious resource is actively managed and protected.” 
 Prior to Nejadhashemi’s appointment, Dana Infante, chair of the Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, was serving as interim IWR director.

 Dr. David Swayne Obituary 
 SWAYNE, Dr. David Allan Butler: September 5th 1945 – October 13th, 2024 
 Dr. David Allan Butler passed away suddenly in London, Ontario on Sunday, October 13th, 2024 at the age of 79 years. David was born in Smiths Falls, Ontario on September 5, 1945 to Clarence (1973) and Thressa (nee Droppo; 1995) Swayne. He was the loving husband of Dianne Swayne for 54 years. Loving father of Stephanie (Paul Buchan), Seanna (Tim Costello), and Leigh Anne (Brent Shantz). Doting grandfather of Izak Buchan and David Gnepe. Dear brother-in-law of Ronald and Susan White, and Brenda Lee and Daniel McNiven. Dearly missed by Dwayne, Sara, Mike, and Jeff Edgerton, and Clair, Charis, and Felica Kelso and many nieces and nephews. 
 David obtained his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Waterloo in (1975) and was a long-time professor at the University of Guelph. He was instrumental in establishing the University of Guelph-Humber. He was very proud of his long-term work with Canada Centre for Inland Waters and Environment Canada as a private consultant in the early days of artificial intelligence and environmental modelling. His work in this area also took him to many parts of the globe (where he made lasting friendships), including Ethiopia, Indonesia, Vietnam, China, Germany, Denmark, Portugal, Scotland, England, Central and South America (and many more). David loved to ski, travel and enjoy a hearty meal with loved ones, often prepared by him. He excelled at many sports throughout his childhood and early adulthood, including basketball, hockey, running and tennis. Later in life, he became an avid crossfitter(!). He was an intense sports fan, cheering on his daughters in a variety of sports, and as a many-years-running president of the “6th player [basketball fan] club” and academic mentor to University of Guelph men’s basketball players, and as a dedicated fan of March Madness U.S. College basketball. He loved to spend time with Dianne and “the three girls” and organized many an adventure for them (in various Volkswagen vans). He loved dogs, especially his little 1.5 pound teacup poodle, Zena. He cherished sharing stories of his travels and his vast knowledge of many subjects with his grandsons, as well as cheering them on for all their activities and sports. Although the pandemic years were isolating, he kept them well supplied with Lego and other past times and he designed and helped construct a two-storey tree fort to make sure they were happy. He will be fondly remembered by family and friends alike for his quick wit, friendliness and generosity of spirit. 
 David’s family will receive relatives and friends from 4:00-6:00 p.m. on Saturday, October 19, 2024 at the Henry Walser Funeral Home, 507 Frederick Street, Kitchener, 519-749-8467. Memorial will be held in the funeral home chapel on Sunday, October 20, 2024 at 11:00 a.m. Reception to follow.

 J8. Decision-Making Under Uncertainty in Water Resources Management 
 In water resources management, making optimal decisions under uncertainty remains a significant challenge. Uncertainty can stem from various sources, such as natural climate variability, climate change, data errors, model limitations, operational unpredictability and future policy change. These uncertainties can negatively affect the design and real-time operations of large water infrastructures (including reservoirs and groundwater systems) essential for water supply, flood control, environmental watering, and hydropower generation. For this session, we invite contributions from researchers and practitioners pertaining to any of the following: (1) improved methods in the field, including but not limited to those based on optimisation, simulation, scenario analysis and/or artificial intelligence, (2) application of probabilistic forecasts to inform planning or operational decisions, (3) advancements in scoping and communicating forecasts; (4) extending water forecasts to assess social and economic impacts, and (5) case studies on real world challenges of decision-making under uncertainty. We also welcome contributions on other relevant topics not mentioned above. 
 Keywords:Decision-making; Decision modelling; Uncertainty; Hydrometeorological forecasting; Water resources management 
 CLOSEJ9. Challenges, new concepts and new methods for water resources management 
 Intensifying competition for water from agricultural, industrial, and domestic users has sharply increased stress on aquatic and wetland ecosystems. In a growing number of catchments and aquifers, the volume of water allocated has reached or exceeded sustainable limits in many parts of the world. These issues are predicted to worsen in the future with climate change. This poses challenges to manage water resources effectively and efficiently in a changing world. New concepts and innovative approaches need to be developed to solve these challenges. This session welcomes papers on “Challenges, new concepts and new methods for water resources management”. The areas include (but not limited to) challenges and recent development of novel advances for water resources management to adapt in the changing world, problems and challenges in the current water management systems, new ideas to effectively manage water resources, development of statistical and machine learning based methods to assess and predict water resources (e.g. assessment the impact of anthropogenic climate change and hydro dam operations on low flows), developing integrated models for surface-groundwater movement and contaminant transport, innovative approaches to estimate future water demand and water availability. 
 Keywords:Water resources management; Machine learning technology; Water demand and supply; Anthropogenic climate change 
 CLOSEJ10. Advancements in Hydrological Predictions through Novel Sensing and Innovative Modelling Techniques 
 Traditional hydrological models have long relied on in-situ measurements, which, despite their value, often present challenges due to spatial and temporal limitations. Recent advancements in data acquisition technologies offer new opportunities to address these constraints and enhance hydrological predictions. 
 This session will explore innovative approaches that integrate diverse datasets and cutting-edge modelling techniques to improve predictive accuracy, uncertainty management, and real-world applications in water resource management. We particularly welcome contributions that introduce methodologies not traditionally applied in hydrology, fostering interdisciplinary advancements in the field. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Remote sensing applications – The use of remote sensing to monitor hydrological variables, particularly surface water dynamics, and their integration into hydrological modelling frameworks. 
 Innovative modelling – The application of novel hydrological modelling approaches, including deep learning, stochastic methods, and models that incorporate data-driven insights to enhance hydrological predictions. 
 This session aims to bring together researchers working on novel sensing technologies and innovative modelling approaches to advance hydrological predictions. By expanding the scope of predictive capabilities, it will contribute to sustainable water resource management and informed policy decision-making. 
 Keywords:Hydrological modelling; Remote sensing applications in hydrology; Innovatives in hydrology; Unsolved Problems in Hydrology; Predictions in ungauged basins; Deep learning in hydrology; Stochastic modelling in hydrology 
 CLOSEJ11. Ecohydrological Modelling 
 The interactions between water, soils and ecosystems are complex and can have important effects on water resources, land, and ecosystem management. This session welcomes ecohydrological modelling studies on issues involving relationships between water, soils, vegetation and other biota in different settings (rural/urban, pristine/modified, wetlands/drylands) spanning plot to catchment to global scales and over short and long temporal scales. Contributions may address water use by ecosystems, biochemical cycles, vertical fluxes between soils and atmosphere, ecosystem responses to floods and droughts, and climate change effects. 
 Keywords:Hydrology; Plants; Soils; Atmosphere; Ecosystem response 
 CLOSEK1. Modelling Complexity: New Approaches for Water, Environment and Society in Large Basins 
 Globally, large river basins provide crucial values for agriculture, biodiversity, industry, and communities. Most of these large basins suffer from a complex set of water, environmental, socio-economic, cultural and management issues often impacted by significant anthropogenic and climate change-induced environmental degradation. While the stability of regional communities is dependent on river basins being highly productive, resilient and sustainable, the way river basins are often managed ignores diverse values and priorities which leads to conflict and inequitable trade-offs. New participatory models and tools are needed to integrate diverse values, including traditional cultural knowledges. The Murray-Darling Basin is an exemplary case of a large river basin where actors actively participate in the co-design of collaborative solutions for these ‘wicked problems’. For this session, we solicit contributions that present approaches from local to supra-regional scales addressing how integrated, participatory and systems-based analysis and modelling can contribute to addressing these social, environmental, agricultural, cultural and governance issues. 
 Keywords:Modelling complexity; Large river basins; Murray-Darling Basin; 
 CLOSEK2. Statistical, post-processing and verification methods for environmental prediction 
 This session will focus on statistical and data driven methods that are used to improve the quality of predictions, and on methods that are used to evaluate and diagnose prediction quality. It includes, but is not limited to, the post-processing of probabilistic and ensemble predictions to improve reliability, statistical methods for the quality control of observations, data driven methods (such as machine learning) for improving predictions, applications of decision theory to evaluate predictive utility, and advances in verification methods. The session will also cover post-processing methods used to generate downstream products for specific applications. 
 We particularly encourage submissions that make advances in such methods or that promote techniques developed in other disciplines (e.g. statistics or econometrics) that may be little known to environmental scientists but have potential within environmental prediction. 
 Keywords:Prediction verification; Post-processing; Machine learning; Statistics 
 CLOSEK3. Advancing Drought Monitoring, Prediction, And Resilience For Sustainable Development 
 Drought is a complex and slow-onset disaster with far-reaching impacts on water resources, agriculture, ecosystems, and livelihoods. As climate change intensifies hydroclimatic extremes, droughts’ frequency, duration, and severity are increasing, posing significant challenges for water security and sustainability. Addressing these challenges is crucial for achieving global targets such as Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 13 – Climate Action, and SDG 15 – Life on Land. 
 This session will bring together researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to explore the latest drought science and management advancements. We welcome contributions that focus on: 
 Innovative approaches to drought monitoring, including remote sensing, in-situ observations, and multi-variable indices. 
 Advances in drought prediction and early warning systems, leveraging climate models, statistical methods, and emerging technologies. 
 Understanding drought propagation across hydrological, ecological, and socio-economic systems. 
 The role of climate change and human activities in shaping drought patterns and water availability. 
 Practical solutions for drought mitigation and adaptation, including policy interventions and nature-based strategies. 
 This session aims to bridge the gap between science and action by fostering interdisciplinary discussions, ensuring that research contributes to real-world resilience and sustainable water management. We invite perspectives from across disciplines and regions to share insights, challenges, and solutions to tackle one of our time’s most pressing hydroclimatic issues. 
 Keywords:Vegetation Responses; CO2 Rise; Drought; Water Use Efficiency; Soil Moisture; Global Drought Patterns; Extreme Climatic Events; Food Security Under Drought 
 CLOSEK4. Understanding and modelling catchment behaviour in a variable and changing climate 
 This session explores how catchments react to climate changes over periods ranging from several years to multiple decades, and how this can be simulated for water planning purposes. Catchments are complex systems that respond to external influences (such as climate change) across various timeframes due to the interplay and feedback loops among their elements. Recent findings indicate that current models and techniques tend to underestimate the effects of climate changes on streamflow, which significantly impacts the dependability of these methods for future planning. The poor performance of these models suggests that they may misrepresent or overlook crucial processes, their timescales, or the interactions between them. These shortcomings must be rectified to improve our ability to project hydrological conditions for future climate scenarios – particularly those scenarios that may exceed the range of variability of the past. 
 We welcome submissions on topics including, but not limited to: 
 Initiatives to enhance the realism of hydrological models for projections under future climate scenarios; 
 Improved understanding of water-related and/or biophysical processes linked to long-term climate shifts that may contribute to apparent changes in hydrological responses; 
 Comprehending and measuring catchment “memory” over multiple years; 
 Research that expands or reassesses established hydrological principles (such as the Budyko hypothesis) for predictions under changing conditions; and 
 Data-driven and modelling studies aimed at better understanding and simulating how water systems respond to historical climate variability and change. 
 Keywords:Climate change; Hydrology; Models; Drought; Projections 
 CLOSEK5. When models fail: lessons learned from false starts, wrong turns and dead ends 
 It’s somewhat disputed whether Thomas A. Edison actually said “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work” but the sentiment holds true for modellers and their models. In this session, inspired by the 2008 ‘Court of Miracles of Hydrology’ workshop, we invite contributions from modellers on the cases where their models have failed or not behaved as expected. These failure stories are rarely published in the scientific literature. By identifying the key lessons learned by sharing stories of case studies where previously well behaved models performed poorly it can help others to avoid repeating the same mistakes. We welcome contributions from all environmental modellers – the aim here is to lead to improved prediction across the wide spectrum of environmental modelling. Topics may cover statistical approaches through to physical models, data ‘outliers’ and failures in operationalising models. Lessons learned from model failures that led to eventual success are also welcome. 
 Keywords:Modelling; failure; Lessons learned 
 CLOSEK6. Advancing hydroclimate forecasting: methods and applications. 
 Hydroclimate and hydrometeorological forecasts are increasingly available for lead times of hours through to seasons. These forecasts are beneficial for a wide range of applications across the water resources management and agricultural domains for planning routine operations and responding to extreme events like floods and droughts. However, there are many outstanding challenges in producing new forecasting systems, including: developing methods that are as accurate as possible; the deployment of real-time forecasting systems; and understanding the role of forecasts in operational decision-making. This session invites contributions from scientists and practitioners covering developments in forecasting methods and applications on potential topics, including but not limited to: 
 •Developments in modelling approaches for hydrometeorological or hydroclimate forecasting 
 •Extreme events 
 •Statistical and machine learning methods for forecasting 
 •Hybrid forecasting techniques (e.g., blending dynamic and ML methods) 
 •Ensemble forecasting and uncertainty analysis 
 •Evaluation of forecasts for decision making 
 •Post-processing techniques 
 •Operational challenges in implementing forecasting systems 
 •Applications of new forecasting systems 
 Keywords:Hydrological forecasting; Forecast evaluation; Operational forecasts; Forecast-informed decisions 
 CLOSEK7. Understanding hydrological extremes: trends, drivers and impacts 
 Hydrological extremes such as floods, drought, extreme precipitation, heat waves, and storm surge have disastrous consequences on the economy and society which are only becoming more frequent and severe due to both climate change and anthropogenic activities. We invite contributions from any field investigating the nature of hydroclimatic extremes, particularly those aiming to simulate, predict, and understand extremes. Potential submissions include but are not limited to (i) Data analysis on global and regional trends in frequency and intensity of hydrological extremes; (ii) Process- and AI-based modelling for improving the prediction of hydrological extremes; (iii) Understanding how land surface changes (e.g., land cover changes, urbanization, wildfires, vegetation greening) and anthropogenic interventions (e.g., dams, reservoirs) cause and intensify hydrological extremes; (iv) Natural and societal impacts of hydrological extremes, as well as management solutions. By bringing together interdisciplinary research from environmental science, hydrology, and policy, this session aims to enhance our understanding of hydrological extremes and inform management practices in response to global changes. 
 Keywords:Extremes; Extreme Rainfall; Flooding; Droughts; Storms; Heat waves; Climate Change 
 CLOSEK8. Watershed flood regime changes and their prediction 
 Flood events usually show tremendous spatial and temporal variabilities in behaviour due to heterogeneities in meteorological and underlying surface conditions across basins or entire regions. Particularly, flash floods usually happen in the small mountainous watershed, but have remarkable damage to human lives and property due to flash flooding and their potential secondary disasters. They are one of the costliest and most dangerous natural disasters globally and have the highest mortality rate. Existing studies usually focus on the magnitude and timing of flood events, and the variability, timing, duration, and rate of changes are usually ignored, all of which are the critical components of flood events. The prediction performance still needs to be improved further due to the impacts of complicated hydroclimate and underlying surface conditions. Therefore, it is fundamentally important to investigate the flash flood change characteristics and prediction in the small watersheds for both flash flood scientific research and management purposes. The objectives of this sessions are to (1) investigate the flood regime changes and their causal mechanisms under the impacts of climate changes and human disturbances in both China and Australia; (2) discuss the new technology applications (e.g., hydrodynamic modelling, machine learning) for flash flood predictions with international researchers.

 CLOSEL3. Modelling water quality treatment and management 
 Water can contain contaminants such as sediments, nutrients, metals, microorganisms and emerging contaminants of concern. Management systems are needed both in urban and agricultural catchments for: (i) the treatment of water for reuse (e.g., irrigation, drinking), and (ii) the treatment of both wastewater (domestic and industrial) and stormwater prior to discharge into the environment, often utilizing various modelling approaches for water treatment planning, alongside intervention models to enhance treatment efficiency and sustainability. There are a wide range of management systems currently in use. These include grey and traditional infrastructure (e.g., water treatment plants) or green infrastructure (e.g., wetlands, biofilters). Management systems can also range from structural systems to non-structural systems. Modelling water quality treatment and management options involves assessing the physical, chemical, biological, socio-political, and economic factors that influence system performance.

 CLOSEL4. Modelling Erosion and Pollutant Dynamics 
 Sediments and nutrients from catchments flow into inland, coastal, and marine waterways, degrading water quality and often impacting environments. Understanding the sources and contributions of these landscape processes is crucial for effective water quality management and mitigation. In urban and rural waterways, sediment and nutrient pollution arise from complex interactions between erosion processes (overland, gully, and streambank erosion), human activities (e.g., farming tillage, construction), and transport mechanisms via overland flow. These processes are further influenced by hydroclimatic events, land use and management changes, and climate change over time.

 CLOSEG7. Tackling the challenges associated with modelling increases in landscape fire effects on human and ecosystem health under climate change conditions 
 The report “Spreading like Wildfire” by UNEP and GRID-Arendal finds that factors such as climate and land-use change are influencing Wildfire patterns everywhere. Wildfires, along with prescribed burns and agricultural burning practices, are collectively termed landscape fires. A global increase of extreme wildfires is anticipated given projected heatwaves and droughts, even in areas previously unaffected. Uncontrollable and extreme wildfires can be devastating to people, biodiversity and ecosystems. They also exacerbate climate change, contributing significant greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Given the implicit, intricate links between climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental pollution associated with landscape fires, as well as the potential impacts on public health, local biodiversity and natural resources, environmental modelling and simulation are key tools for our ability to consider scenarios of the future. Equally, integrated modelling systems are indispensable for both the ex-post assessment of interventions and the effectiveness of mitigation measures, as well as the ex-ante exploration of possible future scenarios. This session invites contributions from modelling studies, scenario simulations, tool developments and data science approaches addressing current and future challenges related to landscape fires. In addition, inter- and transdisciplinary modelling of environmental and public health impacts related to fires are welcome. Finally, the session would suit submissions explicitly addressing the interconnectedness of drivers, impacts and potential policy responses to the triple existential crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and environmental pollution specifically related to fires.

 CLOSEH4. Modelling the impact of environmental pressures on vector-borne and zoonotic disease burdens 
 Vector-borne and zoonotic diseases represent a significant source of deaths and morbidity around the globe. Environmental pressures, such as climate, land use and ecosystem resilience play an important role in the spread of these diseases and their spillover from wildlife and domestic animals into people. While this is particularly true for lower-income or developing countries, high income countries such as Australia are still at risk from a range of endemic and emerging diseases including Ross River Virus, Dengue fever, Hendra and Japanese Encephalitis. Meanwhile, our neighbours in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories continue to face high disease burdens coupled with under-funded health care systems and the rising tide of climate change. 
 In this session we look at the use of environmental modelling for exploring the environmental drivers of vector-borne and zoonotic disease burdens, with a focus on (but not limited to) Australia and the Pacific region. We encourage studies that represent a systems or Planetary Health approach, or that explore the complex relationships between human disease risk and the environment, how these relationships could change in a warmer world, and how models can inform interventions or policies to reduce the burden, particularly for those in poorer regions. These could include, but are not limited to systems dynamics, Bayesian geostatistics, Bayesian networks, agent-based models. We are keen to hear talks on either the direct or indirect effects of vector-borne and zoonotic disease burdens.

 CLOSEH5. Development and applications of simulation models in health economics 
 Simulation modelling plays a pivotal role in health economics as it allows extrapolation of health outcomes and costs, prediction of final endpoints based on intermediate outcomes, synthesis of evidence from different sources, generalisation of the results from clinical trials, evaluation of uncertainties, and generation of information about which health interventions represent value for money. This session welcomes submissions from a wide range of modelling studies and development of software tools for prediction of health outcomes as well as health care costs to support economic evaluations. Models that can be used to simulate disease progression and/or predict serious health-related events over a long time period in people with ill health, and those to predict transmission of infectious diseases and assess the impact of interventions on health and economic burden are of special interest.

 CLOSEI3. Agent-based and data-driven modelling of complex social systems in public information environments 
 Online social platforms are dynamic spaces for information exchange, but are increasingly a potential vector for the proliferation of misinformation and malicious influence operations. This session explores the application of agent-based modelling and empirical data-driven approaches to understand the dynamics of complex social systems, such as online information environments. 
 By defining rules which govern individual behaviour and inter-individual interactions and simulating the repeated application of these rules within a population of individuals, agent-based modelling offers a powerful tool for understanding population-level phenomena in terms of the individual differences and interaction patterns that give rise to them. By integrating empirical data, researchers can create models that reflect real-world phenomena more accurately and use them to explore different scenarios and examine counterfactuals. 
 The session will explore applications in diverse public environments such as social media and forums, focusing on how behaviours adapt, information spread, and community dynamics evolve over time. Talks will explore questions like the differences between online and offline environments, and how the technological affordances of online environments, such as recommender systems, impact the system dynamics. Key challenges include managing model complexity, incorporating large text-based datasets efficiently, ensuring computational feasibility, and validating models against real-world data. 
 This session aims to foster discussions on the latest advancements in modelling techniques, their practical applications across multiple contexts including defence and national security, and offering insights into understanding complex social phenomena through a multidisciplinary lens.

 CLOSEI4. Training future modellers for an uncertain future 
 The recent explosion of computing power and cheap sensor technology has triggered an avalanche of data, and generative AI is disrupting education and industry alike. At the same time, a rapidly changing climate and geopolitical instability make quantitative assessment more important than ever. What are the skills modellers need in this brave new world, and how do we develop these in our students and across our profession? How do we empower modellers to act ethically, think in systems and engage effectively with non-modellers, while developing rigorous technical capabilities? What can, and can’t, we outsource to the machines? How should we assess learning in a world of online education and ubiquitous access to large language models (LLMs)?

 CLOSEJ1. Long term shifts in hydrological systems 
 Water systems are complex and dynamic, exhibiting changes in behaviour as a result of environmental disturbances and climate change. Prolonged stressors, such as hydrological droughts, can push these systems beyond critical thresholds, leading to long-term changes known as “state shifts.” A state shift refers to a significant alteration in the fundamental probability distribution of a variable. 
 In the context of water resources, it means a catchment switching its stable state from its threshold called tipping point as a result of any disturbances. The catchment continues to remain in that altered state until another disturbance pushes it back to normal conditions. When these conditions continue to be for long number of years, it causes long term shift. These “state shifts” result in significant changes in the system’s structure, function, and resilience. 
 Key drivers of state shifts include prolonged droughts, extreme weather events, land-use changes, and climate change. These factors can disrupt hydrological processes, depleting soil moisture, reducing groundwater recharge, and diminishing streamflow. Multiple findings from different parts of the world have shown that prolonged hydrological droughts often lead to long-term state shifts in hydrological variables, especially streamflow. 
 Understanding the dynamics behind state shifts in hydrological variables is crucial for effective water resource management, as it highlights the importance of recognizing factors that can push hydrological systems beyond critical thresholds and thereby affecting resilience of the system. 
 This session invites papers addressing : 
 State shifts in hydroclimatic variables :Changes in streamflow, evapotranspiration, or groundwater. 
 State shifts in water quality variables : Long-term impacts of pollution and salinization.

 CLOSEJ2. River System Modelling for Water Resources Management: Advances and Challenges 
 Hydrological modelling of river systems plays an important role in water management. In the past four decades, numerous rainfall-runoff models, river water balance models, groundwater models and hydraulic models have been developed to inform the development and implementation of key water management policies in regulated and unregulated river valleys in different jurisdictions within Australia. In the early years of river system model development, the key focuses were on catchment runoff generation, river flow and water demand modelling of key water users to support development of water sharing plans. In the recent years, there has been greater emphasis on enhancing capability of river system model to represent various consumptive water uses, floodplain take, environmental flow, cultural values, surface and groundwater exchange, water trading, climate risk, etc. to support greater transparency and efficiency in water resources management. 
 This session aims to bring together researchers, modellers, practitioners and policy makers to discuss the current successes, issues, and potential solutions in dealing with challenges in river system modelling to support water resources planning and management in changing environment in the 21st Century.

 CLOSEJ3. Novel methods for data collection and predictive modelling in data sparse environments 
 The reliable modelling and simulation of physical and ecological processes requires measurements to use as inputs, identify dominant processes, calibrate parameters as well as evaluate outputs. Nonetheless in many parts of the world these measurements do not exist, are of low quality and/or are at an inappropriate scale. 
 The acquisition of measurements to inform numerical modelling, however, can be costly and time consuming. Furthermore, in some regions, such as the remote and sparsely inhabited regions of northern Australia, field sites can be difficult to access, and some data collection activities can pose a risk to human safety. 
 We invite papers that outline: 
 Novel cost-effective environmental data collection techniques, particularly in remote and vast environments. 
 New sources of data from field-based sensors or remote sensing for use with numerical modelling. 
 Use and application of novel existing data or data that has been hitherto underutilised. 
 Innovative ways of reducing, quantifying and/or communicating uncertainty when faced with data limitations in the modelling process. 
 Methods that optimise data collection to minimise cost and time.

 CLOSEJ5. Fit for purpose modelling for water resources management 
 This session addresses the challenge covered by the much over used quote by George Box “All models are wrong, some are useful.” This session will explore what makes a model useful for water management and how do we know a model is fit for purpose. In the context of water resource management, and the related complex socio-ecological system, we have an increasing array of tools, data and models, coupled with increasing uncertainty in climate and social processes. There is therefore a countless number of ways a problem can be considered and represented by models. In the same paper, Box suggests that since all models are wrong, we need to focus only on what is importantly wrong – “It is inappropriate to be concerned about mice when there are tigers abroad”. Given the increasing uncertainty in water management, how well do our current modelling approaches address or help us communicate the important uncertainties. There are tradeoffs in selecting different modelling approaches and selection of modelling tools often goes unquestioned. 
 This session welcomes paper submissions that address questions such as: 
 Who should play a role in modelling choices (including selection of scales, system features and processes, and modelling tools or algorithms)? 
 What influences model selection? 
 What influences model trust? How can we improve this trust? 
 How well do we reflect on our existing modelling tools, including on their uncertainties and implications for decision making as well as trust in their outputs from users or other parties? 
 What frameworks can support selection of fit for purpose modelling? 
 What are the “tigers” we are missing for the “mice” in our water resource modelling? 
 In what way do different water management problems or contexts demand different modelling needs? 
 The session will include invited papers followed by a panel discussion. 
 Keywords:Water resource modelling; Uncertainty; Decision making 
 CLOSEJ6. Hydroclimate extremes forecasting: from droughts to floods

 In 2024 the Independent Hydroclimate Science Expert Panel provided their long-term guidance for assessing hydroclimate risks to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. Key to this was that the future of modelling must be shaped by a deeper understanding of hydroclimate risks, synthesis of diverse data sources, and improved modelling frameworks to support adaptive water resources management under increasing uncertainty. Existing models and approaches, while valuable, often rely on historical assumptions that may no longer hold under intensifying climate variability and evolving socio-political contexts. 
 This session is focused on new frontiers in water resource modelling, particularly those that seek to represent a broader range of hydroclimate risk drivers—including compound events, non-stationary climate processes, and multi-scale interactions between water and human systems. We aim to showcase work that integrates multiple lines of evidence, such as palaeoclimate reconstructions, remote sensing, and scenario-based approaches to improve decision-relevant insights. Presentations will also discuss ways to improve the robustness, accessibility, and applicability of water resource models under climate change. 
 The format of this session will include a range of solicited speakers at the forefront of the science of hydroclimate modelling and management. However, we also welcome wider submissions that meet the aims of the session. 
 Contributions addressing methods advancements, including hybrid modelling and stochastic approaches are encouraged. Equally critical are discussions on governance and institutional frameworks that ensure modelling remains transparent, inclusive, and actionable for diverse water users, policymakers, and river managers. By fostering collaboration across ecohydrology, climate science, and policy, this session aims to chart a path toward modelling approaches that better support water planning and management in contested and climate-sensitive river basins.

 CLOSEF1. Ecological and environmental modelling using a combination of mathematical and statistical approaches 
 Ecological and environmental modelling carries technical challenges that physical systems do not encounter as strongly. For example, there may be a myriad of plausible models – which range from empirical formulas to mechanistic descriptions – all of which fit the observations well. (By comparison, in physical systems, there may be a smaller group of well-established models.) Part of this problem is the greater uncertainty and stochasticity of ecological and environmental systems compared to physical systems. 
 This session invites talks which use a combination of mathematical and statistical approaches to address the modelling which is required in ecological and environmental systems. Empirical models, mechanistic models, differential equation models, either deterministic or stochastic, agent-based models, statistical models, Bayesian inference, uncertainty propagation, especially when constrained by observations or data, are welcomed. Applications to ecological and environmental systems can be broad or specific to a particular system. We encourage consideration of ecological and/or environmental models for improved understanding and/or forecasting.

 CLOSEF9. Ecological Forecasting: Advancing ecological theory and management in Oceania with near-term forecasts 
 While ecologists have long developed predictive models of natural systems, such models have often had a relatively long time horizon. In contrast, near-term ecological forecasting, on which predictions are made on shorter timescales (days to decades), is a rapidly expanding field. Rapid environmental change, alongside increasing pressure from human activities, provides major challenges for decision-making in natural resource management, and near-term forecasting allows predictive models to be applied to support environmental decision-making on short time scales. Near-term forecasting also allows for an iterative model development-evaluation-improvement cycle that can support rapid advances in basic scientific understanding. However, the shift from longer term modelling to forecasting requires development of new techniques and community capacity-building. Building on the increasing reach of the Ecological Forecasting Initiative’s Oceania chapter, this session aims to bring together practitioners of near-term ecological forecasting to showcase new developments and share methodologies. We welcome presentations on ecological forecasts which seek to deliver predictions of abundance, distribution, and phenology for single species, multispecies, or communities, or predictions of ecological events such as harmful algal blooms, pathogen loads, species eruptions, and coral bleaching.

 CLOSEF12. The Future of Vegetation: Advances in Modelling Plant Function and Distribution 
 Natural and managed vegetation communities around the world are threatened by rapid changes in climate and land use. Anticipating future vegetation function and distribution shifts is critical for enhancing ecosystem resilience. Modelling approaches from local to continental scales provide important insights, including quantification of vegetation productivity, ecosystem health, carbon cycling, and water availability. 
 Models of varying complexity are currently used to address questions around future vegetation change. Statistical approaches project historical climate-distribution dependencies forward, while state-and-transition models impose shifts between ecological conditions induced by predefined triggers. Process-based soil-plant-atmosphere models explicitly simulate biogeochemical cycles, while ecosystem demography models also include cohort establishment, growth, competition, and mortality. It is common for different approaches to produce conflicting results, and no clear consensus has yet emerged on several key questions. For example, it is unknown whether CO2 fertilisation and increases in plant water use efficiency will overcome the negative productivity impacts of increasing drought frequency and severity projected for many regions. It is also unclear whether competition with other species or individual species’ physiological constraints dominate current vegetation distributions. Long-term legacy effects and landscape coevolution add a further layer of uncertainty to these questions. 
 This session will cover diverse approaches to advance understanding of vegetation function and distribution modelling. We welcome presentations on vegetation model development, evaluation, and applications. We encourage submissions that describe innovative approaches for model-data comparisons or leverage modern measurement techniques (e.g., remote sensing, drone-based monitoring).

 CLOSEG3. Climate risk assessment for government and industry: Bridging the gap between climate science and actionable insights for decision makers 
 There is increasing demand for climate risk assessments due to several factors including: 
 New regulatory requirements of annual climate related financial disclosures for medium to large businesses (e.g. ASRS2) 
 Public and private sector management of existing assets and planning future infrastructure needs 
 Emergency managers needing to understand how to prepare for changing hazards 
 Climate scientists have developed sophisticated climate projections under different warming scenarios and under different socioeconomic pathways (i.e. RCPs and SSPs ). These datasets contain information about climate variables including temperature and rainfall for different future time periods and different global warming levels. 
 Impacts from changes in these climate variables are experienced through variations in natural hazards including heatwaves, storms, floods, fires, cyclones and extreme winds. Additionally, their intensity, frequency and/or duration can change into the future. This requires specialised expertise in each of these domains to translate the climate projections into relevant hazard predictions. These hazards can cause direct impact to assets (i.e. damage or destruction) and indirect impacts due to loss of productivity. 
 According to the IPCC definition, Climate risk is defined as the interaction between hazards, exposure, vulnerability and response. For financial decision making, risk is quantified with units of an expected annual cost. Further complexity is introduced through modelling interdependencies between hazard events and the cascading risks between different infrastructure sectors. 
 In this session, we invite practitioners to present novel frameworks and methodologies for bridging the gap between climate science and actionable insights for decision makers in different domains.

While analytical tools and modelling approaches have been progressing at astronomical speeds, now more than ever, the availability of well-curated, quality data is the limiting factor. To overcome this limitation, particularly where data requirements are diverse and span regions, organizations, and contexts, there are strong moves to build approaches for sharing and re-using data and models. This underpins impact by amplifying the value of datasets and through digital products that address specific issues. There are hundreds of well-functioning systems that already share data. However, many of these operate within single organizations and well-defined problem spaces. As the complexity of human, political, and business relationships increases, so does the potential societal impact—and so do the difficulties involved. In this session, we will hear various perspectives from collaborative efforts to build data-sharing systems to support modelling and analytics. By ‘system,’ we mean all aspects of governance and the IT platforms that support governance. 
 Keywords:Federated data 
 CLOSEC4. Open and intelligent modeling and simulation 
 Modelling and simulation are significant methods in exploring dynamic phenomena and processes, analysing global/regional geohypotheses, and supporting decision/policy making. Due to the complexity of modelling issues, traditional modelling and simulation are generally constrained by the comprehensiveness of phenomena, closure of models, inefficient computation, and adaptive capability to dynamic changes. Recently, the exciting emerging and rapid developments in computer technologies, for example, AI, big data, cloud computing and, have provided an efficient and flexible way to aggregate various knowledge and resources dispersed around the world. These advances predictably will significantly promote modelling and simulation to the open and intelligent era, and change the relevant methods, techniques, and applications. 
 This session aims to explore the latest methodologies, technologies, and applications in the field of open and intelligent modelling and simulation. The focus will be on how these achievements (e.g., open modelling frameworks, model and data sharing strategies, artificial intelligence (AI), collaboration methods, and distributed computing techniques) are transforming traditional modelling and simulation practices, enabling more accurate, scalable, and efficient decision-making. 
 Keywords:Modelling frameworks; intelligent modelling; collaborative modelling; sharing and integration, distributed computing 
 CLOSEC3. Digital twins and mixed reality 
 Digital twins are digital “copies” of physical objects, processes or interacting humans which semi-autonomously maintain their likeness through the application of cyber-physical systems. A significant topic in both scientific literature and real-world application over the last several years, digital twins are a critical component in industrial automation; designed to be combined with AI, optimisation and computational modelling technologies in order to decentralise decision making, improve forecasting and automate diagnosis, planning and control processes. Alongside recent improvements in sensing and cyber-physical technologies, mixed reality technologies are a significant driver behind the push to implement digital twins. Mixed reality technologies allow the outputs of digital twins to be visualised interactively alongside their physical counterpart within the operating environment. 
 A growing number of organisations are beginning to incorporate Digital Twins and Mixed Reality technology into their business operations, however, achieving their full potential may require large-scale integration of digital twins across organisations and domains. This conference session will explore applications of Digital Twin and Mixed Reality technologies, examining the state of adoption in Australian industry. 
 Keywords:Digital Twin, Computational Modelling, Simulation, Applications, Workflows, Workspace 
 CLOSEC2. Modelling and simulation of Robotic and Autonomous Systems (RAS) 
 Robotic and Autonomous Systems (RAS) combine physical and virtual capabilities to perform real-world tasks as autonomous members of human-machine teams. The development and safe deployment of RAS is supported and accelerated by modelling and simulation (M&S), which can also validate system performance and build the trust required for effective operation alongside humans. This session will explore papers discussing the application of modelling and simulation to RAS development and deployment. Topics of interest include best practice methods and applications, linkage between simulations of varied fidelity and focus (i.e. Operational Analysis, digital twins, high-fidelity engineering simulations), applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning (including synthetic training data), test and evaluation, verification and validation (TEVV), and building trust in human-machine teams. All relevant topics and authors are welcome, but papers are particularly sought from the Defence RAS ecosystem (industry, academia and government). 
 Keywords:Robotics; Autonomous Systems; Modelling and Simulation; uncrewed systems; AI/ML; test and evaluation; verification and validation 
 CLOSEC1. Using workflow platforms in modelling and simulation 
 Most scientific activities can be thought of as workflows which involve sequences of tasks or actions. These tasks often include obtaining input data, processing activities which are then followed by post-processing operations such as visualisation and analysis in support of decision making. Processing steps may involve use of modelling, simulation or analysis programs and may include the outputs of such models being dynamically fed back into the system. Post processing analysis may involve advanced techniques such as Machine Learning to provide insightful analysis which given the data volumes may not be obtainable via traditional methods. 
 Commercialisation of workflows as software applications or services is often not considered or is considered late in the development process which creates significant hurdles to maximising benefit. Very commonly workflows are created as bespoke combinations of software components linked by manual steps or tasks. The presence of such manual steps increases the cost of performing the activity and limits its reproducibility and its transfer to others (often leaving the IP stranded). They are often also conducted on disparate systems, limiting the possibly of automation and integration. Often workflows and the tasks involved are not well documented. This makes packaging capability for commercial use difficult and can limit the range of users. 
 The use of workflow engines allows scientific workflow to be systematized and automating leading to reduction in cost of creation and use, reducing dependence on specific people and skills, improving collaboration by fostering interoperability of software components and supports improved reliability, reproducibility and commercialisation. 
 This session provides a forum for researchers to explore the opportunities for improvement of their scientific workflow development, to discuss what is modelling and modelling software best practice and to exchange their experiences in using workflow concepts to improve their scientific research and its impact. 
 Keywords:Workflows, software best practice, Workspace, commercialization, stranded IP 
 CLOSEB9. Advances in agent-based modelling and their statistical challenges in biological, ecological and agricultural systems 
 Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) has long been applied to the study of complex phenomena. It has become increasingly popular across many scientific fields including the study of biological, ecological and agricultural systems. Agent-Based models provide a rich environment for the experimentation and analysis of these systems at different levels of complexity by conceptually breaking them down into individual interacting components. However, the likelihoods, the functions that describe the probability of the observed data given parameter values, for these models are not analytically or computationally tractable. This makes statistical inference for these models challenging. 
 This session aims to highlight the advances in ABM approaches applied to the development of simulation systems in biology, ecology and agriculture. Statistical inferential methods for ABM will also be discussed. Submissions addressing the scientific challenges of modelling these systems using the ABM paradigm and novel approaches for dealing with statistical inference of these models are especially welcomed. Areas of interest, not necessarily exhaustive, include geospatial ABMs, hybrid models, model validation and verification, integration with commercial off-the-shelf or open source Geographical Information Systems, optimisation techniques, ABM-enhanced Decision Support Systems, mobile applications, likelihood-free or simulation-based inferential methods for ABMs such as Generalized Bayesian inference, Approximate Bayesian Computation, Bayesian indirect inference integration with machine learning (ML) and active learning techniques.

 CLOSEB8. Innovative Modelling Approaches for Agricultural Systems Sustainability under Climate Change 
 As climate change intensifies, agricultural systems are increasingly challenged by extreme weather events, soil degradation, and the urgent need for resilient crop production strategies. These issues threaten global food security and the livelihoods of millions of farmers. In response, innovative research and technologies have emerged in recent decades, focusing on advanced modelling and climate-smart practices for crop and soil management to enhance agricultural sustainability and productivity. 
 The session will delve into the transformative potential of innovative approaches in addressing climate-related agricultural challenges. It will highlight three key areas: (1) the critical role of integrated modelling by combining biophysical models and climate information, in predicting crop yields under climate change and extreme climate conditions, enabling farmers and policymakers to make informed decisions; (2) the development of techniques including machine learning that allow rapid, accurate, and non-destructive characterization of crop growth, to accelerate modern breeding process and assist in precision management; (3) the exploring of innovative soil management strategies and their regulatory mechanisms to improve soil health, optimize water and carbon dynamics, and support climate mitigation. 
 By integrating diverse innovation modelling techniques in agricultural production, this approach offers actionable insights to optimize soil management, improve crop resilience, and ensure sustainable agricultural practices in the face of a changing climate. The session aims to bridge the gap between scientific research and practical solutions, empowering stakeholders to build more resilient and productive agricultural systems.

 CLOSEB7. Optimising farming systems to improve climate resilience and sustainability under water-constraint environments 
 Climate change has amplified the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, including prolonged droughts and irregular rainfall patterns, leading to significant challenges for farming systems. Water scarcity has emerged as a critical threat to global food security, particularly in regions where agriculture heavily relies on finite freshwater resources. Sustainable agricultural practices and innovative farming system designs are urgently needed to enhance resilience, maintain productivity, and ensure long-term environmental sustainability under these water-constrained conditions. 
 In recent years, advancements in crop modelling, precision agriculture, soil and water management techniques, and climate-resilient cropping systems have offered new opportunities to mitigate the impact of water scarcity on agriculture. However, significant knowledge gaps remain in optimizing these strategies for various agro-ecological contexts and aligning them with broader goals of sustainability and climate resilience. 
 This session aims to: 
 Explore innovative farming system designs and practices that improve water-use efficiency, enhance crop productivity, and reduce environmental footprints under water-constrained environments. 
 Highlight advancements in modelling tools and data-driven approaches for assessing and improving the resilience of farming systems to water stress. 
 Examine the role of climate-smart agriculture, such as drought-tolerant crop varieties, reduced or no-tillage systems, and integrated soil-water-nutrient management practices, in addressing the challenges of water scarcity. 
 Discuss policy frameworks and strategies for scaling up sustainable practices and technologies to improve resilience and sustainability across diverse farming systems. 
 Facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration among researchers, policymakers, and practitioners to develop practical solutions for climate-resilient and water-efficient agriculture.

 CLOSEB6. Integrating data and system knowledge to support decision-making: Advances, applications and lessons learned 
 In an era of rapid change and digitalisation, effective management of agricultural and ecological systems requires moving beyond traditional, siloed quantitative approaches. This has never been clearer as the gap between data and decisions continues to widen, despite more and more data becoming available. Bridging this gap demands robust decision support that integrates and translates diverse data streams and system knowledge into actionable information for decision-makers. Both data-driven and process-based approaches have unique yet complementary roles in achieving this. Data-driven methods, such as machine learning, provide empirical evidence and scalability, while process-based methods, which represent system knowledge in a mathematical framework, enable interpretation and generalizability. 
 This session will share innovative developments and applications of quantitative approaches that integrate data and system knowledge to improve decision-making for agricultural and ecological system management. 
 We welcome submissions that adopt (in no particular order): (i) process-based models in concert with parameter estimation, model evaluation (or ‘validation’), data assimilation, etc.; (ii) data-driven approaches such as reinforcement learning and physics-informed machine learning; and (iii) so-called hybrid approaches. Submissions should emphasize both methodological contributions and their relevance to decision support. Authors are encouraged to share lessons learned from the many challenges in trying to unify data and models (e.g. data-model scale discrepancies, measurement and model error) to inspire future advancements. 
 Keywords:Decision support; Value of information; Data-knowledge integration; Data-model conflict; Multi-method; Sustainability 
 CLOSEB5. Agricultural Systems 
 Agricultural systems comprise a set of components and their interactions that enable the production of food, fibre, and energy from natural resources. Its study must be interdisciplinary and employ systems analysis, encompassing methodologies for diagnosis, assessment, and design of production systems, taking into consideration environmental, social, and economic aspects. 
 This session accepts papers on model and simulation studies that are based on mathematical and biological principles interfacing with specific applications to the agricultural industries. Applications vary from knowledge generation, exploration of specific issues, to the analysis of integrated systems and decision support tools. 
 The papers could encompass cropping, horticultural, livestock, fisheries, and forestry industries, either with a specific or broad focus. For example, a paper may tackle a specific problem within an agricultural system whereas a broad paper may describe and discuss a methodology used to improve the production and profitability of an entire agricultural industry.

 CLOSEB4. APSIM Developments: Livestock, pests and diseases, whole farm modelling, cloud computing, etc. 
 As a modelling platform APSIM is highly flexible. This allows developers to add on components that interact with the crop/vegetation and soil models already in the platform without having to (re)create capability that already exists. This session will concentrate on those new developments. We invite papers on APSIM developments that do not otherwise fit into the APSIM vegetation and soil sessions including papers that review existing capability to identify gaps and needs for future development.

 Keywords:APSIM 
 CLOSEB3. APSIM Developments: Soil modelling capability (water, nutrients, temperature, climatic inputs) 
 In APSIM the soil provides a central focus. Plants, seasons and managers come and go, finding the soil in one state and leaving it in another. This means that the various APSIM soil modules are included in every simulation, playing a critical role in determining the water, nutrient and temperature dynamics that affect so many of the other processes, including development and growth of plants and losses to the environment. In turn, the plants and environmental conditions affect the various soil processes. APSIM’s applications over the past 30+ years have been varied, resulting in the model evolving over time to meet new and changing needs. This applies to the soil modelling capability as well, where an increased focus on environmental impacts of farming, or its role in mitigating these, challenges the model in different ways. In this session of the APSIM Symposium we invite submissions that concern APSIM’s soil modelling capability. These submissions could be reviews that reflect on the existing capability, contributions showcasing current developments, or forward-looking presentations identifying future development needs. All soil processes modelled (or to be modelled) by APSIM are in scope. Soil modelling capability is considered in a wide sense, including, e.g., return flows from plants or better representation of the effects of environmental conditions on soil processes. The focus of the submissions should be on model capability, development or development needs. Submissions on model use and applications are invited in several other MODSIM sessions.

 CLOSEA6. Industrial mathematical modelling and simulation 
 Much decision making in industry is based on rules-of-thumb, which are either validated via mathematical modelling or simulations. The Mathematics-in-Industry Study Group meetings, organised by Australian and New Zealand Industrial and Applied Mathematics, have played an important role in fostering stronger contacts between mathematicians and statisticians and industrial partners. The speakers will discuss some representative examples where the resulting solutions have had considerable subsequent impact. Even in industrial modelling and simulation, a key issue is the management of uncertainty, so that useful rules-of-thumb are identified even though the models on which they are based are only approximations of the reality of the processes being investigated. The management of uncertainty in industrial modelling and simulation is often achieved by identifying an appropriate simple model that encapsulates the answer to the question under consideration. Various examples will be discussed.

 CLOSEA3. Modelling and simulation for trustworthy data science on challenging datasets 
 Modern data science is an engine for decision-making across society, as well as for driving scientific advances across multiple domains and diverse datasets. However, this only highlights an increasing need for data-driven decisions and algorithms to be trustworthy and explainable: untrustworthy algorithms and models can produce erroneous outcomes and potential harms. 
 Modelling and simulation can enhance the trustworthiness of data-driven methods by allowing for the clear articulation of assumptions, frameworks for uncertainty quantification, and the ability to explore scenarios and provide counterfactual explanations. This session aims to bridge the gaps between data-driven methods, modelling and simulation and explore their complementarities. 
 Talks will bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds to explore the intersection of statistical data science, mathematical modelling, and simulation techniques in addressing complex challenges in data science. The focus will be on modelling and simulation methods that deal with challenging datasets exhibiting characteristics like high dimensionality, noise, and missing data. It will explore topics at the interface of modelling and data, such as Bayesian inference, data assimilation, and complex systems. Talks will feature application domains such as climate, social systems, online/offline behaviours, and government/industry applications. 
 Keywords:Data science; trustworthiness; explainability; Bayesian methods; data assimilation; statistical inference 
 CLOSEA2. Advances In Numerical Solutions For Water Resources Models 
 With mounting pressure on scarce water resources, hydrological models including rainfall-runoff, routing, river system and hydrodynamic models are becoming more and more complex to incorporate a broad range of processes. These models are now required to simulate surface water dynamic, but also incorporate groundwater-surface water interactions, floodplain storage, vegetation growth, water extractions or ecological health indicators. At the same time, models are expected to run at short time steps (e.g. hourly), incorporate a broad range of climate scenarios and generate uncertainty estimates via Monte Carlo sampling. Achieving all these goals requires advanced numerical schemes that solve complex model equations while remaining fast and stable under extreme hydro-climate conditions. Numerical improvements benefit both classical models formulated as differential equations and machine learning models which poses significant challenges in terms of formulation and calibration. 
 In addition, despite its fundamental importance in hydrology, numerical analysis is often perceived as an obscure subject by many practitioners, which limits the adoption of efficient algorithms and reduces model performance. Consequently, methods and tools to facilitate user training are of utmost importance to accelerate adoption and ensure steady improvement of water resources simulations. 
 This session invites contributions showcasing the latest innovations in numerical approaches for water resources models. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Software and techniques to accelerate hydrological and hydrodynamic model computations, 
 Acceleration of machine learning model computations, 
 Flexible modelling frameworks, 
 Analytical and Numerical approaches to solve differential equations, 
 Case study of numerical issues in complex hydrological modelling. 
 To promote methods facilitating training and adoption, session conveners will attribute a prize to the best presentation in terms of user training and adoption. Prize will be determined based on simplicity of the method and availability of accessible training material (e.g. spreadsheet version of the model).
