Examples of SoK papers include papers that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence, or provide an extensive and realistic evaluation and comparison of competing approaches to solving specific security problems. 
 SoK papers must include the prefix "SoK:" in the title of the paper and will be reviewed by the full PC. They will be accepted based on their treatment of existing work and value to the community. 
 Instructions for Authors 
 ACISP 2025 will have two rounds of submission. Round one will be on 6 Nov 2024. Round two will be on 19 February 2025. The first round will have the results including reject, major revision, and accept. For the major revision, we encourage authors to submit the updated manuscripts to round two. Round two only includes accept and reject.
