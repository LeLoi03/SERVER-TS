 SCAM 2025 
 The aim of thehref="http://www.ieee-scam.org" - IEEE International Conference on Source Code Analysis & Manipulation
(SCAM) is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on theory, techniques and applications that concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of computer systems. While much attention in the wider software engineering community is properly directed towards other aspects of systems development and evolution, such as specification, design, and requirements engineering, it is the source code that contains the only precise description of the behavior of the system. The analysis and manipulation of source code thus remains a pressing concern. 
 For the purpose of clarity, ‘source code’ is taken to mean any fully executable description of a software system. It is therefore so-construed as to include machine code, very high level languages and executable graphical representations of systems. The term ‘analysis’ is taken to mean any automated or semi automated procedure which takes source code and yields insight into its meaning. The term ‘manipulation’ is taken to mean any automated or semi-automated procedure which takes and returns source code. 
 — Steering Committee Charter 
 The 25th IEEE International Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2025) will be held on September 7-8 in Auckland, New Zealand, co-located withhref="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsme-2025" - ICSME 2025

 Call for papers 
 The 25th IEEE International Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2025) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on theory, techniques, and applications that concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of software systems. The term “source code” refers to any fully executable description of a software system, such as machine code, (very) high-level languages, and executable graphical representations of systems. The term “analysis” refers to any (semi-)automated procedure that yields insight into source code, while “manipulation” refers to any automated or semi-automated procedure that takes and returns source code. While much attention in the wider software engineering community is directed towards other aspects of systems development and evolution, such as specification, design, and requirements engineering, it is the source code that contains the only precise description of the behavior of a system. Thus, the analysis and manipulation of source code remains a critical area of research from which SCAM 2025 solicits high-quality submissions. 
 href="#covered-topics-and-paper-formats" - Covered Topics and Paper Formats
We welcome submission of papers that describe original and significant work in the field of source code analysis and manipulation. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 abstract interpretation 
 bad smell detection 
 bug location and prediction 
 clone detection 
 concern, concept, and feature localization and mining 
 decompilation 
 energy efficient source code 
 natural language analysis of source code artifacts 
 program comprehension 
 program slicing 
 program transformation and refactoring 
 repository, revision, and change analysis 
 security vulnerability analysis 
 source level metrics 
 source level optimization 
 source-level testing and verification 
 static and dynamic analysis 
 SCAM explicitly solicits results from any theoretical or technological domain that can be applied to these and similar topics. Submitted papers should describe original, unpublished, and significant work and must not have been previously accepted for publication nor be concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop. 
 Papers must not exceed 12 pages (the last 2 pages can be used for references only) and must conform to the IEEE proceedings paper format guidelines. Templates in Latex and Word are available on IEEE’s website. All submissions must be in English and should be submitted electronically in PDF format. Submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee, judging the paper on its novelty, quality, importance, evaluation, and scientific rigor. If the paper is accepted, at least one author must register for the conference and present the paper. All authors, reviewers, and organizers are expected to uphold the IEEE Code of Conduct. Failure to do so may lead to a (desk) rejection of the paper. 
 href="#submission-guidelines" - Submission guidelines
All submissions must be in English and should be submitted electronically in PDF format using EasyChair. 
 Papers must not exceed 12 pages, and the last 2 pages can be used for references only. 
 Papers must conform to the IEEE proceedings paper format guidelines. Templates in Latex and Word are available on IEEE’s website. 
 All submissions must be in English and should be submitted electronically in PDF format. 
 Submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee, judging the paper on its novelty, presentation quality, importance, soundness, and the quality of its evaluation. 
 If the paper is accepted, at least one author must register for the conference and present the paper. 
 All authors, reviewers, and organizers are expected to uphold the IEEE Code of Conduct. Failure to do so may lead to a (desk) rejection of the paper. 
 Double-blind Review 
 We follow a double-blind reviewing process. Submitted papers must adhere to the following rules: 
 Author names and affiliations must be omitted. (The track co-chairs will check compliance before reviewing begins.) 
 References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not “We build on our previous work…” but rather “We build on the work of…”) 
 If the program chairs find that the authors did not respect the rules of double-blind review they can decide to (desk) reject the paper. 
 Artifact Evaluation 
 ICSME, VISSOFT, and SCAM have joined once more forces and present a single Artifact Evaluation Track for the three venues. We invite authors of any paper accepted to SCAM 2025 to submit artifacts associated with their papers for evaluation. Papers with artifacts that meet the review criteria will be awarded badges, noting their contributions to open science in software engineering. 
 More information on the Call for Papers of the Joint Artifact Evaluation Track will be available at the ICSME 2025 web page (href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsme-2025" - https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsme-2025
). 
 Proceedings 
 All accepted papers will appear in the proceedings which will be available through the IEEE Digital Library.
