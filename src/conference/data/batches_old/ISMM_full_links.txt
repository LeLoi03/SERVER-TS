 Call for Papers 
 Update 2025-03-06:One week submission extension, submissions now due 2025-03-18 (AoE UTC-12h) 
 Continuing from ISMM 2024, we are excited to announce the continued expanded scope of ISMM this year to encourage submissions and participation from related fields such ascomputer architectureandcomputer systemsin addition to our core PL community! 
 The 2025 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2025) is soliciting full-length submissions covering new work on all memory management related topics in both software and hardware (and their cooperation), as well as papers presenting confirmations or refutations of important prior results. In addition to regular papers, traditionally submitted to ISMM, we also invite submissions of the following kinds: 
 Surveys and comparative analyses that shed new light on previously published techniques. 
 Practitioner reports, describing experience with memory management in production. Such papers are not expected to provide novel research contributions, but they should not have been previously published. 
 Intellectual abstracts, where researchers share designs, algorithms, or theory that may be interesting to the memory management community, but not yet evaluated. 
 Please indicate whether the paper is a regular paper, a survey, a practitioner report, or an intellectual abstract, by using a subtitle. For example, for a regular paper, include on of the following on the line below the title line:\subtitle{This submission is a regular paper},\subtitle{This submission is a survey},\subtitle{This submission is a practitioner report}, or\subtitle{This submission is an intellectual abstract}. 
 ISMM 2025 will be colocated withhref="https://pldi25.sigplan.org/" - PLDI 2025
. 
 Areas of interest include but are not limited to (in no particular order): 
 Garbage collection algorithms and implementations 
 Memory allocation and de-allocation 
 Memory system design and analysis (both software and hardware) 
 Hardware support for memory management 
 Memory management for large-scale data-intensive systems 
 Memory management at datacenter and cloud scales 
 Formal analysis and verification of memory management algorithms 
 Compiler analyses to aid memory management 
 Tools to analyze memory usage and characteristics of programs 
 Empirical analysis of memory intensive programs 
 Formal analysis and verification of memory intensive programs 
 Memory management for machine learning systems 
 Programming and management of emerging or persistent memories 
 Caches, memory controllers, memory hierarchies and their management 
 Cache coherence and memory consistency 
 Processing in memory (including processing near and using memory) 
 Memory technology and architecture (SRAM, DRAM, flash, NVM, emerging technologies) 
 Security and privacy of memory systems 
 Robustness of memory systems 
 Low-latency and low-energy memory systems 
 The symposium welcomes industry practitioners presenting their recent practice and findings in memory management related to real-world deployments.

Formatting Instructions 
 All papers must be submitted on-line in Portable Document Format (PDF). 
 Papers should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format. Each paper should have no more than 12 pages, excluding bibliography, in 10pt font. There is no limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g.,[52]. Submissions should be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper. These requirements are all the same as in the previous years. 
 Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected. 
 Make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale. 
 Appendices should not be part of the paper, but should be submitted as supplementary material. Supplementary material should also be anonymized, as described below. 
 As explained in more detail athref="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author" - http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author
, authors should use the sigplan subformat of the acmart format. Please note the following: The first two lines should be: 
 \documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart} \settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}The default citation style is numeric. 
 Do notmess with the class file or settings to try to sneak in additional space. (Conversely, you may toggle the printccs and printacmref flags if you wish, but these changes will consume space.) 
 Do notuse the PACMPL files or format; ISMM is not using them. However, the template files were designed to make migrating a paper from one format to the other as simple as possible. 
 Double-Blind Reviewing 
 ISMM uses double-blind reviewing. This means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. These are firm submission requirements. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. 
 An earlier FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs –href="https://pldi23.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2023-pldi#FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing" - https://pldi23.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2023-pldi#FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing
. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, or any cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ, please contact the Program Chairs. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Program Chairs than to risk summary rejection. 
 Declaring Conflicts 
 When submitting the paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years). 
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair. 
 Publication Date 
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference.The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.(For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.) 
 href="#author-response" - Author Response
The author response process will occur in April 2025 (see Important Dates on thehref="https://conf.researchr.org/home/ismm-2025" - main page
when published), and will give the authors an opportunity to respond to factual errors in reviews before the Program Committee meets to make its decisions. The committee may, but need not, respond to the author response or revise reviews at or after the committee meeting.

 Welcome to the home page of the 2025 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2025)! ISMM is the premier forum dedicated to research in memory management, covering the areas of memory performance, allocator design, garbage collection, architectural support for memory management, persistent memories, emerging memory technologies, and more. 
 ISMM’25 will held in-person as part of PLDI’25, sharing the venue and activities. 
 Code of Conduct 
 ISMM follows theACM Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities. Please familiarize yourself with thepolicyandguide for reporting unacceptable behavior. 
 Call for Papers 
 Update 2025-03-06:One week submission extension, submissions now due 2025-03-18 (AoE UTC-12h) 
 Continuing from ISMM 2024, we are excited to announce the continued expanded scope of ISMM this year to encourage submissions and participation from related fields such ascomputer architectureandcomputer systemsin addition to our core PL community! 
 The 2025 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2025) is soliciting full-length submissions covering new work on all memory management related topics in both software and hardware (and their cooperation), as well as papers presenting confirmations or refutations of important prior results. In addition to regular papers, traditionally submitted to ISMM, we also invite submissions of the following kinds: 
 Surveys and comparative analyses that shed new light on previously published techniques. 
 Practitioner reports, describing experience with memory management in production. Such papers are not expected to provide novel research contributions, but they should not have been previously published. 
 Intellectual abstracts, where researchers share designs, algorithms, or theory that may be interesting to the memory management community, but not yet evaluated. 
 Please indicate whether the paper is a regular paper, a survey, a practitioner report, or an intellectual abstract, by using a subtitle. For example, for a regular paper, include on of the following on the line below the title line:\subtitle{This submission is a regular paper},\subtitle{This submission is a survey},\subtitle{This submission is a practitioner report}, or\subtitle{This submission is an intellectual abstract}. 
 ISMM 2025 will be colocated withhref="https://pldi25.sigplan.org/" - PLDI 2025
. 
 Areas of interest include but are not limited to (in no particular order): 
 Garbage collection algorithms and implementations 
 Memory allocation and de-allocation 
 Memory system design and analysis (both software and hardware) 
 Hardware support for memory management 
 Memory management for large-scale data-intensive systems 
 Memory management at datacenter and cloud scales 
 Formal analysis and verification of memory management algorithms 
 Compiler analyses to aid memory management 
 Tools to analyze memory usage and characteristics of programs 
 Empirical analysis of memory intensive programs 
 Formal analysis and verification of memory intensive programs 
 Memory management for machine learning systems 
 Programming and management of emerging or persistent memories 
 Caches, memory controllers, memory hierarchies and their management 
 Cache coherence and memory consistency 
 Processing in memory (including processing near and using memory) 
 Memory technology and architecture (SRAM, DRAM, flash, NVM, emerging technologies) 
 Security and privacy of memory systems 
 Robustness of memory systems 
 Low-latency and low-energy memory systems 
 The symposium welcomes industry practitioners presenting their recent practice and findings in memory management related to real-world deployments.

Formatting Instructions 
 All papers must be submitted on-line in Portable Document Format (PDF). 
 Papers should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format. Each paper should have no more than 12 pages, excluding bibliography, in 10pt font. There is no limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g.,[52]. Submissions should be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper. These requirements are all the same as in the previous years. 
 Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected. 
 Make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale. 
 Appendices should not be part of the paper, but should be submitted as supplementary material. Supplementary material should also be anonymized, as described below. 
 As explained in more detail athref="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author" - http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author
, authors should use the sigplan subformat of the acmart format. Please note the following: The first two lines should be: 
 \documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart} \settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}The default citation style is numeric. 
 Do notmess with the class file or settings to try to sneak in additional space. (Conversely, you may toggle the printccs and printacmref flags if you wish, but these changes will consume space.) 
 Do notuse the PACMPL files or format; ISMM is not using them. However, the template files were designed to make migrating a paper from one format to the other as simple as possible. 
 Double-Blind Reviewing 
 ISMM uses double-blind reviewing. This means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. These are firm submission requirements. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. 
 An earlier FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs –href="https://pldi23.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2023-pldi#FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing" - https://pldi23.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2023-pldi#FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing
. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, or any cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ, please contact the Program Chairs. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Program Chairs than to risk summary rejection. 
 Declaring Conflicts 
 When submitting the paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years). 
 Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair. 
 Publication Date 
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference.The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.(For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.) 
 href="#author-response" - Author Response
The author response process will occur in April 2025 (see Important Dates on thehref="https://conf.researchr.org/home/ismm-2025" - main page
when published), and will give the authors an opportunity to respond to factual errors in reviews before the Program Committee meets to make its decisions. The committee may, but need not, respond to the author response or revise reviews at or after the committee meeting.
