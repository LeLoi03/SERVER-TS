The 15th International Conference on Emerging Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks (EUSPN-2024) is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks related areas. The EUSPN-2024 will be held in Leuven, Belgium on October 28-30, 2024. The EUSPN-2024 will be held in conjunction withthe 14th International Conference on Current and Future Trends of Information and Communication Technologies in Healthcare (ICTH-2024). 
 Leuvenis the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in Belgium. It is located about 25 kilometres (16 miles) east of Brussels. It is the 10th largest municipality in Belgium and the fourth in Flanders. Leuven is home to the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, the largest and oldest university of the Low Countries and the oldest Catholic university still in existence. The related university hospital of UZ Leuven, is one of the largest hospitals of Europe. The city is also known for being the headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer and one of the five largest consumer-goods companies in the world. 
 Leuven's Town Hall is one of the best-known Gothic town halls worldwide and Leuven's pride and joy. It took three architects and thirty years to build it. Leuven's 'Hall of Fame' features 236 statues, which were only added to the façade after 1850. There are 220 men and 16 women in total. On the bottom floor are famous Leuven scientists, artists and historical figures, dressed in Burgundian garb. The first floor is reserved for the patron saints of the various parishes of Leuven. Above them the façade is adorned by the counts and dukes of Brabant while the towers primarily feature biblical figures.
