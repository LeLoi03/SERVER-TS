 WELCOME TO THE IEEE ISORC 2025Last Updates: 
 Authors of selected papers from ISORC 2025 will be invited to submit an extended version of their work for theSpecial Issue on AI-Driven Real-Time Distributed Computing for the Edge-Cloud Continuumreview and possible publication in theElsevier Journal of Systems Architecture: Embedded Software Design (JSA). 
 IEEE ISORCwas founded in 1998 (with its first meeting in Kyoto, Japan) to address research into the application of real-time object-oriented distributed technology. Since then, ISORC has continually evolved to meet the latest challenges faced by researchers and practitioners in the real-time domain, with an emphasis on object-, component- and service-oriented systems and solutions. 
 ISORC is asingle-track and single-blind conference,with a lively community. We have hosted a number of associated workshops, doctoral symposium, dissertation digest and are proud of our spirit of openness. We seek to encourage diverse views and new approaches to all Real-Time Issues and Challenges for novel applications and systems in RT computing issues. 
 Papers are to be submitted through thehref="https://isorc25.hotcrp.com/" - HotCRP system
. 
 For our 28th symposium,we are meeting in Toulouse,'The Pink City' , France, fromMay 26 - 28, 2025.
