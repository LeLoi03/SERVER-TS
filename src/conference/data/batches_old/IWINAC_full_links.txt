 Abstract 
 Schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex mental disorder, hallmarked by symptoms including delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, cognitive impairments, and diminished motivation. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have become a critical tool for clinicians and psychologists in diagnosing SZ. Nonetheless, interpreting EEG data to diagnose SZ presents significant challenges for specialists, leading to increased interest in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) for early detection. This study introduces a novel approach for SZ detection from EEG signals utilizing a transformer-based architecture. The methodology encompasses dataset selection, preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification phases. The RepOD dataset was employed for all simulations. Preprocessing entails filtering, normalization, and segmenting into time windows. Following this, a one-dimensional (1D) transformer architecture, incorporating various activation functions, is applied to extract features from the preprocessed EEG signals. In the architecture’s final layer, the Softmax activation function is utilized for classifying the data. The performance of the proposed model is assessed using a K-Fold crossvalidation strategy, with K set to 10. The proposed method achieved a maximum accuracy of 97.62% in diagnosing schizophrenia (SZ), underscoring its potential efficacy in SZ diagnosis.

 Overview 
 Abstract 
 Neuroimaging techniques have had a major impact on medical science, allowing advances in the research of many neurological diseases and improving their diagnosis. In this context, multimodal neuroimaging approaches, based on the neurovascular coupling phenomenon, exploit their individual strengths to provide complementary information on the neural activity of the brain cortex. This work proposes a novel method for combining electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near–infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore the functional activity of the brain processes related to low-level language processing of skilled and dyslexic seven-year-old readers. We have transformed EEG signals into image sequences considering the interaction between different frequency bands by means of cross-frequency coupling (CFC), and applied an activation mask sequence obtained from the local functional brain activity inferred from simultaneously recorded fNIRS signals. Thus, the resulting image sequences preserve spatial and temporal information of the communication and interaction between different neural processes and provide discriminative information that enables differentiation between controls and dyslexic subjects.

We have transformed EEG signals into image sequences considering the interaction between different frequency bands by means of cross-frequency coupling (CFC), and applied an activation mask sequence obtained from the local functional brain activity inferred from simultaneously recorded fNIRS signals. Thus, the resulting image sequences preserve spatial and temporal information of the communication and interaction between different neural processes and provide discriminative information that enables differentiation between controls and dyslexic subjects. 
 AB - Neuroimaging techniques have had a major impact on medical science, allowing advances in the research of many neurological diseases and improving their diagnosis. In this context, multimodal neuroimaging approaches, based on the neurovascular coupling phenomenon, exploit their individual strengths to provide complementary information on the neural activity of the brain cortex. This work proposes a novel method for combining electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near–infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to explore the functional activity of the brain processes related to low-level language processing of skilled and dyslexic seven-year-old readers. We have transformed EEG signals into image sequences considering the interaction between different frequency bands by means of cross-frequency coupling (CFC), and applied an activation mask sequence obtained from the local functional brain activity inferred from simultaneously recorded fNIRS signals. Thus, the resulting image sequences preserve spatial and temporal information of the communication and interaction between different neural processes and provide discriminative information that enables differentiation between controls and dyslexic subjects.
