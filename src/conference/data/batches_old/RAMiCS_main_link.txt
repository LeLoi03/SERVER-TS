 Since 1994, the RAMiCS conference series has been the main venue for research on relation algebras, Kleene algebras and similar algebraic formalisms, and their applications as conceptual and methodological tools in computer science and beyond. 
 Theoretical aspects include semigroups, residuated lattices semirings, Kleene algebras, relation algebras, quantales and other algebras; their connections with program logics and other logics; their use in the theories of automata concurrency, formal languages, games, networks and programming languages; the development of algebraic, algorithmic category-theoretic, coalgebraic and proof-theoretic methods for these theories; their formalisation with theorem provers. 
 Applications include tools and techniques for program correctness, specification and verification; quantitative and qualitative models and semantics of computing systems and processes; algorithm design, automated reasoning, network protocol analysis, social choice, optimisation and control.

 Seethe AiML local information sitefor more.Safety and Inclusivity 
 The AiML+RAMiCS Safety and Inclusivity Team serves as the main point of contact at the conferences for any issues related to safety, harassment, and threatening behaviour. If you have any questions or concerns about these or related issues, we encourage you to speak to a member of the Safety and Inclusivity Team, who can be identified by a blue sticker on their conference badge. The team members are Marta Bílková, Wesley Fussner, and Filip Jankovec. 
 Call for papers 
 href="https://link.springer.com/conference/ramics" - 
All papers will be peer-reviewed by at least three referees. The proceedings will be published in an LNCS volume by Springer, ready at the conference. Submissions must not be published or under review for publication elsewhere. Submissions must be in English using a PDF not exceeding16 pages(excluding references) in LNCS style. 
 Submission is via EasyChair athref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ramics2024" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ramics2024
Submissions must provide sufficient information to judge their merits. Additional material may be provided in a clearly marked appendix or by a reference to a manuscript on a web site. Experimental data, software or mathematical components for theorem provers must be available in sufficient detail for referees. Deviation from these requirements may lead to rejection. 
 One author of each accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference. Accepted papers must be produced with LaTeX. Formatting instructions and LNCS style files are available athref="http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html" - http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html
. 
 As for earlier RAMiCS conferences, we intend to publish a journal special issue with revised and extended versions of a selection of the best papers. 
 RAMICS history 
 RAMiCS has been taking place since 1994, first under the acronym ofRelMiCS("Relational Methods in Computer Science") and, after uniting with theAKAconferences ("Applications of Kleene Algebra") as RAMiCS since 2009.
