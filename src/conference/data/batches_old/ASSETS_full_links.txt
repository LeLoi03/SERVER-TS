 The International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility 
 Current conference:href="https://assets21.sigaccess.org/" - ASSETS 2024
Computer and Information Technologies have redesigned the way modern society operates. In particular, they have identified new avenues to assist individuals with special needs and provided tools and resources to alleviate the traditional barriers encountered by persons with disabilities. For example, speech generation systems have assisted persons with visual disabilities, voice recognition has helped people with motor impairments, multi-modal presentations have been shown to be effective in helping people with learning disabilities understand information. 
 The ASSETS series of conferences explores the potential of Computer and Information Technologies to support and include individuals with disabilities, and those around them. ASSETS is the premier forum for presenting innovative research on the design and use of both mainstream and specialised assistive technologies by people with disabilities. Sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Special Interest Group on Accessible Computing, ASSETS includes formal paper sessions, demonstrations, posters, a doctoral consortium, and a student research competition. The single track and friendly atmosphere make ASSETS the ideal venue to meet researchers, practitioners, developers and policy-makers to exchange ideas, share information, and make new contacts.
