Conference ITP:

16th International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving 
 ITP '25 
 part ofhref="../index.html" - FroCoS/ITP/TABLEAUX '25
Reykjavik, Iceland, 27 September-3 October 2025 
 Background 
 The ITP conference series is concerned with all aspects of interactive theorem proving, ranging from theoretical foundations to implementation aspects and applications in program verification, security, and the formalization of mathematics. This will be the 16th conference in the ITP series, while predecessor conferences from which it has evolved have been going since 1988.

 Important dates 
  
 Abstract submission deadline: | March 12, 2025 
 Paper submission deadline: | March 19, 2025 
 Author notification: | May 23, 2025 
 Camera-ready copy due: | June 27, 2025 
 Topics 
 ITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects of interactive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to, the following:formalizations of computational models 
 improvements in interactive theorem prover technology 
 formalizations of mathematics 
 integration with automated provers and other symbolic tools 
 verification of security algorithms 
 industrial applications of interactive theorem provers 
 formal specification and verification of hardware and software 
 user interfaces for interactive theorem provers 
 use of theorem provers in education 
 concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls) 
 Paper categories and submission 
 We welcome regular papers and short papers. Submission for both is lightweight double-blind. This means that (1) author names and institutions must be omitted using the theanonymousoption of the document class, (2) references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person and (3) the identity of authors will be reveiled to reviewers once they have submitted a first draft of their review.The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing it more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as usual. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. 
 Regular papers must: 
 be no more than 16 pages in length excluding bibliographic references 
 not include an appendix, and 
 be in LIPIcs format. 
 Short papers can be used to describe interesting work that is still ongoing and not fully mature. Accepted short papers will be published in the main proceedings and will be presented as short talks. Short papers must 
 be no more than 6 pages in length excluding bibliographic references and may consist of an extended abstract, 
 have the phrase "Short paper" as a subtitle, 
 not include an appendix, and 
 be in LIPIcs format. 
 Both categories of papers must be prepared in LaTeX using thehref="https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author" - lipics-v2021
    style (v2021.1.3)
and must be submitted electronically as pdf files throughhref="https://itp25.hotcrp.com" - HotCRP
. 
 All submissions are expected to be accompanied by supplementary material containing verifiable evidence of a suitable implementation, such as the source files of a formalization for the proof assistant used.Two forms of supplementary material may be submitted: (1) Anonymous supplementary material is made available to the reviewers before they submit their first-draft reviews. (2) Non-anonymous supplementary material is made available to the reviewers after they have submitted their first-draft reviews and have learned the identity of the authors. We strongly encourage anonymous supplementary material whenever possible. 
 Publication 
 The conference proceedings will be published in Dagstuhl Publishing'sLeibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs)series in Gold Open Access under theCC-BY-4.0 license. 
 Registration and Participation 
 Remote attendance of the conference will be possible for a low or no fee. For all accepted papers, at least one author must pay a full registration fee. For presenters we strongly encourage physical participation since coming to the conference benefits the dissemination of the paper and the overall quality of the conference. Remote talks are only possible if agreed with the organizers by the registration deadline, but still one author must pay the full registration fee.
