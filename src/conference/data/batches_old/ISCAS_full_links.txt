 DescriptionNewsOrganizersDocumentsDescription 
 Thehref="https://2025.ieee-iscas.org/" - IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)
is the flagship conference of the IEEE Circuits and Systems (CAS) Society and the world’s premiere forum for researchers in the active fields of theory, design and implementation of circuits and systems. This is accomplished through technical conference sessions, poster sessions, live demonstration sessions, and publication of conference papers. 
 ISCAS 2025 will be driven by the theme “Technology Disruption and Society” aiming to emphasize the potential of the CAS Society to find innovative solutions to challenges facing society today. Unless conditions change substantially over the coming year, ISCAS 2025 will be an in-person event and authors are expected to be onsite to present their papers.
