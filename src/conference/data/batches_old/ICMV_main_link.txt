 Welcome to ICMV 2025, October 19-22, 2025 
 Paris, France 
 202518thInternational Conference on Machine Vision. 
 We are delighted to invite researchers, academics, and industry professionals to the18th International Conference on Machine Vision (ICMV 2025), which will take place fromOctober 19-22, 2025, in the vibrant city ofParis, France. Since its inception in 2007 (Islamabad), ICMV has evolved into a premier platform for exploring the latest advancements in machine vision and its transformative applications.Organized by esteemed institutions such as University of Stuttgart, University of Barcelona, and The Federal Research Center "Computer Science and Control" of the RAS, with support from globally renowned organizations including Aberystwyth University, Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology, Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Etienne, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, and Sfax University, ICMV 2025 promises a rich, interdisciplinary experience. Building on the momentum from previous editions held in prestigious locations like Edinburgh (2024), Rome (2022), and Amsterdam (2019), this year's conference will delve into the latest research, theories, and applications that are driving innovation in machine vision. 
  
 ICMV 2025 will emphasize the role of machine vision as a core driver of digital transformation, tackling topics such as: Theoretical advancements and new algorithms in image processing and computer vision. Applications in industrial automation, quality inspection, medical diagnostics, robotics, and more. Integrative technologies enabled by mobile and wireless devices. With a focus on cutting-edge research and practical implementations, the conference will provide a platform for leading minds to collaborate, share ideas, and drive progress in this dynamic field. 
  
 We encourage the submission of high-quality, original research papers that address all aspects of machine vision, including theory, principles, algorithms, practices, and applications. Selected papers will be presented through oral sessions, poster presentations, and invited talks, fostering an interactive and engaging environment. 
 Join us inParis, the city of lights and innovation, to connect with experts from around the world and shape the future of machine vision!
