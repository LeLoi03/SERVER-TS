Call for Papers information:


The International Test Conference (ITC) is the world’s premier venue dedicated 
to the electronic test of devices, boards and systems—covering the complete 
cycle from design verification, design- for-test, design-for-manufacturing, silicon 
debug,  manufacturing  test,  system  test,  diagnosis,  reliability  and  failure 
analysis, and back to process and design improvement. 
Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished papers describing recent 
work in the field of testing and testable design. Of particular interest are works 
dedicated to the topics listed on the right and/or works focused on special tracks 
such as Automotive  Reliability, Reliability of  AI  HW  and  usage  of  AI  for 
Testing, 3D/2.5D and Chiplet Testing, or HW Security. Authors are also invited 
to submit practical, industry-oriented papers.  
A special  industrial  case-study  track is dedicated to papers that enable 
others to learn best industrial practices.  
Submissions must include: 
Title of paper.
Name, affiliation, e-mail address of each author.  (Double blind review is 
not required).
The corresponding author(s). ITC will communicate with the corresponding 
author(s).
One topic from the topic list.
An electronic copy of a complete paper of 6~10 pages for regular
papers (including regular Industrial case-study papers) or 3~5
pages for short Industrial Practices papers.
An abstract of maximum 100 words to be entered online.
 ITC  maintains  a  competitive  selection  process  for  technical  papers. 
Submissions  must  clearly  describe  the  status  of  the  reported  work,  its 
contribution, novelty and/or significance. Supporting data, results (priority is 
often given to papers with results from real designs) and conclusions, and 
references to prior work must also be included. 
Paper title/abstract due: March 7, 2025 
Paper PDF due: April 2, 2025 (Extended) 
Author notification: May 13, 2025 
Final manuscript due: 
May 31, 2025
 
Test Week tutorial and workshop proposals are also welcomed. Deadlines and 
other  information  about  proposals  can  be  obtained  from  TTTC  at:
