Welcome to MUM 2025 
 The International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia (MUM) is a leading annual international conference, which provides a forum for presenting the latest research results on mobile and ubiquitous multimedia. The conference brings together experts from both academia and industry for a fruitful exchange of ideas and discussion on future challenges, in a comfortable and effective single-track conference format. 
 The 24th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia (MUM 2025) will be held in Enna, Italy, Dec 1 — 4, 2025. The conference is currently being planned as an in-person event only. Still, the organization is continuously monitoring travel and health restrictions and may reassess the possibility for virtual or hybrid options. 
 In addition to the peer-reviewed accepted papers, the conference program will also include keynote presentations, posters, and demos, among other tracks. The conference will also have a co-located doctoral school. The technical program will be complemented by several social events to facilitate informal discussions and networking among the conference attendees and invited guests.

 MUM 2024, the 23rd International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia 
 Stockholm, Sweden, December 1-4, 2024 
 As part of the Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia (MuM) conference, we conduct a joint seminar for PhD students from the various sub-disciplines related to mobile media, ubiquitous computing, and human-computer interaction. The doctoral consortium (DC) will take place on-site on Sunday, Dec 1, 2024, before the main conference. 
 The DC will be an opportunity for a small group of PhD students to meet and discuss their work with each other and with a panel of experienced researchers in the field, in an informal and interactive setting. We welcome applications from current PhD students studying in any area of relevance to the MUM community. PhD students at any stage of the PhD can apply. Depending on the stage the DC may provide helpful feedback for narrowing down a topic, discussing methodological and technical aspects of the ongoing research, or on the framing and presentation of the results in a thesis. 
 To apply for participation in the DC, we ask you to submit a 2-4 pages long paper inhref="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow" - Word or LaTeX (using the ACM Primary Article Template)
. The paper should describe the context and motivation of your PhD research, the problem and aims that drive your research and your research objectives, hypothesis, and/or questions. It should further describe and explain your (proposed) research approach and methods, and include a discussion of results you may already have. Please also include the context of your PhD, i.e. the university programme in which you conduct your PhD, the status of your PhD, the expected completion date, and any other relevant information on your PhD situation. 
 Submissions will not be peer-reviewed. We will select students for participation with a view of prioritising those who would likely benefit most. Accepted students will be asked to prepare a presentation on their PhD research, and a poster which will be included in the MUM 2024 poster track. Submissions must be submitted via e-mail tohref="mailto:dc2024@mum-conf.org" - dc2024@mum-conf.org
. For accepted doctoral consortium submissions, the author can select if they want the submission to be included in the conference proceedings. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 Your submission should be 2-4 pages. Please use the template and include the following: 
 Your name, Advisor(s) name(s), and the university where you are conducting your doctoral work. Submissions should NOT be anonymous. 
 Current year of study and projected completion date (plus information about the regulations of your PhD program regarding length, any part-time study, etc.) 
 Please address the following questions if applicable for you research: 
 Which problem do you solve? Why is this problem important? What do you want to find out? 
 Which steps do you plan to take, and how do you evaluate your results? 
 Which research papers (not more than 3) are related most to your research? How does your work differ? 
 What have you found out so far? What’s next? 
 What’s still missing? Where do you need help? Where would you want to collaborate? 
 Submissions must be submitted via e-mail tohref="mailto:dc2024@mum-conf.org" - dc2024@mum-conf.org.
