 KEIR@ECIR 2024: The First Workshop on Knowledge-Enhanced Information Retrieval 
 on the 46th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR'24) 
 Glasgow, Scotland: 28th March, 2024 
 About the workshop 
 In the field of information retrieval (IR), harnessing knowledge from external knowledge bases, such as Knowledge Graphs and Wikipedia, has emerged as a promising avenue for improving the effectiveness and the interpretability of IR systems. These external knowledge bases offer valuable information that empowers IR models to make more accurate predictions. The infusion of external knowledge bases into IR models can provide enhanced ranking results and greater interpretability, offering substantial advancements in the field. 
  
 The First Knowledge-Enhanced Information Retrieval workshop (KEIR @ ECIR 2024) will serve as a platform to bring together researchers from academia and industry to explore and discuss various aspects of knowledge-enhanced information retrieval systems, such as models, techniques, data collection and evaluation. The workshop aims to not only deliberate upon the advantages and hurdles intrinsic to the development of knowledge-enhanced PLMs, IR models and RecSys models but also to facilitate in-depth discussions concerning the same. 
 Call for Papers 
 This workshop holds a steadfast commitment to fostering collaboration among researchers engaged in the realm of knowledge integration for IR, RecSys and NLP. We invite submissions regarding different aspects of knowledge-enhanced information retrieval systems. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to: 
 Knowledge-enhanced information retrieval models. 
 Knowledge-enhanced approaches for query processing, including query parsing, query expansion relevance feedback, and query reformulation. 
 Knowledge-enhanced recommendation models. 
 Knowledge-enhanced language models for retrieval. 
 Data augmentation for knowledge-enhanced information retrieval. 
 Knowledge retrieval from unstructured data and structured data. 
 Applications of knowledge-enhanced retrievals, such as dialogue systems, question answering summarisation and other domain-specific applications. 
 Data collection for knowledge-enhanced information retrieval. 
 Evaluation methodologies for knowledge-enhanced retrieval. 
 The interpretability and analysis of knowledge-enhanced models for IR, including potential biases and ethical considerations. 
 We invite authors to submit papers written in English. Submissions may range in length from a minimum of 6 pages to a maximum of 12 pages; however, references and supplementary materials may exceed this page count without limitation. In order to facilitate a double-blind review process, authors must ensure that submissions are fully anonymized. Please note that we do not impose a specific anonymity period prior to submission. 
  
 The papers (.pdf format) should be submitted using the EasyChair submission system athref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=keirecir2024" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=keirecir2024
. Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates to prepare the submission. The Microsoft Word and LaTeX versions of the template can be found athttps://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines. Submissions to KEIR@ECIR2024 will be peer-reviewed on the basis of technical quality, relevance to workshop topics originality, significance, clarity, etc. 
 We accept submissions of the following types: 
 Original work that is not published or submitted elsewhere. 
 Work that is submitted elsewhere and is still under review. In this case, the authors should make sure that you are not violating the submission guidelines and anonymity requirements of the other venue(s). 
 Work that has been rejected at ECIR 2024. 
  
 The proceedings of the KEIR workshop will be non-archival in nature. Extended versions of selected papers will be recommended for special issues of several SCI-indexed international journals. However, authors retain the right to submit their work to other peer-reviewed venues for further dissemination. 
 Important Dates 
 Paper Submission Deadline (extended): | January 12, 2024 | January 26 2024, 11:59 PM, AoE 
 Acceptance Notification: | February 22, 2024 (11:59 PM, AoE) 
 Workshop Date: | March 28, 2024

 Knowledge-enhanced Conversational Recommender Systems 
 Abstract 
 Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) have revolutionized how we interact with the recommender by discerning user preferences through iterative dialogues. However, the effectiveness of these systems is often hindered by a need for more contextual understanding for precise preference modeling. Integrating various external knowledge sources offers promising solutions to enrich dialogue context, predict user preferences, and generate informative responses. This presentation will delve into recent advancements in the realm of knowledge-enhanced CRS, spotlighting studies that leverage knowledge to refine recommendations and enrich user interactions. I will share insights from our recent research that bolsters the recommendation quality and the informativeness of conversational responses. Additionally, I will illuminate emerging research trajectories within this domain, emphasizing the synergy between CRS and Large Language Models. 
 Bio 
 Dr. Zhaochun Ren is an Associate Professor at Leiden University, the Netherlands. He is interested in information retrieval and natural language processing, with an emphasis on conversational artificial intelligence, recommender systems, and social media analysis. He aims to develop intelligent agents that can address complex user requests and solve core challenges in NLP and IR towards that goal.

 Utilizing Structured and Encoded Knowledge for Search 
 Abstract 
 At Bloomberg, we build search applications for financial professionals as a part of our main product, the Bloomberg Terminal. In this talk, we will provide an illustration of a typical search workflow at Bloomberg, and discuss 1) how structured and encoded knowledge could be utilized end-to-end in a search system, and 2) challenges in applying them effectively at each step. Early in the pipeline, knowledge can be used to enrich and organize documents in the searchable collection. Thus, we start by discussing the document understanding step. Then, we consider the challenges of interpreting queries correctly and applying the appropriate retrieval configuration needed to satisfy the user’s information needs. We then continue to discuss the utilization of such enriched knowledge for document retrieval and reranking. Lastly, since user experience (UX) plays an important role in the search process, we will also discuss open questions around designing the user experience that is guided by knowledge. 
 Bio 
 Dr. Ridho Reinanda is an AI Research Scientist who is currently leading the Knowledge Graph team at Bloomberg. He obtained his Ph.D. in Information Retrieval at the University of Amsterdam, where he focused on leveraging knowledge graphs for information retrieval tasks and applying IR techniques for knowledge graph maintenance.
