 About IE2025 
 A convention, in the sense of a meeting, is a gathering of individuals who meet at an arranged place and time in order to discuss or engage in some common interest. The most common conventions are based upon industry, profession, and fandom. Trade conventions typically focus on a particular industry or industry segment, and feature keynote speakers. 
 Professional conventions focus on issues of concern along with advancements related to the profession. Such conventions are generally organized by societies or communities dedicated to promotion of the topic of interest. Fan conventions usually feature displays, shows, and sales based on pop culture and guest celebrities. Science fiction conventions traditionally partake of the nature of both professional conventions.

Doctoral colloquium: 
 The aim of the colloquium is to provide research students an opportunity to meet other people in a similar position, make relatively informal presentations, receive feedback from experts in the field, exchange ideas and experiences with each other, and make connections and have fun! All accepted presentations will be submitted as short (4-page) papers and published in the IE2025 IEEE Proceedings. A prize will be awarded for the best colloquium paper. 
 Industrial Forum: 
 In the Industrial Forum, colleagues from the industry domain will have the opportunity to showcase their projects while attracting funding or further expand collaborations with industry and academia at an international level. A limited number of presentation/demo slots of up to 30 minutes including questions and answers will be available for industry partners. During these slots, it will be possible for companies to present products/solutions/projects related to Intelligent Environments. 
 Publications: 
 As in previous editions, we expect all papers accepted at the main conference to be published by IEEE-indexed proceedings (currently in negotiation with IEEE, as in previous editions). All papers accepted in the workshops will be published as a volume of the IOS Press Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments book Series of IOS Press, which is published Open Access and indexed by Clarivate (Web of Science). Both the articles in the IEEE proceedings and the IOS Press books will be ISI-indexed. As in previous years, selected papers will be invited to be extended and submitted to journals for publication. 
 Proceedings: 
 Papers accepted in the main conference as either short or full paper will be published in IEEE proceedings and available through IEEE Xplore. 
 Papers accepted in workshops will be published as a volume of the IOS Press Ambient Intelligence and Smart Environments book Series of IOS Press. Proceedings will be indexed by Web of Science and SCOPUS. 
 Journal publication: 
 A selection of papers will be invited to extent and submit extended versions to special issues of high-quality journals:
