Call For Papers 
 This one-day workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in optimizing database performance on modern computing infrastructure by designing new data management techniques and tools. 
 Topics of Interest 
 The continued evolution of computing hardware and infrastructure imposes new challenges and bottlenecks to program performance. As a result, traditional database architectures that focus solely on I/O optimization increasingly fail to utilize hardware resources efficiently. Multi-core CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, new memory and storage technologies (such as flash and non-volatile memory), and low-power hardware imposes a significant challenge to optimizing database performance. Consequently, exploiting the characteristics of modern hardware has become an essential topic of database systems research. 
 The goal is to make database systems adapt automatically to sophisticated hardware characteristics, thus maximizing performance transparently for applications. To achieve this goal, the data management community needs interdisciplinary collaboration with researchers from computer architecture, compilers, operating systems, and storage. This involves rethinking traditional data structures, query processing algorithms, and database software architectures to adapt to the advances in the underlying hardware infrastructure. 
 We seek submissions bridging database systems to computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems. We also invite submissions to our call for papers on hardware/software co-design for modern data-intensive workloads, including but not limited to machine learning training and inference, graph analytics, and similar tasks. As these workloads continue to grow in scale and complexity, innovative co-design approaches that tightly integrate hardware architectures and software systems are crucial to achieving breakthroughs in performance, energy efficiency, and scalability. In particular, submissions covering topics from the following non-exclusive list are encouraged: 
 database algorithms and data structures on modern hardware 
 cost models and query optimization for novel hierarchical memory systems 
 hardware systems for query processing 
 data management using co-processors 
 novel application of new storage technologies to data management 
 query processing using computing power in storage systems 
 database architectures for low-power computing and embedded devices 
 database architectures on multi-threaded and chip multiprocessors 
 performance analysis of database workloads on modern hardware 
 compiler and operating systems advances to improve database performance 
 new benchmarks for micro-architectural evaluation of database workloads 
 taking advantage of modern network capabilities for data processing 
 hardware/software co-design for modern data-intensive workloads (e.g., machine learning, graph analytics) 
 Submission Tracks 
 We invite submissions to two tracks: 
 Full papers: A full paper must be no longer than six pages, excluding the bibliography. There is no limit on the length of the bibliography. Full papers describe a complete work in data management for new hardware. Accepted papers will be given 10 pages (plus a bibliography) for the camera-ready version and a long presentation slot during the workshop. 
 Short Papers: Short papers must not exceed two pages, excluding the bibliography. Short papers describe very early-stage works or summaries of mature systems. Short papers will be included in the proceedings, given 4 pages (plus a bibliography) for the camera-ready version, and may be given a short presentation slot during the workshop. 
 All accepted papers (full and short) will also be presented as posters during a workshop poster session 
 Best of DaMoN 2025 
 This year all accepted DaMoN papers will be considered for abest paper award. 
 We intend to invite extended versions of a selection of DaMoN'25 papers for submission to the VLDB Journal. Extended papers that are accepted to the VLDB Journal will appear in a special section (“Best of DaMoN 2025”) within one of the regular VLDBJ issues. 
 Important Dates 
 Paper submission:March 14th, 2025March 21st, 2025 (11:59pm AoE) 
 Notification of acceptance: April 28th, 2025 
 Camera-ready copies: TBD 
 Workshop: June 23rd, 2025 
 Submission Instructions 
 Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that are not being considered for publication in any other forum. Manuscripts should be submitted electronically as PDF files using the latestACM paper formatconsistent with thehref="https://2025.sigmod.org/calls_papers_sigmod_research.shtml" - ACM SIGMOD formatting guidelines
to the DaMoN 2025 CMT site athref="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DaMoN2025" - https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DaMoN2025
(available from mid-February on). Submissions will be reviewed in a single-blind manner. Submissions that are two pages or shorter, excluding the bibliography, will be reviewed as short papers. Submissions that are six pages or shorter, excluding the bibliography, will be reviewed as full papers. Submissions that are longer than six pages, excluding the bibliography, will be desk-rejected. 
 Accepted papers will be included in the informal online proceedings at the website. Additionally, all accepted papers will be published online in the ACM Digital Library. Therefore, the papers must include the standard ACM copyright notice on the first page.
