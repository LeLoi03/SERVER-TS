 VLDB 2025: Overview 
 The Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) is a premier annual international forum for data management, scalable data science, and database researchers, vendors, practitioners, application developers, and users. The forthcoming VLDB 2025 conference is poised to deliver a comprehensive program, featuring an array of research talks, keynote and invited talks, panels, tutorials, demonstrations, industrial tracks, and workshops. It will cover a spectrum of research topics related to all aspects of data management, where systems issues play a significant role, such as data management system technology and information management infrastructures, including their very large scale of experimentation, novel architectures, and demanding applications as well as their underpinning theory. 
 Key areas of interest for PVLDB include, but are not limited to, data mining and analytics, data privacy and security, database engines, database performance and manageability, distributed database systems, graph and network data, information integration and data quality, languages, machine learning, ai, and databases, novel database architectures, provenance and workflows, specialized and domain-specific data management, text and semi-structured data, and user interfaces. These thematic pillars represent the foundational elements underpinning the technological landscape of the emerging applications of the 21st century. 
 The VLDB 2025 conference will take place from 1st to 5th September 2025 at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre (QEII Centre) in London, UK. Located in the heart of Westminster, the QEII Centre offers a prime setting, just a five-minute walk from the iconic River Thames and two minutes from the peaceful St Jamesâ€™s Park. This venue perfectly balances the convenience of a central urban location with the serenity of nearby natural landmarks.

 is a non-profit organisation incorporated in the United States for the sole purpose ofpromoting and exchanging scholarly work in databases and related fields throughout the world.The Endowment serves as the steering committee for thehref="conference.html" - VLDB conference
series. The review process for these conferences is implemented in collaboration withhref="pvldb" - PVLDB
and the conference review process is entirely throughhref="pvldb" - PVLDB
. 
 Since 1992, the Endowment has publishedhref="http://vldb.org/vldb_journal/" - the VLDB Journal
for disseminating archival research results. By now, the journal is one of the most successful journals across all of computer science. The VLDB Journal is published in collaboration with Springer-Verlag. 
 On various activities, the Endowment closely cooperates withACM SIGMOD. 
 The Endowment also sponsors various scholarly activities. It has established a program that supports summer schools, and other training activities of this kind, in countries that could otherwise not afford the expenses for such events. 
 Thehref="archives/" - VLDB historical archives
since 1995 contains web sites of past conferences, conference statistics (e.g., number of papers submitted, acceptance rates), and other useful information. 
 The VLDB Endowment is governed by aBoard of Trusteesconsisting of 21 members. 
 VLDB's Position on Racism 
 The VLDB Endowment is committed to ensuring that all VLDB activities are carried out in an inclusive and diverse environment with zero tolerance for discrimination, harassment, or any other form of misconduct. The database systems community wide DBCares initiative, co-started with ACM SIGMOD, is a realization of this principle. 
 We cannot be satisfied with continuing the status quo. We will continue to actively stand against discrimination. We will find new ways to address the inequities that exist in our field. We will help to create an environment that is more welcoming, just, and equitable to all. 
 We join ACM and CRA in stating that we will continue to listen, to learn, to engage and to explore new ways to fight against and reject racism. Silence perpetuates, doubt reinforces, and rationalization of incident after incident only compounds the pain so many in our society continue to endure. 
 We know that racism: 
 Is systemic and institutionalized. 
 Continues to oppress people of color around the world â€“ denying basic human rights, denying opportunity, and even more tragically denying many of their very lives. 
 Is learned behavior that may be unlearned through education, compassion, empathy, and action. 
 Drives a wedge between communities, and in doing so limits the enviable quest for a society steeped in respect. 
 Benefits the privileged from its existence, who must be willing to sacrifice to overcome it. 
 To stand against it, we: 
 Acknowledge the existence of racism within our communities and commit to defeating it. 
 Call out and reject rationalization of incidents and distortion of information. 
 Educate ourselves and those around us to address racism in its many forms. 
 Stand up against the status quo by using our voice and agency. 
 Invite the community to discuss concrete steps to take to create lasting change.
