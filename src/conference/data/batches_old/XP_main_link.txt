This year's XP 
 What matters to you? 
 In just a few years, AI tools have been widely adopted by industry and their capabilities have improved enormously. Together with other trends such as platform engineering, conversational applications, sustainable development, and many more, the way we develop, operate, and evolve software may change drastically. At the same time, with the digital revolution, software has become part of the critical infrastructure of the entire economy; software is a core asset of many companies and is responsible for their success. 
 How can these trends and new research support and enhance agile software development and its operation in the future? Are the agile values and principles described in the manifesto still valid and/or sufficient? 
 What other trends, innovations, and research do you see emerging in the development and operation of valuable software products? Do you want to help shape the future of software development? Do you have ideas, and solutions or have you done experiments and research to solve a specific problem? 
 The overarching theme of XP 2025 is thus:“Adapt - Uncovering better ways to deliver valuable software products”.

This year's XP 
 What matters to you? 
 In just a few years, AI tools have been widely adopted by industry and their capabilities have improved enormously. Together with other trends such as platform engineering, conversational applications, sustainable development, and many more, the way we develop, operate, and evolve software may change drastically. At the same time, with the digital revolution, software has become part of the critical infrastructure of the entire economy; software is a core asset of many companies and is responsible for their success. 
 How can these trends and new research support and enhance agile software development and its operation in the future? Are the agile values and principles described in the manifesto still valid and/or sufficient? 
 What other trends, innovations, and research do you see emerging in the development and operation of valuable software products? Do you want to help shape the future of software development? Do you have ideas, and solutions or have you done experiments and research to solve a specific problem? 
 The overarching theme of XP 2025 is thus:“Adapt - Uncovering better ways to deliver valuable software products”. 
 XP 2025 Program Components 
 Research & Industry Practice Workshops 
 A forum for small group discussions to share and discuss the results of scientific research and experiences in interactive sessions. Full and half-day research workshops will take place on Monday. 
 Experience Reports 
 Authors of Experience Reports share their first-hand experience. The Experience Report track offers a supportive environment for authors to share their story and learn from it. Experience Reports help bridge Agile and Lean software development. 
 Research Papers 
 Presentation of research papers on topics across the full spectrum of Agile development and broader Agile issues of interest to both researchers and practitioners. 
 Open Space 
 XP 2025 will feature Open Space that is aimed at an active exchange between participants on different topics. 
 Industry & Practice 
 A program for industry, practitioners, and companies to showcase and reflect on their experiences with agile software development in practice. This track also includes Education and Training, and Sustainability topics. 
 Open Access Publication 
 Workshops, demonstrations, and results of the conference will be published in open access in collaboration with an internationally recognized publisher. We intend to publish in gold open access, i.e., free availability to readers with no hidden paywall. The conference proceedings will be published in a fully open access publication.
