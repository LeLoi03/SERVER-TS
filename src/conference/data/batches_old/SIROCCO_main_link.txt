 General Information 
 The 32nd International Colloquium On Structural Information and Communication Complexity (SIROCCO 2025) will take place on June 2-4, 2025, in Delphi, Greece. See thehref="/content/ryerson/sirocco-2025/call-for-papers.html" - Call for Papers
for more information about the scope and submission instructions. 
 About SIROCCO 
 SIROCCO is devoted to the study of the interplay between structural knowledge, communication, and computing in decentralized systems of multiple communicating entities.

 will present their view of the future of scientific research in their fields, particularly the challenges and threats posed by recent developments in computer science, engineering, and academicresearch and education. 
 Venue 
 SIROCCO 2025 will take place in the historic town ofDelphi(external link), Greece, at theEuropean Cultural Centre of Delphi(external link). ThisUNESCO World Heritage site(external link), once home to the oracle of Apollo and the omphalos, the 'navel of the world', is renowned for its profound blend of natural beauty and sacred history. Known as the seat of the high priestess Pythia of the Temple of Apollo, Delphi was considered the center of the world by the ancient Greeks, primarily due to the Oracle of Delphi where the priestess dispensed prophecies. Conveniently located just a few hours’ drive from Athens, Delphi is easily accessible for international attendees. Participants will enjoy breathtaking views of theAmphissa Olive Grove(external link)and the Itea Bay from theCentre’s guest rooms(external link), which are equipped with modern amenities. Additionally, Delphi hosts the renownedDelphi Archaeological Museum(external link), one of Greece’s most visited cultural treasures.

 Submission Instructions 
 A submission must report on original research and contain results that have not appeared previously in a regular conference paper and have not been concurrently submitted to or previously appeared in a journal or a conference with published proceedings. 
 The papers must be submitted in PDF format usinghref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sirocco2025" - EasyChair (external link)
. Submissions must be written in English and formatted in a single column on US letter-size or A4 size paper, use at least 11-point font, and have at least 2.5 cm margins. 
 All submissions must start with the paper’s title, author names, and a short abstract. There is no page limit, but it is mandatory that the paper contains, within the first 14 pages, a concise and clear presentation of the primary content and merits of the paper. Everything beyond 14 pages will be read at the discretion of the reviewers only. Whether an appendix is used or not is up to the authors. 
 Submissions deviating from these guidelines as well as papers outside the scope of the conference may be rejected without consideration of their merits. 
 A submission that is not accepted as a full paper may be invited for a brief announcement. 
 Proceedings 
 The proceedings of SIROCCO 2025 will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Note carefully that inclusion in the proceedings requires a presentation by one of the authors at the conference site and at least one full registration for every full paper. 
 Special Issue 
 Selected papers from SIROCCO 2025 will be invited to a special issue of the journalTheoretical Computer Science. 
 Best Paper Awards 
 All regular papers are eligible for the best paper award. Moreover, all regular papers that have at least one student author, and these student authors have done most of the work, are also eligible for the best student paper award. If a submission is eligible for the best student paper award, please state that on the first page. The program committee may decline to make the awards or may split them among multiple papers.
