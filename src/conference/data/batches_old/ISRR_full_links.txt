 Welcome to the International Foundation of Robotics Research 
 The goal of IFRR ispromoting scientific excellence in robotics research. IFRR establishes the theoretical foundations and technology as a basis for its ever expanding robotics applications, with an emphasis on its potential role to benefit humans. As a volunteer-driven non-profit organization, we organize a series of select and high-quality symposia and support new emerging researchers and trends in robotics research.

 ISRR 
 International Symposium of Robotics Research 
 The goal of IFRR is to promote the development of robotics as a scientific field establishing the theoretical foundations and technology basis for its ever expanding applications, with emphasis on its potential role to benefit humans. The Foundation was formally established in 1986 following the success of a series of pioneering symposia that were conceived to provide the emerging community with a forum entirely devoted to all areas of robotics research.
