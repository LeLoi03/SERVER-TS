 ICB/IJCB Conference 
 The IAPR International Conference on Biometrics (ICB)is sponsored by IAPR-TC4 (Technical Committee on Biometrics – TC4, International Association for Pattern Recognition), is the premier forum for the presentation of new advances and research results in the fields of biometrics. ICB, formed in 2006 by merging AVBPA (Audio- and Video-based Person Authentication), ICBA (International Conference on Biometric Authentication) and other biometric workshops, has established itself as a leading international conference in biometrics. The conference will have a broad scope and invites papers that advance biometric technologies, sensor design, feature extraction and matching algorithms, analysis of security and privacy, and evaluation of social impact of biometrics technology. Topics of interest include all areas of current Biometrics research and applications. 
 The International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB)combines two major biometrics research conferences, the International Conference on Biometrics (ICB) and the Biometrics Theory, Applications and Systems (BTAS) conference. The blending of these two conferences is through a special agreement between the IAPR TC-4 and the IEEE Biometrics Council. IJCB presents an exciting event for the entire worldwide biometrics research community.
