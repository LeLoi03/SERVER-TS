 General Info 
 We invite proposals for workshops and competitions to be held in conjunction with the 23rd International Conference on Image Analysis and Processing (ICIAP 2025). 
 The workshops and competitions will take place onSeptember 15th and 16th 2025, prior to the main conference. 
 The purpose of the workshops is to provide a dedicated forum to explore emerging or established topics that may not be fully addresses during the main conference, as well as encouraging in-depth discussion on technical and practical aspects. The ICIAP 2025 organizing team will provide support by managing workshop registrations, providing facilities, and distributing electronic copies of workshop proceedings. All the accepted workshop papers will be published in a dedicated volume of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). 
 Due to limited space and time, and to promote a diverse range of topics, only a limited number of proposals will be accepted. We strongly encourage workshop organizers to submit proposals that are well-defined and provide clear justification for their relevance and feasibility. 
  
 Proposals should be submitted in PDF format via email toworkshops@iciap.orgno later thanFebruary 15th, 2025. 
 Each proposal should include the following information:

 Organizers and Speakers 
 Full names, titles, and affiliations (with one, potentially two, contact emails) of the organizers. 
 A summary of the organizers’ background and experience that make them well suited for organizing the event, including brief bios. 
 In case this event is part of a series, please provide URLs to relevant past events and / or any related information. 
 A preliminary list of invited speakers (if applicable). Important: Please list only speakers who have confirmed or tentatively confirmed their attendance, clearly indicating whether each confirmation is tentative or final. 
 An estimate of the number of paper submissions. 
 Logistics 
 Preference for half-day or full-day event. 
 A tentative program committee. 
 Specify the primary nature of your event: | Competition 
 Invited speaker event 
 Peer reviewed paper event (orals / posters) 
 Combination of invited speakers and peer reviewed papers 
 Affinity workshop to create and strengthen communities (such as “Women in Computer Vision”) 
 A review timeline for papers or competitions. 
 If posters will be presented, provide a number estimate. Note that the conference may limit the number of posters based on space availability. 
 Any special space or equipment requirement. 
  
 Additional Information 
 After acceptance, workshop organizers will be required to create individual workshop websites, separate from the ICIAP 2025 site. These pages will include workshop details, organizers, dates, submission instructions and, once finalized, the workshop program.
