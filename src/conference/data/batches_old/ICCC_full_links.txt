Welcome to the 15th International Conference on Computational Creativity, ICCC’24! 
 The International Conference on Computational Creativity is the premier forum for disseminating research on computational and AI creativity, bringing together researchers interested in exploring the ever increasing capacities of technology in creative domains such as writing, visual arts and music. State-of-the-art AI-algorithms can now create works that to a casual observer are comparable to those of human professionals, but many have questioned whether this is sufficient (or even necessary) for a computer to be considered to be “acting creatively”. This conference and its associated workshops exist to discuss the how and what of computational participation in creativity. 
 Come join us in the beautiful Swedish town of Jönköping ([ˈjœ̂nːˌɕøːpɪŋ]) at Midsummer and discuss questions like: by which metrics should we judge the creativity of AI output? Can an AI tool augment the creativity of its human users? What are the ethical implications of algorithms taking on creative roles? And, of course: can an AI be creative at all? These questions and more are at the heart of the sub-field of AI known as Computational Creativity (CC), defined as “the art, science, philosophy, and engineering of computational systems which, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviors that unbiased observers would deem to be creative”. 
 The ICCC conference series organized by the Association for Computational Creativity since 2010 is the only scientific conference that focuses on computational creativity alone and also covers all aspects of it. 
 ICCC’24 will take place June 17 – June 21, 2024, at the University of Jönköping, in Sweden.

Welcome to the 16th International Conference on Computational Creativity, ICCC’25! 
 Computational creativity is the art, science, philosophy and engineering of computational systems which, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviours that unbiased observers would deem to be creative. As a field of research, this area is thriving, with progress in formalising what it means for software to be creative, along with many exciting and valuable applications of creative software in the sciences, the arts, literature, gaming and elsewhere. 
 TheICCCconference series organized by theAssociation for Computational Creativitysince 2010 is the only scientific conference that focuses on computational creativity alone and also covers all aspects of it. 
 ICCC’25will take place from June 23rd to June 27th, 2025.

Call for venues to organize ICCC 
 The Association for Computational Creativity (ACC) invites all its members and any colleagues interested in the area to submit a proposal for organising the International Conference on Computational Creativity in 2024 (ICCC’24) and 2025 (ICCC’25). 
 For ICCC’24, the Association will favour proposals to host the conference within Europe; however, if no submission satisfies the ACC’s requirements, or we receive a truly exceptional submission, bids outside Europe will also be considered. 
 For ICCC’25, the Association will favour proposals to host the conference outside Europe. 
 The hosting bid guidelines can be found here:
