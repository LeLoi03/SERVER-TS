 Temporal Representation 
 and Reasoning 
 Oct. 28–30, 2024 
 Montpellier, France 
  
 href="#Dates" - Dates | Program | Registration | Organization | Venue 
 Introduction 
 TIME has been for more than twenty years the only yearly multidisciplinary international event dedicated to the topic of time in computer science. The purpose of the symposium is to bring together active researchers in different research areas involving temporal representation and reasoning. The symposium also welcomes research papers on the related topics of spatial and spatio-temporal representation and reasoning. In the early years, most contributions came from the Artificial Intelligence community, but the number of contributions from other areas such as Temporal Logic and Verification and partly from Temporal Databases has been increasing in the last years.
