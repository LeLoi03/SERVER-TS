 Call For Papers 
 The British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) is one of the major international conferences on computer vision and related areas. It is organised by the British Machine Vision Association (BMVA). The 36th BMVC will now be an in-person event from 24th—27th November 2025 in Sheffield, UK. 
  
 Authors are invited to submit high-quality papers in image processing, computer vision, machine learning and related areas for BMVC 2025. Submitted papers will be refereed on originality, presentation, empirical results, and evaluation quality. Accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings published and DOI-indexed by BMVA. Past proceedings are online at the BMVA proceedings website. 
  
 Please note that BMVC is a single-track meeting with oral and poster presentations. The paper submission deadline will be on the 16th of May 2025. Submitted papers should not exceed NINE pages (references are excluded), and appendices should be submitted via the supplementary information. You can find further information in the Author Guidelines and Submit your Paper pages. 
  
 The submission portal will be available from late-April, 2025. 
  
 Topics include, but are not limited to: 
  
 3D from X 
 3D Shape modeling and processing 
 Action and event understanding 
 Adversarial attack and defense 
 Architecture and Space Design 
 Biometrics 
 Brave new ideas (not beating SOA but a new appraoch, theory, niche) 
 Computational Photography and Photogrammetry 
 Computer vision theory 
 Datasets and Evaluation 
 Deep learning architectures and techniques 
 Document analysis and understanding 
 Embodied vision: Active agents; simulation 
 Explainable AI 
 Fairness, privacy, ethics, social-good, transparency, accountability in vision 
 Generative models 
 Humans: Face, Gestures, Pose and Body Movement 
 Human-in-the-loop computer vision 
 Image Retrieval 
 Low-level and Physics-based Vision 
 Machine learning (other than deep learning) 
 Medical and Biological Image Analysis 
 Motion estimation and tracking 
 Multimodal learning 
 Recognition for X 
 Representation Learning 
 RGBD sensors and analytics 
 Scene Analysis and Understanding 
 Segmentation, grouping and shape analysis 
 Self-, semi-, meta-, unsupervised learning 
 Transfer, low-shot, continual, long-tail learning 
 Video analysis and Understanding 
 Vision and audio 
 Vision and graphics 
 Vision and language 
 Vision and robotics 
 Vision applications and systems 
 Visual reasoning and logical representation 
  
 Papers submitted under the “Brave new ideas” subject area are expected to move away from incremental benchmark gains. Proposed ideas should radically differ from the current research strand or propose a novel problem. 
 Reviewing Process for BMVC 2025 
  
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. The Area Chair will provide a meta-review, summarising the reviewers’ points and recommending paper decisions. 
  
 Please Note: Due to the anticipated volume of papers for BMVC 2025 (based on recent year’s experience), there will be NO extension granted to the submission deadline. In keeping with conferences in the field (e.g., NeurIPS, CVPR) and to cope with the increasing number of submissions, we ask that all authors be prepared to review papers. The submission site will ask authors to acknowledge this commitment, and failure to engage with the reviewing process might be grounds for rejection. 
  
 Further information about the reviewing process can be found at the Reviewing policies. 
  
 Any queries to the Programme Chairs should be sent to pc_email.
