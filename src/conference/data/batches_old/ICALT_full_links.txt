 ICALT 2024 received 144 papers from 40 countries. All submissions were peer-reviewed through a double-blind review process by an international panel of at least three international expert referees and decisions were taken based on research quality. We are very pleased to report that the quality of the submissions this year turned out to be very high. In average each submission in the main tracks received 3.3 reviews. A total of 27 papers were accepted as full papers, thus resulting in a full paper acceptance rate of around 24.32%. Furthermore, 53 papers were accepted for presentation as short papers, 15 as discussion papers, and 3 papers were selected for the Doctoral Consortium.
