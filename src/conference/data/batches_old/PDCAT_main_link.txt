 The 25th International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies (PDCAT'24) will be held in Hong Kong during December 13-15,2024. 
  
 The International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies (PDCAT) is major forums for scientists, engineers, and practitioners throughout the world to present the latest research, results, ideas, developments andapplications in all aspects of parallel and distributed computing, parallel architectures, algorithms and programming techniques. We devoutly wish participants to learn the basic theory of a gradual approach, practical experimental data, new business models, and the latest academic trends from this conference. During these 24 years, PDCAT had been successfully held in many countries including China, Japan,Korea,Singapore, Australia and New Zealand across Asia-Oceania.
