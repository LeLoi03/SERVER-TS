 SCOPE 
 The International Conference on Information Visualization Theory and Applications aims at becoming a major point of contact between researchers, engineers and practitioners in Information Visualization. The conference will be structured around several Information and Data Visualization topics (listed below), and we welcome papers describing original work in any of these topics. We also encourage papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques, general survey papers indicating future directions, and theoretical or empirical contributions. Paper acceptance will be based on quality, relevance to the conference theme and originality. The conference program will focus on oral and poster presentations, although proposals for sessions dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as technical tutorials, are also encouraged.CONFERENCE AREAS 
 Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas:1. INFORMATION VISUALIZATION

 PAPER SUBMISSION 
 Authors can submit their work in the form of a complete paper or an abstract, but please note that accepted abstracts are presented but not published in the proceedings of the conference. Complete papers can be submitted as a Regular Paper, representing completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, portraying a short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue discussing ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research focused on one of the conference topic areas. 
  
 Authors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics. Each paper should clearly indicate the nature of its technical/scientific contribution, and the problems, domains or environments to which it is applicable. To facilitate the double-blind paper evaluation method, authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors, including the authors’ personal details, the acknowledgments section of the paper and any other reference that may disclose the authors’ identity. 
  
 When submitting a complete paper please note that only original papers should be submitted. Authors are advised to readINSTICC's ethical norms regarding plagiarism and self-plagiarismthoroughly before submitting and must make sure that their submissions do not substantially overlap work which has been published elsewhere or simultaneously submitted to a journal or another conference with proceedings. Papers that contain any form of plagiarism will be rejected without reviews. Authors should also avoid using an excessive number of self-citations. 
  
 All papers must be submitted through the online submission platformPRIMORISand should follow the instructions and templates that can be found underGuidelines and Templates. After the paper submission has been successfully completed, authors will receive an automatic confirmation e-mail. 
  
 PUBLICATIONS 
 All accepted complete papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and on digital support. 
 SCITEPRESS is a member of CrossRef (http://www.crossref.org/) and every paper on our digital library is given a DOI (Digital Object Identifier). 
 The proceedings will be submitted for indexation bySCOPUS, Google Scholar, DBLP, Semantic Scholar, EI and Web of Science / Conference Proceedings Citation Index.
