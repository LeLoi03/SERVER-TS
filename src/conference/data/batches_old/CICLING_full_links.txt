Their paper will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) in Springer. 
 CICLing is one of the leading conferences in in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics that attracts many researchers from NLP and AI community. Researchers around the world attendhref="https://www.cicling.org/" - CICLing
every year. 
 Fazel and Sayef, presented their paper in front of a global audience including some of the most prolific figures in NLP community including Alexander Gelbukh, Conference Chairperson and Carlo Strapparava, keynote speaker. They also had the opportunity to present their poster and answer key questions to researchers during the conference. 
 The keynote speaker for the conference was Carlo Strapparava, a member of the HLT Unit (Human Language Technologies) of FBK’s Information Technology Center, Italy, and a Google grant award winner, who shared some of his recent research. Some of the topics included BRAINSUP (Creation of Flexible Catchy Headlines), Humor Recognition and many more. Fazel and Sayef had the opportunity to interact with him and exchange some research ideas and future research collaboration. 
 "It was a great opportunity and learning experience for Sayef to interact with world class researchers and present his paper in an international conference", said Dr. Keshtkar.
