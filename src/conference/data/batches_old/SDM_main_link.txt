 About the Conference 
 This meeting is sponsored by theSIAM Activity Group on Data Science. 
 The SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM25) invites submissions of high-quality research papers that present original results on data mining algorithms and their applications. Data mining is a core process within computing and statistics, aimed at discovering valuable knowledge from data. This field has significant applications across various domains including science, engineering, healthcare, business, and medicine. Datasets in these fields are typically large, complex, and noisy, necessitating sophisticated, high-performance analysis techniques grounded in sound theoretical and statistical principles. SDM25 provides a venue for researchers who are addressing these problems to present their work in a peer-reviewed forum. It also provides an ideal setting for graduate students to network and get feedback for their work (as part of the doctoral forum) and everyone new to the field to learn about cutting-edge research by hearing outstanding invited speakers and attending presentations, tutorials and a number of focused workshops. The proceedings of the conference are published in archival form and are also made available on the SIAM website.
