 Ioannis Michos holds a B.Sc. (with distinction) in Mathematics from University of Ioannina, Greece; a M.Sc. and a Ph.D. in Pure Mathematics (Algebra) from the University of Manchester, England. He had been a post-doctoral fellow at LIAFA (Laboratoire d’ Informatique: Fondements et Applications) (today’s IRIF: Institut de Recherche en Informatique Fondamentale) at the University of Paris VII in France working on the 5thEuropean TMR project ALAPEDES (Algebraic Approach to Performance Evaluation of Discrete Event Systems). 
 He has taught in various universities in Greece and Cyprus: as a visiting assistant professor at the University of Crete, University of Ioannina, University of Cyprus, Frederick University and European University, Cyprus from 2003 to 2014. He currently holds a permanent position as an assistant professor of Mathematics in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at European University, Cyprus. He has taught several mathematics courses related to algebra, combinatorics and discrete mathematics such as Linear Algebra, Graph Theory, Combinatorics, Coding Theory, Group Theory and Number Theory. 
 His research area spans from Algebra and Combinatorics to Discrete Mathematics and their applications to Theoretical Computer Science and Computational Biology. More precisely: combinatorics of free Lie algebras (with relations to the theory of formal languages and automata), free partially commutative (trace) monoids (average parallelism and applications to parallel and discrete event systems), Representations of finite groups (modular representation theory, invariant theory and relatively free algebras), Combinatorics and Graph theory (combinatorics on words, Patterns in permutations and words, Spectral graph theory), Combinatorial and Computational Biology (combinatorial structure of RNA). 
 His scientific results have been published in several journals of worldwide recognition such as Discrete Mathematics, Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics and Discete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science. He has also published his work in numerous well known conference proceedings such as the Euroconference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Applications (EUROCOMB 2001), the Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science (STACS 2002) and Permutation Patterns (PP2018, PP2019). He is a reviewer in the journal Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science and of the American Mathematical Society.
