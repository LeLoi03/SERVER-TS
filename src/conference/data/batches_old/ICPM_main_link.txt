 Call for Research Papers 
 The International Conference on Process Mining (ICPM) is the leading global forum for researchers, practitioners, and developers in process mining. The conference fosters a dynamic exchange of ideas and knowledge through scientific talks, interactive industry discussions, live contests, hands-on tutorials, and expert panels. 
 ICPM covers all facets of process mining, including theoretical advancements, algorithmic challenges, impactful applications, and interdisciplinary connections with fields like machine learning, data science, and operations management. Co-sponsored by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society and supported by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining, ICPM represents the cutting edge of process mining research and practice. 
 Process mining transforms how organizations understand, analyze, and improve their work processes by extracting insights from transactional data recorded in IT systems. This data-driven approach enables organizations to enhance performance across key dimensions such as efficiency, quality, compliance, and risk. By replacing traditional, assumption-based methodologies with evidence-based decision-making, process mining unlocks unique opportunities for advancing business process management. 
 Topics for Research Papers 
 ICPM 2025 invites groundbreaking contributions in both technical and empirical process mining research, aiming to push the boundaries of innovation and knowledge. Submissions should clearly articulate their contributions and novelty. Unless they are purely formal or conceptual, papers are expected to include evaluations (in case of technical papers) or present newly collected data (in case of empirical papers). To enhance replicability and impact, authors are strongly encouraged to provide supplementary resources, such as used datasets, publicly accessible implementations, and experimental packages for empirical studies. Studies utilizing novel, unpublished datasets are particularly welcomed. Research using existing datasets must emphasize the novelty of the analysis or its unprecedented results. 
 Selected accepted papers may be invited for an extended and revised publication in a special issue of the flagship journal Process Science, edited by Springer (https://link.springer.com/journal/44311). 
 ICPM 2025 welcomes submissions across a broad spectrum of topics, including but not limited to: 
 Technical Research in Process Mining 
 Novel process mining techniques for | Process discovery

 The use of | AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of the paper. Any sections utilizing AI-generated content must include citations to the AI system used. 
 Submissions should be made through the ICPM 2025 submission system at | href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icpm2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icpm2025 | (ICPM 2025 track) 
 All papers must be written in English. 
 Review Process 
 Each submission will be reviewed by at least one senior process committee member and two additional reviewers. 
 A discussion period will follow the reviews to finalize decisions. 
 Presentation and Copyright 
 At least one author of each accepted contribution is required to register for the conference, present their work, and sign a copyright release form. 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
 The Process Mining community welcomes the advancement of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) across our professional endeavors. We celebrate the diversity in our community and foster an environment that welcomes individuals irrespective of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, nationality, beliefs, sexual orientation, physical capabilities, education, and professional background. We urge all participants to uphold DEI principles in their written work, reviews, presentations, and any engagement linked to the ICPM conference. 
 Open Science Principles 
 The ICPM conference encourages authors of research papers to follow the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. In particular, the conference supports the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourages authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data in order to increase reproducibility and replicability. 
 Authors are encouraged to make research artifacts (e.g., prototypes, interview protocols, questionnaires) or the datasets (used in, or produced by, the empirical evaluation) reported in the paper available in a suitable form. To facilitate this, we kindly ask authors to include links in their manuscripts to private or public repositories where reviewers can access the associated research artifacts. This information may be presented in a dedicated section, such as “Data availability” or “Reproducibility”. This requirement does not apply to papers that neither involve an empirical study nor a prototype implementation. 
 Authors who are unable or choose not to share their research artifacts and datasets with the program committee are encouraged to provide an explanation within their submitted manuscript, detailing the reasons behind their decision. This statement may be removed from the final version of the paper if it gets accepted. Possible reasons may involve privacy restrictions or non-disclosure agreements. While sharing research artifacts is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, the program committee members may use this information to inform their decision. 
 To enhance the accessibility of research artifacts and datasets, authors are advised to make them accessible via public repositories (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, GitHub, or institutional archives) under an open data license such as the CC0 dedication or the CC-BY 4.0 license. Making research artifacts and datasets available via cloud services such as Dropbox or Google Docs is discouraged due to the volatility of the links associated with these services. 
 Finally, authors are encouraged to self-archive their pre- and post-prints in open, preserved repositories, such as their institutional preprint repository, arXiv, or other non-profit services, in line with IEEE’s copyright agreement (seehref="https://cis.ieee.org/publications/t-emerging-topics-in-ci/tetci-ieee-preprint-policy" - IEEE Preprint Policy
). 
 Opportunities for Sub-Reviewing 
 ICPM 2025 warmly encourages early-career researchers, including Ph.D. students and early postdoctoral researchers, to actively participate in the scientific reviewing process by contributing as sub-reviewers. Sub-reviewing a paper is a great opportunity to gain firsthand experience with the peer-review process, sharpen your critical evaluation skills, and familiarize yourself with the latest research on process mining. 
 If you are interested, we invite you to approach a PC member you already know to express your interest, clearly indicating that you are willing to contribute a sub-review in exchange for feedback on your reviewing skills. If you do not have a direct connection to a PC member, please don’t hesitate to reach out to the PC chairs, who will help facilitate your involvement. Your contributions are valuable to the community and we look forward to incorporating your expertise!
