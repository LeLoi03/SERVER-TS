 IJCNN is the premier international conference in the area of neural networks theory, analysis and applications. Since its inception, IJCNN has been playing a leading role in promoting and facilitating interaction among researchers and practitioners, and dissemination of knowledge in neural networks and related facets of machine learning. And Rome with its history and geographical position will further contribute to grow and maintain the role of the IJCNN as a prominent platform for exchange of knowledge in neural networks and artificial intelligence. 
 The technical program, including tutorials, special sessions, workshops and plenary talks, covers almost all facets of neural networks and related learning systems including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, convolutional neural networks, spiking neural networks, cognitive algorithms, and deep learning along with a wide spectrum of applications. A special track is also included dedicated to the conference theme on “Human-AI interaction in creative arts and sciences”. 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit complete papers of no more than eight (8) pages in the IEEE two-column conference proceedings format, according to thehref="https://2025.ijcnn.org/authors/initial-author-instructions" - Paper Submission Guidelines
. All the accepted and presented papers will be published on IEEE Xplore Digital Library and indexed by Scopus. 
 Whether you are presenting your latest work, learning from experts, or networking with peers, IJCNN 2025 promises to be an unforgettable experience that will inspire and propel the AI and neural network community forward. We look forward to welcoming you in Rome!

Welcome to the INNS International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025! The IJCNN Organizing Committee is thrilled to invite you to this prestigious event in the heart of Rome from June 30 to July 5, 2025. This conference brings together the brightest minds in neural networks and artificial intelligence, offering a platform for sharing ideas and fostering collaborations. 
 IJCNN 2025 will be held in the year and the city of the Jubilee, making it an even more special occasion. Hosted at the Pontifical Gregorian University, just a coin's throw from the iconic Trevi Fountain, attendees will have the unique opportunity to experience Rome's rich history and culture. The Eternal City will serve as an open-air museum, providing an inspiring backdrop for our discussions and networking. 
 The IJCNN 2025 motto, "All Neural Network roads lead to Rome," highlights the growing significance of neural networks across various scientific domains and applications, all of which are welcome to IJCNN 2025. Neural networks are at the forefront of interdisciplinary research, connecting diverse fields and driving innovation. This theme underscores the central role that neural networks play in advancing science and technology. 
 With our discipline recognized as an enabling technology in areas as diverse as physics and molecular biology, our aim is that the IJCNN 2025 serves as a vehicle to both celebrate and enhance the increasingly evident synergy between humans and AI in numerous domains and manifold applications. This synergy not only enhances our daily lives but also pushes the boundaries of what is possible, fostering creativity and innovation across disciplines. We are excited to explore this theme through a Special Track in the scientific program. 
 We encourage you to participate in this memorable event, which promises a high-quality scientific program and a variety of social initiatives infused with the rich history of Rome. Join us in making IJCNN 2025 an unforgettable experience, filled with knowledge, inspiration, and new connections. 
 Warm regards,

 Following the successes of previous events, the 17th International Symposium on Neural Networks (ISNN 2020) will be held in Cairo, Egypt on October 1-5, 2020. Located by the Nile River, Cairo is the capital of Egypt and the largest city in Africa, with a population of over ten millions. 
  
 ISNN2020 aims to provide a high-level international forum for scientists, engineers, and educators to present the state of the art of neural network research and applications in related fields. The symposium will feature plenary speeches given by world renowned scholars, regular sessions with broad coverage, and special sessions focusing on popular topics. 
  
 Prospective authors are invited to contribute high-quality papers to ISNN 2020. In addition, proposals for special sessions within the technical scopes of the symposium are solicited. Special sessions, to be organized by internationally recognized experts, aim to bring together researchers in special focused topics. Papers submitted for special sessions are to be peer-reviewed with the same criteria used for the contributed papers. Researchers interested in organizing special sessions are invited to submit formal proposals to ISNN 2020. A special session proposal should include the session title, a brief description of the scope and motivation, names, contact information and brief biographical information of the organizers. 
  
 Authors are invited to submit full-length papers (10 pages nominal and 12 pages maximum) by the submission deadline through the online submission system. Potential organizers are also invited to enlist five or more papers with cohesive topics to form special sessions. The submission of a paper implies that the paper is original and has not been submitted under review or is not copyright-protected elsewhere and will be presented by an author if accepted. 
  
 All submitted papers will be refereed by experts in the field based on the criteria of originality, significance, quality, and clarity. The authors of accepted papers will have an opportunity to revise their papers and take consideration of the referees' comments and suggestions. The proceedings of ISNN 2020 will be published in the Springer LNCS series and selected good papers will be included in special issues of SCI journals.
