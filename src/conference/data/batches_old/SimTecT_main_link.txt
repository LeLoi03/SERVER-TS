 Featured Medical Simulation Conferences 
 href="#aioseo-2025-general-clinical-simulation-conference-listings" - 2025 General Clinical Simulation Conference Listings: 
 ‌Healthcare Simulationconferences are an absolute must for healthcare professionals who seek to start or expand their institution’s clinicalsimulation programs. As there are very few educational pathways forMedical Simulationprofessionals, participation in healthcare simulation conferences likeSimGHOSTS,IMSHorINACSLis a crucial step in the development or expansion of the healthcare simulation institution’s program and development of individual and team members’ professional careers. 
 TheHow to Get the Most Out of Your First Healthcare Simulation Conferencearticle is a great article to read in preparation for a healthcare simulation conference attendance. The internationalclinical simulationcommunity is incredibly generous to share resources and help for other areas as required. Healthcare simulation conferences are an excellent way to be able to see what other clinical simulation professionals are up to, hot topics and new concepts and ideas. 
 Healthcare simulation conferences are also a great opportunity for those who work in clinical simulation to be able to showcase their work and receive feedback from renowned leaders in healthcare simulation. Presentation at a healthcare simulation conference allows individuals and teams the opportunity to be able to plan, prepare and deliver a number of different clinical simulation conference presentations such as talks and workshops. The ability to present in this manner takes a lot of practice and is a great skill to acquire. 
 Networking is one of the best parts of attendance at a healthcare simulation conference. Speak to as many people as possible to be able to meet new people in the healthcare simulation industry. Go to the conference with questions and interests at the forefront of mind to share and network with others over. Collect business cards and allow others to introduce other people of interest as well. Be brave and talk to a favorite speaker and share the impact that their presentation has had. There may be opportunities to link in with other centers forhref="https://www.healthysimulation.com/healthcare-simulation/research-journals/" - research
and collaborations to do with healthcare simulation. Be sure to express interest and ask questions. 
 There are plenty of fantastic global conferences coming up in 2024 that provide a range of focused healthcare simulation learning, networking, and vendor engagement opportunities, so save the dates for these special events listed below. Previous annual events are summarized in the drop-down fields at the bottom of the page.
