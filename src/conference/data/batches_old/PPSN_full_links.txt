 Parallel Problem Solving From Nature 
 PPSN 2024 
 September 14 - 18, 2024 
 Hagenberg, Austria 
 Welcome to PPSN 2024! 
 The International Conference on Parallel Problem Solving From Nature is a biannual open forum fostering the study of natural models, iterative optimization heuristics search heuristics, machine learning, and other artificial intelligence approaches. We invite researchers and practitioners to present their work, ranging from rigorously derived mathematical results to carefully crafted empirical studies. 
 All information regarding the conference organization, call for papers/tutorials/workshops, submission, registration, venue, etc. will be provided and constantly updated on this website and on our social media channels. In case of any additional inquiries, please do not hesitate tocontact us. 
 See you soon in beautiful Hagenberg, Austria!

 Abstract 
 Co-evolutionary algorithms (CoEAs), which pair candidate designs with test cases, are frequently used in adversarial optimisation, particularly for binary test-based problems where designs and tests yield binary outcomes. The effectiveness of designs is determined by their performance against tests, and the value of tests is based on their ability to identify failing designs, often leading to more sophisticated tests and improved designs. However, CoEAs can exhibit complex, sometimes pathological behaviours like disengagement. Through runtime analysis, we aim to rigorously analyse whether CoEAs can efficiently solve test-based adversarial optimisation problems in an expected polynomial runtime. 
  
 This paper carries out the first rigorous runtime analysis of (1, λ)-CoEA for binary test-based adversarial optimisation problems. In particular, we introduce a binary test-based benchmark problem called Diagonal problem and initiate the first runtime analysis of competitive CoEA on this problem. The mathematical analysis shows that the (1, λ)-CoEA can efficiently find an ε approximation to the optimal solution of the Diagonal problem, i.e. in expected polynomial runtime assuming sufficiently low mutation rates and large offspring population size. On the other hand, the standard (1, λ)-EA fails to find an ε approximation to the optimal solution of the Diagonal problem in polynomial runtime. This illustrates the potential of coevolution for solving binary adversarial optimisation problems.
