 SEAMS 2021 Goes Virtual The current trends in the global Covid-19 pandemic make it very unlikely that we will be able to hold a physical conference in Madrid in May 2021 with sufficient assurances of safety. Hence, it is with great sadness that​ we announce that SEAMS 2021, along with ICSE and other co-located events, will be held virtually this year.

 20th International Conference on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems 
 Today we are building an exciting future in which autonomous vehicles navigate complex environments, smart cities help solve public problems and achieve a higher quality of life, and service robots support social care workers or perform tasks that are too dangerous for humans. However, these software-intensive systems must continuously preserve and optimize their operation in the presence of uncertain changes in their operating environment, resource variability, evolving user needs, attacks and faults. In addition, the complexity of these systems demands them to adapt and manage themselves autonomously. 
 SEAMS is a CORE-A ranked conference that applies software engineering methods, techniques, processes, and tools to support the construction of safe, performant, and cost-effective self-adaptive and autonomous systems that provide self-* properties like self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization, and self-protection. The objective of SEAMS is to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to investigate, discuss, examine, and advance the fundamental principles, state of the art, and the solutions addressing critical challenges of engineering self-adaptive and self-managing systems.

 Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems 
 The annual conference on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS) attempts to consolidate interest within the software engineering community on self-adaptive, self-managing, self-healing, self-optimizing, self-configuring, and self-organizing systems. The aim of SEAMS is to discuss progress and challenges in this important area of software engineering. 
 SEAMS is a co-located event to theInternational Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE). The first SEAMS workshop was held at ICSE 2006. After five very successful years as a workshop, SEAMS became a Symposium co-located with ICSE in 2011. In 2021, SEAMS was ranked inhref="http://portal.core.edu.au/core/media/justification/CORE2021/4612SEAMS.pdf" - CORE (A ranking)
. In 2024, SEAMS became a Conference co-located with ICSE.
