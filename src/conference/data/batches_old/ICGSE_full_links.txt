4-min. readNamed after department icon and professor emeritusCarla Savage, theCarla Savage Awardsare an intra-departmental initiative that recognizes outstanding achievement within the department. 
 Yuchen LiuYuchen Liuleads theNetworking and Intelligence (NICE) Lab. His research interests lie in the areas of networking, machine learning, wireless systems, mobile sensing and computing, digital twins and security. He received his Ph.D. degree from Georgia Tech in 2022. His recent work explores innovations in digital twins, foundation models and explainable artificial intelligence, and how these advancements are revolutionizing next-generation networks and autonomous systems. The long-term goal is to advance user-centric applications through ubiquitous networking and intelligence in diverse areas. He has organized multiple workshop series at Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Communications Society conferences (International Conference on Computer Communications [INFOCOM], Global Communications Conference [GLOBECOM], International Conference on Communications [ICC] and more) and serves as an Associate Editor for four high-impact journals. 
 Liu’s nominators write that he is an outstanding educator and researcher; he consistently earns top student evaluations, including a perfect 5.0 in one course. Liu successfully manages large classes, with 94 students enrolled in his Fall 2024 Computer Networking course. Of the many papers he published in 2024, nine were in top IEEE Journals and 16 were featured in IEEE/Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) conferences, with two papers earning Best Paper Runner-Up awards. Since joining the department in 2022, Liu has published over 40 top-tier papers, most co-authored with students. He fosters a collaborative, supportive environment where student well-being is a priority. Liu mentors with optimism, encourages work-life balance and builds strong relationships, making him an exceptional advisor and leader. 
 Sandeep Kaur KuttalSandeep Kaur Kuttaldirects the Human Factors + Experience Engineering Lab (Discovering and Inventing for Human-Centered SE and AI). Kuttal is also a member of the College of Engineering’s AI Advisory Team. Her research integrates human-computer interaction, software engineering (SE) and AI. Kuttal is the recipient of two prestigious awards: an National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER award and an Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) Young Investor Program (YIP) award. She also received a letter of commendation from the U.S. Senator James M. Inhofe for the YIP award. Her research excellence was recognized with Best Paper and Honorable Mention Awards at the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) and a Best Paper Award at the ACM/IEEE International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE). Kuttal serves on the editorial board of the Journal of Computer Languages (COLA) and the Human-AI committee of the International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCII). She’s held key roles at major research conferences, including: the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE), the International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE), the International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE) and the Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC). 
 Kuttal’s nominators write that she is a leading researcher in software engineering and human-computer interaction, publishing in top venues like ICSE, CHI and ACM’s Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM). As an exceptional Ph.D. advisor, Kuttal provides expert guidance, ensuring students publish regularly while supporting their professional growth. She fosters a collaborative and innovative research environment, where students are engaged in high-impact projects. Kuttal is organizing IEEE VL/HCC 2025 at NC State and actively shares research through keynote speeches. Her leadership, mentorship and research excellence make her a key figure in the field. 
 Shandler A. MasonShandler A. Masonis a Ph.D. candidate advised by Sandeep Kuttal in the Human Factors + Experience Engineering Lab. Her research focuses on discovering societal and technological barriers for software users and programmers and inventing methodologies to support software practitioners. Shandler received her M.S. in computer science from NC State and her B.S. in computer science with a minor in applied mathematics from North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University. 
 Mason’s nominators write that in just 2 ½ years, she has built an impressive research record, publishing in top venues such as TOSEM, ICSE and VL/HCC. Her body of work includes one journal paper, four full research papers, a short paper and a poster presentation. An independent and visionary researcher, Shandler is making a transformative impact on SE and human-computer interaction. Her research focuses on identifying inclusivity barriers in collaborative software tools and developing frameworks to address them. By exploring how demographic diversity – such as race, gender, disability and age – affects collaboration, she is driving meaningful change in technology. Her academic excellence, creativity and commitment to inclusivity make her a rising leader in the field. 
 Mason is expected to become Dr. Mason in 2026. Currently, she is exploring opportunities to pursue a research career in academia or industry.

 Present CFP : 2022 
 The International Conference on Global Software Engineering (ICGSE) will again be held jointly with the International Conference on Software and Systems Processes Software Engineering (ICSSP) on May 20-22, 2022. The conference is co-sponsored and will be hosted by the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (USA). 
  
 The theme of the 2022 conference is "Envisioning the Future of Software Engineering Process & Practice for Global Competitiveness & Innovation" 
  
 To view the call for submissions and to learn more about the conference and the venue, go to ICSSP/ICGSE 2022 website: https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/news-events/events/icssp/ 
  
 Some information on the submission process is included below. Please feel free also to contact the Program Co-chairs and the Industry Chair for more information. 
  
 ICSSP and ICGSE 2022 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to share their research findings, experiences, and new ideas on diverse topics related to software and system processes and global software engineering. The goal is to advance both the state of the research and the state of the practice by applying innovative ideas from different fields of research to the future of software engineering processes and globally distributed software development. 
  
 TOPICS OF INTEREST 
  
 Submissions must be related to software and systems processes and/or global software engineering. For 2022 we are especially interested in, but not limited to, papers relating to the following topics: 
  
 Work from Anywhere (WFX) 
 Education and Training 
 Future and Innovation Related to Software Process and Collaboration 
 Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics in Software Process and Development 
 Business Strategy 
 Methods and Processes 
 Hybrid Processes 
 Human Aspects of Distributed Software Development and Processes 
 Systems-Software Interfaces 
  
 Specific points of interest for each of these topics are listed on the conference website. 

SUBMISSIONS 
  
 Submissions are invited for unpublished original work in the following categories: 
  
 *Full Papers* (10 pages + 2 pages of references) that reflect completed and evaluated research on novel approaches to major software and systems engineering process challenges, especially relating to the Future of Software Engineering Process & Practice for Global Competitiveness and Innovation. Enhanced versions of the best research papers will be included in a special issue of the Journal of Software: Evolution and Process. 
  
 *Short papers* (5 pages including references) that present concise research results, describe work-in-progress (e.g. Ph. D. research), or conceptual and position papers addressing new perspectives, open questions and future directions. Short papers can also be industrial papers, for instance, describing practical challenges or research needs motivated by experience. 
  
 *Industry talks and experience reports* We invite proposals from industrial practitioners for both general talks and experience reports that take on significance from an industrial context. 
  
 For industry talks we seek presentations about significant real-world issues related to Software Engineering Process & Practice for Global Competitiveness & Innovation, especially those challenges that may benefit from cooperation between researchers and practitioners. 
  
 Through industry experience reports you can share your practical experience through a paper and accompanying talk at the conference. These will reflect your own industrial experiences, such as particular problems seen, approaches tried, and results both positive and negative, ideally with lessons learned from which other practitioners may benefit. 
  
 A more complete call for industry talks and experience reports will follow. (Please note that industrial contributors are also welcome to submit full and short papers through the research track.)

 Event Details 
 Thank you for attending the International Conference on Software and Systems Processes (ICSSP) 2022, co-sponsored by the International Software and Systems Process Association and the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute. 
 Envisioning the Future of Software Engineering Process & Practice for Global Competitiveness & Innovation 
 The Software Engineering Institute is proud to host and co-sponsor ICSSP 2022 and bring the conference back home to where much of the early software engineering work originated, including foundational work in process management/measurement, architecture, and software assurance. The SEI helped establish tenets for modern software engineering practice in architecture, assurance, formal analysis, virtual integration, automated code analysis and testing, and measurement and analysis. While the software ecosystem continues to change dramatically through commercial investments in software and technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, the SEI—and others worldwide—continue to build on these software engineering tenets that underpin new advancements. Today, the Software Engineering Institute is a leader in software engineering, cybersecurity engineering, and AI engineering and is dedicated to researching complex problems; creating and testing innovative technologies; and transitioning maturing solutions into practice. The SEI has been working with the U.S. Department of Defense, government agencies, and private industry since 1984 to help meet mission goals and gain strategic advantage in software engineering. 
 ICSSP 2022 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to share their research findings, experiences, and new ideas on diverse topics related to software and system processes and global software engineering. For 2022, the theme of the joint conference is: “Envisioning the Future of Software Engineering Process & Practice for Global Competitiveness and Innovation.” The goal is to advance both the state of the research and the state of the practice by applying innovative ideas from different fields of research to the future of software engineering process and globally distributed software development.
