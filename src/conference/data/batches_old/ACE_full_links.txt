 Submission deadline | October 13, 2023 
 Call for participation 
 We warmly invite you to submit a research or practitioner paper to the 26th annual Australasian Computing Education Conference (ACE 2024). ACE is a high-quality international conference, run in-cooperation with SIGCSE, that provides a forum for educators and researchers to share innovations and insights in computing education. 
 ACE 2024 will run in parallel with several other events as part ofAustralasian Computer Science Week(ACSW) [site still to be updated for 2024], 29th January-2nd February, 2024 at a location to be advised, in Australia. 
 In addition to publishing research from leading computing education researchers, the ACE community is very welcoming and supportive of researchers who are new to computing education research, and practitioners who wish to discuss and develop good computing education practice. Topics of interest for the conference include, but are not limited to: 
 the use of technology in computing education; 
 course content; 
 curriculum structure; 
 methods of assessment and evaluation; 
 pedagogy and learning theories; 
 mobile, flexible, online learning, and 
 valuations of alternative approaches 
 The Program Committee will select the papers to appear based on their potential to enhance learning outcomes in computing courses. Both research papers and practitioner papers must be between 5 and 10 pages in length (inclusive of any references). To illustrate the variety of work presented at ACE, you may wish to view recent conference proceedings which are available on the ACM Digital Library:

RESEARCH PAPERS 
 Papers on research and innovations may be in the context of formal courses or self-directed learning; they may involve, for example, introductory programming, service courses, capstone courses, specialist undergraduate or postgraduate topics, or industry-related short courses. We welcome submissions directed at issues of current and local importance, as well as topics of international interest. Such topics may include the transition from school to university, articulation between vocational and university education, quality management in teaching, teaching people from other cultures, globalisation, attracting and retaining female students, online, mobile and blended learning. Research papers would typically describe research questions, and address these through the careful presentation of methods, results, and limitations, while clearly stating the contribution of the work. 
 PRACTITIONER PAPERS 
 In addition to research papers, ACE provides the opportunity for teachers to demonstrate new educational tools, and to share interesting teaching resources, assignments, and techniques that may be of broad interest to the community. We encourage the submission of papers that present interesting ways to teach challenging concepts, engaging activities that promote student learning, and compelling assignments. Practitioner papers would typically describe a computing education approach or tool, the context of its use, and present a rich reflection on how it worked in practice. 
 STUDENT PAPERS 
 Student authors (of research or practitioner papers) may be eligible for a CORE Student Research award. To qualify as a student paper: 
 the major contribution must be made by a student author, who must be listed as first author; and 
 at the time of submission, the authors must indicate that their paper is to be classified as a student paper, and provide a letter of confirmation from the student’s supervisor or Head of Department by email to the conference chairs. 
 REVIEW PROCESS 
 All research and practitioner papers will be fully refereed, using a double-blind reviewing process, by a minimum of three members of the Program Committee.
