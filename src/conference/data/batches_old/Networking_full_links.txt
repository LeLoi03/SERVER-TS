DSN 2025 
 The 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks 
 Naples, Italy, June 23-26, 2025 
 Welcome 
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we extend you a warm welcome to the 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2025), organized by Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy. Over the years DSN has become a forum to present the best world research in the fusion between dependability and security research, understanding the need to simultaneously fight against accidental faults, intentional cyber-attacks, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions. We are looking forward to a conference filled with ideas from industry and academia. 
 DSN 2025 will be held in Naples, Italy from 23 to 26 June 2025. Naples, an enchanting city of sea and culture. Naples was founded by Greeks in the first millennium BC and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited urban areas in the world. Naples is the capital of Campania lies in the bay of the same name next to the volcano Vesuvius and offers a spectacular view as far as the islands of Capri, Ischia, and Procida. Naples' historic city center is the largest in Europe and has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A wide range of culturally and historically significant sites are nearby, including the Palace of Caserta and the Roman ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Naples is also known for its natural beauties, such as Posillipo, Phlegraean Fields, Nisida, and Vesuvius. Neapolitan cuisine is noted for its association with pizza, which originated in the city, as well as numerous other local dishes. 
 We look forward to meeting you in Naples!!!
