We are excited to have an opportunity to take part in the organization of an international conference that gathers researchers and professionals from academia and industry to share experiences and new ideas in such a dynamic area as Information and Communication Technology. Technology is increasingly shaping the prosperity of countries and companies.

Emerging information and communication technologies are key drivers of the digital society and economy. With evolving and new services we are enabling people to innovate, learn, collaborate, and through joint research and technology advancement we are opening ground for new discoveries and sustainable economic growth. Our conference will provide opportunities to interact and network with presenters, experts, peers, and colleagues, as well as to participate in various discussions. The 33rd International Conference on Software, Telecommunications and Computer Networks (SoftCOM 2025), technically co-sponsored by the IEEE Communications Society, will be held on September 18-20, 2025 in the beautiful city of Split located on the magnificent Croatian Adriatic coast.
