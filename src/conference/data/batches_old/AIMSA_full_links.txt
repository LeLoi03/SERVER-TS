 Mission Statement 
 The non-profit corporation that runs MLSys aims to foster the exchange of research advances at the intersection of machine learning and systems, principally by hosting an annual interdisciplinary academic conference with the highest ethical standards for a diverse and inclusive community. 
 About the Conference 
 The MLSys community recognized that many critical future challenges are at the intersection of Machine Learning and Systems. The community was created to solve these exciting problems by recognizing the needs for scaling interdisciplinary collaboration as well as the importance of working together between industry and academia. With the growing importance of holistic machine learning and systems approaches when building real-world AI systems, the MLSys conference plays an even more significant role in today’s AI landscape. 
 Interdisciplinary Focus:MLSys uniquely bridges the gap between machine learning and systems design. In the era of generative AI, which requires significant computational resources and innovative algorithms, this interdisciplinary approach is crucial for developing more efficient and effective AI systems. 
 Optimization of AI Systems:The conference discusses not just AI models but also the systems that support them. This includes topics like hardware acceleration, distributed computing, and energy-efficient designs, all of which are vital for running large-scale AI models efficiently. 
 Advancements in Modeling:The conference showcases the latest advancements in machine learning models with practical system considerations. With rapid developments in this field, MLSys provides a platform for researchers and practitioners to present their latest findings, contributing to the collective knowledge and progress in intelligent systems. 
 Industry and Academic Collaboration:MLSys is a meeting point for both industry leaders and academic researchers. This collaboration fosters the translation of academic research into practical, real-world applications in the field of machine learning and systems. 
 Ethical and Societal Implications:As AI systems become more prevalent, its societal and ethical implications become more significant. MLSys provides a forum for discussing these implications, ensuring that advancements in AI are aligned with ethical standards and societal needs. 
 Education and Training:By bringing together leading experts in the field, MLSys plays a role in education and training for the next generation of AI and systems researchers and practitioners, who will be at the forefront of developing and deploying AI technologies. 
 The steering committee and program committees consist of 110 leading members of the AI systems area coming from industry and academia with expertise ranging from machine learning to systems to security. The MLSys community welcomes industry participation and sponsorships; we believe the investment will pay dividends in both technology advancement and industry growth for years to come.

 The Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence 

Download the Brochure in 
 EN/FR/ES/AR/TR/CA 
 The Council of EuropeFramework Convention on Artificial Intelligenceand human rights, democracy and the rule of law is thefirst-ever international legally binding treatyin this field. Opened for signature on 5 September 2024, it aims to ensure that activities within the lifecycle of artificial intelligence systems are fully consistent with human rights, democracy and the rule of law, while being conducive to technological progress and innovation. 
 Framework Conventionand itsExplanatory Report 
 The Framework Convention complements existing international standards on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, andaims to fill any legal gaps that may result from rapid technological advances. In order to stand the test of time, the Framework Convention does not regulate technology and is essentiallytechnology-neutral.

 How was it elaborated?What does it require states to do?Who is covered?How is the implementation monitored?How was the Framework Convention elaborated?Work was initiated in 2019, when the ad hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI) was tasked with examining the feasibility of such an instrument. Following its mandate, it was succeeded in 2022 by the Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAI) which drafted and negotiated the text. 
 The Framework Convention was drafted by the 46 member states of the Council of Europe, with the participation of all observer states: Canada, Japan, Mexico, the Holy See and the United States of America, as well as the European Union, and a significant number of non-member states: Australia, Argentina, Costa Rica, Israel, Peru and Uruguay. 
 In line with the Council of Europe’s practice of multi-stakeholder engagement, 68 international representatives from civil society, academia and industry, as well as several other international organisations were also actively involved in the development of the Framework Convention. 
 What does the Framework Convention require states to do? 
 Fundamental principles 
 Activities within the lifecycle of AI systems must comply with the following fundamental principles: 
 Human dignity and individual autonomy 
 Equality and non-discrimination 
 Respect for privacy and personal data protection 
 Transparency and oversight 
 Accountability and responsibility 
 Reliability 
 Safe innovation 
 Remedies, procedural rights and safeguards 
 Document the relevant information regarding AI systems and their usage and to make it available to affected persons; 
 The information must be sufficient to enable people concerned to challenge the decision(s) made through the use of the system or based substantially on it, and to challenge the use of the system itself; 
 Effective possibility to lodge a complaint to competent authorities; 
 Provide effective procedural guarantees, safeguards and rights to affected persons in connection with the application of an artificial intelligence system where an artificial intelligence system significantly impacts upon the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms; 
 Provision of notice that one is interacting with an artificial intelligence system and not with a human being. 
 Risk and impact management requirements 
 Carry out risk and impact assessments in respect of actual and potential impacts on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, in an iterative manner; 
 Establishment of sufficient prevention and mitigation measures as a result of the implementation of these assessments; 
 Possibility for the authorities to introduce ban or moratoria on certain application of AI systems (“red lines”). 
 Who is covered by the Framework Convention?The Framework Convention covers the use of AI systems bypublic authorities– includingprivate actorsacting on their behalf – andprivate actors. 
 The Convention offers Parties two modalities to comply with its principles and obligations when regulating the private sector: Parties may opt to be directly obliged by the relevant Convention provisions or, as an alternative, take other measures to comply with the treaty’s provisions while fully respecting their international obligations regarding human rights, democracy and the rule of law. 
 Parties to the Framework Convention are not required to apply the provisions of the treaty to activities related to the protection of their national security interests but must ensure that such activities respect international law and democratic institutions and processes. The Framework Convention does not apply to national defence matters nor to research and development activities, except when the testing of AI systems may have the potential to interfere with human rights, democracy, or the rule of law. 
 How is the implementation of the Framework Convention monitored?The Framework Convention establishes a follow-up mechanism, the Conference of the Parties, composed of official representatives of the Parties to the Convention to determine the extent to which its provisions are being implemented. Their findings and recommendations help to ensure States’ compliance with the Framework Convention and guarantee its long-term effectiveness. The Conference of the Parties shall also facilitate co-operation with relevant stakeholders, including through public hearings concerning pertinent aspects of the implementation of the Framework Convention.
