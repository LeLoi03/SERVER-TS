 The 25thACM Symposium on Document Engineering 
 September 2, 2025 to September 5, 2025 
 University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UKThe 25thACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng'25) seeks original research papers that focus on the design, implementation, development, management, use and evaluation of advanced systems where documents and document collections play a key role. DocEng emphasizes innovative approaches to document engineering technology, use of documents and document collections in real-world applications, and novel principles, tools and processes that improve our ability to create, manage, maintain, share, and productively use these. 
 In particular, DocEng'25 seeks contributions on the theme ofDocument Trust and Security. 
 You are invited to submit original papers to DocEng'25, to be held in Nottingham, UK. Attendees at this international forum have interests that span all aspects of document engineering and applications.

Document engineeringis the computer science discipline that investigates systems for documents in any form and in all media. As with the relationship between software engineering and software, document engineering is concerned with principles, tools and processes that improve our ability to create, manage, and maintain documents. 
 TheACM Symposium on Document Engineeringis an annual meeting of researchers active in document engineering. Interested researchers are invited to submit papers and to attend the Symposium, which is held in the latter part of each year. DocEng is the leading international ACM Symposium for researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences in the domain of document engineering. It is sponsored by ACM by means of the ACM SIGWEB Special Interest Group and in cooperation with ACM SIGDOC. All DocEng Proceedings are available through theACM Digital Library.
