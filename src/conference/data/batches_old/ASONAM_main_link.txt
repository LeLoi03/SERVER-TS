 Welcome to ASONAM 2025 
 The 17th International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining -ASONAM-2025 
  
 The study of social networks originated in social and business communities. In recent years, social network research has advanced significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine learning techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social medium that fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences and knowledge, group activities, community formation and evolution. This has led to a rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics homeland security and business. This follows the pattern of known entities of our society that have evolved into networks in which actors are increasingly dependent on their structural embedding. 
 The international conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2025) will primarily provide an interdisciplinary venue that will bring together practitioners and researchers from a variety of SNAM fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices. ASONAM 2025 is intended to address important aspects with a specific focus on the emerging trends and industry needs associated with social networking analysis and mining. The conference solicits experimental and theoretical works on social network analysis and mining along with their application to real life situations. 
 Full papers will be reviewed and assessed by the program committee and a "Best Paper Award" ceremony will be organized at the banquet. 
 News 
 - Good news: ASONAM is now included in the prestigious CORE Conference Portal in Australia.
