 Fitness landscape analysis and manipulation in Biomedical disciplines 
  
 Aim 
 Many complex computational tasks in the bio-medical disciplines (e.g., Bioinformatics, Bioengineering, Systems Biology, Synthetic Biology, and Computational Biology) can be reformulated in terms of optimization problems, that is, the identification of the global minima (or maxima) of a given function (or multiple functions) inside a multi-dimensional search space. In global optimization techniques, which denote the algorithms leveraged to solve such problems, the data structures used to represent thecandidate solutionscan sometimes bedirectly decodedandinterpreted. Consequently, the best-fitting individuals immediately provide an explicit andhuman-readabledescription of the optimal solution. The researchers, who mainly focused on the creation of novel strategies, often aim to propose solutions able to balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the optimization algorithms. 
 Although this well-established research line is very prolific—paving the way for the design of efficient algorithms, even for large-scale problems—there is another promising direction that should be investigated, consisting in theanalysis and modification of the fitness landscape, that is the hyper-surface induced by the evaluation of the objective function for each point of the search space. Indeed, the analysis of the fitness landscape might help in the choice of the optimization algorithm to use and the choice of the space transformations to use, such as dilate, shrink, stretch, collapse, smooth, or remap the fitness landscape, leading to alternative or simplified formulations of the original optimization problem. 
 In discrete domains, a similar approach can be performed by embedding implicitor explicit assumptionsinto the structure of the candidate solutions. In such a way, the genetic operators can explore the feasible search space in a “smarter” way, reducing the overall computational effort. Examples of this technique include generative representations, techniques based on grammar, single parent techniques where example genes are incorporated, and other structured representations that starkly limit the portion of the search domain examined. 
 This special session aims to gather the researchers investigating new directions and ideas in the field ofcandidate solution representations, its dual notion offitness landscape manipulationandits analysisto tackle complex tasks, especially problems related to Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. 
 Scope 
 This Special Session welcomes any paper considering allnon-conventional candidate solution representations, including the dual perspective offitness landscape manipulation, andits analysis. 
 Examples include but are not limited to: 
 Non-conventional representations of candidate solutions 
 Dilation functions and other functions that reshape the fitness landscape 
 Generative automata 
 Alternative semantics for candidate solutions 
 Fitness landscape modification, simplification, and restriction 
 Novel closed variation/evolutionary operators 
 Implicit/relative representations 
 Generative or developmental representations 
 Self-adaptive representations 
 Parameterized manifolds of representations 
 State-conditioned representations 
 Procedural representations 
 Surrogate models 
 Highly interpretable representations

 IEEE CIS Task Force on Optimization Methods in Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (OMBB) 
 The IEEE CIS Task Force on Optimization Methods in Bioinformatics and Bioengineering (OMBB) is a Task Force under theIEEE Bioinformatics and Bioengineering Technical Committee (BBTC). 
 Our Mission 
 Our aim is to promote research on the design, application and theory of optimization methods in the field of Bioinformatics and Bioengineering. 
 Upcoming Events 
 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology 2025 (CIBCB 2025), Tainan, Taiwan. 
 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Health and Medicine (IEEE CIHM) at the 2025 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI 2025), Trondheim, Norway. 
 What is Bioinformatics and Bioengineering? 
 Bioinformatics and Bioengineering are interdisciplinary scientific fields involving many branches of computer science, engineering, mathematics, and statistics. 
 Bioinformaticsis concerned with the development and application of computational methods for the modeling, retrieving and analysis of biological data. There is a long list of problems in the field that can be formulated as optimization problems including, just to name a few, the optimization of biochemical processes, protein structure alignment and prediction, protein sequence alignment, directed evolution, drug design and discovery, and experimental design. 
 Whilst Bioinformatics uses computers to understand biology better,Bioengineeringis the application of engineering techniques to biology so as to create usable and economically viable products. Typical problems in the field deal with the design of biological systems, optimization of manufacturing processes, material and equipment optimization, and biomedical equipment manufacturing. 
 Why a Task Force Group on Optimization Methods in Bioinformatics and Bioengineering? 
 Bioinformatics and Bioengineering are relatively new fields subject to different types of challenging optimization problems, urging the need for effective optimization methods due to several reasons: 
 Biological data sets are typically complex, very large, include noisy measurements, and may change over time, thus requiring advanced optimization approaches. 
 Problems can often be formulated as multiobjective optimization problems, and thus require optimization methods capable of discovering a set of trade-off solutions (i.e. Pareto optimal solutions) rather than a single solution. 
 Problems may involve time-consuming and expensive physical experiments and/or computer simulations, and thus require optimization methods that arrive at a robust solution as quickly as possible, whilst, potentially, needing to account for constraints, uncertainty, mixed-variable types, user preferences, and various resourcing issues. 
 Problems can be “black box” (i.e. lack gradient information) and thus call for derivative-free optimization methods, such as nature-inspired algorithms and heuristics.
