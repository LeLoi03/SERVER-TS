 Since its inception in 1989 as AWOCA (Australasian Workshop on Combinatorial Algorithms), IWOCA has provided an annual forum for researchers who design algorithms for the myriad combinatorial problems that underlie computer applications in science, engineering and business. Previous IWOCA and AWOCA meetings have been held in Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, UK, Taiwan and USA. Information on previous IWOCA conferences can be found athref="http://www.iwoca.org/" - http://www.iwoca.org
IWOCA 2024 will take place at Hotel Continental Terme in Ischia, Italy.

 Proceedings 
 Conference proceedings will be published in the LNCS series of Springer, within the ARCoSS subline. 
 Journal Special Issues 
 Authors of selected papers accepted to IWOCA will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to a Special Issue in Journal of Computer and Systems Sciences, and Acta Informatica.Awards 
 Awards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper. To be eligible for the best student paper award, at least one of the paper authors must be a full-time student at the time of submission, and the student(s) must have made a significant contribution to the paper. 
 The program committee may decline to make these awards or may split them. 
 Submission instructions 
 Authors are invited to submit high-quality manuscripts reporting original unpublished research in the topics related to the symposium. Simultaneous submission to other conferences or workshops with published proceedings is not allowed. It is required that each accepted paper be presented at the conference by one of its authors. 
 Submissions must be in the form of a single pdf file prepared using the LNCS latex templates and style files. Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are also available on Overleaf. Springer’s authors’ guidelines may be consultedhere.Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers, and requieres to draw the attention of the contributing conference paper authors to thehref="https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct" - Code of Conduct.
 
 Each submission should consist of the main part of the paper, not exceeding 12 pages (including the title page and excluding the references), plus an optional clearly marked appendix (to be read at the discretion of the program committee). Any figure pertaining to the main part of the paper should be included therein (within the 12 page limit). For a paper eligible for the best student paper, besides identifying it as "Student Paper" in the submission system, it is recommended that the first page include an indication of whether the paper is eligible for the best student paper award. 
 Submissions not conforming to the above rules as well as papers outside of the scope of the conference will be rejected with­out consideration. 
 Papers are to be submitted electronically through EquinOCS at the following link:href="https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/iwoca2025" - https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/iwoca2025

 The 36th International Workshop on Combinatorial Algorithms (IWOCA 2025) will be held during July 21-24, 2025, in Bozeman, MT, USA. Bozeman is 90 miles away from Yellowstone National Park, and late July is probably the best time to visit Yellowstone. 
  
 If you plan to visit Yellowstone, please plan early; and, if you do not plan to rent a car, you might need to contact some local travel agent as soon as possible. Some information can be found on Travel and Lodging. | Abstract Deadline: March 4, 2025 (a.o.e.)

 Office: Barnard 355 | Besides Yellowstone, Bozeman itself has quite some local attractions --- it has the largest airport in the state of Montana. For example, the famous American Computer and Robotics Museum is probably a must-see venue for CS-related people. 
  
 If you like outdoor hiking, etc., Hyliate Lake and its nearby trails could provide exciting trips with different levels of difficulty. For more information, please check Local Attractions.
