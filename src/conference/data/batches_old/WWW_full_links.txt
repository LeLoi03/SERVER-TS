 Since the invention of the World Wide Web in 1989, The Web Conference (formerly known as the International World Wide Web Conference, abbreviated as WWW) is a yearly international academic conference on the topic of the future direction of the World Wide Web. This conference has been the premier venue to present and discuss progress in research, development, standards, and applications of the topics related to the Web. Over the past three decades, The Web Conference has been the forum where some of the most fundamental Web technologies have been introduced, such as the Anatomy of a Large Scale Web Search Engine in 1998 prefiguring Google, the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003, and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007 (see also the Test of Time Award past recipients). The conference assembles scholars, researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and end-users with one unifying goal: to envision and create the future of the Web. 
  
 The 2025 ACM Web Conference will offer a high-quality program made of research sessions, posters, and demonstrations, a PhD symposium for the junior scholars, workshops, tutorials, a developers track for the practitioners as well as thought-provoking keynote speakers, panels, special tracks, and colocated special days. 
  
 The 2025 ACM Web Conference is an in-person conference with rich virtual components including live streaming of keynotes, oral presentations, workshops, and tutorials, as well as access to pre-recorded videos of talks, and the Whova platform for interaction with all conference attendees. 
  
 We thank you for participating and look forward to seeing you in Sydney, Australia!

 Scope 
 The scope of the conference is the Web and how it has crucially enabled new research and applications. While the Web feeds on and is part of a broader interdisciplinary ecosystem, including technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and many others, it remains a distinct scholarly field, with its own research methods, tools, and challenges. 
 A typical Web Conference paper should have explicit focus on at least one of the following: 
 understanding, evaluating, and improving the Web as a technical infrastructure; including core Web technologies, standards, and platforms 
 understanding, evaluating, and improving the Web as a socio-economic system; 
 understanding better the impact of the Web and Web technologies; 
 democratizing access to Web content and technologies, making it more accessible, fair, inclusive, and accountable to a wide range of audiences.

 Relevance. Every submission must clearly state how the work is relevant to the Web and to the track in thefirstpage. Submissions that merely use a Web artifact---e.g., a dataset or a Web Application Programmer Interface (API) or a social network---rather than answering a specific Web-related scientific research challenge, are out of scope and will be desk-rejected. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 Deadlines.The submission deadlines arestrictand no extensions, regardless of circumstances, will be allowed. Placeholder/dummy abstracts are forbidden. 
 Authorship. The ACM has anhref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship" - authorship policy
stating who can be considered an author in a submission as well as the use of generative AI tools. Every person named as the author of a paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the paper and/or to the writing of the paper and must take responsibility for the entire content of a paper. 
 Maximum authorship. The number of submissions allowed per author is limited to9(nine)maximum, accumulatively across the research tracks. If more than 9 papers are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional papers submitted after the first 9 by submission id, will be desk-rejected. 
 Authorship changes. The full list of authors, including the ordering, must be finalizedat the point of submission. Therecannotbe any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after submission time. The only changes allowed are the correction of spelling mistakes or new affiliation. 
 Anonymity. The review process will bedouble-blind. The submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information. This may include, but is not restricted to acknowledgments, self-citations, references to prior work by the author(s), and so on. Please use the third-person to identify your own prior work. You may explicitly refer in the paper to organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions and tools. 
 Formatting Requirements. Submissions must be in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to thehref="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template" - ACM template and format
(alsohref="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty" - available
in Overleaf). Word users may use the Word Interim Template and the recommended setting for LaTeX is: 
 \documentclass\[sigconf, anonymous, review\]{acmart}. 
 Submissions must be a single PDF file:8(eight)pages as main paper, with unlimited pages for references and an optional Appendix (that can contain details on reproducibility, proofs, pseudo-code, etc). The first 8 pages should be self-contained, since reviewers are not required to read past that. 
 Originality and Concurrent Submissions. Submissions must present original work---this means that papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference/journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted. Submissions that have been previously presented orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in non-archival venues with no formal proceedings, including workshops or PhD symposia without proceedings, are allowed. Authors may submit anonymized work that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv or SSRN) without citing it. The ACM has a stricthref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview" - policy against plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification
that applies to all publications. 
 Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent.Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when appropriate. You and your co-authors are subject to allhref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc" - ACM Publications Policies
, includinghref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" - ACM's Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects
(posted in 2021). Please ensure all authors are familiar with these policies. 
 Please consult the regulations of your institution(s) indicating when a review by an Institutional Ethics Review Board (IRB) is needed. Note that submitting your research for approval by such may not always be sufficient. Even if such research has been approved by your IRB, the program committee might raise additional concerns about the ethical implications of the work and include these concerns in its review. 
 Submissions that do not follow these guidelines or do not view or print properly, will be desk-rejected. 
 Reviewing Process 
 Reviewing. Each paper is submitted to one of the tracks listed above. Papers that do not conform to the conference scope or submission guidelines will be desk-rejected by the track chair (aka Senior Area Chair, SAC). Each submission will receive at least three independent reviews within each track and the process overseen by an Area Chair (AC). Authors may be requested to serve as reviewers. 
 Rebuttal. Authors will have the chance to provide a response to the reviews during an author-reviewer discussion period. The ACs and SACs will consider the authors' responses to the points raised by the reviewers to inform acceptance decisions. 
 Decision. A range of factors including technical merit, originality, potential impact, quality of execution, quality of presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics, will be used by the ACs and SACs to make a recommendation. The PC Chairs will make the final decisions. 
 Transparency.By submitting paper(s) to The Web Conference 2024, the authors agree that the reviews, meta-reviews, and discussions will be made public in OpenReview for all accepted papers. 
 Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy 
 All authors and reviewers must declare conflicts of interest in OpenReview. You must declare adomain conflict(entered in Education & Career History) for employment at the same institution or company, regardless of geography/location, currently or in the last 12 months. You must declare apersonal conflictwhen the following associations exist: 
 candidate for employment at the same institution or company 
 co-author on book/paper or co-PI on a funded grant/research proposal in the last 24 months 
 active collaborator 
 family relationship or close personal relationship 
 graduate advisee/advisor relationship, regardless of time elapsed since graduation 
 deep personal animosity 
 In general, we expect authors, PC, the organizing committee, and other volunteers to adhere tohref="https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/acm-conflict-of-interest-policy" - ACM's Conflict of Interest Policy
as well as thehref="https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct" - ACM's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct
. 
 Publication and Presentation Policies 
 Publication. All accepted papers will be allowed the same maximum page length in the proceedings (12pages, of which8are content pages), which will be published by ACM and will be accessible via the ACM Digital Library. Accepted papers will require a further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers can and should include all information to identify authors, and should acknowledge any funding received that directly supported the presented research. In addition, all papers are required to submit abrief pre-recorded video, which will appear on ACM Digital Library, along with the PDF of the papers. 
 Registration. To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by adistinctconference registration, e.g., two papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day) or Main Conference (3-day) registration, at the standard (non-student) in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the camera-ready deadline. This registration requirement applies universally, regardless of attendance or presentation mode. 
 Presentation. Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings. There will be two forms of presentation: 
 Oral Presentation. Among the accepted papers, asubsetwill be selected for oral presentation. Generally we expect oral presentations to be in-person, but may allow a few online presentations by authors with significant travel difficulties. 
 Poster Presentation. All papers will be asked to produce a poster on-site. An e-copy will appear on Whova. To facilitate authors in getting their hard-copy posters on-site, the conference offers a local poster printing service for a fee, which you may access at thislink. Organizer will bring the posters on-site. 
 Reproducibility.Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available after the review process. We are encouraging the (optional) use of the "Artifacts Available" badge in ACM's Digital Library. If you release any code, dataset, or similar artifact to accompany your paper, and host it in a publicly available, archival repository for research artifacts that provides a Document Object Identifier (DOI), you are welcome to apply for this badge. A special subcommittee will check the artifacts of all accepted papers for availability and relatedness to the paper after the acceptance notification.

 Welcome 
 After the World Wide Web was conceived in 1989 byTim Berners-LeeatCERNin Geneva, Switzerland, theInternational World Wide Web Conference Committee(IW3C2) was founded byJoseph HardinandRobert Cailliauin August 1994 and formally incorporated in May 1996 as a non-profit Association under Swiss law. It is a professional organization which promotes Web research and development. 
 Mission 
 From its creation in 1994 to the beginning of 2022, theIW3C2, was the organization that managed theWWW Conference series. 
 In 2018 the conference series was renamedThe Web ConferencealiasTheWebConf.
