Dear MICCAI colleagues and friends, 
 The 28th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2025) will be held from Tuesday September 23rd to Saturday September 27th 2025 in Daejeon, Republic of Korea. This will be the first MICCAI conference hosted in Korea 
 The MICCAI 2025 organizing committee and the local team in South Korea have been working diligently at planning the conference for years. We are dedicated to making sure that MICCAI 2025 will be a great experience for everyone! 
 The annual MICCAI conference attracts the world’s leading biomedical scientists, engineers, and clinicians from a wide range of disciplines associated with medical imaging and computer assisted intervention. The conference series includes three days of scientific content, including oral presentations and poster sessions. Workshops, tutorials, and challenges are held on the days preceding and succeeding the conference. Delegates can enjoy many different session formats in these satellite events that offer a comprehensive forum to further explore topics relevant to MICCAI. Industrial sessions and exhibitions provide interesting opportunities of exchange between academia and industry. The Student Board and Women in MICCAI Board will complete the program with exciting social events. 
 In the months to follow, we will send out many emails announcing what is planned and providing more details. Watch out for those as we share even more exciting news about MICCAI 2025! 
 On behalf of the entire organizing committee, we look forward to meeting each one of you in person. See you all in Korea!
