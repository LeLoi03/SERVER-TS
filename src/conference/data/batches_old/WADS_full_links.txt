 The Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium, WADS, which alternates with the Scandinavian Symposium and Workshops on Algorithm Theory, SWAT, is intended as a forum for researchers in the area of design and analysis of algorithms and data structures. 
 We invite submissions of papers presenting original research on the theory and application of algorithms and data structures in all areas including, but not limited to: approximation algorithms, parametrized algorithms, distributed algorithms, parallel algorithms, external-memory algorithms, data structures, computational geometry and topology, exponential time algorithms, online algorithms, randomized algorithms, streaming algorithms, sub-linear algorithms. The algorithmic problems considered may be motivated by applications, e.g. in optimization, graph analysis, bioinformatics, visualization, string processing, information retrieval, machine learning, algorithmic game theory, or mechanism design.

Two special issues of papers selected from WADS are planned for the journals Algorithmica and Computational Geometry: Theory and Applications. 

WADS 2021 is planned for August 9-11, 2021. The symposium will most likely be fully online. It may have an in-person component, which will be held at Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. This depends on the covid-19 situation.

 Overview 
 Top Research Topics at Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures? 
 Combinatorics (55.41%) 
 Discrete mathematics (25.58%) 
 Algorithm (20.81%) 
 The conference mainly deals with areas of study such as Combinatorics, Discrete mathematics, Algorithm, Time complexity and Set (abstract data type). It investigates Combinatorics research which frequently intersects with Upper and lower bounds. The study on Discrete mathematics presented is investigated in conjunction with research in Bounded function. 
 Some problems in Algorithm that were presented in it overlapped with concepts under Mathematical optimization and Data structure. The research on Mathematical optimization discussed in Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures draws on the closely related field of Competitive analysis. The work on Competitive analysis addressed in the event expands to the thematically related Online algorithm. 
 Set (abstract data type) research discussed connects with the study of Plane (geometry). 
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference? 
 Secure Multi-party Computational Geometry (190 citations) 
 Visibility-Based Pursuit-Evasion in a Polygonal Environment (177 citations) 
 The buffer tree: A new technique for optimal I/O-algorithms (157 citations) 
 Research areas of the most cited articles at Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures: 
 The conference papers are organized to reinforce research efforts on Combinatorics, Algorithm, Discrete mathematics, Time complexity and Approximation algorithm. The conference papers address concerns in Combinatorics which are intertwined with other disciplines, such as Set (abstract data type) and Constant (mathematics). Upper and lower bounds and Data structure are some topics wherein Algorithm research discussed in the conference articles has an impact. 
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for? 
 Operating system 
 Algorithm 
 Artificial intelligence 
 The previous edition focused in particular on these issues: 
 The conference focuses largely on the fields of Combinatorics, Discrete mathematics, Graph, Time complexity and Binary logarithm. Upper and lower bounds and Set (abstract data type) are some topics wherein Combinatorics research discussed in Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures have an impact. The event focuses on Discrete mathematics but the discussions also offer insight into other areas such as Scheduling (computing), Job shop scheduling and Approximation algorithm. 
 It explores the study of Time complexity to improve our understanding of the broader topic of Algorithm. While the event focused on Algorithm, it was also able to explore topics like Completion time, 3SUM, Data structure and Hamiltonian path. It explores topics in Binary logarithm which can be helpful for research in disciplines like Sink (computing), Sorting, Sorting algorithm, Path (graph theory) and Efficient algorithm. 
 The most cited articles from the last conference are: 
 The Complexity of Drawing Graphs on Few Lines and Few Planes (19 citations) 
 Conditional Lower Bounds for Space/Time Tradeoffs (15 citations) 
 Minimizing the Continuous Diameter When Augmenting a Tree with a Shortcut (15 citations) 
 Papers citation over time 
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue.

 Publication chance based on affiliation 
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference. 
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered.

Another21.74%included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included23.91%of all publications and17.39%were from other institutions. 
 Returning Authors Index 
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year. 
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index 
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at thelast edition of a conference, grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C). 
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups: 
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
 Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
 Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
 Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
 Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 
 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
