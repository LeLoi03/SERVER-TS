DAIS 2025 - 25th International Conference on Distributed Applications and Interoperable Systems 
 DAIS 2025 is one of the three conferences ofhref="." - DisCoTec 2025
. 
 Scope 
 The DAIS conference series addresses all practical and conceptual aspects of distributed applications, including their design, modeling, implementation and operation, the supporting middleware, appropriate software engineering methodologies and tools, as well as experimental studies and applications. Submissions will be judged on their originality, significance, clarity, relevance, and technical correctness. 
 The topics of interest to the conference include, but are not limited to: 
 Novel and innovative distributed applications and systems, particularly in the areas of 
 middleware, 
 cloud, edge and fog computing, 
 big data processing, 
 distributed embedded machine learning (TinyML), 
 streaming and complex event processing, 
 distributed social networking, 
 IoT and cyber-physical systems, 
 mobile computing, 
 advanced networking (SDN/NFV), 
 micro-services and service-oriented computing, 
 peer-to-peer systems, and 
 data center and internet-scale systems. 
 Novel architectures and mechanisms, particularly in the areas of 
 publish/subscribe systems, 
 epidemic protocols, 
 language-based approaches, 
 virtualization and resource allocation, 
 distributed storage, 
 trusted execution environments, 
 blockchains, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, and 
 distributed consensus mechanisms. 
 System issues and design goals, including 
 interoperability and adaptation, 
 self-* properties (e.g., self-organization, self-management,…), 
 security and practical applications of cryptography, 
 trust and privacy, 
 cooperation incentives and fairness, 
 fault-tolerance and dependability, 
 scalability and elasticity, and 
 tail-performance and energy-efficiency. 
 Submission and Publication 
 All papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Each paper will undergo a thorough peer review by the Program Committee. DAIS 2025 offers three submission tracks: 
 Full research papers in no more than 15 pages + 2 pages references. 
 Full practical experience reports, including experimental and evaluation studies, case studies, and practice reports in no more than 15 pages + 2 pages references. 
 Work-in-progress papers, describing ongoing work and interim results, in no more than 6 pages + 2 pages references. 
 Publication of proceedings is coordinated among the three DisCoTec conferences (see theConferencespage for details).
