 Overview 
 Abstract 
 A t-out-of-n threshold ring signature allows t signers to sign a message while anonymizing themselves within a set of n public keys. One of the key research directions is to build a practical threshold ring signature with a short signature size, which is logarithmic to the parameters (t, n).
