 Call for Focus Group Proposals 
 Do you have a pattern-related topic with the potential to spark a discussion? Focus Groups at EuroPLoP are an excellent opportunity to collaborate with other passionate pattern writers. They are 1 to 2 hour sessions, usually workshops, but you are welcome to experiment with different formats. Your submission should include a summary of the topic, outcomes you envision, a brief description of how you will organize the session, its time budget, and the required number of participants. 
 Focus Group Proposal submission deadline: May 16, 2025 
 Paper Submission Process 
 The submission runs through three quality gates before the final proceedings will be published. After the first draft is accepted, your paper will be assigned to a shepherd. This is an experienced pattern author, who will provide feedback and suggestions on how to improve your paper. Following several iterations of shepherding, your improved second draft will be reviewed again and accepted or rejected for the conference. On acceptance, your paper will be discussed in the writers’ workshop during the conference. Based on the feedback received during the workshops, you must submit a final revised version that will be published. The submission system is available underhref="https://www.europlop.net/submission/" - https://www.europlop.net/submission/
. 
 Paper Submission Format 
 The final submission for publication must be formatted using theSpringer template,but for the drafts and intermediate versions,you can use any format. However, we encourage you to use the Springer formatright from the beginning to avoid layout problems in the end. If you don’tintend to publish with Springer, you can choose whatever format you like. Werecommend 10 pages as a guideline and especially welcome shorter papers.Longer papers are also possible but bear in mind that the writers’ workshopmight decide to focus only on a part of your paper. Have a look at thehref="https://europlop.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pattern_introduction_pack.zip" - introductory information pack

 High-quality feedback 
 All submissions will benefit from an iterative shepherding processprior to the conference: an experienced pattern author will give youfeedback and suggestions on how to improve your paper. In Writers’Workshops – the core of the conference – peers and experts willdiscuss your paper. You will receive in-depth, constructive feedbackand insights to improve your paper further. If you wish, you maycomplement your paper with alternative media (e.g., short video clipslinked from the paper) to get feedback on that format as well. 
 Share and learn
