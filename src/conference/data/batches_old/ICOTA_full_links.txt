 Message from the Chairpersons 
 The Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) and the Intervention and Coiled Tubing Association (ICoTA) will hold the 2025 Well Intervention Conference and Exhibition from 25-26 March 2025 in The Woodlands, Texas, USA. 
 Well Intervention encompasses a very diverse range of technical disciplines, including wireline, braided-line, slickline, coiled tubing, capillary tubing, hydraulic and standard workover rigs and snubbing. These technical disciplines are used to recover or increase production and to abandon wells once their useful life cycle ends, as part of the energy generation cycle. Due to the relative low cost of the additional production, the potential upside of 10%+ production increase and low CO2 footprint by using existing infrastructure, intervention is becoming a more important tool for operators as they increase focus further on production optimization recovery in their existing assets. Service companies and operators collaborate on optimizing operations, finding solutions and improvements to technical and operational challenges, and new technologies developments for high profile wells, complex fields and alternate energy transition applications, such as geothermal energy. By attending and participating in this conference, you will gain knowledge on current and future industry trends and solutions which can be applied in your operating environment, while networking with like-minded professionals. 
 Interact and network with industry experts from North and South America, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia, who will present their technical papers and share their knowledge on the performance and effectiveness of well intervention solutions and advancements through presentations, training courses, and the exhibition of services and products. A wide range of technical disciplines, including technology and applications, offshore and onshore operations, extended reach, subsea, HSE, innovation, energy transition, and the use of data science to improve intervention performance will be covered. 
 As intervention operations can be complex, knowledge sharing within the community is essential. Our well intervention community is resourceful, rich in content and innovative ideas applied in different parts of the world. Consider sharing your knowledge and technical innovations by submitting an abstract to participate in the conference, by doing so, you will effectively serve as a technical expert and become part of a growing community of optimization-minded professionals focused on doing more with less. Selections will be based on the technical and operational content, as well as the relevance to the conference and the industry. Potential authors are strongly encouraged to submit a detailed abstract by 26 September 2025. 
 Lastly, come join us for the keynote luncheon speech given by the International Energy Association (IEA) Chief Economist, Tim Gould, on the Role of Well Interventions in the Energy Outlook; a definite must see. 
 We look forward to your participation in this popular event.
