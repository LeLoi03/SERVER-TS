 Theme: Decarbonizing the Construction Industry 
 Topics Framework 
 The technical areas summarize the paper topic areas of interest, which represents all the research themes that are relevant to ISARC/IAARC. This is an important mechanism for the technical committee to consolidate the knowledge accumulated from each year’s conference while allowing for the smooth incorporation of new research topics and trends in the community. 
 Please note that we require authors upon submission to roughly classify their paper by a multiple choice mode for each of the 3 axis of the topic framework. 
 The areas will be used to facilitate submission review management 
 The number of areas does not necessarily map one-on-one to the Area Chairs; depending on the submission number, some technical areas could have more than one Area Chair while other areas might have none 
 Based on the previous years’ ISARC, the technical areas are grouped into the following three Axes; upon submission of the full paper, authors need to select one and only one major Axis, and up to three areas (among all the Axes) 
 Axis 1: Automation tools and techniques– comprises but is not limited to the following topics: 
 Sensing systems & data infrastructures | computing, and visualization, middleware, platforms, and data management (including topics such as imaging systems, laser scanning, data security and privacy, legal aspects, etc.) 
 Information modeling techniques | data analysis, simulation, and digital twins (including AI and machine learning, computer vision, point cloud analysis, data science in general, etc.) 
 Human-machine interface, mixed realities | including topics such as ergonomics, usability, etc. 
 Automated/robotic devices | devices, equipment, and applications (including topics such as construction robotics, automated robotized construction machines, and tools, end-effectors, additive manufacturing/3D printing, exoskeletons, construction safety equipment, etc.) 
 Construction management techniques | organization, processes, productivity, safety, etc. 
 Services and business applications 
 Technology management, entrepreneurship, and innovation 
 Technologies and applications in developing countries 
 Other topics 
 Axis 2: Application domains in the construction value chain– comprises but is not limited to the following topics: 
 Developers and real estate | : the construction market 
 Architecture, planning, engineering 
 Construction execution management 
 Materials, components, off-site manufacturing | prefabrication, modular construction, etc. 
 Supply chain and logistics | including micro-/macro-/factory-/site-logistics 
 On-site construction, construction equipment 
 Building operation and maintenance | including topics such as energy efficiency and sustainability, smart buildings, healthy and assisted living, etc. 
 Renovation and circularity 
 Other topics 
 Axis 3: Sectors– comprises but is not limited to the following topics: 
 Building construction 
 Infrastructure and civil construction 
 Industrial construction 
 Mining, energy/oil/gas industry 
 Smart, sustainable, and resilient cities | including topics such as sustainable buildings and construction, circular economy, etc. 
 Space/maritime/etc. construction 
 Smart mobility and transportation 
 Other topics 
 The IAARC Topics Framework is an initial step towards an IAARC reference architecture framework in tune with other frameworks such as the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 and the IEC’s use cases classification methodology.

 © 1984-2024 The International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction (IAARC)Dr. Mohamed Al-Hussein is a professor, Research Chair in the Industrialization and Decarbonization of Construction, in the of Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Alberta. He held the NSERC Industrial Research Chair in the Industrialization of Building Construction and was the inaugural director of the Nasseri School of Building Science and Engineering. He is a highly sought researcher in the areas of modular and offsite construction, lean manufacturing, construction process optimization, and BIM. Dr. Al-Hussein’s research has been published in over 400 articles in leading journals and conference proceedings. 
 CLOSEFarzad is a Professor of Digital Engineering at the School of Computing, Engineering and Digital Technologies, Teesside University, UK. He is the leader of the Centre for Sustainable Engineering and Open Research and Output Quality Lead, SCEDT, Teesside University. He is Editor in Chief: Smart and Sustainable Built Environment (SCI/JCR IF=3.6, CiteScore Tracker: 9.1) and Associate Editor: AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION (SCI/JCR IF=10.3, Citescore: 16.7). Farzad has a robust research track record delivering more than 200 quality publications and more than 3800 citations. Farzad’s research covers various aspects of Construction 5.0, with a strong emphasis on adopting cutting-edge technologies to serve the NetZero and sustainability agenda, including XR for H&S training, AI and deep-learning for sustainable infrastructures and logistics, smart construction, circular construction, energy policies, data-driven digital twins, demand response optimisation, smart energies, DLT and blockchain technologies, and social innovation. Farzad has successfully led several high-profile research projects – from H2021, InnovateUK through to the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), European Regional Development Funds (ERDF), Construction Scotland Innovation Centre (CSIC), Scottish Funding Council (SFC), Data Lab, and Advanced Forming Research Centre (AFRC). Farzad secured research and innovation income of over £2.5m. This expertise and standing are also recognised through several high-profile bodies, including the International Council for Building (CIB) and buildingSMART International. He graduated with 10 PhD students in the topics across the fields above, and some of them are already senior academics at reputable institutions such as the University of Cambridge, the University of Edinburgh, and the University of Salford, and some hold leadership positions in the industry.
