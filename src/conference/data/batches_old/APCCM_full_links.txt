 Mission  
 The Asia-Pacific Conference on Conceptual Modelling provides an annual forum for disseminating the results of innovative research in information modelling and related areas. Topics of conference vary from conceptual modeling research and practice to all related areas that are mentioned in prime essay and scientific journals.  
 The amount, complexity and diversity of information held in computer systems are constantly on the increase, and so are the requirements and challenges to be met for useful access and manipulation of this information. Conceptual modelling is fundamental to the development of up-to-date information and knowledge-based systems. The conference series aims on bringing together experts from all areas of computer science and information systems with a common interest in the subject.  
 Upcoming Conference  
 The Tenth Asia-Pacific Conference on Conceptual Modelling (APCCM 2014) will take place in Auckland, New Zealand from January 20th to 23rd, 2014.  
 The 2014 conference will be held as part of the Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW 2014).

 Applying ontologies is the most promising approach to semantically enrich Web services. To facilitate this, two efforts contributed the most in enabling the creation of ontologies: OWL-S from the US and WSMO in Europe. These two compete and promote their ontologies from the design perspective, reflecting their inventors’ bias but not offering much help to Web service developers using them. To bypass existing biases and enable evaluation of ontologies expressed in these two languages, this paper provides a study of the two important facilitators, OWL-S and WSMO, surveying their usage in several SWS Projects and identifying their respective and outstanding gaps. The paper then proposes a set of evaluation criteria for usage measurement on the two prominent SWS ontologies.
