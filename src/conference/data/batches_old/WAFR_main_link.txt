 WAFR 2024 - 30 years of WAFR 
 Algorithms are a fundamental component of robotic systems: they control or reason about motion and perception in the physical world. They receive input from noisy sensors, consider geometric and physical constraints, and operate on the world through imprecise actuators. The design and analysis of robot algorithms therefore raises a unique combination of questions in control theory, computational and differential geometry, and computer science. 
 The Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR) is a multi-disciplinary single-track workshop with submitted and invited papers on advances on algorithmic problems in robotics. WAFR was created in 1994 as a small-size workshop. It has been held every other year since 1994 and while it spans a relatively small community, it has an established reputation as one, if not the most, important venue for presenting algorithmic work related to robotics. The workshop proceedings will be published in theSpringer Proceedings in Advanced Robotics (SPAR)series. 
 The topics of interest are very broad since the focus of WAFR is on algorithm development and analysis rather than specific problems or applications. Increasingly, robotics algorithms are finding use in areas far beyond the traditional scope of robots. Therefore, while we encourage submissions on fundamental topics such as complexity completeness, and computational geometry, we also welcome papers in applications such as computational biology, virtual environments sensor networks, manufacturing, and medical robotics. Papers on algorithmic developments in traditional areas of robotics, such as motion planning, manipulation, sensing, and mobile robotics, as well as papers in newer areas such as distributed robotics and simultaneous localization and mapping, are also encouraged.

 WAFR 1994, Stanford, CA, USA | Call For Papers 
 The Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR) is a biannual multi-disciplinary single-track meeting of international researchers presenting the latest advances on algorithmic problems in robotics.. Since its inception in 1994, WAFR has established a reputation as a, if not the, premier venue for presenting algorithmic work related to robotics. In 2024 we celebrate 30 years of WAFR and we are planning some special events related to this milestone. 
 The focus of WAFR is on the design and analysis of robot algorithms from both theoretical and practical angles. These algorithms process inputs from noisy sensors, build geometric and physical models of the world, plan high-and low-level actions at different time horizons, and execute these actions on actuators with limited precision. The design and analysis of robot algorithms raise a unique combination of questions from many fields, including but not limited to: 
 Algorithmic approaches to human-robot interaction, 
 Computational geometry and topology, 
 Control theory and optimization, 
 Distributed and parallel methods, 
 Decision theory and game theory, 
 Geometrical and physical modeling, 
 Machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, representation learning, imitation learning 
 Planning and reasoning under uncertainty, 
 Probabilistic and sampling-based algorithms, 
 Sensing and perception, 
 Task and motion planning, and 
 Theoretical computer science. 
 In addition to these topics, we also encourage papers on applications of robot algorithms to important or new domains, including those beyond the traditional scope of robotics, such as: 
 Assistive and service robotics, 
 Brain-controlled robots, 
 Computational biology, 
 Computer animation, graphics and animation, VR/AR, 
 Legged locomotion, 
 Manufacturing and automation, 
 Multi-agent systems, 
 Sensor networks and IoT devices, 
 Surgical robots, intelligent prosthetics, rehabilitation robots, 
 Transportation networks and systems. 
 The workshop proceedings will be published in theSpringer Proceedings in Advanced Robotics (SPAR)series and selected papers will be invited for publication in special issues of relevant journals.

 Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools for Authors 
 Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of a paper submitted to WAFR. The use of content generated by AI in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The AI system used must be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content should be specified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the manner in which the AI system was used to generate the content. The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. Even so, in this case, disclosure is still recommended as the lines between these uses can be difficult to distinguish. 
 Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools for Reviewers 
 Information or content contained in or about a manuscript under review shall not be processed through an AI system. Doing so is considered a breach of confidentiality and as such is not permitted.
