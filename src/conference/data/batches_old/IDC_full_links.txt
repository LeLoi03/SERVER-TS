 Committee 
 Welcome to IDC2025 in Iceland! 
 We are pleased to announce the 24th annual ACM Interaction Design and Children (IDC) Conference, scheduled to occur from June 23-26, 2025 at Reykjavík University in Iceland. IDC is the premier international conference for researchers, educators and practitioners to share the latest research findings, innovative methodologies and new technologies in the areas of inclusive child-centered design, learning and interaction. 
 The theme for IDC 2025 is hope– IDC2025 aims to join together different generations to dream about and act upon a better future for us all. Even if the world around us can be worrisome, and children can feel sad and helpless due to on-going discussions on wars, health problems, and political struggles, adults should try to find ways for supporting children to remain brave, hopeful, and kind towards all, also towards those who are different from us. IDC2025 envisions a life full of bravery, kindness, and hope.

 Call for Bids for IDC 2026 
 We invite researchers working in the field of Interaction Design and Children (IDC) to submit outline bids for hosting and chairing the ACM SIGCHI IDC Conference in 2026. If you are interested, please send your bid by mail to the IDC Steering Committee Chairs Jerry Fails (jerryfails@boisestate.edu) and Monica Landoni (monica.landoni@usi.ch). 
 IDC 2024 will be in Delft, Netherlands (Europe) and we invite calls for IDC 2026from any region and are open to working with those interested to create a bid. 
 We ask those interested in hosting to reach out byOctober 31, 2024, feel free to reach out (to Jerry or Monica) and ask questions or recommendations prior to submitting your bid. 
 Please address the following points in your bid (do not exceed three pages): 
 Clearly identify how you and members of your team (including some members of your program committee) have been involved in past IDC events. We encourage teams with a good mix of new people but also with some members who have been involved in IDC before. We generally have co-chairs on program committees and one will continue to serve the following year (to promote consistency). We expect that organizing committees will include people from different parts of the world with varied experiences and backgrounds. 
 Briefly explain the relevant experience the host institution has in supporting and organizing workshops and conferences. 
 Specify the location where the conference will be held (describe the rooms and facilities) and describe how accessible the venue is including rail and airline links and proximity of hub airports.Also, indicate the accessibility of the venues for conference participants with varied abilities. 
 Highlight the benefits of hosting IDC at your proposed venue and location for the IDC community as a whole. Explain how your bid will help IDC reach out to new attendees, maybe industrial, maybe from another academic discipline and explain the unique aspects of the bid that will facilitate this outreach. 
 Identify potential sponsors, co-organizers and industry partners. 
 As IDC is a SIGCHI sponsored conference, please familiarize yourself with the SIGCHI Help Pages on organizing a conference. The information can be found here:https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-organizers/. The IDC conference has a handbook that will be helpful as you organize the conference. 
 The bid will be reviewed by the IDC conference steering group, which includes past general chairs of IDC. Bids that are successful at the initial stage will require further development where we will seek to have more details of the proposed program committee and an outline of the budget. This is NOT expected at the initial stage. 
 The IDC2026 host will be expected to be present and announce the conference during the IDC 2025 conference.
