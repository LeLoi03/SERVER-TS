 10thInternational Conference on Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction 
 14-20 July, Birmingham, UK.The 10thFSCD (International Conference on Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction) will be held in Birmingham, UK, Tuesday 15 - Friday 18 July, 2025, with workshops on Monday 14 and Saturday 19 - Sunday 20, in co-operation withACM SIGLOG. 
 href="http://fscd-conference.org/" - FSCD
covers all aspects of formal structures for computation and deduction, from theoretical foundations to applications. Building on two communities, RTA (Rewriting Techniques and Applications) and TLCA (Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications), FSCD embraces their core topics and broadens their scope to closely related areas in logic, models of computation, semantics and verification in new challenging areas.

 Overview 
 href="http://fscd-conference.org/" - FSCD
covers all aspects of formal structures for computation and deduction, from theoretical foundations to applications. Building on two communities, RTA (Rewriting Techniques and Applications) and TLCA (Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications), FSCD embraces their core topics and broadens their scope to closely related areas in logic, models of computation, semantics and verification in new challenging areas. 
 The suggested, but not exclusive, list of topics for submission is: 
 Calculi: | Rewriting systems (string, term, higher-order, nominal, graph, conditional, modulo, infinitary, etc.); 
 Lambda calculus; 
 Logics (first-order, higher-order, equational, modal, linear, classical, constructive, etc.); 
 Proof theory (natural deduction, sequent calculus, proof nets, etc.); 
 Type theory and logical frameworks; 
 Homotopy type theory; 
 Process algebras (synchronous, asynchronous, static and dynamic semantics with and without time, etc.); 
 Quantum calculi. 
 Methods in Computation and Deduction: | Type systems (polymorphism, dependent, recursive, intersection, session, etc.); 
 Induction, coinduction; 
 Matching, unification, completion, orderings; 
 Strategies (normalisation, completeness, etc.); 
 Tree automata; 
 Model building and model checking; 
 Proof search and theorem proving; 
 Constraint solving and decision procedures. 
 Semantics: | Operational semantics and abstract machines; 
 Game Semantics and applications; 
 Domain theory and categorical models; 
 Quantitative models (timing, probabilities, etc.); 
 Quantum computation and emerging models of computation. 
 Algorithmic Analysis and Transformations of Formal Systems: | Type inference and type checking; 
 Abstract Interpretation; 
 Complexity analysis and implicit computational complexity; 
 Checking termination, confluence, derivational complexity and related properties; 
 Symbolic computation. 
 Tools and Applications: | Programming and proof environments; 
 Verification tools; 
 Proof assistants and interactive theorem provers; 
 Applications in industry; 
 Applications of formal systems in other sciences; 
 Applications of formal systems in education. 
 Formal Systems for Modelling and Verification in new challenging areas: | Certification; 
 Security; 
 Blockchain; 
 Databases; 
 Deep learning and machine learning algorithms; 
 Planning. 
 Publication 
 The proceedings will be published as an electronic volume in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) of Schloss Dagstuhl. All LIPIcs proceedings are open access. 
 Special Issue 
 There will be a special issue of Logical Methods in Computer Science of selected papers. More details will be provided later. 
 Submission guidelines 
 The submission site is: 
 href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fscd2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fscd2025
Submissions must be formatted using thehref="https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author" - LIPIcs style files
and submitted via EasyChair. 
 Submissions can be made in two categories. Regular research papers are limited to 15 pages, excluding references and appendices. They must present original research which is unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. System descriptions are limited to 15 pages, excluding references. Shorter papers are welcome and will be given equal consideration. A system description must present new software tools, or significantly new versions of such tools, in which FSCD topics play an important role. An archive of the code with instructions on how to install and run the tool must be submitted. In addition, a webpage where the system can be experimented with should be provided. 
 One author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the work in person at the conference. In case that this is not possible for some unforeseen reason, online presentation will be arranged, but in person registration will still be required. 
 Best paper award by junior researchers 
 The programme committee will select a paper in which at least one author is a junior researcher, i.e. either a student or whose PhD award date is less than three years from the first day of the meeting. When submitting the paper, other authors should declare to the PC Chair that at least 50% of contribution is made by the junior researcher(s).
