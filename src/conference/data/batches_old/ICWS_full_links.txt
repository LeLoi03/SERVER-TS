 Introduction of ICWS 
 Founded in 2003, the International Conference on Web Services (ICWS) has been a prime international forum for both researchers and industry practitioners to exchange the latest fundamental advances in the state-of-the-art and practice of Web-based services, identify emerging research topics, and define the future of Web-based services. All topics regarding Web-centric services, enabling technologies, and applications align with the theme of ICWS.

 ICWS 2025 is a member of the Services Conference Federation (SCF). SCF 2025 will have the following 10 collocated service-oriented sister conferences: 2025 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2025), 2025 International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD 2025), 2025 International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2025), 2025 International Conference on Big Data (BigData 2025), 2025 International Conference on AI & Multimodal Services (AIMS 2025), and 2025 International Conference on Metaverse (METAVERSE 2025), 2025 International Conference on Internet of Things (ICIOT 2025), 2025 International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC 2025), 2025 International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE 2025), and 2025 International Conference on Blockchain (ICBC 2025). 
 Started in 2003, the long-term goal of ICWS is to build up the most reputable conference for the international community on Internet and Web-based services. It is very clear that the ICWS belongs to everyone. As the founding member of the Services Conference Federation (SCF), thehref="https://dblp.org/db/conf/icws/icws2003.html" - first International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)
was held in June 2003 in Las Vegas, USA. Meanwhile, the First International Conference on Web Services - Europe 2003 (href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540201250" - ICWS-Europe 2003
) was held in Germany in October 2003. ICWS-Europe'03 is an extended event of the 2003 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2003) in Europe. In 2004, ICWS-Europe was changed to the European Conference on Web Services (href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783540232025" - ECOWS
), which was held in Erfurt, Germany. 
 To celebrate its 22-year-old birthday,SCF 2025 will be held on September 27 - 30, 2025, in Hong Kong, China.

Topics 
 From a technology foundation perspective, Services Computing has become the default discipline in the modern services industry. As a major implementation technology for the modernizing services industry, Web services are Internet-based programmable application components published using standard interface description languages and universally available via uniform communication protocols. The program of ICWS 2025 will continue to feature research papers with a wide range of topics, focusing on various aspects ofInternet and web-based services. Some of the topics include Web services discovery and composition, Web services specifications and enhancements, Web services QoS (e.g., security, performance, reliability, fault tolerance, etc.), Web services standards and formalizations, Web services modeling, Web services engineering, Web services testing, Web services-based applications and solutions, Web services realizations, semantics in Web services, Web services supporting Cloud Computing, Web services lifecycle management, and all aspects of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) infrastructure and middleware. 
 The technical program of ICWS 2025 will include a Research Track, an Application Track, and a Short Paper Track. The ICWS 2025 tracks seek original, UNPUBLISHED research papers reporting substantive new work in various aspects of web-based services.

The authors can extend a maximum of 2 pages for each paper but will have to pay extra fees for each extra page.Unformatted papers and papers beyond the maximum page limit may not be reviewed. 
 Electronic submission of manuscripts (in PDF or Word format) is required.Detailed instructionsfor electronic paper preparation and submission, panel proposals, tutorial proposals, workshop proposals, and review process can be found at the conference site. 
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference and present the paper. One Best Paper award and one Best Student Paper award will be granted at ICWS 2025.The first author of the best student paper must be a full-time student. 
 Manuscripts submitted to the Research Track focusing on applications or solutions may be recommended to the Application Track or other tracks for further consideration if the session slots are available.

 View PDFHTML (experimental)Abstract:In the domain of spatial crowdsourcing drone services, which includes tasks like delivery, surveillance, and data collection, secure communication is paramount. The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ensures this by providing a system for digital certificates that authenticate the identities of entities involved, securing data and command transmissions between drones and their operators. However, the centralized trust model of traditional PKI, dependent on Certificate Authorities (CAs), presents a vulnerability due to its single point of failure, risking security breaches. To counteract this, the paper presents D2XChain, a blockchain-based PKI framework designed for the Internet of Drone Things (IoDT). By decentralizing the CA infrastructure, D2XChain eliminates this single point of failure, thereby enhancing the security and reliability of drone communications. Fully compatible with the X.509 standard, it integrates seamlessly with existing PKI systems, supporting all key operations such as certificate registration, validation, verification, and revocation in a distributed manner. This innovative approach not only strengthens the defense of drone services against various security threats but also showcases its practical application through deployment on a private Ethereum testbed, representing a significant advancement in addressing the unique security challenges of drone-based services and ensuring their trustworthy operation in critical tasks.
