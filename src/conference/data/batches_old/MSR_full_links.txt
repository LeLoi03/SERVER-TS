 Mining Software Repositories 2025 
 Welcome to the website of the Mining Software Repositories 2025 conference! 
 TheMining Software Repositories(MSR) conference is the premier venue for software analytics research, according to which software engineering data is analyzed using a mixture of data science, machine learning/artificial intelligence and qualitative methodologies. The goal of the conference is to improve software engineering practices by uncovering interesting and actionable information about software systems and projects using the vast amounts of software data such as source control systems, defect tracking systems, code review repositories, archived communications between project personnel, question-and-answer sites, CI build servers, and run-time telemetry. Mining this information can help to understand software development and evolution, software users, and runtime behavior; support the maintenance of software systems; improve software design/reuse; empirically validate novel ideas and techniques; support predictions about software development; and exploit this knowledge in planning future development. 
 Six years after the successful Montreal edition, Canada is delighted to host the conference again, this time in its capital, Ottawa (Ontario). MSR 2025 continues the tradition of bringing together leading researchers and practitioners of the field, together with students and other participants eager to learn the latest and greatest MSR developments, in order to discuss the latest advancements, innovations, and insights in mining software repositories. With the abundant data available in modern software development, the conference will serve as an essential platform for the exchange of knowledge and the fostering of collaborations aimed at leveraging data science to address pressing challenges in software engineering. 
 We welcome you toOttawa (Ontario, Canada) on the 28th and 29th of April, 2025, and are looking forward to discuss the next advances in the field of mining software repositories!
