 Aims & Scope 
 We invite submissions to the 28thInternational Conference on Discovery Science, welcoming paper submissions from all areas relevant to artificial intelligence and data science. 
 The Discovery Science 2025 conference provides an open forum for intensive discussions and exchange of new ideas among researchers working in different areas of Artificial Intelligence and the data sciences, focusing on discovering and advancing scientific knowledge. Its scope includes the development and analysis of methods for discovering scientific knowledge, coming from machine learning, data mining, intelligent data analysis, and big data analytics, as well as their application in various domains of physical, life, environmental, natural and social sciences. 
 This year’s edition of Discovery Science welcomes works that focuses on the following topics, that will be the subject of special sessions within the conference: 
 Explainable AI 4 Science 
 Symbolic regression 4 Science 
 Semantic technologies 4 Science 
 Foundation models 4 Science 
 Physics informed NNs 4 Science 
 In addition to the main sessions, the conference will also include parallel one-day events, dedicated to the following topics: 
 AI & Environmental sciences 
 AI & HPC 
 AI & Biomedicine

 Important Dates 
 Submission starts: | April 1, 2025 
 Abstract submission deadline: | May 17, 2025 
 Full paper submission deadline: | May 24, 2025 
 Deadline for review submission: | June 24, 2025 
 Notification of acceptance: | July 7, 2025 
 Camera-ready version, author registration: | July 18, 2025 
 All dates are specified as 23:59:59 SST (Standard Samoa Time / Anywhere on Earth) 
 Submission Procedure 
 Contributions, written in English, must be formatted according to the guidelines of the Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer-Verlag, which are available together with templateshere. 
 Submission System:href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DS2025/" - https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DS2025/
. 
 The Microsoft CMT service was used for managing the peer-reviewing process for this conference. This service was provided for free by Microsoft and they bore all expenses, including costs for Azure cloud services as well as for software development and support. 
 Main conference 
 We invite original contributions that have not been previously published to another venue. The page limit for the contributions submitted to the main conference, including special sessions, is 15 pages in the LNCS format (note that 15 pages in LNCS format is roughly equivalent to 8 pages in NeurIPS format). This includes figures, title pages, references, and appendices. 
 Submission of the camera-ready version of the paper has to include the authors’ consent to publish on the above Springer LNCS website. Submissions will be reviewed following a single-blind procedure. Therefore, authors should include their names and affiliations in the paper. Authors may not submit any paper which is under review elsewhere or which has been accepted for publication in a journal or another conference; neither will they submit their papers elsewhere during the review period of DS 2025. 
 Accepted papers will be published in theDiscovery Science Springer LNCS series. 
 One-day event (Workshops) 
 We invite original technical/position papers or contributions discussing published works. We particularly welcome contributions presenting initial or late-breaking results as well as ongoing work, including works currently under review at other venues. 
 For the parallel one-day events, the page limit for contributions is 2 pages in LNCS format, including figures, title pages, references, and appendices. Submissions to the parallel one-day events are non-archival, and therefore will not be included in the conference proceedings.
