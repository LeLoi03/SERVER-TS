 Shanghai,China 
 Many organizations and individuals have relied on electronic collaboration between distributed teams of humans, computer applications, and/or autonomous robots to achieve higher productivity and produce joint products that would have been impossible to develop without the contributions of multiple collaborators. Technology has evolved from standalone tools, to open systems supporting collaboration in multi-organizational settings, and from general-purpose tools to specialized collaboration grids. Future collaboration solutions that fully realize the promises of electronic collaboration require advancements in networking, technology and systems, user interfaces and interaction paradigms, and interoperation with application-specific components and tools. 
 The 21st EAI International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (EAI CollaborateCom 2025) will be held in Shanghai, China, and will continue to serve as a premier international forum for discussion among academic and industrial researchers, practitioners, and students interested in collaborative networking, technology and systems, and applications.

 EAI Pervasive Health 2025 will take placeFrom 15-17 October 2025 in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. 
 “PervasiveHealth 2025 will be held in October 2025, in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, hosted by the Department of Industrial Design, Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). 
 PervasiveHealth is a premier international forum with a specific focus on technologies and human factors related to the use of ubiquitous computing in healthcare and for well-being. PervasiveHealth 2025 will focus on the use of data, AI, and connectivity as creative material for empowering patients, caregivers, and people in general, by integrating technology, materiality, and aesthetic qualities, with particular interest in the impact of technical connectivity on social connectedness and on the behavior changes and societal transformations in healthcare, especially in informal care. 
 TU/e is the center of one of the most powerful technology hubs in the world: Brainport Eindhoven. Globally, TU/e stands out when it comes to collaborating with advanced industries, including companies such as ASML and Philips. Together with other institutions, It forms a thriving ecosystem with one common aim – to improve quality of life through sustainable innovations. 
 The conference will be located at Evoluon – a landmark, a museum, and a conference center. The conference will be followed by the Dutch Design Week, an event about Dutch and international design, with exhibitions, studio visits, workshops, and seminars across the city.”

 EAI CollaborateCom 2025 
 15 – 16 November, 2025 
 Shanghai,China 
 Many organizations and individuals have relied on electronic collaboration between distributed teams of humans, computer applications, and/or autonomous robots to achieve higher productivity and produce joint products that would have been impossible to develop without the contributions of multiple collaborators. Technology has evolved from standalone tools, to open systems supporting collaboration in multi-organizational settings, and from general-purpose tools to specialized collaboration grids. Future collaboration solutions that fully realize the promises of electronic collaboration require advancements in networking, technology and systems, user interfaces and interaction paradigms, and interoperation with application-specific components and tools. 
 The 21st EAI International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (EAI CollaborateCom 2025) will be held in Shanghai, China, and will continue to serve as a premier international forum for discussion among academic and industrial researchers, practitioners, and students interested in collaborative networking, technology and systems, and applications.
