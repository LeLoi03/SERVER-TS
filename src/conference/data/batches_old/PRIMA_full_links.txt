 Call For Papers 
 We invite you to submit your best work in the area of agents and multi-agent systems to PRIMA-2024, the 25th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Multi-Agent Systems, to be held in Kyoto in November 2024. 

Papers will be submitted to the conference CMT on the track of “Main track Submission" : https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PRIMA2024/ 

Scope and Background 

Software systems are rapidly becoming more intelligent in the functionality they offer to users. They are also becoming more decentralized, with components that act autonomously and must communicate among themselves or with human users, to achieve their goals. Examples of such systems include those in healthcare, disaster management, e-business, and smart grids. A multi-agent perspective is crucial to the proper conceptualization, deployment, and governance of such systems. Rooted in solid computational and software engineering foundations, this perspective offers abstractions such as intelligent agents, protocols, norms, organizations, trust and incentives, among others. As a large, but still growing research field of Computer Science, multi-agent systems today remain a unique enabler of interdisciplinary research.

Information for Authors 

PRIMA 2024 invites submissions of original, unpublished work strongly relevant to multi-agent systems. Apart from theoretical work, we encourage the submission of reports on the development of applications or prototypes of deployed agent systems, and of experiments that demonstrate novel agent system capabilities. In addition to this, we also encourage the submission of position and review papers that are of particular relevance to the multi-agent community. 

The papers submitted can be up to 16 pages in length, including references, in the Springer LNCS format. All submitted papers must be in a form suitable for double-blind review. Specifically, in order to make blind reviewing possible, authors must omit their names and affiliations from the paper. Also, while the references should include all published literature relevant to the paper, including previous work of the authors, it should not include unpublished works. When referring to one's own work, use the third person rather than the first person. For example, say "Previously, Foo and Bar [2] have shown that…", rather than "In our previous work [2], we have shown that…". Such identifying information can be added back to the final camera-ready version of accepted papers. 

All papers will be reviewed by at least 2-3 experts in the area following a detailed review form that will assess the paper based on the significance and novelty of the idea, the technical description of the proposal, clarity and organization, the evaluation methodology, and any ethical considerations. 

All accepted papers for the main track will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series (LNCS/LNAI).

Scope and Background 

Software systems are rapidly becoming more intelligent in the functionality they offer to users. They are also becoming more decentralized, with components that act autonomously and must communicate among themselves or with human users to achieve their goals. Examples of such systems include those in healthcare, disaster management, e-business, and smart grids. A multi-agent perspective is crucial to the proper conceptualization, deployment, and governance of these systems. Rooted in solid computational and software engineering foundations, this perspective offers abstractions such as intelligent agents, protocols, norms, organizations, trust and incentives, among others. As a large, but still growing research field of artificial intelligence, multi-agent systems today remain a unique enabler of interdisciplinary research.

Information for Authors 

PRIMA 2025 invites submissions of original, unpublished work strongly relevant to multi-agent systems. Apart from theoretical work, we encourage the submission of reports on the development of applications or prototypes of deployed agent systems, and of experiments that demonstrate novel agent system capabilities. In addition to this, we also encourage the submission of position papers that are of relevance to the multi-agent community. 

All submitted papers must be in a form suitable for double-blind review. Specifically, in order to make blind reviewing possible, authors must omit their names and affiliations from the paper. Also, while the references should include all published literature relevant to the paper, including previous work of the authors, it should not include unpublished works. When referring to one's own work, use the third person rather than the first person. For example, say "Previously, Foo and Bar [2] have shown that…", rather than "In our previous work [2], we have shown that…". Such identifying information can be added back to the final camera-ready version of accepted papers. 

All papers will be reviewed by at least 2-3 experts in the area following a detailed review form that will assess the paper based on the significance and novelty of the idea, the technical description of the proposal, clarity and organization, the evaluation methodology, and any ethical considerations. 

All accepted papers will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series (LNCS/LNAI). 

All papers must be submitted using the Springer LNCS/LNAI format. 

Type of submissions: 
  
 Full papers, 16 pages plus references 
  
 Short papers, 4 pages plus references 
  
 Position papers, 2 pages plus references

 The 24th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Multi-Agent Systems 
 Hybrid, Valencia, Spain 
 16-18 November 2022 
 *** DEADLINE EXTENDED, JOURNAL INFORMATION UPDATED, CALL FOR TUTORIALS *** 
 Agent-based Computing addresses the challenges in managing distributed computing systems and networks through monitoring, communication, consensus-based decision-making and coordinated actuation. As a result, intelligent agents and multi-agent systems have demonstrated the capability to use intelligence, knowledge representation and reasoning, and other social metaphors like ‘trust’, ‘game’ and ‘institution’, not only to address real-world problems in a human-like way but also to transcend human performance. This has had a transformative impact in many application domains, particularly in e-commerce, and also in planning, logistics, manufacturing, robotics, decision support, transportation, entertainment, emergency relief & disaster management, and data mining & analytics. 
 The 24th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Multi-Agent Systems (PRIMA 2022) invites submissions of original, unpublished, theoretical and applied work on any such topic, and encourages reports on the development of prototype and deployed agent systems, and of experiments that demonstrate novel agent system capabilities. 
 PRIMA 2020 will include invited talks and presentations for refereed submissions, as well as workshops.
