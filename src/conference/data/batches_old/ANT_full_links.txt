 to ANT 2025 
 The 16th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies (ANT 2025) is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies related areas. ANT 2025 will be held in conjunction withthe 8th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40). 
 Ambient systems can be viewed as interconnected systems that exist anywhere and everywhere in the environment. These systems are able to work together in the network collaboratively or competitively to provide human users with their daily technological needs, during which these systems remain invisible. This concept has emerged as a major research area with many potential applications. This is because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the themes required such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, networks and communications, data science, Internet of Things, Smart Entities, etc. 
 ANT will be held in Patra Greece. Patra is Greece's third largest, and the regional capital and largest city of western Greece, in the northern Peloponnese, 215 km west of Athens. As of the 2021 census, the municipality of Patras has a population of 215,922, while the urban population is 173.600. Patras and its region are home to various Ancient Greek, Roman and Byzantine Monuments including the Roman Odeon, the Fortress of Rio, and the Castle of Patras. Patras is a relatively newly built city, as its medieval buildings were destroyed in the Greek War of Independence. The Patras Carnival is the largest event of its kind in Greece and one of the biggest in Europe, with a heritage reaching back 160 years. 
 Patras is an important educational center in Greece, home to several institutions of higher education, including the prestigious University of Patras, which is the third largest university in Greece with the respect to the size of the student body, the staff, and the number of departments. and most respected universities. The university of Patras is considered one of the top-ranked universities in Greece and has been placed in the top 200 universities in subject areas. In 2019, the student population was more than 33,000 (29,901 at the undergraduate level and 3,931 at the postgraduate level). 
 All ANT 2025 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series on-line. Procedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), and will be freely available worldwide. All papers in Procedia will be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and by Thomson Reuters' Conference Proceeding Citation Index (https://thomsonreuters.com/conference-proceedings-citation-index/). All papers in Procedia will also be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and Engineering Village (Ei) (www.engineeringvillage.com). This includes EI Compendex (www.ei.org/compendex). Moreover, all accepted papers will be indexed in DBLP (https://dblp.uni-trier.de/). The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers. You will be able to provide a hyperlink to all delegates and direct your conference website visitors to your proceedings.

 to ANT 2024 
 The 15th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies (ANT 2024) is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all Ambient Systems, Networks and Technologies related areas. ANT 2024 will be held in conjunction withthe 7th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40). 
 Ambient systems can be viewed as interconnected systems that exist anywhere and everywhere in the environment. These systems are able to work together in the network collaboratively or competitively to provide human users with their daily technological needs, during which these systems remain invisible. This concept has emerged as a major research area with many potential applications. This is because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the themes required such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, networks and communications, data science, Internet of Things, Smart Entities, etc. 
 ANT 2024 will be held in the city of Hasselt. Hasselt was founded in approximately the 7th century on the Helbeek, a small tributary of theDemerriver. The name Hasselt came fromHasaluth, which means hazel wood. During the Middle Ages, it became one of the bigger towns of thecounty of Loon, which had borders approximately the same as the current province of Limburg. Hasselt is an old yet modern city which is home to multiple academic institutions and where visitors can enjoy a variety of activities and entertainment. 
 ANT 2024 is co-organized & co-hosted by theHasselt University, Belgium. Since 1973 Hasselt University is located on the Campus Diepenbeek, which occupies an attractive 150 acre site in the middle of Limburg's green belt. It is 2 kms west of the town centre of Diepenbeek, a residential town of 17.717 inhabitants, and 4 kms east of Hasselt which has a population of about 69.529 and is the administrative and commercial centre of the province. Brussels is 90 kms away (to the South-West), Antwerp lies 90 kms to the West, Liege (in the French-speaking part of Belgium) 45 kms to the South, Maastricht (in the Netherlands) 25 kms to the East, Aachen (in Germany) 60 kms to the South-East. 
 All ANT 2024 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series on-line. Procedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), and will be freely available worldwide. All papers in Procedia will be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and by Thomson Reuters' Conference Proceeding Citation Index (http://thomsonreuters.com/conference-proceedings-citation-index/). All papers in Procedia will also be indexed by Scopus (www.scopus.com) and Engineering Village (Ei) (www.engineeringvillage.com). This includes EI Compendex (www.ei.org/compendex). Moreover, all accepted papers will be indexed in DBLP (http://dblp.uni-trier.de/). The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers. You will be able to provide a hyperlink to all delegates and direct your conference website visitors to your proceedings. 
 (optional) Social Event @ ANT 2024 
 Visit to the C-mine expedition :(located in the nearby city of Genk) 
 C-mine expedition starts in the energy building of the C-mine site. First you descend to 6 meter deep where you get to see a lot of surprising installations. Famous artists such as Stijn Meuris and Pascale Platel made unique stories about the mine in combination with creative image projections. In the interactive sound cell you are going to get busy. Produce your own 'sound ' by levers, buttons and wheels to operate. Or sample the atmosphere while you're wondering around in the maze on the way to the topsoil.The highlight of the expedition is to climb the giant and authentic mine tower on the square. That is more than 60 meters high! Perhaps you reach the top exhausted, but the reward is greater: gorgeous views of the green surroundings of Limburg. For the slightly less ' big ' daredevil, there is a stop at 15 metres height. If you don't like heights, stay comfortable with both feet firmly on the ground. Just enjoy the open feeling on the beautifully renovated square.

ANT 2025 will be held in Thessaloniki, Greece. Thessaloniki is the second-largest city in Greece, with slightly over one million inhabitants in its metropolitan area. Thessaloniki is located on the Thermaic golf, at the northwest corner of the Aegean sea. The municipality of Thessaloniki is the second most populous in Greece, after Athens, with a resident population of 317,778 and an area of 19.307 square kilometers. Because of the city’s reach and diverse history, Thessaloniki houses many museums dealing with many different eras in history.

Thessaloniki is a major centre of education of Greece. Three of the country’s largest universities are located in central Thessaloniki. Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, the University of Macedonia, and the international Hellenic University. Aristotle was founded in 1926 and is currently the largest university in Greece by number of students, which number at more than 80,000 in 2010, and is part of the Utrecht Network. 

ANT 2025 will be held in conjunction with the 8th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40).
