 IJCNN is the premier international conference in the area of neural networks theory, analysis and applications. Since its inception, IJCNN has been playing a leading role in promoting and facilitating interaction among researchers and practitioners, and dissemination of knowledge in neural networks and related facets of machine learning. And Rome with its history and geographical position will further contribute to grow and maintain the role of the IJCNN as a prominent platform for exchange of knowledge in neural networks and artificial intelligence. 
 The technical program, including tutorials, special sessions, workshops and plenary talks, covers almost all facets of neural networks and related learning systems including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, convolutional neural networks, spiking neural networks, cognitive algorithms, and deep learning along with a wide spectrum of applications. A special track is also included dedicated to the conference theme on “Human-AI interaction in creative arts and sciences”. 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit complete papers of no more than eight (8) pages in the IEEE two-column conference proceedings format, according to thehref="https://2025.ijcnn.org/authors/initial-author-instructions" - Paper Submission Guidelines
. All the accepted and presented papers will be published on IEEE Xplore Digital Library and indexed by Scopus. 
 Whether you are presenting your latest work, learning from experts, or networking with peers, IJCNN 2025 promises to be an unforgettable experience that will inspire and propel the AI and neural network community forward. We look forward to welcoming you in Rome!

Welcome to the INNS International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025! The IJCNN Organizing Committee is thrilled to invite you to this prestigious event in the heart of Rome from June 30 to July 5, 2025. This conference brings together the brightest minds in neural networks and artificial intelligence, offering a platform for sharing ideas and fostering collaborations. 
 IJCNN 2025 will be held in the year and the city of the Jubilee, making it an even more special occasion. Hosted at the Pontifical Gregorian University, just a coin's throw from the iconic Trevi Fountain, attendees will have the unique opportunity to experience Rome's rich history and culture. The Eternal City will serve as an open-air museum, providing an inspiring backdrop for our discussions and networking. 
 The IJCNN 2025 motto, "All Neural Network roads lead to Rome," highlights the growing significance of neural networks across various scientific domains and applications, all of which are welcome to IJCNN 2025. Neural networks are at the forefront of interdisciplinary research, connecting diverse fields and driving innovation. This theme underscores the central role that neural networks play in advancing science and technology. 
 With our discipline recognized as an enabling technology in areas as diverse as physics and molecular biology, our aim is that the IJCNN 2025 serves as a vehicle to both celebrate and enhance the increasingly evident synergy between humans and AI in numerous domains and manifold applications. This synergy not only enhances our daily lives but also pushes the boundaries of what is possible, fostering creativity and innovation across disciplines. We are excited to explore this theme through a Special Track in the scientific program. 
 We encourage you to participate in this memorable event, which promises a high-quality scientific program and a variety of social initiatives infused with the rich history of Rome. Join us in making IJCNN 2025 an unforgettable experience, filled with knowledge, inspiration, and new connections. 
 Warm regards, 
 Danilo Comminiello
