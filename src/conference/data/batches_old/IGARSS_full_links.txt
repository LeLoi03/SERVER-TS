 Welcome to Brisbane, 
 IGARSS 2025! 
 The International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS) is the flagship conference of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS). On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we are thrilled to invite you to attend the 45th IGARSS which is to be held in the sunshine city Brisbane Australia, on 3-8 August 2025. 
 The theme ofIGARSS 2025 is One Earth. IGARSS 2025 will address the threats to our Earth and promote collaborative global solutions using remote sensing technology. The event will provide an excellent experience for IGARSS attendees through strong technical and social programs, and opportunities for collaboration regionally and globally. 
 Australia is a safe multicultural country and August is a great time to visit Brisbane and the state of Queensland more broadly. The conference will be hosted at the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre (BCEC), which is a world-class conference venue.

(confirming an accepted paper) 
 Participation in IGARSS 2025 is open to all individuals interested in or working in the fields of geoscience and remote sensing. Technical sessions will be comprised of papers submitted to a common topic. There is a list of general topics categorized by technology, techniques, and applications. In addition to the general sessions, there are Community Contributed Session (CCS) topics. These CCSs were contributed by members of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society and were selected for inclusion in the technical programs for IGARSS 2025 based upon an open call in October 2024. They are meant to be complementary to the general topic sessions highlighting new and emerging topics. Both the general sessions and the CCSs are open for submission by all authors. 
 Manuscripts received by the deadline will be considered for program placement under the standard peer review process. The IEEE IGARSS 2025 Technical Program Committee will organize all accepted submissions into either oral or interactive poster sessions based upon their potential contribution to the symposium and the composition of high-quality sessions. 
 The entire submission process and requirements are detailed in thehref="papers/paper_kit.php" - Paper Kit
