 In Loving Memory of Dr. Sally A. McKee- Read MoreIn Loving Memory of Dr. Sally A. McKee 
 The Computing Frontiers community has been shocked by the sad news of the passing of Dr. Sally A. McKee. Sally has been a long time member of the CF family, being one of the original founders of the conference, part of the Steering Committee for a long time, and author of one of the most cited papers of the conference. Sally had an enduring impact on the research on memory systems, having coined the term “memory wall” (specifically mentioned in her most cited CF paper) to highlight the appearance of the memory bottleneck in computer architecture. Sally also had an enduring impact on our lives as researchers and as friends, having been a mentor for many of us. The CF community will always remember her fondly. 
 Keynotes Announcement 
 Ingrid Verbauwhede, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium 
 Bio 
 (click to expand)Dr. Ir. Ingrid Verbauwhede is a Professor in the research group COSIC at KU Leuven. She is a fellow of IEEE and of IACR. She is a member of the Royal Academy of Belgium. She received the IEEE 2017 Computer Society Technical Achievement Award. She delivered the 2022 IACR distinguished lecture. She received the 2023 IEEE Don Pederson award for “pioneering contributions to energy-efficient and high-performance secure integrated circuits and systems”, and the 2024 EDAA Achievement Award. She received two EU ERC Advanced Grants: one in 2016 and a second one in 2021. She is also co-founder of the Belfort company, which focuses on hardware acceleration of computing on encrypted data. 
 She is a pioneer in the field of efficient and secure implementations of cryptographic algorithms on many different platforms: ASIC, FPGA, embedded, and cloud. With her research, she bridges the gaps between electronics, the mathematics of cryptography, and the security of trusted computing. Her group owns and operates an advanced electronic security evaluation lab at the KU Leuven. Her list of publications is available fromhttps://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/people/ingrid-verbauwhede/orhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZyG1ZGgAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=aoTitle: Hardware Security: state of the art. 
 Abstract 
 (click to collapse)Hardware security is the root of trust in all modern ICT systems! Depending which community you address, it has a different meaning. It covers efficient, secure implementations of new generations of cryptography such as light-weight crypto, post-quantum crypto as well as advanced schemes such as zero-knowledge proofs, fully homomorphic encryption, and computing on encrypted data in general. On top, implementations also must resist a wide variety of side-channel, fault, and micro-architectural attacks. Post-quantum algorithms promise to resist the attacks developed for quantum computers. Yet, their implementations also must resist attacks on classic platforms. 
 Besides crypto, secure systems rely on many more security modules, requiring analog and digital circuit techniques to design quality true random number generators, physically unclonable functions, secure key storage, and many more. A recent report on “Revitalizing the U.S. Semiconductor Ecosystem” (from Executive Office of the President, President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, September 2022) describes a set of recommendations on semiconductors and system security. In this presentation, we will demonstrate how our research addresses these recommendations, and we will illustrate this with recent results. 
 href="" - Call For Papers
The 22nd ACM International Conference on Computing Frontiers (CF'25) will take place May 28th-30th, 2025, Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy.Participation is in-person only.Computing Frontiers (CF) is an eclectic, interdisciplinary, collaborative community of researchers investigating emerging technologies in the broad field of computing: our common goal is to drive the scientific breakthroughs that support society.

 href="" - Submission
We encourage the submission of bothfull papersandshort paperscontaining high-quality research describing original, unpublished work. Full papers are expected to provide well-rounded contributions, where novelty, originality, and sufficient preliminary evaluation are included. Short papers may be position papers or may describe preliminary or highly speculative work. 
 Papers must be submitted through:https://cf25.hotcrp.com/Full papers are a maximum of eight (8) pages (excluding references) and short papers are a maximum of four (4) (including references) pages. All papers should use the double-columnACM conference format. Page limits include figures, tables and appendices. Authors may buy up to two (2) extra pages for accepted full papers. 
 As the review process is double-blind, the removal of all identifying information from paper submissions is required (e.g., cite own (previous) work in the third person, avoid references to machines and/or systems that can identify the paper authors, etc.). Papers not conforming to the above submission policies on formatting, page limits, and the removal of identifying information, are likely to be automatically rejected. Authors are strongly advised to submit their papers with the final list of authors in the submission system, as changes may not be feasible at later stages (due to restrictions at the publisher). 
 Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research. If the submission extends from a prior short paper, there should be substantial new content and intellectual contribution, and this should be clearly mentioned. Concurrent submission of the same paper to any other conference or journal is not permitted. While authors may post a draft of their paper on arxiv or as a technical report on their institution's website, they should take care to use a sufficiently different title and name for their system to ensure the anonymity of the submission. 
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to allACM Publications Policies, including ACM's newhref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" - Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects
. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
 As perACM Publications Policies, any use of artificial intelligence (AI) generated content in a paper must be clearly disclosed in the acknowledgements section of the submission. The authors are reponsible for the correctness of any generated material. The authors also attest that the submitted paper accurately represents their own novel intellectual contributions, and is not primarily the result of the tool's generative capabilities. 
 Registration and No-show policy:At least onefull registrationis required from a submission author for each accepted paperandall accepted papers are expected to bepresented in personat the conference. If circumstances arise such that authors are unable to present their papers at the conference, they must contact the PC co-chairs with a proposal for a replacement presenter. A no-show will result in exclusion from the ACM digital library proceedings. 
 Camera-Ready Instructions 
 Filling the Copyright FormSoon after acceptance notification, authors will receive an email from ACM requesting to fill in a copyright form. After that, authors will obtain thecopyright statement(i.e., copyright strip/DOI/ISBN) to be inserted on thefirst pageof the paper. Make sure to use exactly the same information in the camera-ready PDF, including the same title of paper, author list (names/ affiliation/ e-mail address) as specified in the original paper version submitted for review. Please ensure that co-authors obtain an ORCID ID so that the copyright process can be completed smoothly. 
 Camera-Ready Preparation ChecklistPlease walk through the following checklist for preparing the camera-ready paper. This helps to have a smoother submission in TAPS by having less chance of running into validation errors: 
 The template to use for the camera-ready version of the paper is the double-column ACM conference format: | Proceedings Template | . If the LaTeX template is used, ensure that the first line of the source file is | \documentclass[sigconf]{acmart} | . 
 If the LaTeX template is used, please make sure to | ONLY | use | href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/accepted-latex-packages" - TAPS-accepted Latex Packages | . 
 Authors must apply ACM Computing Classification categories and terms. The templates provide space for this indexing and point authors to the Computing Classification Scheme at | HERE | . 
 Do not include page numbers. 
 The author list must include names, affiliations (institute, city, country), and email addresses for all authors. 
 Make sure that the paper title and author names / affiliations / emails match exactly the information provided in the ACM copyright form. 
 CCS (Computing Classification Scheme), keywords, and ACM reference format must be present. 
 The copyright block may not be omitted. 
 Make sure to include the copyright statement (i.e., copyright strip/DOI/ISBN) on the first page of the paper. 
 The PDF may only contain Type 1 fonts, not Type 3. 
 All fonts must be embedded within the PDF file. 
 Libertine must be used as the main font. 
 Check that running page headers show abbreviated title / authors. 
 Check that figure captions are below figures and table captions above tables. 
 Make sure to have a README file in the sources (packaged as ZIP), including directions on how to generate the PDF from sources. 
 Make sure that at least one author is registered for the conference, at latest, by camera-ready submission due. If the PDF uses extra pages (only full papers), this registration must include payment for the extra pages. 
 Camera-Ready Submission via TAPSWe are using the ACM Production System (or TAPS) for the camera-ready submissions. This system assists authors in preparing and submitting the camera-ready version of the paper. Within a few hours after completing the copyright form (as instructed earlier), authors will receive an email from ACM TAPS, including links for submitting the camera-ready version of the paper. 
 That link redirects the authors to the ACM Author Dashboard, where detailed instructions on how to structure the article source material (e.g., in a ZIP file with a certain structure and name). ACM Author Dashboard also includes an upload field for submission of the sources and the paper. TAPS also runs a few checks after uploading the sources to assess their validity. Also, TAPS provides a contact support field in the Author Dashboard to facilitate discussions (e.g, in case TAPS reports validation errors for the submitted sources). 
 The TAPS workflow for camera-ready submission can be summed up in a few steps: 
 Prepare source material according to the above checklist - the Word or LaTeX source document(s), and any supplementary material authors wish to have distributed alongside the article in the Digital Library. 
 Organize the article source material into a ZIP file according to the instructions in ACM Author Dashboard. The zip file for upload must be named as follows: proceedings_acronym-paper_id.zip (e.g., cf25-44.zip). Note that the | paper_id | used here is different from the ID assigned to the paper in HotCRP when submitted. This paper_id is assigned by the ACM systems for preparing the proceedings and is shown on top of the ACM Author Dashboard page. 
 Upload that ZIP file to TAPS. 
 Upload the supplementary materials as per organizer instructions. 
 If the source was successfully processed, review the generated PDF and HTML5 documents. If validation errors occur, revise the source and resubmit to TAPS. 
 Approve the article in TAPS for publication when all errors are resolved.

 href="" - Extended Author Notification Deadline
Due to the extended submission deadlines and the relatively short review period allocated to the Program Committee (PC), along with our commitment to ensuring thorough discussions, we have to extend the notification deadline toMarch 10th. The PC is working diligently to finalize all decisions as soon as possible. We understand that some authors may need early confirmation of their acceptance status forvisa applications, travel arrangements, or registration purposes. If you require urgent information regarding your paper's status,please contact the PC chairs directly, and we will do our best to accommodate your request. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience and understanding. 
 href="" - Call for Artifact Evaluation and disclaimer
The CF25 Organizing Committee strongly encourages authors on a voluntary basis to present the Artifact Evaluation (AE) documentation to support their scientific results. The Artifact Evaluation is run by a different committee after the acceptance of the paper and does not affect the paper evaluation itself. 
 Authors may submit the artifact during the submission period or after the notification. To arrange the necessary computing resources, authors are invited to flag the option during the paper registration if they are willing to participate in the evaluation. Authors are encouraged, but not required, to include the AE appendix in the paper at the time of submission. Note that the AE appendix does not count toward the page limit. 
 Artifact Preparation 
 CF25 adopts the ACM Artifact Review and Badging (Version 1.1 - August 24, 2020). By "artifact", we mean a digital object that was either created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself. Typical artifacts may include system descriptions or scripts to install the environment or reproduce specific experiments. Authors are invited to include a one-page appendix to the main paper (after the references). The appendix does not count toward the page limit. 
 To prepare the Appendix and avoid common mistakes, authors may refer to the following guide:https://ctuning.org/ae/checklist.htmlA Latex template can be found at the following link:https://github.com/ctuning/ck-artifact-evaluation/blob/master/wfe/artifact-evaluation/templates/ae.tex. 
 Artifact Review Process 
 The Artifact Evaluation Committee will reproduce the paper by following the instructions included in the appendix and verify ACM roles for assigned badges. For example, in order to have a paper with an Artifact Available badge, the code and data should be stored in a permanent archive with a DOI or another unique identifier. 
 Authors may be invited by the AE Committee to revise their instructions according to their feedback. At the end of the process, AE Committee will recommend one or more badges to assign to the paper among those supported by the ACM reproducibility policy. 
 Special Issue Opportunity 
 A Special Issue ofACM Transactions on Parallel Computing (TOPC)has been approved, where highly rated papers from the conference will be invited to submit their extended article by August, 2025. The manuscripts will undergo another round of peer review before a final decision.

 Abstract 
 (click to collapse)Hardware security is the root of trust in all modern ICT systems! Depending which community you address, it has a different meaning. It covers efficient, secure implementations of new generations of cryptography such as light-weight crypto, post-quantum crypto as well as advanced schemes such as zero-knowledge proofs, fully homomorphic encryption, and computing on encrypted data in general. On top, implementations also must resist a wide variety of side-channel, fault, and micro-architectural attacks. Post-quantum algorithms promise to resist the attacks developed for quantum computers. Yet, their implementations also must resist attacks on classic platforms. 
 Besides crypto, secure systems rely on many more security modules, requiring analog and digital circuit techniques to design quality true random number generators, physically unclonable functions, secure key storage, and many more. A recent report on “Revitalizing the U.S. Semiconductor Ecosystem” (from Executive Office of the President, President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, September 2022) describes a set of recommendations on semiconductors and system security. In this presentation, we will demonstrate how our research addresses these recommendations, and we will illustrate this with recent results.

 href="" - Submission
We encourage the submission of bothfull papersandshort paperscontaining high-quality research describing original, unpublished work. Full papers are expected to provide well-rounded contributions, where novelty, originality, and sufficient preliminary evaluation are included. Short papers may be position papers or may describe preliminary or highly speculative work. 
 Papers must be submitted through:https://cf25.hotcrp.com/Full papers are a maximum of eight (8) pages (excluding references) and short papers are a maximum of four (4) (including references) pages. All papers should use the double-columnACM conference format. Page limits include figures, tables and appendices. Authors may buy up to two (2) extra pages for accepted full papers. 
 As the review process is double-blind, the removal of all identifying information from paper submissions is required (e.g., cite own (previous) work in the third person, avoid references to machines and/or systems that can identify the paper authors, etc.). Papers not conforming to the above submission policies on formatting, page limits, and the removal of identifying information, are likely to be automatically rejected. Authors are strongly advised to submit their papers with the final list of authors in the submission system, as changes may not be feasible at later stages (due to restrictions at the publisher). 
 Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research. If the submission extends from a prior short paper, there should be substantial new content and intellectual contribution, and this should be clearly mentioned. Concurrent submission of the same paper to any other conference or journal is not permitted. While authors may post a draft of their paper on arxiv or as a technical report on their institution's website, they should take care to use a sufficiently different title and name for their system to ensure the anonymity of the submission. 
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to allACM Publications Policies, including ACM's newhref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" - Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects
. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
 As perACM Publications Policies, any use of artificial intelligence (AI) generated content in a paper must be clearly disclosed in the acknowledgements section of the submission. The authors are reponsible for the correctness of any generated material. The authors also attest that the submitted paper accurately represents their own novel intellectual contributions, and is not primarily the result of the tool's generative capabilities. 
 Registration and No-show policy:At least onefull registrationis required from a submission author for each accepted paperandall accepted papers are expected to bepresented in personat the conference. If circumstances arise such that authors are unable to present their papers at the conference, they must contact the PC co-chairs with a proposal for a replacement presenter. A no-show will result in exclusion from the ACM digital library proceedings. 
 Camera-Ready Instructions 
 Filling the Copyright FormSoon after acceptance notification, authors will receive an email from ACM requesting to fill in a copyright form. After that, authors will obtain thecopyright statement(i.e., copyright strip/DOI/ISBN) to be inserted on thefirst pageof the paper. Make sure to use exactly the same information in the camera-ready PDF, including the same title of paper, author list (names/ affiliation/ e-mail address) as specified in the original paper version submitted for review. Please ensure that co-authors obtain an ORCID ID so that the copyright process can be completed smoothly. 
 Camera-Ready Preparation ChecklistPlease walk through the following checklist for preparing the camera-ready paper. This helps to have a smoother submission in TAPS by having less chance of running into validation errors: 
 The template to use for the camera-ready version of the paper is the double-column ACM conference format: | Proceedings Template | . If the LaTeX template is used, ensure that the first line of the source file is | \documentclass[sigconf]{acmart} | . 
 If the LaTeX template is used, please make sure to | ONLY | use | href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/accepted-latex-packages" - TAPS-accepted Latex Packages | . 
 Authors must apply ACM Computing Classification categories and terms. The templates provide space for this indexing and point authors to the Computing Classification Scheme at | HERE | . 
 Do not include page numbers. 
 The author list must include names, affiliations (institute, city, country), and email addresses for all authors. 
 Make sure that the paper title and author names / affiliations / emails match exactly the information provided in the ACM copyright form. 
 CCS (Computing Classification Scheme), keywords, and ACM reference format must be present. 
 The copyright block may not be omitted. 
 Make sure to include the copyright statement (i.e., copyright strip/DOI/ISBN) on the first page of the paper. 
 The PDF may only contain Type 1 fonts, not Type 3. 
 All fonts must be embedded within the PDF file. 
 Libertine must be used as the main font. 
 Check that running page headers show abbreviated title / authors. 
 Check that figure captions are below figures and table captions above tables. 
 Make sure to have a README file in the sources (packaged as ZIP), including directions on how to generate the PDF from sources. 
 Make sure that at least one author is registered for the conference, at latest, by camera-ready submission due. If the PDF uses extra pages (only full papers), this registration must include payment for the extra pages. 
 Camera-Ready Submission via TAPSWe are using the ACM Production System (or TAPS) for the camera-ready submissions. This system assists authors in preparing and submitting the camera-ready version of the paper. Within a few hours after completing the copyright form (as instructed earlier), authors will receive an email from ACM TAPS, including links for submitting the camera-ready version of the paper. 
 That link redirects the authors to the ACM Author Dashboard, where detailed instructions on how to structure the article source material (e.g., in a ZIP file with a certain structure and name). ACM Author Dashboard also includes an upload field for submission of the sources and the paper. TAPS also runs a few checks after uploading the sources to assess their validity. Also, TAPS provides a contact support field in the Author Dashboard to facilitate discussions (e.g, in case TAPS reports validation errors for the submitted sources). 
 The TAPS workflow for camera-ready submission can be summed up in a few steps: 
 Prepare source material according to the above checklist - the Word or LaTeX source document(s), and any supplementary material authors wish to have distributed alongside the article in the Digital Library. 
 Organize the article source material into a ZIP file according to the instructions in ACM Author Dashboard. The zip file for upload must be named as follows: proceedings_acronym-paper_id.zip (e.g., cf25-44.zip). Note that the | paper_id | used here is different from the ID assigned to the paper in HotCRP when submitted. This paper_id is assigned by the ACM systems for preparing the proceedings and is shown on top of the ACM Author Dashboard page. 
 Upload that ZIP file to TAPS. 
 Upload the supplementary materials as per organizer instructions. 
 If the source was successfully processed, review the generated PDF and HTML5 documents. If validation errors occur, revise the source and resubmit to TAPS. 
 Approve the article in TAPS for publication when all errors are resolved.

Due to the extended submission deadlines and the relatively short review period allocated to the Program Committee (PC), along with our commitment to ensuring thorough discussions, we have to extend the notification deadline toMarch 10th. The PC is working diligently to finalize all decisions as soon as possible. We understand that some authors may need early confirmation of their acceptance status forvisa applications, travel arrangements, or registration purposes. If you require urgent information regarding your paper's status,please contact the PC chairs directly, and we will do our best to accommodate your request. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience and understanding. 
 href="" - Call for Artifact Evaluation and disclaimer
The CF25 Organizing Committee strongly encourages authors on a voluntary basis to present the Artifact Evaluation (AE) documentation to support their scientific results. The Artifact Evaluation is run by a different committee after the acceptance of the paper and does not affect the paper evaluation itself. 
 Authors may submit the artifact during the submission period or after the notification. To arrange the necessary computing resources, authors are invited to flag the option during the paper registration if they are willing to participate in the evaluation. Authors are encouraged, but not required, to include the AE appendix in the paper at the time of submission. Note that the AE appendix does not count toward the page limit. 
 Artifact Preparation 
 CF25 adopts the ACM Artifact Review and Badging (Version 1.1 - August 24, 2020). By "artifact", we mean a digital object that was either created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself. Typical artifacts may include system descriptions or scripts to install the environment or reproduce specific experiments. Authors are invited to include a one-page appendix to the main paper (after the references). The appendix does not count toward the page limit. 
 To prepare the Appendix and avoid common mistakes, authors may refer to the following guide:https://ctuning.org/ae/checklist.htmlA Latex template can be found at the following link:https://github.com/ctuning/ck-artifact-evaluation/blob/master/wfe/artifact-evaluation/templates/ae.tex. 
 Artifact Review Process 
 The Artifact Evaluation Committee will reproduce the paper by following the instructions included in the appendix and verify ACM roles for assigned badges. For example, in order to have a paper with an Artifact Available badge, the code and data should be stored in a permanent archive with a DOI or another unique identifier. 
 Authors may be invited by the AE Committee to revise their instructions according to their feedback. At the end of the process, AE Committee will recommend one or more badges to assign to the paper among those supported by the ACM reproducibility policy. 
 Special Issue Opportunity 
 A Special Issue ofACM Transactions on Parallel Computing (TOPC)has been approved, where highly rated papers from the conference will be invited to submit their extended article by August, 2025. The manuscripts will undergo another round of peer review before a final decision.

 In Loving Memory of Dr. Sally A. McKee- Read MoreIn Loving Memory of Dr. Sally A. McKee 
 The Computing Frontiers community has been shocked by the sad news of the passing of Dr. Sally A. McKee. Sally has been a long time member of the CF family, being one of the original founders of the conference, part of the Steering Committee for a long time, and author of one of the most cited papers of the conference. Sally had an enduring impact on the research on memory systems, having coined the term “memory wall” (specifically mentioned in her most cited CF paper) to highlight the appearance of the memory bottleneck in computer architecture. Sally also had an enduring impact on our lives as researchers and as friends, having been a mentor for many of us. The CF community will always remember her fondly.

The zip file for upload must be named as follows: proceedings_acronym-paper_id.zip (e.g., cf25-44.zip). Note that the | paper_id | used here is different from the ID assigned to the paper in HotCRP when submitted. This paper_id is assigned by the ACM systems for preparing the proceedings and is shown on top of the ACM Author Dashboard page. 
 Upload that ZIP file to TAPS. 
 Upload the supplementary materials as per organizer instructions. 
 If the source was successfully processed, review the generated PDF and HTML5 documents. If validation errors occur, revise the source and resubmit to TAPS. 
 Approve the article in TAPS for publication when all errors are resolved.

 href="" - Extended Author Notification Deadline
Due to the extended submission deadlines and the relatively short review period allocated to the Program Committee (PC), along with our commitment to ensuring thorough discussions, we have to extend the notification deadline toMarch 10th. The PC is working diligently to finalize all decisions as soon as possible. We understand that some authors may need early confirmation of their acceptance status forvisa applications, travel arrangements, or registration purposes. If you require urgent information regarding your paper's status,please contact the PC chairs directly, and we will do our best to accommodate your request. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your patience and understanding. 
 href="" - Call for Artifact Evaluation and disclaimer
The CF25 Organizing Committee strongly encourages authors on a voluntary basis to present the Artifact Evaluation (AE) documentation to support their scientific results. The Artifact Evaluation is run by a different committee after the acceptance of the paper and does not affect the paper evaluation itself. 
 Authors may submit the artifact during the submission period or after the notification. To arrange the necessary computing resources, authors are invited to flag the option during the paper registration if they are willing to participate in the evaluation. Authors are encouraged, but not required, to include the AE appendix in the paper at the time of submission. Note that the AE appendix does not count toward the page limit. 
 Artifact Preparation 
 CF25 adopts the ACM Artifact Review and Badging (Version 1.1 - August 24, 2020). By "artifact", we mean a digital object that was either created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the experiment itself. Typical artifacts may include system descriptions or scripts to install the environment or reproduce specific experiments. Authors are invited to include a one-page appendix to the main paper (after the references). The appendix does not count toward the page limit. 
 To prepare the Appendix and avoid common mistakes, authors may refer to the following guide:https://ctuning.org/ae/checklist.htmlA Latex template can be found at the following link:https://github.com/ctuning/ck-artifact-evaluation/blob/master/wfe/artifact-evaluation/templates/ae.tex. 
 Artifact Review Process 
 The Artifact Evaluation Committee will reproduce the paper by following the instructions included in the appendix and verify ACM roles for assigned badges. For example, in order to have a paper with an Artifact Available badge, the code and data should be stored in a permanent archive with a DOI or another unique identifier. 
 Authors may be invited by the AE Committee to revise their instructions according to their feedback. At the end of the process, AE Committee will recommend one or more badges to assign to the paper among those supported by the ACM reproducibility policy. 
 Special Issue Opportunity 
 A Special Issue ofACM Transactions on Parallel Computing (TOPC)has been approved, where highly rated papers from the conference will be invited to submit their extended article by August, 2025. The manuscripts will undergo another round of peer review before a final decision.
