Attractions 
 Welcome to Hangzhou, a charming city in China. It combines natural allure with rich history and modern charm. Verdant mountains and serene waters offer tranquility, while ancient heritages tell tales of the past. Hi-tech zones and trendy malls reveal its dynamic present, captivating all who visit. 
 West Lake, the crown jewel of Hangzhou, enchants visitors with its idyllic landscapes. It encompasses famed sites like the Broken Bridge, Su Causeway, Leifeng Pagoda, and Three Pools Mirroring the Moon. These spots, with their own stories and allure, draw countless eyes and make West Lake an ever-charming destination. 
 Lingyin Temple, a time-honored Buddhist sanctuary, dates back centuries. Tucked away in verdant mountains, it features imposing architecture like the majestic Main Hall. The temple complex is filled with an air of solemnity, and the nearby Feilai Peak is adorned with exquisitely carved stone statues, a testament to ancient artistry. 
 Xixi National Wetland Parkis a nature lover's paradise. It's a labyrinth of waterways marshes, and reed beds. Here, you can paddle a boat through tranquil canals, observe diverse bird species in their natural habitats, and soak up the fresh air, far from the city's din. 
 Hefang Street, one of the most representative historical blocks in old Hangzhou, retains the charm of the late Qing and early Republic. Here, a dazzling array of snacks like DingSheng Cake Pianâ€™erchuan Noodles, Stinky Tofu and Small Steamed Buns awaits. Every bite is filled with the unique flavor of Hangzhou. 
 Hangzhou Song Cityresurrects the glory of the Song Dynasty. Entering, you're transported to an era of prosperity. Streets are lined with quaint shops selling handicrafts and traditional snacks. The nightly "Song City Romance" show is a dazzling display of lights, music, and dance, retelling historical tales and captivating audiences. 
 The Zhejiang Provincial Museumholds over 100,000 artifacts, spanning from the Neolithic to modern times. With treasures like Hemudu and Liangzhu relics, celadon, and Buddhist items, plus ancient mirrors, coins from the Southern Song Dynasty, calligraphy and rubbings, it unveils rich regional history.

 Abstract Submission: May 25, 2025 
 Full Paper Submission: June 1, 2025 
 Author Notification: August 1, 2025 
 Camera-ready versions: August 20, 2025 
 Conference dates:November 10-13,2025 
 Conference Paper Submission and Publication 
 Submission should be done through the ICFEM 2025 submission page(the web page is under construction). 
 As in previous years, the proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. 
 Papers should be written in English and should not exceed 16 pages (excluding references and appendix) in the Springer's LNCS format. Each submission will undergo a rigoroussingle-blind pear-review process by at least three experts.

In summary, the PhD forum will provide PhD students with an ideal opportunity to present, share and discuss their research in a constructive and critical scientific atmosphere. 
 We seek submissions from PhD students who have either determined the direction of their thesis research (probably with some preliminary results already published), but who still have substantial work to complete; or PhD student participants who are in the early stages of their dissertations. It is not required to have a paper accepted at the main conference in order to participate in the ICFEM Doctoral Symposium. 
 Submissions to the Doctoral Symposium should include: Title of the research, the author name (single name) and affiliation; Context and motivation; Problem statement and related work; Proposed solutions and current research efforts, their significance, methodology, results and analysis, and future work. The paper should be prepared using theLNCS formatand submitted in PDF format via EasyChair. 
 We accept two types of submissions:(a)2-page extended abstracts which will not be included in the ICFEM proceedings; and(b)6-page papers which will be published in the LNCS volume of Springer as part of the main ICFEM proceedings. 
 Authors with accepted submissions are expected to attend the Doctoral Symposium in person to present their work. A discounted registration fee for Doctoral Symposium participants will be announced later.
