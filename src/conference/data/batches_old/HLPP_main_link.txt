 High-Level Parallel Programming 
 and Applications 
 17th International Symposium, Pisa, Italy 
 4-5 July 2024 
 The 17th HLPP Symposium proposes a two-day meeting at theComputer Science Department of the University of Pisain Italy. It focuses on high-level parallel programming of multi-/many-core platforms, heterogeneous compute clusters, highly parallel and distributed infrastructures. 
 As for previous editions, HLPP serves as a forum for researchers and engineers in parallel computing, proposing an excellent opportunity for scientists to present their latest ideas and findings in this challenging and ever-changing research field. We especially encouraged innovative approaches in parallel programming models and applications, high-level parallel languages, compilers, runtime systems, and programming tools for all classes of parallel machines.

 HLPP 2024 Call for Papers 
 The 17th HLPP symposium will be held in Pisa, Italy, as a two-day meeting (July 4-5, 2024) in the Computer Science Department of the University of Pisa. The HLPP symposium series aims to provide attendees with a focused and in-depth platform for presentations, discussion, and interaction in the parallel computing area with a particular focus on high-level parallel programming approaches. 
 We invite papers – max 20 pages Springer-Nature journal format — on topics related to all aspects of research, development, and application of high-performance systems with a focus on high-level programming of multi-/many-cores, heterogeneous compute clusters, highly parallel machines and distributed infrastructures. 
 The complete “Topics of Interest” list is provided below and on the symposium website. Submissions within the scope of this symposium series are highly encouraged, including unlisted but related topics. 
 Authors of accepted research papers will be invited to submit their work to the Spinger-Nature International Journal of Parallel Programming (IJPP) Special Issue of the HLPP 2024 symposium. The Special Issue has already been confirmed. 
 TOPICS OF INTEREST include but are not limited to: 
 High-level parallel and distributed programming models, libraries, and tools 
 High-level parallel programming for heterogeneous platforms with HW accelerators 
 Parallel performance models and performance portability 
 High-Performance Data Analytics and Machine Learning using high-level approaches 
 Programming models, languages, and patterns for the Compute Continuum 
 High-level parallelism in programming languages and libraries: semantics and implementation 
 Verification of declarative parallel and distributed programs 
 Efficient code generation, auto-tuning, and optimization for parallel and distributed programs 
 Model-driven software engineering for parallel and distributed systems 
 Domain-specific languages: design, implementation and applications 
 Parallel and distributed applications using high-level languages and libraries
