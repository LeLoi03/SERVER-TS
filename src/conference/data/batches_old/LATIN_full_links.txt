 This archive contains the pointers as they were when active. Pages for old conferences are likely to have expired, but the listing of dates and locations, etc., may be of use for historical purposes.Conferences in2024,2023,2022,2021,2020,2019,2018,2017,2016,2015,2014,2013,2012,2011,2010,2009,2008,2007,2006,2005,2004,2003,2002,2001,2000-1997.Conference Series Archives 
 Archive sites for conference series provide a valuable record. Links for several appear below. These also may have expired for conference series that are now defunct. Archives may include such things as lists of talks participants, and abstracts; even sometimes photos. If anyone knows of archive sites for other conference series in discrete mathematics, please let me know (send information todwest(at)illinois(dot)edu). There are many other conference series that would benefit from having archive sites; any volunteers?ACCOTA (Combinatorial and Computational Aspects of Optimization, Topology and Algebra)
