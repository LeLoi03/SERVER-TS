 IEEE INFOCOM 2025 is scheduled to take place in London, United Kingdom. This event will be conducted in person, allowing attendees to fully immerse themselves in the conference experience. However, we understand that some authors may encounter travel difficulties, such as obtaining visas. In such cases, assistance for remote presentation of their papers will be considered upon approval by the General Chairs. Virtual participation in the conference will no longer be supported. 
 IEEE INFOCOM is a top-ranked networking conference of the IEEE Communications Society.

 IEEE INFOCOM incorporates a rigorous double-blind review process. The review assignment will be based on the view assignment system described in the following paper, which analyzes the submitted manuscripts and the representative publications of TPC members and matches the submissions to TPC members’ expertise and interests. 
 B. Li and Y.T. Hou. “The new automated INFOCOM review assignment system,” IEEE Network, vol.30, no.5, pp.18-24, Sept./Oct. 2016. 
 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7579022/ 
 Papers that present data that include experiments on or with humans or animals and/or presentation or analysis of personally identifiable information, including aggregated data, must have the appropriate approval from the author(s)’ institution(s). An explicit statement about the approval must be included in the paper (with appropriate anonymization in the paper submitted for review). 
 Preprints Policy 
 The submitted manuscript or its title/abstract should not be posted on a public website, such as arXiv.org, or transmitted via public mailing lists. 
 Conflict of Interest (CoI) 
 Before submission, please update your CoIs in the EDAS system. A CoI occurs when a person’s objective judgment is — or is perceived by a reasonable observer — compromised by an existing relationship, affiliation, or connection to a person whose work they must evaluate. 
 The following are considered to be specific examples of relationships that produce CoIs. Individuals in such relationships should not be involved in peer review of, or making editorial decisions about, materials provided by the related parties. 
 The lifelong relationship between Ph.D. student and Ph.D. supervisor 
 Within the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next year: | Working closely together (e.g., at the same institution, company, or organization; or within the same organizational team). 
 Recipients of joint funding or significant professional collaboration. 
 Joint authorship of an archival publication. 
 Personal or family relationships that would reasonably cause others to doubt the impartiality of the review 
 Notable personal or professional conflicts (publicly known or not). 
 Submission Cap, Length, and Formatting Requirements 
 The maximum number of papers an author can submit to IEEE INFOCOM 2025 is five. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE INFOCOM 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®. Submitted papers must be written in English, witha maximum length limit of 10 printed pages. The main text (including figures, tables, appendices, and any material other than references) must beno more than 9 pages. Papers that do not comply with the length limit will not be reviewed. Use the standard IEEE Transactions templates for Microsoft Word or LaTeX formats found at: 
 https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html 
 If the paper is typeset in LaTeX, please use an unmodified version of the LaTeX template IEEEtran.cls version 1.8, and use the preamble: \documentclass[10pt, conference, letterpaper]{ IEEEtran } 
 Do not use additional LaTeX commands or packages to override and change the default typesetting choices in the template, including line spacing, font sizes, margins, space between the columns, and font types. This implies that the manuscript must use 10-point Times font, two-column formatting, as well as all default margins and line spacing requirements as dictated by the original version of IEEEtran.cls version 1.8. If you are using Microsoft Word to format your paper, you should use an unmodified version of the Microsoft Word IEEE Transactions template (US letter size). Regardless of the source of your paper formatting, you must submit your paper in Adobe PDF format. 
 The paper must print clearly and legibly, including all the figures, on standard black-and-white printers. Reviewers are not required to read your paper in color. The submitted manuscript should be self-contained. Inclusion of additional material (e.g., a technical report containing the detailed math proof through an anonymous Dropbox or OneDrive link) is not allowed. 
 Important Dates: 
 Abstract Due: Wednesday, July 24, 2024 (11:59pm, PDT) 
 Full Paper Due: Wednesday, July 31, 2024 (11:59pm, PDT) 
 Notification of Acceptance: Friday, December 6, 2024 
 Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE INFOCOM 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®. Full details regarding the submission procedures and requirements are available at https://infocom2025.ieee-infocom.org/.
