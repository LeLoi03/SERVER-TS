 ICSOC Conference OverviewICSOC, the International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing, is the premier international forum for academics, industry researchers, developers, and practitioners to report and share groundbreaking work in service-oriented computing. ICSOC fosters cross-community scientific excellence by gathering experts from various disciplines, such as services science, data science, management science, business-process management, distributed systems, wireless and mobile computing, cloud and edge computing, cyber-physical systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT), scientific workflows, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and services and software engineering. 
  
 ICSOCprovides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further our knowledge and understanding of the various aspects (e.g. application and system aspects) related to Service Computing with particular focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, IoT, and emerging technologies including quantum computing.

===========================================* 
 ICSOC, the International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing, is the premier international forum for academics, industry researchers, developers, and practitioners to report and share groundbreaking work in service-oriented computing. ICSOC 2024, the 22st event in this series, will take place in Tunis, Tunisia from 3 to 6 December 2024.Submissions / Review Model 
 ————————————— 
 Early submissions: Authors are invited to consider early submissions (deadline: May 9 May 2024). In the early submission round, only papers submitted as full/regular papers will be considered, and they will go through a full peer-review process. An early submitted paper that is accepted will be included in the proceedings. An early submitted paper that is rejected can be still revised and submitted to the normal submission round by the given deadline. If the authors of an early submitted paper that is rejected decide to resubmit their paper to the normal submission round, they will have to include an appendix (maximum 2 pages) describing how they have addressed the comments received by the reviewers from the early submission. 
 Normal submissions: Authors are also welcome to submit papers to the normal submission round by the given deadline. They need to submit an abstract by 10 July 2024. After the normal submission deadline, the papers resubmitted from the early submission round and those submitted only to the normal submission round will undergo the same review process as other submissions. The decisions made from this normal review procedure will be final and no resubmission will be permitted afterwards. 
 Anonymous submissions: ICSOC implements a double-blind reviewing process. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper. Authors’ prior work should be preferably referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded. Submissions that violate these requirements will be rejected without review. 
 The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.It should be noted that unformatted papers and papers beyond the page limit may not be reviewed.

 Theoretical foundations of Service Engineering 
 Service monitoring and adaptive management 
 Secure service lifecycle development 
 Privacy management aspects for services 
 Secure service lifecycle development 
 Privacy management aspects for services 
 Trust management for services 
 Service mining and analytics 
 Data-provisioning services 
 Cloud service management 
 Cloud and fog computing 
 Edge service orchestration 
 Metaverse services 
 IoT services 
 Lightweight service deployment and management 
 Social networks and services 
 Innovative service business models 
 Service-based business process management 
 In addition to the traditional topics, which include theoretical and empirical evaluations, as well as practical and industrial experiences, with emphasis on results that solve open research problems and have significant impact on the field of digital services and service-oriented computing, ICSOC welcome specific new 4 areas, which are presented below. 
 Focus Area 1: Service Oriented Technology Basics and Trends 
 Focus Area 2: AI for Services and as-a-Service 
 Focus Area 3: Novel Service Frameworks for Cloud Continuum and Smart Environments 
 Focus Area 4: Emerging Technologies 
 We invite high-quality submissions of research papers describing original contributions that are unpublished and not under review elsewhere. The research papers will focus on traditional areas or in a specific focus area mentioned above. Research in each area will be considered strictly in the context of service-oriented computing. No papers would be accepted unless they clearly illustrate the contribution to the ICSOC areas of interest. It may even be desk-rejected. 
 Paper Submission 
 ———————— 
 Papers should be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS Formatting Guidelines. Submissions must be in English and must not exceed 15 pages. All papers must be submitted electronically to the Conference Submission System. Each paper must be submitted on or before the provided deadlines. Authors are kindly invited to respect the abstract submission deadline, set one week before the paper submission. The limit length of accepted papers should be 15 pages (including abstract, figures and references). The final submission should be formatted according to Springer’s 
 LNCS Camera ready instructions. 
 For each accepted paper, at least one author must attend the conference and present the paper. 
 The deadline for identifying and registering this individual author will be at the time when the camera-ready version is submitted. 
 All accepted papers will be included in the Conference Proceedings published by Springer Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.
