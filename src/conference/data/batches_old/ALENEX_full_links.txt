 About the Conference 
 The aim of ALENEX is to provide a forum for the presentation of original research in the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. 
 Typical submissions will include an extensive experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. 
 Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering. 
 Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to high-performance and cloud computing. 
 Proceedings will be posted online in January 2025. ALENEX is supported by SIAM. 
 Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect that interesting synergies will develop between the co-located conferences. 
 ALENEX will be held jointly with: 
 ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) 
 SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA)

 CALL FOR PAPERS 
  
 Conference Website: https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/alenex25

 | About the Conference 
 +-------- 
  
 The aim of ALENEX is to provide a forum for the presentation of original 
 research in the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of 
 algorithms and data structures. Typical submissions will include an extensive 
 experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the 
 gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address 
 methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of 
 algorithms and data structures. 
  
 Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to 
 databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; 
 operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and 
 computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering. 
  
 Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for 
 advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel 
 computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to 
 high-performance and cloud computing. 
  
 Proceedings will be posted online in January 2025. ALENEX is supported by SIAM. 
  
 Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning 
 detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect 
 that interesting synergies will develop between the co-located conferences. 
  
 The following conferences will be held jointly: 
 - ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) 
 ) https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/soda25 
 - SIAM Symposium on Algorithm Engineering and Experiments (ALENEX)

 | How to Participate 
 +-------- 
  
 == Format == 
 Submissions must be PDF, formatted according to the double column macro posted 
 here. (Note that there is also a single column macro, but ALENEX uses the 
 double-column one.) Submissions must not exceed 10 pages, excluding front 
 matter (title and abstract), references, and a clearly marked appendix (further 
 described below). 
  
 == Content == 
 Papers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract, which begins 
 with the title of the paper as well as a short abstract. This should be 
 followed by the main body of the paper that begins with a precise statement of 
 the problem considered, a succinct summary of the results obtained (emphasizing 
 the significance, novelty, and potential impact of the research), and a clear 
 comparison with related work. The remainder of the extended abstract should 
 provide sufficient details to allow the program committee to evaluate the 
 validity, quality, and relevance of the contribution. Clarity of presentation 
 is very important; the entire extended abstract should be written carefully, 
 taking into consideration that it will be read and evaluated by both experts 
 and non-experts, often under tight time constraints. 
  
 == Appendix and Additional data == 
 All details needed to verify the results must be provided. Supporting 
 materials, including proofs of theoretical claims and experimental details, 
 that do not fit in the 10 page limit should be given in an appendix. If more 
 appropriate, the full version may be given as the appendix. In both cases, 
 however, the authors should include in the main part specific pointers to the 
 relevant locations in the appendix. The appendix will be read by the program 
 committee members and subreviewers at their discretion and will not be 
 published as part of the proceedings. Thus, the paper without the appendix 
 should be able to stand on its own. Experimental and implementation results 
 (independent of paper type) must be reproducible and verifiable. Authors are 
 encouraged to put accompanying software and relevant data, in a repository 
 accessible to the reviewers. Authors are asked to indicate which of the 
 supporting materials will remain publicly available if their papers are 
 accepted. 
  
 == Double-blind == 
 ALENEX will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions 
 should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, 
 authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the 
 beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any 
 references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not "We 
 build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the work of ..."). 
 Particular care needs to be taken with accompanying software or data, which 
 need to be linked anonymously (for example, via a DropBox folder or the like). 
 Upon registering a submission, the authors will declare conflicts of interest 
 with PC members. The purpose of lightweight double-blind reviewing is to help 
 PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper 
 without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if 
 they were to try. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft 
 versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post 
 drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on 
 their research ideas. We encourage authors with further questions on 
 double-blind reviewing to contact the PC chairs. 
  
 == Previous or Simultaneous Submissions == 
 Results previously published or accepted for publication in the proceedings of 
 another conference cannot be submitted. Simultaneous submissions of the results 
 to another conference with published proceedings are not allowed. Exempted are 
 workshops and conferences without formal proceedings, but possibly with 
 handouts containing short abstracts. Results that have already been accepted 
 (with or without revision) for publication in a journal at the time of their 
 submission to the symposium are not allowed. A paper submitted to a journal but 
 not yet accepted for publication can be submitted to the symposium. In such 
 cases, the authors must mention this on the front page of the submission and 
 clearly identify the status of the journal submission at the date of the full 
 paper submission deadline. 
  
 == Accepted Papers == 
 Final proceedings versions of accepted papers must use the same double column 
 formatting macro as the submissions. Title, abstract, and body of the paper 
 altogether must not exceed 12 pages, followed by unlimited references. If any 
 supporting material (including complete proofs of theoretical claims and 
 experimental details) does not fit in the specified limit, then the full 
 version of the paper containing this information must be referenced in the 
 conference version and made available at a public repository, such as arXiv, by 
 the time the final version is submitted. Where applicable, we encourage the 
 authors to make accompanying software and/or data publicly accessible, with 
 proper references in the paper. 
  
 == Artifact Evaluation == 
 To verify and facilitate reproducibility of the results described in ALENEX 
 papers, we encourage authors of accepted papers to submit their artifacts (e.g. 
 code and data) for Artifact Evaluation (AE). The artifact submission deadline 
 for accepted papers will be Sep. 9. A separate committee will examine the 
 artifacts, with notification by Oct. 13. Participation in artifact evaluation 
 is not mandatory and will not influence paper acceptance. However, AE results 
 will be considered when inviting top papers for journal publication. Papers 
 that pass Artifact Evaluation will be awarded SIAM badges for availability and 
 reproducibility, which will be printed directly on the papers giving the 
 readers greater confidence in the results presented in them. Participation in 
 the AE phase will not be made public except for the papers that receive badges. 

The Easy Chair submission site is available: 
 ) https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alenex25 

== Proceedings == 
 The proceedings will be posted online in mid-January 2025. 
  
 == Acceptance Notification == 
 The Program Committee chairs will distribute acceptance notices and final paper 
 submission instructions to authors of accepted papers in late August 2024. 
  
 SIAM will distribute a follow-up notice in early October 2024; a list of 
 accepted papers will be posted at this time.

 Abstract 
 Thepeaceable queens problemasks to determine the maximum number\(a(n)\)such that there is a placement of\(a(n)\)white queens and\(a(n)\)black queens on an\(n\times n\)chessboard so that no queen can capture any queen of the opposite color. 
 In this paper, we consider the peaceable queens problem and its variant on the toroidal board. For the regular board, we show that\(a(n)\le 0.1716n^{2}\), for all sufficiently large\(n\). This improves on the bound\(a(n)\le 0.25n^{2}\)of van Bommel and MacEachern [16]. 
 For the toroidal board, we provide new upper and lower bounds. Somewhat surprisingly, our bounds show that there is a sharp contrast in behaviour between the odd torus and the even torus. Our lower bounds are given by explicit constructions. For the upper bounds, we formulate the problem as a non-linear optimization problem with at most 100 variables, regardless of the size of the board. We solve our non-linear program exactly using modern optimization software. 
 We also provide a local search algorithm and a software implementation which converges very rapidly to solutions which appear optimal. Our algorithm is sufficiently robust that it works on both the regular and toroidal boards. For example, for the regular board, the algorithm quickly finds the so-calledAinley construction. Thus, our work provides some further evidence that the Ainley construction is indeed optimal.
