IPSN: ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor NetworksIPSN is a flagship conference on sensor networks, with its main focus on information processing and embedded platform design aspects of networked embedded sensing and control systems. It provides a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present the latest research results and exchange ideas and network with colleagues. As sensor networks is an interdisciplinary field, IPSN draws upon a number of disciplines including signal and image processing, embedded systems design, information and coding theory, networking and protocols distributed algorithms, wireless communications, machine learning, and data bases and information management. The conference encourages submissions on innovative applications of sensor network technology.href="http://ipsn.acm.org/2025" - IPSN 2025 | , Irvine, USA, May 6-9, 2025.

Announcement from the Joint 
 SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI Steering Committee 
 We are excited to announcethe plans of merging threeleading conferences — SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI — into a single premier event under the new name: 
 SenSys: 
 Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems 
 This unified conference will focus on advancing research at the intersection of sensing systems and embedded artificial intelligence. Originating from distinct yet complementary research areas, these three conferences have driven innovation across multiple disciplines, including sensor networks, embedded systems, mobile computing, wireless communication, signal processing, data science, and AI-driven applications. As intelligent sensing systems continue to permeate diverse research domains, the necessity for a unified, high-impact forum has become apparent. The newly expanded SenSys conference will provide a comprehensive platform where researchers and industry professionals can converge to present state-of-the-art research, exchange novel ideas, address key challenges, and shape the future of the field. 
 SenSys'25 will continue as a SenSys event (Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems), while the merger with IPSN and IoTDI is pending final approvals ofthe ACM and the IEEE. SenSys'25 will bring the three communities together and mark an important milestone in the transition toward a fully unified conference. The merger will be finalized as soon as the necessary approvals and structure are in place. SenSys 2025 will be collocated with CPS-IoT Week 2025, providing a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange. All accepted papers in 2025 will be published in the ACM SenSys proceedings. In addition, we are exploring the possibility of introducing multiple submission deadlines in the future. Detailed information, including the updated call for papers and submission guidelines, will be made available on the official conference website at:href="https://sensys.acm.org/2025/" - https://sensys.acm.org/2025/
