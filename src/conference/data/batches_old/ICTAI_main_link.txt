 Welcome to ICTAI 2022 
 The IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI) is a leading IEEE-CS annual scientific meeting for three decades. It provides a major international forum where the creation and exchange of ideas related to artificial intelligence are fostered among academia, industry, and government agencies. The conference facilitates the cross-fertilization of these ideas and promotes their transfer into practical tools, for developing intelligent systems and pursuing artificial intelligence applications. The ICTAI encompasses all technical aspects of specifying, developing and evaluating the theoretical underpinnings and applied mechanisms of the AI-based components of computer tools such as algorithms, architectures and languages.

 Paper Submission 
 ICTAI 2022 uses a double-blind review process.To facilitate this, authors should ensure that their names and affiliations do not appear anywhere in the submitted paper. 
 The submissions should contain original, high quality, not submitted or published elsewhere work. Papers should be submitted electronically (through the ICTAI web site) inPDFformat and should be conformed to IEEE specifications (single-space, double-column, 10-point font size, up to 8 pages). 
 ICTAI receives only full papers (up to 8 pages long). The Review Committee makes the decision of categorization of these papers based on their merit. More specifically, the categories are: 
 Full papers based on their quality after review (8 pages long with regular registration plus one extra page, if needed, with extra cost $100 according to IEEE CS policy). 
 Short papers based on their merit after review (5 pages long with regular registration PLUS ONE extra page, if needed, with extra cost $100 according to IEEE CS policy). 
 Full papers and short papers will be published in the same proceedings and will be presented in the sessions in a mixed order. 
 Paper Presentation 
 Each accepted paper should be presented by one of the authors and accompanied by at least one full registration fee payment, to guarantee publication in the proceedings.All accepted papers will be included in the proceedings of ICTAI 2022 that will be published by the IEEE Computer Society. 
 Special Issues 
 Extended versions of the best papers of the conference will be invited for publication in a special issue of the International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools (IJAIT) (SCI Indexed).
