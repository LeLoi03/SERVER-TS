Previous editionsDOLAP: the International Workshop on Design, Optimization, Languages and Analytical Processing of Big Data 
 DOLAP is established as one of the reference places for researchersto publish their work in the broad area of data decision support systems. The DOLAP workshop maintains a high quality of accepted papers, as attested by its ranking as “very good event” in the last edition of theGII-GRIN-SCIE Conference Ranking. Every year, the best papers published at DOLAP are invited to submit extended version to a special issue on a highly reputed international journal (likeInformation SystemsorData & Knowledge Engineering). Moreover, the high-quality program of DOLAP includesinvited keynotesfrom reputed speakers, abest paperaward since 2020, and usesopen proceedingssince 2017. Atest-of-time awardwas given in 2023 to celebrate the 25th edition of DOLAP. 
 Research focus 
 Research in data warehousing and OLAP has produced important technologies for the design, management, and use of information systems for decision support. Nowadays, due to the advent of Big Data, Decision Support Systems (DSS) include a wider range of systems, in which novel solutions combine advanced data management and data analytics, (semi-)automating the data lifecycle (from ingestion to visualization). Yet, modern data analytics systems acknowledge the relevance of managing data in an efficient way (by means of data modeling and optimized data processing) to serve innovative data analysis bringing added value to organizations. 
 Data platforms of the future will consequently be significantly different than what the current state-of-the-practice supports. The trend is to move from current systems that are “data presenting” to more dynamic systems that allow the semi-automation of the decision making process (including both data management and data analysis tasks). This means that systems partially guide their users towards data discovery, management and system-aided decision making via intelligent techniques (beyond OLAP and exploiting artificial intelligence) and visualization. In the backstage, the advent of the big data era requires that new methods, models, techniques and architectures are developed to cope with the increasing demand in capacity, data type diversity, schema and data variability and responsiveness. And of course, this does not necessarily mean to re-invent the wheel, but rather, complementing the wealth of research in data management and anlytics with other approaches. 
 We envision DOLAP as a forum to discuss, foster and nurture novel ideasaround these new landscapes of decision support systems and data platoforms in the era of big data in order to produce new exciting results, within a strong, vibrant community around these areas. 
 The new logo 
 After 25 years of workshops, we have revamped theoriginal logoto represent the main themes that are driving the scope of DOLAP. While the cube is an obvious reference to the multidimensional data, here is the breakdown of the symbols on its sides. 
 OLAP 
 The star and snowflake schemas laid the foundation to multidimensional data modeling and implementation of data warehouses, i.e., the building block of any business intelligence and OLAP application, identifying the roots of DOLAP's scope 
 Big Data 
 The big data revolution imposed disruptive changes at the levels of the 4 Vs (volume, velocity, variety, veracity), pushing researchers and practitioners into rethinking practices of data (and metadata) managament and analytical processing 
 ML & AI 
 If machine learning techniques have always been paired with OLAP analyses to support the decision-making process, the ground-breaking advancements in the field of artificial intelligence are further pushing the boundaries of what analytical applications can achieve 
 Data-driven decision-making is a research topic in continuous evolution, always encountering new challenges and opening to tremendous opportunities, inspiring research work that takes data analysis to an ever-higher level. The DOLAP workshop is the perfect venue for researchers to share their latest work in this area and join a strong and proactive data-enthusiast community.

 Abstract 
 The DOLAP workshop celebrated its 25thanniversary in 2023. This significant milestone reflects the enduring impact and importance of DOLAP as a platform for advancing research in topics covered in the forum. DOLAP, founded in 1998 as an ACM workshop alongside CIKM, served as a pioneering academic forum for research in Data Warehousing and OLAP. Since 2017, DOLAP has been co-located with EDBT, and it has evolved into the International Workshop on Design, Optimization, Languages and Analytical Processing of Big Data. This study aims to analyze the 25-year evolution (1998-2023) of DOLAP research. By analyzing 328 full-text DOLAP papers through the DMR topic modeling, the research employs bibliometrics and social network analysis for research performance and collaboration networks. The paper presents evolution of thematic trends, a variety of citation statistics, and collaboration networks among DOLAP authors.
