WG 2025 
 51st International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science, June 11-13, Europäische Akademie Otzenhausen, Germany 
 WG conferences aim to connect theory and applications by demonstrating how graph-theoretic concepts can be applied in various areas of computer science. The goal is to present recent results and to identify and explore directions for future research. The51st edition of the International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science (WG 2025)will be held atEuropäische Akademie Otzenhausenfrom June 11 to 13, 2025, with a reception on the evening of June 10. 
 Important dates 
 Abstract submission deadline: February 14, 2025 
 Paper submission deadline: February 20, 2025 
 Notification of paper acceptance: April 17, 2025 
 Symposium: June 11-13, 2025

 Aims and scope 
 WG is mainly concerned with efficient algorithms of various types (e.g., sequential, parallel, distributed, randomized, parameterized) for problems on graphs and networks. The goal is to present recent results and to identify and explore directions for future research. Submitted papers should describe original results in any aspects of graph theory related to computer science, including but not restricted to: 
 design and analysis of sequential, parallel, randomized, parameterized algorithms 
 distributed graph and network algorithms 
 structural graph theory with algorithmic or complexity applications 
 computational complexity of graph and network problems 
 graph grammars, graph rewriting systems and graph modeling 
 graph drawing and layouts 
 computational geometry 
 computational biology 
 graph mining 
 random graphs and models of the web and scale-free networks 
 support of the above concepts by suitable implementations and applications.

 WG 2025 will offer awards for the best paper and the best student paper. The awards will be decided by the program committee. The committee can decide to split the awards over multiple papers, or not to offer an award. Papers eligible for the best student paper can have non-student co-authors, but the main work in a paper that is a candidate for the best student paper award must be done by co-authors that were students at the time of submission, and the award can be received only by such co-authors. It must be indicated at the time of submission whether a paper is a candidate for this award.

This key enables other applications to access data from within Indico even when you are neither using nor logged into the Indico system yourself with the link provided. Once created, you can manage your key at any time by going to 'My Profile' and looking under the tab entitled 'HTTP API'. Further information about HTTP API keys can be found in the Indico documentation. 
 I have read and understood the above.Additionally to having an API key associated with your account, exporting private event information requires the usage of a persistent signature. This enables API URLs which do not expire after a few minutes so while the setting is active, anyone in possession of the link provided can access the information. Due to this, it is extremely important that you keep these links private and for your use only. If you think someone else may have acquired access to a link using this key in the future, you must immediately create a new key pair on the 'My Profile' page under the 'HTTP API' and update the iCalendar links afterwards.

aim at uniting theory and practice by demonstrating how graph-theoretic concepts can be applied to various areas in Computer Science, or by extracting new problems from applications. The goal is to present recent research results and to identify and explore directions of future research. 
 The 50th edition, WG 2024, was organized by theUniversity of Primorska, Faculty of Mathematics, Natural Sciences and Information TechnologiesandAndrej Marušič Institute, theSlovenian Discrete and Applied Mathematics Society, and theInstitute of Mathematics, Physics and Mechanics, and was held from June 19—21, 2024 in Gozd Martuljek, Slovenia.

 href="https://algo.uni-trier.de/wg2025/" - WG 2025
, the 51st WG conference, will take place in Otzenhausen, Germany. 
 Since 1975, WG conferences aim to connect theory and applications by demonstrating how graph-theoretic concepts can be applied in various areas of computer science. As such WG is mainly concerned with efficient algorithms of various types (e.g. sequential, parallel, distributed, randomized, parameterized) for problems on graphs and networks. The goal is to present recent results and to identify and explore directions for future research. Work presented at WG describes original results in any aspects of graph theory related to computer science, including but not restricted to: 
 design and analysis of sequential, parallel, randomized, parameterized algorithms 
 distributed graph and network algorithms 
 structural graph theory with algorithmic or complexity applications 
 computational complexity of graph and network problems 
 graph grammars, graph rewriting systems and graph modeling 
 graph drawing and layouts 
 computational geometry 
 computational biology 
 graph mining 
 random graphs and models of the web and scale-free networks 
 support of the above concepts by suitable implementations and applications.

 WG conferences aim to connect theory and applications by demonstrating how graph-theoretic concepts can be applied in various areas of computer science. This conference series has a long tradition and bridges discrete mathematics and computer science. WG is mainly concerned with efficient algorithms of various types (e.g., sequential, parallel, distributed, randomized, parameterized) for problems on graphs and networks. The goal is to present recent results and to identify and explore directions for future research.
