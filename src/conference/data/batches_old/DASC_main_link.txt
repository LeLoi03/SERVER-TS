 The 23rd IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing (DASC 2025) 
 Hybrid Conference Mode (In-Presence/Virtual) 
 October 21-24, 2025 - Hakodate City, Hokkaido, Japan 
 As computer and communication systems, as well as other systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and Autonomous Robotic Systems, become increasingly large and complex, their Dependability and Security play critical roles in supporting next-generation science, engineering, and commercial applications. It remains a challenge to design, analyze, evaluate, and improve the dependability and security of a large-scale computing environment. Trusted and autonomic computing/autonomous systems need synergistic research efforts covering many disciplines, from natural sciences to social sciences. It requires scientific and technological advances in a variety of fields, as well as new software, architectures, communication, and data platform technology that support the integration of the constituent technologies. 
 IEEE DASC 2025 will be held during October 21-24, 2025, in Hakodate City, Hokkaido, Japan, co-located withhref="http://cyber-science.org/2025/cyberscitech/" - IEEE CyberSciTech 2025

, andhref="http://cyber-science.org/2025/cbdcom/" - IEEE CBDCom 2025
. It aims to bring together computer scientists, industrial engineers, and researchers to discuss and exchange theoretical and implementation results, novel designs, work-in-progress, experience, case studies, and trend-setting ideas in the areas of dependability, security, trust, and/or autonomic computing, and autonomous systems. 
 Topics of interestinclude, but are not restricted to: Self-Organization and Organic Computing; Cognitive Computing and Self-Aware Computing; Energy Management in Autonomic Computing and Autonomous Systems; Dependable & Fault-tolerant Computing in Big Data, CPS, IoT, SDN, and Real-time System; Hardware and Software Reliability, Verification and Testing; Security and Privacy in Cloud/Fog/Edge Computing, Mobile and Pervasive Computing, Big Data, CPS and IoT systems; Artificial Intelligence Techniques in Network and System Security and Privacy; Autonomic and Autonomous Issues in Cloud/Fog/Edge Computing, Mobile and Pervasive Computing, Big Data, CPS and IoT systems; Software/Apps/Tools Development for Dependable and Secure Applications; IoT and Sensor Network, Big Data, Smart Grid, Aerospace, Transportation Applications.
