Keynotes 
 href="" - Assia Mahboubi is a permanent researcher at Inria and an endowed
Professor at the Department of Mathematics of the VU Amsterdam. Her
research interests are the foundations and formalization of
mathematics in type theory and the automated verification of
mathematical proofs. She was previously a member of
the Mathematical Components team at the Inria Microsoft Research joint
centre, known for a machine-checked proof of the Odd Order
theorem in finite group theory. She has been one of the main
contributors to this collaborative effort. Her current projects are
related to the formal verification of mathematical software.

Annabelle McIver
is a Professor of Computer Science at Macquarie
University in Sydney. Annabelle trained as a mathematician at Cambridge
and Oxford Universities. Her research uses mathematics to prove
quantitative properties of programs, and more recently to provide
foundations for quantitative information flow for analysing security
properties. She is co-author of the book Abstraction, Refinement and
Proof for Probabilistic Systems, and of the forthcoming title The
Science of Quantitative Information Flow.

 Background 
 href="" - The International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction
(MPC) aims to promote the development of mathematical principles
and techniques that are demonstrably practical and effective in
the process of constructing computer programs.
href="" - MPC 2019 will be held in Porto, Portugal from 7-9 October 2019, and is
co-located with the International Symposium on Formal Methods,
FM 2019.

 Scope 
 href="" - MPC seeks original papers on mathematical methods and tools put to
use in program construction.  Topics of interest range from algorithmics
to support for program construction in programming languages and
systems.  Typical areas include type systems, program analysis
and transformation, programming language semantics, security, and
program logics.  The notion of a 'program' is interpreted broadly,
ranging from algorithms to hardware.

Theoretical contributions are welcome, provided that their relevance
to program construction is clear.  Reports on applications are welcome,
provided that their mathematical basis is evident.  We also encourage
the submission of 'programming pearls' that present elegant and
instructive examples of the mathematics of program construction.
href="" - Submission
href="" - Submission is in two stages.  Abstracts (plain text, maximum 250 words)
must be submitted by 7th May 2019.  Full papers (pdf, formatted using
the
llncs.sty style file for LaTex) must be submitted by 10th May 2019. There is no prescribed page limit, but authors should strive for brevity. Both abstracts and papers will be submitted usinghref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mpc20190
" - EasyChair
. 
 Papers must present previously unpublished work, and not be submitted concurrently to any other publication venue. Submissions will be evaluated by the program committee according to their relevance correctness, significance, originality, and clarity. Each submission should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work. Accepted papers must be presented in person at the conference by one of the authors. 
 The proceedings of MPC 2019 will be published in theLecture Notes in Computer Science(LNCS) series, as with all previous instances of the conference. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to transfer copyright to Springer for this purpose. 
 After the conference, authors of the best papers from MPC 2019 and MPC 2015 will be invited to submit revised versions to a special issue ofScience of Computer Programming(SCP). 
 For any queries about submission please contact the program chair,Graham Hutton.
