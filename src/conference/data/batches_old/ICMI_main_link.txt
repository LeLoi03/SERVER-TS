 DEAR ICMI COMMUNITY, 
 We are thrilledto welcome you in-person in Canberra, Australia. 
 The 27th International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (ICMI 2025) will be held in Canberra, Australia on 13-17 Oct 2025. 
 ICMI is the premier international forum that brings together multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) and social interaction research. Multimodal AI encompasses technical challenges in machine learning and computational modeling such as representations, fusion, data, and systems. The study of social interactions englobes both human-human interactions and human-computer interactions. A unique aspect of ICMI is its multidisciplinary nature which values scientific discoveries and technical modeling achievements equally, with an eye toward impactful applications for the good of people and society. 
 We are keen to showcase novel input and output modalities and interactions to the ICMI community. ICMI 2025 will feature keynote speakers, technical full and short papers (including oral and poster presentations), demonstrations, exhibits, doctoral spotlight papers, and late-breaking papers. The conference will also feature workshops and grand challenges. The proceedings of all ICMI 2025 papers, including Long and Short Papers, will be published by ACM as part of their series of International Conference Proceedings and Digital Library, and the adjunct proceedings will feature the workshop papers.The main conference days will be on 14-16 Oct 2025, while workshops/tutorials and grand challenges will be held on 13 or 17 Oct 2025. This schedule will allow for maximum flexibility for attendees who also want to attend the 2025 13th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (href="https://acii-conf.net/2025/" - ACII 2025
, 8-11 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling to combine two excellent conferences in one trip. While the organising committees of ACII 2025 and ICMI 2025 are separate, the teams work closely together and investigate registration options that will allow for different combinations of attending the two conferences for those who cannot attend both conferences in full. Further details will be provided in due time. (Sunday, 12 Oct 2025 will be a rest and recovery day for those attending both conferences.)
