 About MICC 2025 
 The 2025 IEEE 17th Malaysia International Conference on Communications (MICC) is fully sponsored byIEEE Malaysia Communication Society & Vehicular Technology Society Joint Chapter(ComSoc / VTS) will be held on the 27 – 28 August 2025. The conference will be held at Malacca, Malaysia. MICC has since been organized biennially and has been a few times organized in collaboration with other major conferences. In 1997, MICC was held in conjunction with IEEE 5th International Workshop on Intelligent Signal Processing and Communications Systems (ISPACS’97). In 2003 it was co-organized with IEEE 9th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communication (APCC03) and in 2005, the 7th MICC was organized in conjunction with IEEE 13th International Conference on Networks (ICON05). The 8th MICC in 2007 was co-hosted with the 14th International Conference on Telecommunications (ITC07). Next, the 9th MICC in 2009 was held in Kuala Lumpur. The latest, the 10th MICC in 2011 was held in Kota Kinabalu that was collocated with the 17th Asia-Pacific Conference on Communications (APCC 2011). The 11th MICC2013 was held at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and we have celebrated 20th year celebration of this conference. MICC conferences have been very well attended and supported by researchers from Asia-Pacific region and the world at large. The 12th MICC2015 and 13thMICC2017 was successfully held in Kuching, Sarawak and Johor Bahru, Johor and the 14th MICC2019 was held in Hotel Bangi-Putrajaya, Selangor. The 15th MICC2021 was held virtually due to Covid-19 pandemic. While, the 16th MICC2023 was held in Kuala Lumpur with the theme “Smart Digital Communication for Humanity”. Finally, the 17th MICC2025 will be expected to be held in Grand Swiss-Belhotel Melaka.
