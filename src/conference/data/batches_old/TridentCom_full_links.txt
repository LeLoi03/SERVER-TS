 Telecommunication infrastructures play a vital role in modern society. The advancements in the range of network service offerings, their performance, quality of service, security, and ubiquity are relentless, despite global economy fluctuations. The demand for high bandwidth network infrastructures is continuously growing within both academic and industrial sectors. Grid computing is one of the many examples of the new emerging paradigm of networking characterized by huge data traffic flows, that require an extremely high-performance network infrastructure. The need of high speed is emerging also in mobile, wireless network environments, where new wireless technologies promise data rates above 100 Mbps. Other high bandwidth network examples include community access networks, on demand optical networks, and the Next Generation Internet.

 TridentCom 2009 represents a landmark in the history of international testbed conferences. With the rapid convergence of networks and applications, changes in related industries, more complex value chains and increased competition, early prototyping and experimentation will become a key means for driving innovation and development of market oriented solutions. In this context, value generation has shifted from network technologies towards applications and content. Thus, the nature and scope of testbeds have changed substantially in recent years from solely network technologies towards complex service delivery infrastructures riding on various networks. In contrast to traditional vendor, operator and technology specific “closed” testbeds, the notion of “open” testbeds has emerged. “Open” in this context means both wide access as a shared resource and extensibility to include on-demand new end systems, network technologies, protocol stacks, and, most importantly, new middleware and service delivery platforms for specific test purposes. To meet this need, major research and development programs have started around the globe, including GENI in the U.S. and FIRE in Europe, to establish large scale experimental facilities. TridentCom 2009 will provide a forum to explore existing and planned testbed concepts, infrastructures, and tools to address the research and business challenges in a world of global convergence.
