 WELCOME TO SISY 2025! 
 Authors are welcome to submit original and unpublished papers which are not currently under review by another conference or journal and addressing state-of-the-art research to share their work in all areas of Intelligent Systems and Informatics and its applications and attend theIEEE 23rdInternational Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics (SISY 2025)to be held onSeptember 25-27, 2025inSubotica, Serbia. The conference is going to be organized in-person with onsite presentations only. 
 IEEE Publication 
 The conference appears on theIEEE Conference Search. 
 Conference proceedings that meet IEEE quality review standards may be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore), if the paper is not presented at the conference. 'Pay to publish' is not allowed by IEEE. So at least one author of a paper must show up and present the paper at the conference. 
 Scope 
 The aim of SISY 2025 Symposium is to offer researchers an opportunity to extend the existing scientific relationships all over the world in the field of Intelligent Systems including Fuzzy Systems, Fuzzy and Neuro-Fuzzy Control, Knowledge Based Systems, Expert Systems, Intelligent Robotics, Reasoning, Learning, Robotic Systems, Human-Robotic Interaction, Service Robots, Surgery Robots, Intelligent Mechatronics, Cybermedical Systems, CAD/CAM/CAE Systems, Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Deep learning, Engineering Education, 5G and Cybersecurity, Digitalisation, Generation Research, Consumer Trends, Women in Engineering and Informatics. Our hope is that researchers and lecturers working at various institutions will find common research areas at the conference so that they can co-operate on bilateral or international projects. On the one hand, papers submitted to this conference deal with new educational methods that make a valuable contribution to the co-operation of institutions in higher education. The majority of these works focus on intelligent systems that can be successfully implemented in various areas of developing industries all over the world. All accepted papers are presented at the conference in sessions. The technical program is prepared on the basis of announced topics. 
 Celebration 
 SISY 2025 is dedicated to the 65thbirthday of Márta Takács.
