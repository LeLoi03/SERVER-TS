 ITNAC 2025 will be held in Christchurch, New Zealand from 26 to 28 November 2025. Christchurch City is vibrant and full of life, offering a rich mix of colour, atmosphere, and world-class attractions like the International Antarctic Centre, Orana Park, and Willowbank Wildlife Park. Often called the Garden City for its stunning gardens, Christchurch is also a hub for excellent cafes, bars, and restaurants. Additionally, breathtaking destinations such as Kaikoura, Akaroa, Mt Hutt, and South Canterbury are all within a two-hour drive, making it the perfect gateway for exploration. 
 ITNAC Focus Topics 
 With the increasing focus on modelling and simulation in the fields of cyber-networks, data mining, cyber security, distributed computing, mobile computing, cognitive computing, cloud computing, computing tools, applications, simulation tools, system performance and data and computer communications the demand for high quality research outcomes has never been greater. ITNAC has been the forum for researchers and engineers to present and discuss topics related to advanced computing and data communication network technologies, services and applications. 
 Novel contributions are presented in the form of keynote speeches by international experts, peer-reviewed technical papers, and posters. ITNAC 2025 seeks to address and capture highly innovative and state-of-the-art research from academia, industry and standardization bodies. 
 ITNAC 2025 is an international conference and forum for the presentation of research outcomes covering timely and relevant aspects concerning modelling and simulation of distributed, mobile, cognitive and cloud computing, computer and data communications, local and metropolitan networks, optical, wired and wireless telecommunication networks and applications. Contributions are welcome on all advanced research and particularly (but not limited to) on the following topics: 
 Wireline networks 
 Wireless networks 
 Modelling and Simulation 
 Cyber-Networks, Data Mining and Cyber-Security

 Internet and Communications Technologies 
 In the current and the envisioned future Internet, a variety of new technologies and applications is emerging. New networking architectures and design concepts are to be developed which consider interactions with the real world, as well as emerging issues like energy-efficiency or socio-economic aspects. A holistic view is necessary which takes into account the network of the Future, the Internet of services, media and enterprise Internet, but also the Internet of Things. However, there are still significant challenges for the theoretical understanding and on the deployment of Internet technologies. 
 The goal of the Internet technology track is to bring together people from academia and industry and to stimulate discussions on future Internet applications and future wireline and wireless Internet architectures to accelerate their development. We seek papers describing original, previously unpublished research results. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Emerging Technologies: 
 Virtualization technology and programmability of FI elements

 Optical Communications 
 Optical communication technologies will continue to be increasingly important in supporting the future Internet's expected scaling requirements of billions of users, their IT needs and aggregated huge bandwidths. Over the last two decades, optical communication technologies have increased the transmission capacity per fiber by several orders of magnitude, achieving Tbit/s transmissions. If the data traffic usage continues to increase at the current rate, a further increase in the transmission capacity of several orders of magnitude will be needed over the coming decades. This implies that future optical systems and networks should be able to support capacities well over Peta bit/s. However, the current technologies have already begun to reveal several fundamental limits; the electronic speed limit, the Shannon and quantum limit, and the IPbottleneck. The future technologies must overcome these limits ensuring sustainable growth of network traffic. The optical communications theme aims to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of significant progress of research, development and applications of cutting-edge technologies in optical communication devices, subsystems, systems and networks. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Next Generation Broadband Access Networks, Subsystems and Systems 
 Optical Ethernet, EPON/GPON, 10Gb/s Ethernet, 100Gb/s Ethernet

 Wireless Sensor Networks 
 The field of wireless sensor networks is now getting more and more mature, but new design concepts, experimental and theoretical findings, and applications continue to emerge at a rapid pace. Furthermore, there are still significant challenges for the theoretical understanding and practical application of sensor networks. 
 The goal of the sensor networking track is to bring together people from academia and industry who have interest in the area of wireless ad hoc and sensor networks. We seek papers describing original, previously unpublished research results. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Networking protocols: MAC, routing, transport, next generation 
 Cooperative communication approaches 
 Cross-layer design and optimization 
 Broadcasting, multicasting, geocasting 
 Quality-of-service, reliability and fault tolerance, coverage and connectivity 
 Security 
 Supplementary services: localization, time synchronization 
 Body sensor networks 
 Operating Systems and Software 
 Middleware and Macroprogramming 
 Information and query processing 
 Prototypes, field experiments, testbeds 
 Theoretical limits, network scaling 
 Novel applications 
 Networks and Management 
 Telecommunications and networking policy, regulation and management are an important aspect of deregulation and competition policy formulation. There are significant challenges for the development of an understanding of the dynamics of telecommunications markets. The introduction of solutions and case studies provide an opportunity to analyse outcomes and to learn from research into policy and management practices. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 General topics related to networks and applications 
 Broadband Network Management 
 Regional and Remote Networks 
 Next generation network regulation 
 Communication technology fundamentals
