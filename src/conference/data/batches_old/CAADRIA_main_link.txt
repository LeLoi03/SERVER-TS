We kindly remind you to adhere to the template guidelines to ensure a smooth publication process. Pay attention to correct grammatical and syntax conventions, and special attention to using CAADRIA word styles correctly, such as the "CAADRIA Text First" style for the first paragraph of each section. Check that the white box at the bottom of the first page is correctly positioned. Additionally, ensure that your figures are of high quality and suitable for printing. Lastly, double-check the authors and publication data, as no further modifications will be permitted. 
 CAADRIA 2025 also offers additional opportunities for participation. We encourage you to submit a poster for the project exhibition to showcase your work. Furthermore, Master’s and PhD students are invited to apply to present their research at the Postgraduate Student Consortium, where they will receive valuable feedback. Additionally, applications for the Young CAADRIA Award are open to all registered students (undergraduate and postgraduate) with an accepted paper. Awardees will receive a waiver for their conference registration fee. The submission deadline for all three opportunities is January 15, 2025.

CAADRIA 2025 invites contributions in line with the 2025 Conference Theme of "Architectural Informatics" 
 The concepts of architecture and cities are historically intrinsic to human civilization, as a consciousness of mankind's need to construct artificial environments. However, decades after the advent of computers, we are now reconsidering their existence against the backdrop of the rapid expansion and evolution of information technology and its profound impact on industry, the economy, daily life, and society. 
 The quantum acceleration of information processing and communication has had a profound impact on the design of all kinds of artifacts, production techniques, management systems, and usage patterns, and has already surpassed the traditional concept of design and its support methods. By considering social activities and human organizations as forms of information processing, we can reconsider architecture and cities as information systems that have been constructed, accumulated, and acted upon. Viewing architecture and cities through this lens suggests that real and virtual spaces should not be seen as opposing entities, but rather as complementary components within a unified system. 
 In other words, information may be architecture. With “Architectural Informatics” as the theme of CAADRIA's 30th anniversary, we would like to reexamine the fundamental existence of architecture in the age of information technology. 
 ​We invite original high-quality papers presenting current computer-aided architectural design research, accommodating a broad spectrum of approaches ranging from speculative, informal investigations to conventional scientific research, including but not limited to the following topics: 
 ​ 
 Artificial intelligence, neural networks and machine learning 
 Building Information Modeling (BIM) 
 City Information Modeling (CIM) 
 Collective, collaborative & interdisciplinary design 
 Computational design research & education 
 Design cognition and human-computer interaction 
 Disrupted practices, resilience, and social sustainability 
 Environmental and ecological performance 
 Generative, algorithmic & evolutionary design 
 Digital Heritage 
 Interactive environments 
 Material systems, processes and assembly 
 Practice-based design research 
 Robotics, digital fabrication and construction 
 Simulation, visualisation and impact projection 
 Theory, philosophy & methodology of computational design research 
 Urban analytics, big data analysis and smart cities 
 AR / VR / XR 
 Application of technology in the context of the Asia-Pacific Region 
 Paper acceptance will be subject to a two-stage reviewing process, based on an initial abstract review and a later double-blind peer review of full-length manuscripts. The paper publication will be subject to review acceptance, compliance with submission deadlines and formatting guidelines, and to payment of the conference registration fee. Please kindly note that multiple submissions are subject to multiple registrations.
