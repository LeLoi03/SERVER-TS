History 
 ICFCA, CLA and ICCS are three highly relevant conferences in the field of formal concept analysis (FCA) and related areas. All three conferences contribute significantly to advancing the understanding and application of formal concept analysis. In particular: 
 href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/program?id=1363" - ICFCA stands for the International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis . This conference serves as a platform for researchers working on formal concept analysis to present their latest findings, exchange ideas, and discuss advancements in the field. 
 CLA refers to Concept Lattices and Their Applications . This conference series primarily focuses on the theoretical foundations, algorithms, and applications of formal concept analysis and concept lattices. 
 ICCS stands for the International Conference on Conceptual Structures . While not exclusively focused on formal concept analysis, ICCS explores conceptual structures and related theories, including formal concept analysis, ontology, knowledge representation, and semantic technologies. 
 On October 2023, representatives of the three conferences approved the merging of the three conferencesICFCA,CLA and ICCSand creating a new joint event, theInternational Joint Conference on Conceptual Knowledge Structures (CONCEPTS).This merger aimed to create a unified and comprehensive forum for researchers, academics, and professionals from various disciplines interested in formal concept analysis, conceptual structures, and related fields to exchange ideas, present their research, and discuss the latest advancements in these areas. For this purpose, the overall organization of CONCEPTS will follow the existing rules and traditions of the three conferences.

 Caution: there are some FAKE conferences that pretend to be ICFCA or ICCS conferences. The real ICFCA and ICCS conferences do not exist anymore. Fake conferences can be easily recognised because they do not have any FCA researchers on their committees. Furthermore, an internet search for the website domain name and "scam" or "fake" will provide evidence of the fake nature.

 12th International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis 
 Cluj-Napoca, Romania 
 June 10 – 13, 2014 
 Introduction 
 Formal Concept Analysis emerged in the 1980’s from attempts to restructure lattice theory in order to promote better communication between lattice theorists and potential users of lattice theory. Since its early years, Formal Concept Analysis has developed into a research field in its own right with a thriving theoretical community and a rapidly expanding range of applications in information and knowledge processing including visualization, data analysis (mining) and knowledge management. 
 The conference aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on theoretical or applied aspects of Formal Concept Analysis within major related areas such as Mathematics and Computer and Information Sciences and their diverse applications to fields like Software Engineering, Linguistics, Life and Social Sciences, etc.
