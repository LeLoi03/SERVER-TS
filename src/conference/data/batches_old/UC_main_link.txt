 22th International Conference on 
 Unconventional Computing and Natural Computing 
 September 1-5, 2025 in Nice, France 
 TheInternational Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation(UCNC) series is a forum bringing together scientists from many different backgrounds who are united in their interest in novel forms of computation, human-designed computation inspired by nature, and computational aspects of natural processes. UCNC provides a forum for such scientists to meet and discuss their work. The 22nd International Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation (UCNC 2025)will be held at the Université Côte d'Azur, Valrose Campus, Nice, Franceon September 1-5, 2025and will continue the tradition of focusing on current important theoretical and experimental results and their critical evaluation.

 22th International Conference on 
 Unconventional Computing and Natural Computing 
 September 1-5, 2025 in Nice, France 
 Proceedings 
 The conference proceedings will be published by Springer Verlag in theLecture Notes in Computer Scienceseries and will be availablesoonafterthe conference. 
 Paper categories 
 The are four submission categories: 
  
 regular papers: | they contain original research not yet communicated to other conference or any journal. Regular papers should not exceed 15 pages. 
  
 short papers: | they are intended for communicating fresh new original research which is not yet complete or still need some development. Short papers should not exceed 6 pages. 
  
 late-breaking abstract | are informal presentations of new research and/or research direction proposals. In this category may fall also the communication of research already appeared in other conferences with the purpose of further dissemination of results or research directions. They should not exceed 3 pages. 
  
 posters: | Posters should be one page in A0 format (plus 1 page abstract). 
  
 Only accepted regular and short papers will appear in the LNCS proceedings. All paper categories will go through a review process suitable for the given category. 
 Authors Guidelines 
 Submitted papers must describe work not previously published, and they must neither be accepted nor under review at a journal or at another conference with refereed proceedings. 
 Paper preparation 
 Authors are required to submit their manuscripts electronically in PDF using the LNCS style. Authors using LaTeX can download the needed macros atSpringer-Verlag site. Papers should respect the page limits announced above; full proofs may appear in a clearly marked technical appendix which can be read by the reviewers. 
  
 The submission process is completely managed via the EasyChair website. Please use the following submission URL:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ucnc2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ucnc2025
Preparing the final version for the proceedings 
 The final versions of accepted papers must be formatted in LaTeX usingSpringer-Verlag's Lecture Notes style. Authors might use up to 15 pages, if the implementation of the corrections requested by the reviewers requires additional space. Please also consult thehref="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/editor-guidelines-for-springer-proceedings" - Instructions for Authors
provided by Springer. The final version should be uploaded on the Easychair website in zipped format containing the following 
 • The final source files, including bib files, images, non-standard LaTeX packages, etc. 
 • A final PDF file correspondingexactlyto the final source files. 
 • A license-to-publish agreement, signed by hand by the corresponding author on behalf of all of the authors of the paper. 
  
 Moreover, if appropriate, please also give us a suggestion for an abbreviated running head, and information about the correct representation of authors’ names, where necessary. 
  
 Please make sure that you follow the standards set out inhref="https://www.springer.com/us/authors-editors/book-authors-editors/your-publication-journey/publishing-integrity" - Springer's code of conduct
. 
  
 Important.At least one author of each accepted paper, late-breaking abstract and poster has to register, attend the conference and present the work. 
  
 Special issue 
 A special issue of the international journalNatural Computingwill be organized after the conference containing a selection of articles presented at the conference. They will be substantially extended version of the papers presented at the conference and will undergo an independent peer review process.
