 11th IEEE International Conference on Network Softwarization 
 News and Announcements 
 Welcome to IEEE NetSoft 2025The 11th IEEE International Conference on Network Softwarization (IEEE NetSoft 2025) will be held in Budapest, Hungary, from 23 June to 27 June, 2025. Network Softwarization refers to the transition of traditional network infrastructure and functionalities, provided via hardware appliances developed by equipment and service vendors, to new ones that have been propelled over the last 15 years by the maturity of widespread technologies such as network function virtualization, software-defined networking, and service function chaining. In particular, the ability to program, manage, and operate network and service infrastructures more freely makes it possible to reinvent network and cloud architectures, customize services, accelerate service deployment, and facilitate greater operational efficiencies with guarantees.

 “Sustainable and secure networks for distributed AI and compute” 
 11th IEEE International Conference on Network Softwarization 
 23-27 June 2025 – Budapest, Hungary 
 IEEE NetSoft, the premier International Conference on Network Softwarization, addresses advanced research challenges and opportunities raised by the overall transformation trend of network 
 “softwarization,” which has been revolutionizing the networking field and has accelerated its convergence with adjacent industries. 
 Network Softwarization refers to the transition from legacy network infrastructures and functionalities traditionally provided via hardware appliances to new ones provided via software. This technology has become feasible with the maturity of network function virtualization, software-defined networking, and service function chaining in the last 16 years. In particular, the ability to program, manage, and operate network and service infrastructures more freely makes it possible to reinvent network & cloud architectures, customize services, accelerate service deployment, and facilitate greater operational efficiency. This is even more relevant nowadays, as network infrastructures and service deployment technologies are challenged by the growing interest in distributed Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computing solutions. The need for further advances in these topics is reflected in the overall theme of NetSoft 2025:Sustainable and secure networks for distributed AI and compute. 
 NetSoft 2025 will feature technical paper presentations, keynotes, panels, tutorials, workshops, demos, posters and PhD symposiums from world-leading experts representing service providers, vendors, research institutes, open-source projects, and academia.

 PAPER SUBMISSION 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit high-quality original technical papers for presentation at the conference and publication in the NetSoft 2025 Proceedings. All submissions must be written in English and must use the standard IEEE two-column conference template that can be downloaded from: 
 https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html. 
 Technical Papers can be of two types: Full or Short papers, up to 9 and 5 pages respectively, including references and all other material.If accepted, a paper will be published in the category (long/short) of its submission. Long papers are the more traditional form for presenting technical work. Long papers should emphasize not only novelty and vision, but execution and thoroughness of the contribution (design, evaluation). Short papers are the preferred vehicle for visionary papers or traditional technical papers whose description fits within a smaller number of pages. Short papers may not yet be ‘fully baked’ in terms of execution and evaluation. In both Full and Short papers, author names and affiliations should be included after the title, as provided in the templates. 
 Papers submitted should describe original, previously unpublished research results, not currently under review by another conference or journal. Papers not meeting the length and formatting requirements, or violating IEEE’s guidelines on plagiarized content will be rejected without review. All other papers will be reviewed. Selected papers for NetSoft 2025 may be conditionally accepted and subjected to shepherding before final acceptance. Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all manuscripts must be electronically submitted through EDAS.
