 Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Graduate Students, Faculty, and Staff Celebrate Diversity in Computing and Technology at the Tapia Conference 
 Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Graduate Students, Faculty, and Staff Celebrate Diversity in Computing and Technology at the Tapia Conference 
 October 10, 2024Two electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) graduate students, Nathalie Uwamahoro (electrical engineering) and Polina Kozyreva (computer science) attended the prestigious 2024 CMD-IT/ACM Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference in San Diego, California. Known for its emphasis on diversity, inclusion, and collaboration in computing, the conference provided invaluable educational, professional, and networking opportunities for students and professionals alike. 
 The three-day event featured technical workshops, expert panels, and a robust career fair with major companies like Google, Microsoft, and IBM. For Uwamahoro and Kozyreva, the Tapia conference opened doors to new professional connections and deepened their understanding of key topics such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, next-generation computing, and robotics. 
 “Being at the booth and engaging with people interested in graduate school or research was a fantastic opportunity to learn about the diverse projects my peers are working on. This conference reaffirmed my passion for academia, and I’m eager to contribute to this vibrant community in the future,” says Kozyreva. 
 “Attending the Tapia conference for the first time was an unforgettable experience. It strengthened my commitment to inspiring students of African descent to pursue careers in technology,” Uwamahoro adds. 
 The conference also saw participation from the College of Engineering and Computer Science’s Senior Associate Dean for Faculty Affairs and Academic Initiatives, Jae C. Oh and Recruitment Specialist, Michaela Karcher. They were involved in initiatives such as the LEAP Alliance, aimed at increasing diversity in EECS doctoral programs and strengthening the future faculty pipeline. ECS is a Cohort 3 member of the LEAP Alliance and Jae Oh and EECS professor Jason Pollack areLEAP Advocate Faculty. At the conference, LEAP Alliance Fellows and Faculty Advocates got together to share ideas about Broadening Participation in Computer Science Ph.D. programs. 
 EECS Professor Farzana Rahman is a long-time TPC member of the Tapia conference. Rahman spearheaded the EECS representation at the conference alongside Assistant Dean for Student Recruitment, Kathleen M. Joyce and her team, highlighting the department’s commitment to inclusive education, research, and faculty hiring. 
 Karcher also developed a list of potential graduate applicants interested in learning more about EECS programs. “This was my first computer science-focused conference, and it was eye-opening to see the many opportunities available,” she says. 
 The Tapia conference has strengthened Syracuse University’s presence in the computing world, with students returning to campus energized and committed to shaping the future of technology through inclusivity and innovation.

 Tapia Conference: How It Began 
 In the 1990s, there were several discussions about having a conference focused on diversity. At that time, in tech there was theGrace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing Conference, organized by Anita Borg and Telle Whitney. In 2000, Valerie Taylor, Bryant York, Richard Alo and a few other computing professionals strategized about launching a conference focused on diversity, modeled after the Grace Hopper Conference; they had close ties with Anita Borg and Telle Whitney. The group brainstormed and agreed that the event’s title should emphasize the “Celebration of Diversity in Computing” aspect to celebrate the current diversity as well as advocate for increased diversity in tech. 
 During this strategy meeting, it was agreed to name the conference afterhref="https://tapiaconference.cmd-it.org/about/who-is-richard-tapia/" - Richard Tapia
, because of his strong record of accomplishments in the sectors of science and diversity. This meeting was held in Chicago as part of a leadership meeting for the Coalition to Diversity Computing (CDC), which was a joint organization ofACM,CRA, andIEEE-CS. CDC merged with CMD-IT in 2016, at the request of the CDC leadership. 
 The first Tapia Conference was held October 18-20, 2001 in Houston, Texas with 164 attendees. Valerie Taylor and Richard Alo served as the first General Co-Chairs with significant involvement from Bryant York, Ann Redelfs, Theresa Chatman, and Cynthia Lanius. The conference has grown to include thousands of diverse attendees, with strong engagement from academia, industry, and government labs. 
 Tapia Conference: Now 
 The Tapia Conference provides an opportunity for attendees to hear about current topics in tech, learn about effective strategies for success in professional careers from diverse perspectives, pursue career opportunities in tech, seek opportunities for graduate studies, and work together to increase diversity in computing.
