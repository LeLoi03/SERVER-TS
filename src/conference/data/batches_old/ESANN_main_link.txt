 Scope and topics 
 Since its first happening in 1993, the European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks has become the reference for researchers on fundamentals and theoretical aspects of artificial neural networks, computational intelligence, machine learning and related topics. Each year, around 100-140 specialists attend ESANN, in order to present their latest results and comprehensive surveys, and to discuss the future developments in this field. 
 The ESANN 2025 conference will follow this tradition, while adapting its scope to the recent developments in the field. The ESANN conferences cover artificial neural networks, machine learning, statistical information processing and computational intelligence. Mathematical foundations, algorithms and tools, and applications are covered. 
 Papers will be presented orally (single track) and in poster sessions; all posters will be complemented by a short oral presentation during a plenary session. The selection of papers will differentiate between oral and posters presentations according to the topics, and not to the level of quality. 
 The following is a non-exhaustive list of machine learning, computational intelligence and artificial neural networks topics covered during the ESANN conferences: 
 Neural networks; Deep learning; Kernel machines; Signal processing and modeling; Transfer learning; Graphical models, EM and Bayesian learning; Classification and clustering; Vector quantization and self-organizing maps; Recurrent networks and dynamical systems; Time series forecasting; Single- and zero-shot learning; Ensemble learning; Feature selection; Graphs and networks: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction; manifold learning; Statistical and mathematical aspects of learning; Trustworthy AI; Image processing; Natural Language Processing; Data mining; Machine learning for signal processing; Multimodal interfaces and multichannel processing; Vision and sensory systems; Data visualization; Identification of non-linear dynamical systems; Machine learning for healthcare; Evolutionary computation for machine learning; Bioinformatics; Bio-inspired systems; Brain-computer interfacesSpecial sessions 
 href="http://esann-new.ipseite.com/node/4" - Special sessions
will be organized by renowned scientists in their respective fields. Papers submitted to these sessions are reviewed according to the same criteria as the submissions to the regular sessions. Authors who submit a paper to one of these sessions are invited to mention it on the author submission form. Submissions to regular and special sessions follow identical format, instructions, deadlines and procedures. 
 See thehref="https://www.esann.org/special-sessions" - special sessions
page for details about the special sessions organized during ESANN 2025. 
 Talks and posters 
 Accepted papers are presented either as talks or posters. Authors may indicate their preference at submission; however as ESANN is a single-track conference, the number of slots for talks is limited. All poster presentations are coupled to a one-minute spotlight oral presentation during a plenary session; poster presentations increase the interaction with participants. 
 There is no difference in scientific quality between talks and posters. The reviewing and selection processes are identical. In addition all full papers are published in the same way in the proceedings, regardless of the mode of presentation. 
 Deadline 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit their contributions before 20.11.2024.
