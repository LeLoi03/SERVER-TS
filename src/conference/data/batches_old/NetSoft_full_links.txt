 11th IEEE International Conference on Network Softwarization 
 News and Announcements 
 Welcome to IEEE NetSoft 2025The 11th IEEE International Conference on Network Softwarization (IEEE NetSoft 2025) will be held in Budapest, Hungary, from 23 June to 27 June, 2025. Network Softwarization refers to the transition of traditional network infrastructure and functionalities, provided via hardware appliances developed by equipment and service vendors, to new ones that have been propelled over the last 15 years by the maturity of widespread technologies such as network function virtualization, software-defined networking, and service function chaining. In particular, the ability to program, manage, and operate network and service infrastructures more freely makes it possible to reinvent network and cloud architectures, customize services, accelerate service deployment, and facilitate greater operational efficiencies with guarantees.

 The 10thhref="https://netsoft2024.ieee-netsoft.org/about" - IEEE International Conference on Network Softwarization
(IEEE NetSoft 2024) was held inSaint Louis, MO, USA, from 24 June to 28 June, 2024.The General Chairs,Flavio EspositoandJanise McNair, and the Technical Program Chairs, Chiara Contoli, Reza Tourani, and Augusto Neto, are pleased to welcome you to St. Louis, which is the second-largest city in Missouri, United States. It is located near the confluence of the Mississippi and the Missouri rivers. The conference was hosted bySaint Louis University (SLU), a private research university founded in 1818, it is the oldest university west of the Mississippi River and has a long history of academic excellence and innovation. 
 Network Softwarization refers to the transition of traditional network infrastructure and functionalities, provided via hardware appliances developed by equipment and service vendors, to new ones that have been propelled over the last 15 years by the maturity of widespread technologies such as network function virtualization, software-defined networking, and service function chaining. In particular, the ability to program, manage, and operate network and service infrastructures more freely makes it possible to reinvent network and cloud architectures, customize services, accelerate service deployment, and facilitate greater operational efficiencies with guarantees. The need for further advances in these topics is reflected in the overall theme of NetSoft 2024: “Softwarized Networks in the Age of Generative AI”. 
 NetSoft 2024 featured technical paper presentations, keynotes, tutorials, workshops, demos, posters, and exhibitions from world-leading experts representing service providers, vendors, research institutes, open-source projects, and academia. .
