 Use of LLM generated text 
 For ESWC 2025, we adhere to the principles and guidelines stated in thehref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship" - ACM Policy on Authorship
specifically about “Criteria for Authorship” regarding the use of Generative AI technologies for authoring papers: “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work. (…) Basic word processing systems that recommend and insert replacement text, perform spelling or grammar checks and corrections, or systems that do language translations are to be considered exceptions to this disclosure requirement and are generally permitted and need not be disclosed in the Work. As the line between Generative AI tools and basic word processing systems like MS-Word or Grammarly becomes blurred, this Policy will be updated.” 
 In case of any questions regarding this policy, please contact the organizing committee.
