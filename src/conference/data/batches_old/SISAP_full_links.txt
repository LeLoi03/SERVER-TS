18th International Conference on 
 Similarity Search and Applications, SISAP 2025 
 The International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications (SISAP) is an annual forum for researchers and application developers in the area of similarity data management. It aims at the technological problems shared by numerous application domains, such as data mining, information retrieval, multimedia retrieval, computer vision, pattern recognition, computational biology, geography biometrics, machine learning, and many others that need similarity searching as a necessary supporting service. Please see thehref="./callforpapers.html" - call for papers
for more details. 
 SISAP 2025 also features adoctoral symposium. If you are a PhD student, please consider submitting a paper about your project. 
 The SISAP initiative (href="https://www.sisap.org/" - www.sisap.org
) is a forum to exchange real-world, challenging and innovative examples of applications, new indexing techniques, common test-beds and benchmarks, source code and up-to-date literature through its web page, serving the similarity search community. Traditionally, SISAP puts emphasis on the distance-based searching, but in general the conference concerns both the effectiveness and efficiency aspects of any similarity search problem. 
 SISAP is recognized as aCORE Bconference. The series started in 2008 as a workshop and has developed over the years into an international conference withSpringer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)proceedings. You can find links to past SISAP proceedings onhref="https://link.springer.com/conference/sisap" - SpringerLink
. 
 A small selection of the best papers presented at the conference will be recommended for inclusion in a special issue ofElsevierInformation Systems. These extended versions will be subject to a second round of peer review at the journal. 
 There will be aBest Paper Award. The best papers will be recognized with a certificate and a monetary prize, thanks toSpringer's sponsorship. 
 SISAP 2025 will take place atReykjavik University (RU) Reykjavik, Iceland.More details will be published soon on this webpage.

Call for Demonstrations - SISAP 2025 
 18th International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications 
 Reykjavik, Iceland, October 1-3, 2025 
 Important Dates 
 Demonstration Paper deadline: June 6, 2025 (AoE) 
 Paper notification: July 10, 2025 (AoE)

 Conference: October 1-3, 2025 
 Call for Demonstration Submissions 
 We, the organizers of SISAP 2025, cordially invite authors to submit novel and compelling demonstrations on any of ourtopic of interest. As we are seeking to maximize the on-site impact and experience for our attendees the demonstration submissions will be evaluated not only on novelty and academic impact but also on the interestingness and on-site impact. The evaluation criteria will include: novelty, technical advances and challenges, the overall practical attractiveness and potential on-site impact of the system.A demonstration submission shall consist of a paper (of up to 8 pages including references) and a mandatory additional appendix (1 page in PDF format) that shall explain and/or illustrate how the demonstration will be conducted on-site. This additional 1-page appendix will not be published in the conference proceedings but is important in the review process and for the organisation of the demonstration session. Demonstration papers will be peer-reviewed in a single-blind review process. 
 The conference will provide a table, power outlet, a screen, wireless (shared) internet and a poster board. If authors have special needs (e.g., extra space, specific furniture etc.), please include all such information in the 1-page appendix and we will try to accommodate as best we can. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 Authors should submit two separate files– one for the paper (uploaded to the ‘Paper’ field) and one for the appendix (uploaded to the ‘Additional Information’ field)- in PDF through the EasyChair conference management system:href=" https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=sisap2025
