 Abstract 
 This article explores the transformative potential of quantum technology in community services, emphasising quantum sensing, quantum computing algorithms, and quantum communication. Community services, spanning healthcare, education, and environmental conservation, are crucial for resident well-being. Quantum technology, rooted in principles like superposition and entanglement, is presented as a game-changer. Quantum sensing offers unparalleled precision, benefiting environmental monitoring, traffic management, and healthcare diagnostics. Quantum computing algorithms, leveraging qubits, promise breakthroughs in resource allocation, data analysis, and telecommunications optimisation. Quantum communication, particularly quantum key distribution, ensures secure data transmission, safeguarding sensitive information in fields like finance and healthcare. The article envisions a future where quantum technology optimises community services, fostering data accuracy, speed, and privacy. The collaborative incorporation of quantum technology into ICT infrastructure is crucial for realising these advancements and enhancing community well-being. The recommendations stress enhancing ICT infrastructure for seamless quantum technology integration. Quantum-safe encryption, high-speed communication networks, and quantum-ready data centres are crucial. Collaboration among stakeholders is deemed essential for identifying applications and ensuring comprehensive integration.

 Abstract 
 Recent developments in digital technology domains like Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things lead to possibilities for more autonomous systems that more directly interact with their business or social environment. This poses new but often implicit questions with respect to the responsibility for decisions made by these systems and the effects of these decisions on their environment. Requirements embedded in design considerations like security constraints, privacy regulations, and traceability demands, however, imply explicit questions with respect to responsibility in information processing. Responsibility may be expected from four different classes of actors: the system itself, the system designer, the system user, and the party whose data is managed by the system, i.e., the object of the system. This paper presents the questions regarding the allocation of responsibility with the development and deployment of autonomous systems, based on requirements imposed by their application context. The discussion of the effect of explainability of decisions on the allocation of responsibility is an essential ingredient here. We provide the necessary concepts and models to make a first analysis and design of the allocation of responsibility.
