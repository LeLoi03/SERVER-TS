 ABOUT PLoP 
 The International Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, People & Practices 
 Pattern Languages of Programs (PLoP) conference is a premier event for pattern enthusiasts to gather, discuss, and learn. Originally focused on software-related patterns and pattern languages, PLoP has expanded into all aspects of the built world—anything that is designed and made by people, including organizations, culture, and individual practice. 
 PLoP 2025 welcomes paper authors and nonauthors alike! Writers Workshops offer authors feedback on their papers while Imagination Run Wild sessions offer everyone, including nonauthors, a chance to share in a variety of session formats. 
 PLoP brings together practitioners and researchers whose interests span a broad range of topics, but all of whom share an interest in exploring the power of patterns. PLoP invites you to add your expertise to the growing body of patterns. At PLoP we focus on improving the written expression of patterns (both their form and content) through writers’ workshops. We also welcome workshops and presentations under the umbrella of “let your imagination run wild” sessions, which as the title suggests, are limited only by your imagination. Proposals may be in the form of a workshop, presentation, lightening talk, or whatever. Bring it on! 
 Whether you’re a pattern novice, an expert, interested in sharing, or curious about learning, you are welcome to contribute to the PLoP 2025 program with a paper and/or an “Imagination Run Wild” session.

 IMAGINATION RUN WILD IS BACK! 
 Since we had such a great response last year, in addition to Writers’ Workshops, PLoP 2025 will have a variety of other sessions under the umbrella of “Imagination Run Wild.” These sessions offer everyone, including newcomers, an opportunity to learn about patterns and related topics. 
 If you are new to patterns, this is your year to attend PLoP. The conference welcomes pattern authors and nonauthors – old friends and newcomers – pattern experts and the patterns curious – come one, come all. Regardless of what you do at PLoP, you will have a fun and engaging time!

What Past Attendees 
 Are Saying 
 Ceci Fernandes 
 I left PLoP 2023 feeling nourished with good thoughts, good energy from peer attendees, powerful metaphors (that I couldn’t wait to use at work), and a sense of community connection. It was my first PLoP and I felt more than welcome at all times!“ 
  
 Indu Alagarsamy 
 I attended my very first PLoP conference last year. It was unlike any other conference I’ve attended. It was vibrant, and I participated in many activities, such as Writers’ Workshops, Games, and Focus Groups, where I could participate meaningfully. It was a wonderful experience that brought diverse people from various industries and countries together to collectively solve problems and learn from one another to contribute to each of our industries.” 
 Marden Neubert 
 I had a wonderful experience at my first PLoP conference last year. It was an incredible opportunity to connect with many renowned authors of patterns. Participating in the writers’ workshop allowed me to assist other pattern writers from diverse cultures in improving their pattern writing.” 
 HISTORY 
 The PLoP Conference 
 The Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, People, and Practices (PLoP) was established thirty years ago by The Hillside Group. It gathers people who wish to improve the quality of life through designing and using social and technical systems in a more humane way, effectively articulating professional and other creative practices, and sharing this tacit knowledge more broadly. To achieve this, the conference promotes the use of patterns and pattern languages, as well as the underlying theory of the nature of order. 
 Originating in the work of Christopher Alexander on building architecture, these ideas have been further developed in computer science, fundamentally changing the perception of software development. Much of the pioneering work in this area originated at this and other PLoP conferences throughout the world. Patterns and pattern languages have expanded to many other areas, including art, well-being, learning, psychology, organizational development and change, sociology, and anthropology. PLoP encourages a variety of submissions regardless of the area they target. 
 MISSION 
 The Hillside Group 
 The mission of the Hillside Group is to improve the quality of life and society as a whole. This includes architects, developers, managers, owners, workers, educators, students, and more. Understanding and helping the human element is critical for achieving success. The Hillside Group believes in making processes and design more humane by paying attention to real people and existing practices. 
 The Hillside Group promotes the use of patterns and pattern languages to record, analyze, and share knowledge to help achieve its mission. The Hillside Group sponsors a variety of activities to achieve this mission—organizing workshops, hosting PLoP (pattern) conferences, and producing publications for discussing, recording, and documenting successful practices.
