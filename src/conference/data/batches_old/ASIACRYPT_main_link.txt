 Schedule 
 Asiacrypt 2025 will operate a two-round review system with rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee selects a subset of submissions for further consideration in the second round, and the authors receive the first round notification with review comments. The authors of the selected submissions are invited to submit a text-based rebuttal letter to the review comments. 
 In the second round, the program committee further reviews the selected submissions by taking into account their rebuttal letter, acting on all answers of questions issued as pertinent to the decision. The PC chairs make the final decision of acceptance or rejection in consultation with the area chairs and the reviewers. Submissions that have not been selected during the first round of reviews may be resubmitted in other conferences after the first round notification date. 
 Artifacts 
 In order to encourage open and reproducible research, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts associated with their papers, such as software or datasets, for review. The artifact review will be a collaborative process between authors and the artifact review committee. The goal of the process is not just to evaluate artifacts, but also to improve them for reproduction and reusability by the scientific community. 
 Artifacts that pass successfully through the artifact review process will be archived onIACR's artifact archive. With comparable merit priority will be given to papers with machine-verified proofs.Please see the detailed call for artifacts (TBA). The Best Practical Paper must have an accepted artifact. 
 Stipends & awards 
 Students whose papers have been accepted, who will present their talks at the conference, and contact the general chair in a timely fashion will have their registration waived. The primary source of information is the conference website, however, a limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students, whose papers are accepted and who will present the paper themselves, or from groups who are underrepresented at Asiacrypt at least in the last decade are especially encouraged to apply. Requests for stipends should go to the general chair. 
 The program chairs may in consultation with the PC choose to bestow two best (theory and practical) paper awards, and a best early-career paper award.
