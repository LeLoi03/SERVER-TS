 MEMOCODE: ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Formal Methods and Models for System Design 
 Over the last decade, the boundaries between computer system components, such as hardware, software, firmware, middleware, and applications, have blurred. This evolution in system design and development practices led in 2014 to a change in the title and scope of the MEMOCODE conference from its original focus on hardware/software co-design to its new focus on formal methods and models for developing computer systems and their components. MEMOCODE’s objective is to emphasize the importance of models and methodologies in correct system design and development, and to bring together researchers and industry practitioners interested in all aspects of computer system development, to exchange ideas, research results and lessons learned.

 Call for Papers 
 MEMOCODE brings together researchers and practitioners interested in formal methods for system design and development, to exchange ideas, research results and lessons learned. The symposium focuses on the foundations and applications of formal methods in the development of hardware, firmware, middleware, and application software for systems, ranging from single embedded devices to highly networked cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things. 
 Topics of Interest 
 MEMOCODE solicits research papers on formal methods in system design that address the foundations, engineering methods, tools, or experimental case studies. Research areas of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Modeling Languages, Methods, and Tools | Programming languages and models; software and system modeling languages; architecture and high-level hardware description languages; timing models; model and program synthesis methods; model transformation methods. 
 Formal Methods and Tools | Correct-by-construction methods; contract-based design and verification; static, dynamic, and type theoretic analysis; verification; validation; probabilistic model checking; test generation; refinement-based and compositional approaches to design and verification. 
 Models and Methods for Developing Critical Systems | Fault-tolerant systems; security-critical and safety-critical systems; cyber-physical systems; hybrid systems; autonomous systems; self-adapting systems; systems that merge humans, artificial intelligence, and cyber-physical systems; societal-scale cyber-physical systems, such as connected vehicles and smart grids. 
 Quantitative/Qualitative Reasoning | Power/performance/cost/latency estimation methods; system models for quantitative design space exploration 
 Formal Methods/Models in Practice | Design case studies; empirical case studies

 Abstract submission deadline:May 27, 2024May 6, 2024 
 Paper submission deadline:May 27, 2024May 20, 2024 
 Notification of acceptance:Jul 12, 2024Jul 08, 2024 
 Final version of papers:Aug 05, 2024Jul 29, 2024 
 Conference: Oct 3-4, 2024 
 MEMOCODE'24 is a part ofESWEEK 2024, which will take place in Raleigh, USA. Registered attendees can attend sessions in any of the online events, including the conferences (CASES, CODES+ISSS, EMSOFT), symposia, tutorials, workshops, and education classes.Submissions 
 MEMOCODE'24 calls for three kinds of submissions: regular papers, work-in-progress papers, and tool presentations. All papers must be written in English and formatted according to theIEEE Computer Society guidelines. Adouble-blind review processwill be enforced. Authors must not reveal their identity directly or indirectly. Submission of papers is handled viahref="https://memocode24.hotcrp.com" - HotCRP
. 
 Regular papers | are no longer than 10 pages, excluding bibliography and appendices. They should describe original work that does not overlap with another publication or a submission under review or accepted for publication by any other conference or journal. Reviewers will check regular papers for the soundness and novelty of the proposed solutions. 
 Tool papers | are no longer than 8 pages, excluding bibliography and appendices. They should describe an existing and publicly available tool that implements relevant methods. The methods might have been published before, but the tool should not have been described in a tool paper previously. In addition to reviewing the paper, reviewers will assess the tool itself using inputs and a user's manual provided by the authors on the tool's web page. 
 Work-in-progress (WIP) papers | are no longer than 4 pages, excluding bibliography and appendices. They should describe ongoing work. Reviewers will judge the novelty of the idea, but do not yet expect proofs for the envisioned results. 
 For questions regarding technical submissions, feel free to contact one of the program committee co-chairs. All accepted papers (regular papers, WIP papers, and tool papers) will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore's scope and quality requirements. Publication in the proceedings is contingent on one author registering for and presenting the paper at the conference. We will also plan for a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems for which selected papers will be invited for publication. The Program Committee will also select 1-2 papers for the Best Paper Award.
