 The ECCO annual conference aim to bring together researchers in the field of Combinatorial Optimization to present their work, share experiences, and discuss recent advances in theory and applications. The primary objectives are: 
 exchanging results and experiences in solving real-world combinatorial optimization problems 
 reporting on development and implementation of appropriate models and efficient solution methods for combinatorial optimization problems 
 establishing networking contacts between individuals and research groups working on related topics 
 promoting the work on combinatorial optimization (theory and applications) to the broader scientific community 
 identifying challenging research problems for the field, as well as promising research outlets (both in theory and applications) 
 promoting interactions with researchers in other related fields 
 A special issue of theJournal of Combinatorial Optimizationwill be devoted to work presented at the conference. 
 All articles will be refereed according to the high standards of the journal. Details of the process will be given during the conference. | Important dates 
 - Abstract Extended Submission deadline :March 15, 2025
