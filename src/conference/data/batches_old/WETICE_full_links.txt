 Event Venue 
 Catania, Sicily, Italy 
 Catania has a long and eventful history, having been founded about 2750 years ago in a very fertile area at the foot of the biggest volcano in Europe, Mount Etna. The first Sicilian University and one of the oldest in Italy was founded here in 1434. The city hosts many archeological sites, museums, churches and theatres and is close to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Besides the rich history, the magnificient Baroque architecture and the black-lava landscape, Catania is also known for its typical street food and active nightlife. 
 University of Catania, at Benedictine Monastery of “San Nicolò 
 The conference venue is one of the most beautiful city historical buildings: the Benedictine Monastery of “San Nicolò”. At 10 minutes walk from the Catania main Cathedral square you find the Monastery of San Nicolò l’Arena, a late baroque monument and one of the biggest Benedictine monastery in Europe. The construction of the building started in 1500 and has continued until today. It is an example of architectonical integration of different styles through different epochs: you can find a roman house, the cloisters and a roof garden. The monastery is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It hosts the Department of Humanities (DISUM) of the University of Catania 
 Directions 
 From the Airport to the City Centre by bus 
 Catania-Fontanarossa Airport offers bus services to the city of Catania and other surrounding areas. Bus services tend to be much cheaper than taking a taxi, and many passengers prefer this economical option. 
 The city of Catania is only a few miles away from the airport, and buses leave the airport every roughly 20 minutes to reach the city center and the train station. Buses are available from 04:40 until half past midnight. This bus transport is provided by the AMT 'Alibus' service AMTS lines Catania. 
 Take note that all bus tickets, once used, should be validated, or stamped. This is usually done by the validating machines near the entrance of the buses. The machine will put a stamp and a date on your ticket to show that it has been used. Passengers of the bus must validate their own tickets, as they are not validated by the driver of the bus. 
  
 Subway 
 Get off in Piazza Stesicoro and walk until reaching the Monastery.
