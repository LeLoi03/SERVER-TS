 Program Preview 
 The core of the conference program are thewriters’ workshopswhere the accepted papers will be discussed. Additionally, we offer an Open Space format for the acceptedfocus groupproposals. The conference also contains many social activities to foster social networking. 
 Writers Workshops 
 This is where your paper is discussed during the conference. The workshops group together the authors of up to five papers that thematically fit together. Shortly before the conference begins, we will publish the paper-to workshop assignments. If you are an author, use this page to find which workshop you are assigned to.Non-authors, please use the same page to decide which group you would like to join throughout the conference. All participants should download, print and read all the papers in their group before the conference.EuroPLoP is the premier European conference on patterns and pattern languages. Design patterns are a unique and effective way to capture and share expertise, tacit knowledge and research findings. 
 href="/submission" - Submission
Unlike other conferences, EuroPLoP focuses on improving papers instead of only presenting them. Authors will receive high quality feedback in a constructive way during the shepherding process and during the workshops at the conference. The feedback can be used to improve submitted papers for final publication. 
 We hope to be able to organize the conference on-site, but this is subject to change, considering any restrictions imposed by Covid-19. EuroPLoP’s registration fee is normally 1111€ and covers all activities, accommodation, and food.
