Artificial Intelligence (AI) is deeply transforming working modes, opening new ways to achieve a very large diversity of operational tasks where human expertise and artificial intelligence work synergistically. In a worldwide interconnected economy, where collaboration is constantly re-inforced as a key pillar of development, the design, support, management and supervision of hybrid human-AI organization networks open strong scientific challenges. At the organizational level, hybrid intelligence requires (i) the integration of artificial systems in the redefinition of organizational and human goals, roles and skills distribution, (ii) the consistent alignment of AI with the ambition of human-centric organizations or (iii) the management of new hybrid collaborative processes including overcoming human-resistances. At the technological level, hybrid organization first require enhance interoperability at the level of cognitive processes with strong challenges of data quality and availability, scalability and adaptability of algorithms, as well as trust and transparency in decision making. 
 The 25 years of scientific background developed by PRO-VE in designing and managing collaborative networks stand as the basis to build hybrid collaborative intelligence. The multisciplinarity of the science of collaborative networks make possible addressing a range of organizational and technical challenges, each of which demands careful thought and innovative solutions. On the technical side, ensuring effective human-AI integration, scaling AI systems, and fostering trust are key hurdles. Organizationally, addressing the need for skills development, managing change, and creating governance frameworks are all critical components. Balancing these challenges while maintaining ethical standards is essential for long-term success. 
 PRO-VE 2025is a forum for sharing and discussing current developments and experiences regarding the role of collaborative networks in the age of synergic intelligence between human and AI. Contributions are invited from multiple and diverse disciplines such as Engineering, Managerial and Socio-Human sciences: industrial engineering, computer science, manufacturing, organization science, logistics, management, and social sciences, among others.

 Porto, known as Cidade Invicta (invincible city) and one of Europe's oldest tourist destinations, is the second largest city in Portugal, the capital of the Porto district and of the country's northern region. Its wealth of artistic heritage, Port Wine, open-air leisure spaces and cultural life are just some of the reasons to visit this city, whose Historical Centre was designated World Cultural Heritage in 1996. Its natural setting and its meandering streets give it a unique charm.
