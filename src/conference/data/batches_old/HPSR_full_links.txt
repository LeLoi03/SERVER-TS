 The 1st Annual IEEE Communications Society Demonstration Conference 
 Welcome to the 2025 IEEE 26th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR) 
 High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR) is an essential technology for today's high-speed, high-capacity data networks; HPSR has supported the wired and wireless network infrastructure of telecommunications carriers and Internet service providers. In these networks, new paradigms such as network virtualization, cloud edge computing, green networking, and the Internet of Things have emerged one after another, and HPSR has played an important role in each of them. In recent years, it has become especially important in data center networking. As artificial intelligence, especially large-scale language models, is expected to transform society, the need for switching and routing of huge amounts of traffic in data center networks has increased the importance of research and development of HPSR. The IEEE International Conference on HPSR has been held annually to date as a forum for the presentation of cutting-edge research results related to HPSR technology and the 26thedition will be held in Osaka, Japan from May 20 to May 22, 2025. We hope to contribute to the further development of the HPSR community through the presentation of cutting-edge research results on HPSR and heated discussions among participants. We are looking forward to receiving your contributions of cutting-edge research results on HPSR.

 Proposal Submission Instructions: 
 Workshop proposals should be submitted as a single PDF file by email to both Workshop Co-Chairs (see emails below). 
 Proposals that address exciting topics within the scope of IEEE HPSR in creative formats and with potential to generate lively interactions among participants will be given priority. Papers will be peer-reviewed and those accepted will be added to the proceeding of the IEEE HPSR proceedings and archived in IEEE Xplore. 
 Tentative Timeline: 
 Proposal Submission Deadline: March 15, 2024
