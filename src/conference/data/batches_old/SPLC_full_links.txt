 The Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC) is a premier forum where researchers, practitioners, and educators can present and discuss the most recent ideas, trends, experiences, and challenges in the area of software and system product lines engineering. Conference events include opportunities to hear industry leaders’ real-world experiences and researchers’ latest ideas and to learn from both. 
 The 29th ACM International Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC 2025) will be held atFacultade de Informática, Universidade da Coruña (A Coruña, Spain), from September 1st to 5th 2025. 
 The conference will include a highly selective program of research papers and industry papers, accompanied by keynote speeches, workshops, demonstrations, tutorials, panels, and doctoral symposium. Besides, SPLC 2025 advocates the discussion of challenges in the area of software and system product line engineering by adding a challenge track and encourage research discussion by a journal first track. We warmly welcome high quality papers, which describe original and unpublished research advancing the state of the art in software and system product line. We hope that SPLC 2025 can successfully bring an opportunity to hear and learn from both leaders’ real-world experiences and researchers’ latest ideas.
