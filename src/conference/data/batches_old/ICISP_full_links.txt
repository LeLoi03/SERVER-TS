 Welcome Message 
 Namaste! 
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee, our partners and volunteers, it is our pleasure to invite you to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025), which will take place in Hyderabad, India from April 06 to April 11, 2025. The 2025 edition of the flagship conference of the IEEE Signal Processing Society will be an in-person event held at the Hyderabad International Convention Centre. 
 This will be the first time an ICASSP is held in India and also marks the 50thanniversary of ICASSP. We are preparing a memorable event of high technical quality, many novel scientific activities, excellent networking opportunities, enjoyable social events, and unforgettable touristic possibilities. ICASSP’s main theme this year will be “Celebrating Signal Processing.” 
 Hyderabad is the capital of the Telangana state in southern India and has a unique legacy of rich multicultural history. Hyderabad’s historic sites include the Golconda Fort, a former diamond-trading centre that was once the capital of the Qutb Shahi dynasty. The Charminar, a 16th-century monument whose 4 arches support towering minarets, is an old city landmark. A major centre for the technology industry, it is home to most of the global technology giants. The city is also known for its unique delightful cuisine with the most famous Hyderabad biryani! 
 We look forward to welcoming you to this Celebration of Signal Processing and its immense contributions to and possibilities for enhancing human lives through technological advances at ICASSP 2025 in Hyderabad, India.
