 WARNING:We strongly advise booking your hotel rooms as soon as possible! An Iron Maiden concert is scheduled in Padua for the first day of conference (Sunday, July, 13, 2025). Accommodations are expected to fill up quickly. 

JoinSIGIR is the premier international forum for the presentation of new research results and for the demonstration of new systems and techniques in information retrieval. The conference consists of five days of full papers, short papers, resource & reproducibility papers, perspectives papers, system demonstrations, doctoral consortium, tutorials, and workshops focused on research and development in the area of information retrieval. 
  
 SIGIR 2025 is an in-person conference. Despite the challenges it may pose, we believe that an in-person conference is more beneficial in terms of direct engagement and networking opportunities, more dynamic exchange of research ideas, and welcoming and nurturing newcomers.

 Call for Full Papers 
 In Brief 
 The annual SIGIR conference is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results, and the demonstration of new systems and techniques, in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). The 48th ACM SIGIR conference, will be run as an in-person conference from July 13th to 18th, 2025 in Padua, Italy. For the full paper call, we welcome high-impact original papers with contributions related to any aspect of information retrieval and access, including theories, foundations, algorithms, evaluation, analysis, and applications. Please note CFPs for other paper tracks, as well as workshops, tutorials, doctoral consortium, industry day, and other SIGIR 2025 venues will be released separately. 
 Important Dates for Full Papers 
 Deadlines time zone: Anywhere on Earth (AoE) 
 Full paper abstracts due: January 16, 2025 
 Full papers due: January 23, 2025 
 Full paper notifications: April 4, 2025 
 Full paper authors are required to submit an abstract by midnight January 16, 2025 AoE. Paper submission (deadline: midnight January 23, 2025 AoE) is not possible without a submitted abstract. We recommend authors waiting for notification from other conferences should submit an abstract, even if they do not ultimately submit a paper. Immediately after the abstract deadline, PC Chairs will desk reject submissions that lack informative titles and abstracts ("placeholder abstracts"). 
 Submission Guidelines 
 See thishref="https://sigir.org/sigir2022/checklist-to-strengthen-an-ir-paper/" - brief checklist
to strengthen an IR paper, for authors and reviewers. 
 Full research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including the other tracks of SIGIR 2025). 
 Submissions of full research papers must be in English, in PDF format, and beat most 9 pages in length(including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any content except references), withunrestricted space for references, in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, andOverleaftemplates are available from theACM Website(usesigconfproceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word). ACM’s CCS concepts and keywords are required for review. 
 For LaTeX, the following should be used: 
 documentclass[sigconf,natbib=true,anonymous=true]{acmart} 
 Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via EasyChair: 
 href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir2025
by selecting the“SIGIR 2025 Full Papers”track. 
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for SIGIR 2025, and the author(s) or their delegate(s) must present the work at the conferencein person. 
 Anonymity and Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy 
 The full paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information; citations or discussion of your own prior work should be written up in third person form. It is acceptable to refer to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if reviewers can not infer that the authors are currently affiliated with these organizations. You can submit, to SIGIR 2025, papers that you have posted to pre-print/archival platforms (e.g. arXiv), or plan to post in the future, after submission. However, your paper must conform to thehref="arxiv-policy.html" - SIGIR 2025 Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy
. Breaking anonymity or pre-print/ArXiv policy puts the submission at risk of being desk rejected. 
 In-Person Attendance Policy 
 SIGIR 2025 is an in-person conference. Despite the challenges it may pose, we believe that an in-person conference is more beneficial in terms of direct engagement and networking opportunities, more dynamic exchange of research ideas, and welcoming and nurturing newcomers. 
 All accepted papers (including all tracks) to the main conference and workshops are expected to be presented in-person. We anticipate that at least one author from each accepted paper will attend the conference in person to deliver the paper and address audience questions during the Q&A session. No pre-recorded videos will be accepted. More information at thehref="inpresence-policy.html" - SIGIR 2025 In-presence Policy
page. 
 Child Care Service 
 SIGIR 2025 promotes inclusion and attendance also by organizing a child care service, in order to foster work-family balance by offering congress attendees the opportunity to attend events with their children. 
 Children from 0 to 12 years of age are welcomed in a specially set up room inside Padua Congress Center throughout the duration of the congress. A colorful, “warm”, safe and welcoming environment, in the same structure that hosts the congresses, a protected place where parents can leave their children, but at the same time stay in touch with them during the breaks of the different sessions. 
 The nursery space dedicated to the 0-3 age group, equipped with a changing table and other facilities dedicated to the little ones, is next to the kids’ area for children over 3 years old and a cinema room for screenings. 
 The activities are run by a company specialized in education services with expert staff, appointed by Padua Congress Center, and include thematic workshops - from painting to creative activities - as well as playtime also in the open air, in the facility's outdoor spaces. Children are also offered lunch. 
 The service is available - for a fee (depending on sponsors) - to all SIGIR 2025 attendees who request it. For more information and updates, check out thehref="child-care.html" - SIGIR 2025 Child Care
page. 
 Authorship Policy 
 Authors should carefully go throughhref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship" - ACM’s authorship policy
before submitting a paper. Please ensure that all authors are clearly identified in EasyChair before the submission deadline. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at abstract submission time. No changes to authorship, under any circumstances, will be permitted after the abstract submission deadline or for the camera-ready submission. So please, make sure you have listed authors correctly at abstract submission time. 
 Use of AI 
 All submissions must comply with theACM policy on the use of Artificial Intelligence. 
 Desk Rejection Policy 
 Submissions that violate the anonymity,pre-print policy, length, or formatting requirements, or are determined to violateACM’s policies on academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, author misrepresentation, falsification, etc., are subject to desk rejection by the chairs. Any of the following may result in desk rejection: 
 Figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgements, or any other content after page 9 of the submission. 
 Formatting not in line with the guidelines provided above. 
 Authors or authors’ institutional affiliations clearly named or easily discoverable. 
 Links to source code repositories that reveal author identities, or links to extended versions of the current paper. It is recommended to hold these for the final published version and | href="https://sigir.org/general-information/acm-sigir-artifact-badging/" - submit source code for artifact review | . If you need to shared anonymous code, you may use anonymous git repositories, such as | https://anonymous.4open.science/ | . 
 Change of authors after the abstract submission deadline. 
 Content that has been determined to have been copied from other sources. 
 Any form of academic fraud or dishonesty. 
 Lack of topical fit for SIGIR.
