 ICIMP 2025: Call for Papers 
 Onsite and Online Options: In order to accommodate various situations, we are offering the option for either physical presence or virtual participation (pdf slides or pre-recorded videos). 
 The International Conference on Internet Monitoring and Protection continues a series of special events targeting security, performance, vulnerabilities in Internet, as well as disaster prevention and recovery. Dedicated events focus on measurement, monitoring and lessons learnt in protecting the user. 
 The design, implementation and deployment of large distributed systems are subject to conflicting or missing requirements leading to visible and/or hidden vulnerabilities. Vulnerability specification patterns and vulnerability assessment tools are used for discovering, predicting and/or bypassing known vulnerabilities. 
 Vulnerability self-assessment software tools have been developed to capture and report critical vulnerabilities. Some of vulnerabilities are fixed via patches, other are simply reported, while others are self-fixed by the system itself. Despite the advances in the last years, protocol vulnerabilities, domain-specific vulnerabilities and detection of critical vulnerabilities rely on the art and experience of the operators; sometimes this is fruit of hazard discovery and difficult to be reproduced and repaired. 
 System diagnosis represent a series of pre-deployment or post-deployment activities to identify feature interactions, service interactions, behavior that is not captured by the specifications, or abnormal behavior with respect to system specification. As systems grow in complexity, the need for reliable testing and diagnosis grows accordingly. The design of complex systems has been facilitated by CAD/CAE tools. Unfortunately, test engineering tools have not kept pace with design tools, and test engineers are having difficulty developing reliable procedures to satisfy the test requirements of modern systems. Therefore, rather than maintaining a single candidate system diagnosis, or a small set of possible diagnoses, anticipative and proactive mechanisms have been developed and experimented. In dealing with system diagnosis data overload is a generic and tremendously difficult problem that has only grown. Cognitive system diagnosis methods have been proposed to cope with volume and complexity. 
 Attacks against private and public networks have had a significant spreading in the last years. With simple or sophisticated behavior, the attacks tend to damage user confidence, cause huge privacy violations and enormous economic losses. 
 The CYBER-FRAUD track focuses on specific aspects related to attacks and counterattacks, public information, privacy and safety on cyber-attacks information. It also targets secure mechanisms to record, retrieve, share, interpret, prevent and post-analyze of cyber-crime attacks. 
 Current practice for engineering carrier grade IP networks suggests n-redundancy schema. From the operational perspective, complications are involved with multiple n-box PoP. It is not guaranteed that this n-redundancy provides the desired 99.999% uptime. Two complementary solutions promote (i) high availability, which enables network-wide protection by providing fast recovery from faults that may occur in any part of the network, and (ii) non-stop routing. Theory on robustness stays behind the attempts for improving system reliability with regard to emergency services and containing the damage through disaster prevention, diagnosis and recovery. 
 Highly reliable emergency communications are required by public safety and disaster relief agencies to perform recovery operations or associated with disasters or serious network events. Future advanced network development and evolution should take into consideration these requirements through solutions: 
 Identification of suitable technologies, i.e., narrowband and broadband aspects, 
 Interoperability and interworking between emergency communications capabilities and public networks, 
 Preferential access to communications resources capabilities, applications, and facilities, 
 Preferential use of remaining operational resources. 
 We solicit both academic, research, and industrial contributions. We welcome technical papers presenting research and practical results, position papers addressing the pros and cons of specific proposals, such as those being discussed in the standard fora or in industry consortia, survey papers addressing the key problems and solutions on any of the above topics short papers on work in progress, and panel proposals. 
 Industrial presentations are not subject to the format and content constraints of regular submissions. We expect short and long presentations that express industrial position and status. 
 Tutorials on specific related topics and panels on challenging areas are encouraged. 
 The topics suggested by the conference can be discussed in term of concepts, state of the art, research, standards, implementations, running experiments, applications, and industrial case studies. Authors are invited to submit complete unpublished papers, which are not under review in any other conference or journal in the following, but not limited to, topic areas. 
 All topics and submission formats are open to both research and industry contributions.

 Helpful information for paper formatting for MS Word can be foundhere. 
 There is a community providedLaTeX template: the CTAN packageiaria(with full IARIA formatting rules, including IARIA citation style, but for providing citation style it is tightly bound to pdflatex+biblatex+biber). In addition, there is alsoiaria-lite(not bound to pdflatex+biblatex+biber, but compatible with any TeX stack; thus, it cannot provide the IARIA citation formattings, but only the titlepage and content-related IARIA formatting rules). Based on the iaria package, there is a minimal working example asOverleaf template. When you are using the LaTeX templates, please still adhere to the additionaleditorial rules. 
 Slides-based contributions can use the corporate/university format and style. 
 Your paper should also comply with the additionaleditorial rules. 
 Once you receive the notification of contribution acceptance, you will be provided by the publisher an online author kit with all the steps an author needs to follow to submit the final version. The author kits URL will be included in the letter of acceptance. 
 We would recommend that you should not use too many extra pages, even if you can afford the extra fees. No more than 2 contributions per event are recommended, as each contribution must be separately registered and paid for. At least one author of each accepted paper must register to ensure that the paper will be included in the conference proceedings and in the digital library, or posted on the www.iaria.org (for slide-based contributions).
