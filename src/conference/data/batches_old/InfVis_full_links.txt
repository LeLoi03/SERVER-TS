IEEE VIS: Visualization & Visual Analytics 
 November 2 to 7inVienna, AustriaWelcome to IEEE VIS 2025 
 IEEE VIS 2025 will be the year’s premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics. The conference will convene an international community of researchers and practitioners from universities, government, and industry to exchange recent findings on the design and use of visualization tools. 
 In 2025, the conference is again moving to the old continent, and we cannot wait to welcome you to the heart of Europe in the beautiful city of Vienna! Vienna is awelcoming hostthat excels at traditional hospitality, and a highly efficient modern city. It is a major urban center but still has the largest proportion of green space of any large European city. In addition to the well-known cultural highlights, the capital’s outstanding infrastructure sets Vienna apart as a remarkably clean and safe city. The public transportation network and short walking distances between attractions mean it takes no time to get around, with some of Europe’s most beautiful sights and the finest culinary delicacies around every corner. Sustainability is a key factor - from renewable energy forms and the outstanding drinking water fresh from the city’s taps. Like many other events in Vienna, VIS 2025 will be certified as agreen meeting. 
 We will do our best to plan an extraordinary experience for you and will cheer together for IEEE VIS’ past and future!

Information+ Conference 2025 
 Interdisciplinary practices in 
 information design and visualization 
 14—16 November, in Boston, MA 
 Information+ is a biennial conference that brings together researchers, educators, and practitioners ininformation design and data visualizationto explore shared questions and challenges in these rapidly changing fields. We aim to provoke rich, interdisciplinary discourse on how information representation engages within social, political and environmental contexts. 
 Information+ 2025 will be held in-person in Boston, USA, between November 14–16, hosted byNortheastern University’s College of Arts, Media, and Design (CAMD)andMIT’s School of Architecture and Planningthrough theLeventhal Center for Advanced Urbanism (LCAU)andMorningside Academy of Design (MAD). CAMD, LCAU, and MAD actively promote interdisciplinary approaches to teaching and research in information design, data visualization, and related fields. 
 This in-person event seeks to significantly foster community building and interdisciplinary exchange. Info+ 2025 continues the effort from previous convenings. 
 Information+ 2016Emily Carr University of Art + Design, VancouverInformation+ 2018University of Applied Sciences PotsdamInformation+ 2021VirtualInformation+ 2023University of EdinburghInfo+ 2025 seeks submissions that embrace critical insights, provocations, theories, practices, and experiences within information design and data visualization and their applications. Design practitioners are encouraged to submit, alongside contributors from the humanities, sciences, and other interdisciplinary fields, representing both academic and non-academic perspectives. 
 The conference has three types of contributions:Presentations,Workshops & Activities, andExhibition Pieces. We invite proposals from all relevant fields and areas of professional practice, research, and pedagogy. Detailed information links and submissions will open for Information+ in April, 2025. These topics may include, among others: 
 General Topics in Information Design and Visualization: 
 Ethical considerations 
 Design processes 
 Education 
 Justice and equity 
 Environmental sustainability 
 Accessibility and disability justice 
 Modalities of data representation (e.g., touch, sound, taste) 
 Interdisciplinary practices 
 Empathy and joy 
 Domain-Specific Applications of Design and Visualization: 
 Collective futures 
 Indigenous knowledge systems 
 Social and political issues 
 Environment and climate action 
 Health and wellbeing 
 Cultural collections and museums 
 Digital humanities 
 Data journalism 
 Emerging technology 
 Advances and trends in information design 
 While contributions for presentations and workshops & activities will explore a broad range of the themes above,Info+ 2025’s exhibition theme isenergy.energysignifies much more than the contentious ways we power our homes, workspaces, and ourselves. It refers to capacity, strength, expression, dynamism, efficiency, flow, and passion. Amidst democratic erosion and polarization, energy can also represent the shared momentum we build together to uphold rights, nurture inclusive political organizing, and envision thriving, sustainable futures in harmony with our planet. Information designers situate energy within an array of contexts, including the topics listed below and more. At this critical moment in time, when the urgency of information design production and critique has never been greater, we convene Info+ 2025 with the theme energy to also highlight the vitality and ingenuity of our community.
