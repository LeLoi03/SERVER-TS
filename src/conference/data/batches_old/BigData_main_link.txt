 In recent years, Big Data has become a new ubiquitous term. Big Data is transforming science, engineering medicine, healthcare, finance, business, and ultimately our society itself. The IEEE Big Data conference series started in 2013 has established itself as the top tier research conference in Big Data. 
 The first conference | href="http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2013/" - IEEE Big Data 2013 | had more than 400 registered participants from 40 countries and the regular paper acceptance rate is 17.0%; 
  
 href="http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2023/" - The IEEE Big Data 2023 | (regular paper acceptance rate: 17.4%) was held at Sorrento, Italy, Dec 15-18, 2023 with close to 950 registered participants from 50 countries; 
  
 href="http://bigdataieee.org/BigData2024/" - The IEEE Big Data 2024 | (regular paper acceptance rate: 18.4%) was held at Washington DC, USA, Dec 15-18, 2024 with more than 1300 registered participants from 53 countries. 
 The 2025 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (IEEE BigData 2025) will continue the success of the previous IEEE Big Data conferences. It will provide a leading forum for disseminating the latest results in Big Data Research, Development, and Applications.

 INDUSTRIAL & Government Track 
  
 The Industrial Track solicits papers describing implementations of Big Data solutions relevant to industrial settings. The focus of industry track is on papers that address the practical, applied, or pragmatic or new research challenge issues related to the use of Big Data in industry. We accept full papers (up to 10 pages) and extended abstracts (2-4 pages). 
  
 The Government Track welcomes papers discussing the usefulness and need for publicly-contribution big data and open data and their use. Specifically, data utilization scenarios, needs analysis, data utilization obstacle analysis and solutions, data integration processes, interfaces as data utilization solutions, visualization, use cases, evidence-based policy making, building an ecosystem for solving social issues, analyzing their cases comparing international and regional differences, and conducting comparative surveys before and after specific events (like Covid-19). We are also looking for other big data solutions related to national and local governments, and public services.
