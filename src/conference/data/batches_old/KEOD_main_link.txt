Knowledge Engineering (KE) encompasses the technical, scientific, and social aspects of building, maintaining, and utilizing knowledge-based systems. It draws on AI, databases, expert systems, decision support systems, and software engineering, while integrating insights from logic, cognitive science, and socio-cognitive engineering. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Low-code/No-code Platforms have expanded KE’s reach by enabling automated ontology generation and greater accessibility. 
  
 Ontology Development (OD) focuses on creating reusable semantic structures like vocabularies, glossaries, and formal ontologies. These structures are essential in applications such as knowledge graphs, digital twins, explainable AI (XAI), cybersecurity, and IoT interoperability. Ontologies also play a crucial role in ensuring ethical AI development, mitigating bias, and enhancing transparency. 
  
 KEOD serves as a key venue for researchers and practitioners to explore traditional and cutting-edge topics like LLM-based Ontology Development, Ontology-driven Digital Twins, and Ontology-enhanced Low-code Platforms, fostering innovation in KE and OD across academia and industry.

 SCOPE 
 Knowledge Engineering (KE) refers to the technical, scientific, and social aspects involved in building, maintaining, and utilizing knowledge-based systems. As a multidisciplinary field, KE draws upon methodologies from artificial intelligence (AI), databases, expert systems, decision support systems, and information systems, with strong ties to software engineering principles. 
  
 KE also intersects with disciplines like logic, cognitive science, and socio-cognitive engineering. In recent years, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new pathways in ontology development, enabling automated extraction, refinement, and evolution of ontologies. Additionally, the rise of Low-code and No-code Platforms empowers non-experts to participate in ontology engineering, broadening accessibility and fostering innovation. 
  
 Ontology Development (OD) focuses on building reusable semantic structures such as vocabularies, glossaries, and formal ontologies that specify types of entities and relationships within a domain. These semantic structures are increasingly central to applications like knowledge graphs, digital twins, explainable AI (XAI), and cybersecurity frameworks, where ontologies enhance data integration, decision-making, and system transparency. 
  
 Current applications of KE and OD include sustainable AI solutions, semantic interoperability in IoT, natural language processing (NLP), and enterprise engineering. Ontologies now play a crucial role in ensuring ethical AI development by mitigating bias and enhancing transparency. 
  
 The KEOD conference aims to be a major meeting point for researchers and practitioners interested in methodologies and technologies related to Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development. It encourages the exploration of cutting-edge topics such as LLM-based Ontology Development, Ontology-driven Digital Twins, and Ontology-enhanced Low-code Platforms, fostering dialogue and innovation across academic and industrial spheres.CONFERENCE TOPICS
