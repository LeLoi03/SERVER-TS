 Topics of Interest 
 FORTE 2025 is a forum for fundamental research on theory, models, tools, and applications for distributed systems. 
 We invite submissions focused on foundational aspects of distributed software systems, presenting approaches or tools to formally model soundly implement, and rigorously validate these demanding but ever more necessary systems and applications. As our dependency on such software systems grow, also our responsibility as researchers grows to provide both trustworthy and usable solutions. 
 The main topics of interest include: 
 Language concepts for concurrency and distribution, supported by rigorous semantics, well-supported pragmatics, and/or expressive illustrative use-cases. 
 Analyses techniques, methodologies, and/or algorithms, using testing and/or verification, to validate (aspects of) the soundness of various types of concurrent and distributed systems, including communication and network protocols, service-oriented systems adaptive distributed systems, cyber-physical systems and sensor networks. 
 Principles for qualitative and quantitative security analysis of distributed systems. 
 Applications of formal methods and techniques for studying the quality, reliability, availability, and safety of concrete distributed systems. We are specially interested in ‚Äúreal-life‚Äù case studies and industrial applications involving real distributed systems. 
 Emerging challenges and hot topics in distributed systems (broadly construed), such as software-defined networks, distributed ledgers smart contracts, and blockchain technologies, etc. 
 Submission and Publication 
 Categories of Papers 
 We solicit papers in the following categories: 
 Regular papers | (7-15 pages, not counting references): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission. Companion artefacts to regular submissions will be reviewed by the Artefact Evaluation Committee, but the acceptance of the paper is decoupled from the acceptance of the artefact (does not depend on it). The acceptance of the artefact, however, is conditional to the acceptance of the paper. 
 Tool papers | (7-15 pages, not counting references): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of FORTE. The paper should present the underlying theory of the tool, a clear account of the tool‚Äôs functionality and limitations, and include case studies (with rigorous experimental evaluation). In addition, the tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation. Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted. The artefact will be evaluated by a dedicated committee. The paper must contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes, to be submitted until a week after the paper submission deadline. 
 Short papers | (up to 6 pages, not counting references): describing innovative and promising ideas, possibly in an early form, or demonstrating new tools (components), or presenting (i) calls to action, or (ii) substantiated reflections on current and/or future research perspectives related to FORTE, or a summary of a published journal paper clarifying why the presentation would enrich the program of FORTE. 
 Artefact Submission Instructions üì£ 
 We invite you to also submit an associated artefact for evaluation (AE). Artefacts such as ancillary data, tools, and software will be assessed for availability, functionality, and reusability badges. 
 Instructions on how to upload artefacts can be foundhref="/2025/FORTE_Artefact_Evaluation_Guidelines.pdf" - here
. 
 As advertised in the call for papers, artefact submissions are mandatory for tool papers and optional for regular papers. Tool papers must submit an artefact that, at least, satisfies the requirements for theFunctionalbadge. Papers not meeting this clause are rejected. Moreover, the acceptance of artefacts is conditional on the tool paper being accepted. 
 Choose the ‚ÄúFORTE 2025 Artefact Evaluation‚Äù track in EasyChair when submitting your artefact.

Publication 
 Publication of proceedings is coordinated among the three DisCoTec conferences (see theConferencespage for details). The FORTE proceedings will be published by Springer as an LNCS-IFIP volume and will comprise accepted submissions fromallcategories. 
 Special Issue 
 Selected papers will be invited to a special issue ofLogical Methods in Computer Science.
