 Generative AI and CBR 
 Generative AI and CBRis this year’s conference theme, directing the community’s attention to the explosion of Generative AI permeating and changing all aspects of work, life, and societies. This year, we focus on the question: 
 “What are some roles CBR can play to address some of the challenges stemming from Generative AI’s growing pervasion in our society?” 
 Through its attention to personalized solutions and recommendations, CBR has much to offer to Generative AI researchers, policymakers, and practitioners, while at the same time, Generative AI can advance some of the major research questions in CBR. We look forward to receiving papers around this theme, whether position papers or roadmapping proposals, as well as traditional basic or applied research papers. We also welcome all research papers centered on core CBR, whether theoretical, applied, or fielded. 
  
 Exciting Keynotes 
 Invited keynotes will be given by leading experts in the field. We are happy to announce our distinguished speakers: 
 Professor Ralph Bergmann, University of Trier, Germany 
 Professor Claire Gardent, LORIA, France 
 Professor David Leake, Indiana University, USA 
  
 Several Workshops 
 Several workshops will be held alongside ICCBR 2025. Check thehref="https://2025.iccbr.org/program/" - Workshop Program

 Call For Papers 
 TheInternational Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (ICCBR)is the premier annual meeting of the case-based reasoning (CBR) community and the leading international conference on this topic. We welcome contributions from participants representing all types of affiliations (academic, industry, government) and from all communities applying CBR or conducting relevant research. 
 Conference submissions are not limited to papers on the conference theme, though the organizers are especially interested in papers that address the theme. 
 Generative AI and CBR 
 Generative AI and CBRis this year’s conference theme, directing the community’s attention to the growing pervasion of Generative AI in workplaces, homes, and societies, affecting us all. This year we pose the question: 
 “What are some roles CBR can play to address some of the challenges stemming from Generative AI’s growing pervasion in our society?” 
 We encourage submissions and participation from members of the AI and CBR communities—whether they are researchers, policymakers, or practitioners—on the synergistic challenges between Generative AI and CBR. We look forward to a variety of submissions, including position papers, road mapping proposals, as well as traditional basic or applied research papers.

 Important Dates 
 Please note that this edition will have early and late deadlines to allow attendants to book their trip to Biarritz in advance. 
 Authors can submit their papers either by the early or late submission deadlines. 
 The early revision round will evaluate papers as “accepted”, “rejected”, or “rejected with option to resubmit”. The authors of rejected papers with the option to resubmit in the early round can submit a revised version to the late submission deadline. In case a paper was rejected in the early round, it cannot be resubmitted to the late deadline. 
 If you miss the early deadline you can submit directly to the late submission round. The late round works as a regular revision and it will evaluate papers as “accepted” or “rejected”. 
 After both rounds of revision, accepted papers will be considered for poster or oral presentation based on the reviews and the most effective mode of presenting them to theICCBRaudience. 
 Please refer to thehref="https://2025.iccbr.org//key-dates" - Key Dates
page for submission deadlines. 
 Review Criteria 
 Each submission must be identified as presenting (1) theoretical/methodological research, (2) applied research/emerging applications, (3) a deployed application, and will be reviewed using criteria appropriate to its category, (4) Literature surveys, or (5) Challenge papers. These criteria are as follows: 
 Theoretical/methodological research: | Scientific significance, originality, technical quality, and clarity; 
 Applied research/emerging applications | : Significance for theoretical research or promise for application deployment; 
 Deployed application | : Demonstrated practical significance; originality; treatment of issues of engineering, management, and user acceptance; and clarity; 
 Literature survey | : Well-developed body of research, inclusion of works from several authors, significance, clarity, open research questions. 
 Papers will be considered for poster or oral presentation based on the reviews and the most effective mode of presenting it to the ICCBR audience. 
 Submission Procedure 
 Authors must submit a full paper by the conference paper submission deadline, formatted according to the Springer LNCS formatting guidelines (href="https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/conference-proceedings/conference-proceedings-guidelines" - https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/conference-proceedings/conference-proceedings-guidelines
