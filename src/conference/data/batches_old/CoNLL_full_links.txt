 CoNLL 2025Vienna, Austria, July 31 - August 1, 2025 (co-located with ACL) 
 Welcome to the 29th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2025). CoNLL is a yearly conference organized by SIGNLL (ACL's Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning), focusing on theoretically, cognitively, and scientifically motivated approaches to computational linguistics. In particular, it seeks to explore the interaction between theoretical issues inlinguistics and cognition, on the one hand, andcomputational modeling, on the other. Questions that CoNLL addresses are e.g.: How do computational models inform us about how language and cognition work? Which phenomena do they capture, which do they not capture? Conversely, how do linguistics and cognitive science contribute to understanding, and possibly improving, AI models? 
 We welcome work targeting any aspect of language and its computational modeling, including but not only: 
 Computational Psycholinguistics, Cognition and Linguistics 
 Computational Social Science and Sociolinguistics 
 Interaction and Dialogue 
 Language Acquisition, Learning, Emergence, and Evolution 
 Multimodality and Grounding 
 Typology and Multilinguality 
 Speech and Phonology 
 Syntax and Morphology 
 Semantics and Pragmatics 
 Theoretical Analysis and Interpretation of ML Models for NLP 
 Resources and Tools for Scientifically Motivated Research 
 Invited Speakers

 Jean-Rémi King, CNRS / Meta AI 
 Timeline 
 (All deadlines are 11:59pm UTC-12h, AoE) 
 Submission deadline (archival andnon-archival): March 14 2025

 *** CoNLL 2025: 1st Call for Papers *** 
 Vienna, Austria, July 31 - August 1, 2025 (co-located with ACL) 
 SIGNLL invites submissions to the 29th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL 2025). The focus of CoNLL is on theoretically, cognitively and scientifically motivated approaches to computational linguistics, rather than on work driven by particular engineering applications. We welcome work targeting any aspect of language and its computational modeling, including: 
 * Computational Psycholinguistics, Cognition and Linguistics 
 * Computational Social Science and Sociolinguistics 
 * Interaction and Dialogue 
 * Language Acquisition, Learning, Emergence, and Evolution 
 * Multimodality and Grounding 
 * Typology and Multilinguality 
 * Speech and Phonology 
 * Syntax and Morphology 
 * Lexical, Compositional and Discourse Semantics 
 * Theoretical Analysis and Interpretation of ML Models for NLP 
 * Resources and Tools for Scientifically Motivated Research 
 We do not restrict the topic of submissions to fall into this list. However, the submissions’ relevance to the conference’s focus on theoretically, cognitively and scientifically motivated approaches will play an important role in the review process. 
 Submitted papers must be anonymous and use the same template as the ACL 2025. Submitted papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content plus unlimited space for references. Authors of accepted papers will have an additional page to address reviewers’ comments in the camera-ready version (9 pages of content in total, excluding references). Optional anonymized supplementary materials and a PDF appendix are allowed. The appendix should be submitted as a separate PDF file (reviewers are not required to consider the materials in the appendix so it should not include any essential content to the understanding of the paper). Please refer to the ACL 2025 Call for Papers for more details on the submission format. Note that, unlike ACL, we do not mandate that papers have a discussion section of the limitations of the work. However, we strongly encourage authors to have such a section in the appendix. 
 Submission will be via OpenReview. CoNLL 2025 will also accept ARR submission depending on the full review to be completed by May 19 2025. Please note that CoNLL 2025 is an in-person conference. We expect all accepted papers to be presented physically and presenting authors must register through ACL (workshop). 
 ** Timeline ** 
 (All deadlines are 11:59pm UTC-12h, AoE) 
 * Direct submission deadline: Friday, March 14 2025 
 * ARR Commitment deadline: Monday, May 19 2025 
 * Notification of acceptance: Friday, May 23 2025 
 * Camera ready papers due: Wednesday, June 25 2025 
 * Conference: July 31 - August 1, 2025 
 ** Venue ** 
 CoNLL 2025 will be held in-person, along with ACL in Vienna, Austria. 
 ** Multiple submission policy ** 
 CoNLL 2025 will refuse papers that are currently under submission, or that will be submitted to other meetings or publications, including ACL. Papers submitted elsewhere and papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere will be rejected. Authors submitting more than one paper to CoNLL 2025 must ensure that the submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results. 
 ** Further information ** 
 Further information (such as travel visas) will be announced in the 2nd Call for Papers.
