 Special Issue of the Artificial Intelligence and Law journal on "Applications and Evaluation of Large Language Models in the Legal Domain” 
 Submitted byiaailon Sun, 11/19/2023 - 10:18Large Language Models (LLMs), including both proprietary and open-source, are presently being applied in many diverse domains, including finance, healthcare, the soft sciences, engineering, and education. 
 This special issue of the journal aims to produce a set of seminal papers that focuses on the application and impact of LLMs in the legal domain, as well as the ethical issues and risks that are potentially involved.

 Papers (up to 10 pages including references for long papers, up to 5 pages including references for short papers) should present contributions from relevant topics. To maintain ICAIL’s relevance in the larger rapidly-moving field at the intersection of law and artificial intelligence, all papers must make clear their relation to legal information, reasoning, or processes. There should be a statement about the novel scientific contribution. The relation to prior work must be well-developed. The paper ought to report a full and satisfying discussion of its findings. 
 Papers on generative AI, machine learning or data mining should include discussions of the data, methodology, results, and analysis in sufficient depth beyond merely reporting metrics. 
 Submissions focusing on the reproduction, validation, constructive scrutinization, and extension of previously published works, datasets, and benchmarks are strongly encouraged. 
 Papers proposing formal or computational models should provide examples and/or reproducible simulations. 
 Papers on applications should describe the motivations, techniques, implementation, and evaluation. 
 All papers should include some discussion about the relevance to legal theory, practice, use of legal information, or impact on processes.

 It is highly recommended that code and data be published alongside the papers for all submissions to facilitate reproducibility. Program committee members will be instructed to take data and code sharing into account in their reviews. 
 Paper must be formatted using the ACM sigconf template (for LaTeX) or the interim template layout.docx (for Word), both athttp://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-templateAll papers should be converted to PDF prior to electronic submission.Please ensure you use the correct ACM sigconf template as indicated above. Note that some platforms may provide templates that are not fully compliant with the official ACM template.Papers that do not adhere to these conditions will be rejected without review. 
 Submissions can be made via the conftool platform, in the followinghref="https://www.conftool.net/icail2025/" - link
. 
 Submissions should be uploaded to the conference support system (to be supplied soon) by the submission deadline. 
 Reviewing will be double-blind. Papers submitted for review must not include names and affiliations of the authors and not include an acknowledgments section. Any identifying text in the body of the paper (e.g. citing “our work”) should be removed or rephrased to be non-identifying. These aspects can be added at the camera-ready stage. Therefore, prior to submission of the paper, the authors should first register the paper on the conference support system in order to receive an ID number for the paper. Then, in order to submit the paper, the paper should be revised so that the ID number of the paper replaces the names and affiliations of the authors. The references should include published literature relevant to the paper, including previous works of the authors, though care should be taken in the style of writing in order to preserve anonymity. References to code and data intended to be published alongside the papers are to be phrased such that anonymity is preserved. 
 Submitted papers may not be published as open access preprints before acceptance notifications have been sent. Papers that have already been published as preprints at the time of submission for review must be flagged as such in the review system and must not reference the preprint in the paper. 
 Papers submitted not adhering to the page limitation or the anonymity requirements may be rejected without review. 
 If you have any questions about the submission process, please direct them tohref="mailto:icail2025@conftool.net" - icail2025@conftool.net

 UPDATE – January 10, 2025 
 The deadline for submissions has been extended to January 28, 2025 
 Calls For Workshops 
 ICAIL 2025 will include workshops and tutorials on Monday, June the 16th and Friday, June the 20th. Tutorials should cover a broad topic of relevance to the AI and Law community and should have one or more designated organizers/speakers. Workshops are intended for informal discussion and should have one or more designated organizers as well as an organizing and programming committee. Proposals must contain enough information to permit evaluation on the basis of importance, quality, and community interest. Proposals should be 2 to 4 pages and include at least the following information: 
 The workshop or tutorial topic and goals, their significance, and their appropriateness for ICAIL 2025 
 The intended audience, including the research areas from which participants may come, the likely number of participants (with some of their names, if known), and plans for publicizing the workshop 
 Organization of the workshop or tutorial, including the intended format (such as invited talks, presentations, panel discussions, or other methods for ensuring an interactive atmosphere) and the expected length (full day or half day) 
 Organizers’ details: a description of the main organizers’ background in the proposed topic; and complete addresses including web pages of all organizers and committee members (if applicable) 
 Additionally, Workshop and Tutorial organizers must ensure that all participants, including remote attendees, are registered for the ICAIL conference. For both in-person and hybrid events, organizers are required to be present at the conference location. 
 Proposals for workshops and tutorials must be submitted in a filling form (access by clicking this link), by the submission deadline – which has beenextended to December 20th. 
 Calls For Demonstrations 
 A session will be organized for the demonstration of creative, robust, and practical working applications and tools.Where a demonstration is not connected to a submitted paper, a two-page extended abstract about the system should be submitted for review,via the conference support system and following the instructions on paper submission. Accepted extended abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings. For those demonstrations that are connected to a submitted paper, no separate statement about the demonstration needs to be submitted, but the author(s) should send an email to the Program Chair by the demo submission deadline to register their interest in demonstrating their work at this session.
