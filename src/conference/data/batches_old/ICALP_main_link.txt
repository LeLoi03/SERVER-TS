 ICALP code of conduct 
 ICALP is committed to be a respectful forum for its participants, free from any discrimination or harassment of any nature, particularly when abuse of power is involved. All ICALP attendees are expected to behave accordingly. 
 If you experience or witness discrimination, harassment or other unethical behavior at the conference, we encourage you to seek advice and remedy through one or more of the following options: 
 Consult with the SafeToC counsellors of ICALP. 
 Report to the conference chair, the PC chairs or the Steering Committee chair. The chairs are entitled to remove registered participants from the conference (without refunding the conference fees) if they are deemed to pose an ethical risk to other participants.

Awards 
 During the conference, the following awards will be delivered: 
 * the EATCS award, 
 * the Presburger award, 
 * the EATCS distinguished dissertation award, 
 * the best papers for Track A and Track B, 
 * the best student papers for Track A and Track B. 
 Submission guidelines 
 Submissions to ICALP 2025 use HotCRP system: 
 * Submission server Track A:href="https://icalp25-a.hotcrp.com" - icalp25-a.hotcrp.com
* Submission server Track B:href="https://icalp25-b.hotcrp.com" - icalp25-b.hotcrp.com
Guidelines: 
 1. Papers must present original research on the theory of computer science. No prior publication and no simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed. Authors are encouraged to also make full versions of their submissions freely accessible in an on-line repository such as ArXiv, HAL, ECCC. 
 2. Submissions take the form of an extended abstract of no more than 15 pages, excluding references and a clearly labelled appendix. The appendix may consist either of omitted proofs or of a full version of the submission, and it will be read at the discretion of program committee members. The use of the LIPIcs document class is an option, but not required. The extended abstract has to present the merits of the paper and its main contributions clearly, and describe the key concepts and technical ideas used to obtain the results. Submissions must provide the proofs which can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be verified. 
 3. Submissions are anonymous. The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
 The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. 
 4. Submissions authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed. 
 5. The submissions are done via HotCRP to the appropriate track of the conference. The use of pdflatex or similar pdf generating tools is mandatory and the page limit is strict (see point 2.) Papers that deviate significantly from these requirements risk rejection without consideration of merit. 
 6. During the rebuttal phase, authors will have from March 21-24, 2025 the opportunity to view and respond to initial reviews. Further instructions will be sent to authors of submitted papers before that time. 
 7. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register for the conference, and all talks are in-person. In exceptional cases, there may be support for remotely presenting a talk. 
 8. Papers authored only by students should be marked as such upon submission in order to be eligible for the best student paper awards of the track. 
 The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on A4 or letter-size paper. 
 Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. 
 Proceedings 
 ICALP proceedings are published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series. This is a series of high-quality conference proceedings across all fields in informatics established in cooperation with Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz Center for Informatics. LIPIcs volumes are published according to the principle of Open Access, i.e., they are available online and free of charge. The accepted papers will need to comply with the LIPIcs style. 
 Topics 
 Papers presenting original research on all aspects of theoretical computer science are sought. 
 Typical, but not exclusive, topics of interest are: 
 Track A: Algorithms, Complexity and Games
