 Call for Papers 
 Programming languages, compilers, and tools are important interfaces between embedded systems and emerging applications in the real world. Embedded systems are aggressively adapted for deep neural network applications, large language models, autonomous vehicles, robots, healthcare applications, etc. However, these emerging applications impose challenges that conflict with conventional design requirements and increase the complexity of embedded system designs. Furthermore, they exploit new hardware paradigms to scale up multicores (including GPUs and FPGAs) and distributed systems built from many cores. Therefore, programming languages, compilers, and tools are becoming more important to address these issues, such as productivity, validation, verification, maintainability, safety, and reliability for meeting both performance goals and resource constraints. 
 The 26th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, Tools and Theory of Embedded Systems (LCTES 2025) solicits papers presenting original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that help in overcoming these challenges. Research papers on innovative techniques are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by experimenting with real-world systems and applications. Papers can be submitted tohref="https://lctes2025.hotcrp.com/" - https://lctes2025.hotcrp.com/

 Paper Categories 
 Full paper: 10 pages presenting original work (at most 2 additional pages for references and appendix). 
 Poster, work-in-progress and invited paper: 4 pages papers presenting original ideas that are likely to trigger interesting discussions. 
 Accepted papers in both categories will appear in the proceedings published by ACM. In addition, this year’s LCTES will have | Distinguished Paper awards | selected from this year’s accepted paper to recognize the outstanding work among all papers. 
 Special Issue Invitation 
 Accepted full papers will be invited to submit to a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS). A TECS publication will require substantial additional material over the conference publication and will undergo a separate review process. Papers submitted to LCTES (including the WIP papers) will be welcome to submit manuscripts to a special issue of the IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (IEEE ESL). A 4-page IEEE ESL manuscript will require clearly distinct intellectual contribution as compared to the conference paper and will undergo a separate review process.

 Submission 
 Submissions must be in ACM SIGPLAN subformat of the acmart format (available at and explained in more detail athref="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/" - https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/
). Each paper should be in 10pt font and have no more than10 pages for full papersor4 pages for work-in-progress papers, excluding the bibliography. There is a 2-page limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al.). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]. Submissions must be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4-sized paper.For papers in the work-in-progress category, add the suffix “(WIP)” to your title, such as “Title (WIP)”. 
 To enable double-blind reviewing, submissions must adhere to two rules: 
 author names and their affiliations must be omitted; and, 
 references to related work by the authors should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
 However, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as discussed here. Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign an ACM copyright release. 
 ACM Publications Policies 
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to allACM Publications Policies, includinghref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" - ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects
. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
 Please ensure that you and your co-authorsobtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start, and we have recently made ahref="https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs" - commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors
. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
 href="#authors-take-note" - AUTHORS TAKE NOTE
The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. 
 By submitting the paper, the authors agree that if the paper is accepted, one author will have to register at the conference rate and present the paper in person at the LCTES 2025 conference.

 Paper Categories 
 Full paper: 10 pages presenting original work (at most 2 additional pages for references and appendix). 
 Poster, work-in-progress and invited paper: 4 pages papers presenting original ideas that are likely to trigger interesting discussions. 
 Accepted papers in both categories will appear in the proceedings published by ACM. In addition, this year’s LCTES will have | Distinguished Paper awards | selected from this year’s accepted paper to recognize the outstanding work among all papers. 
 Special Issue Invitation 
 Accepted full papers will be invited to submit to a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS). A TECS publication will require substantial additional material over the conference publication and will undergo a separate review process. Papers submitted to LCTES (including the WIP papers) will be welcome to submit manuscripts to a special issue of the IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (IEEE ESL). A 4-page IEEE ESL manuscript will require clearly distinct intellectual contribution as compared to the conference paper and will undergo a separate review process.

 Submission 
 Submissions must be in ACM SIGPLAN subformat of the acmart format (available at and explained in more detail athref="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/" - https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/
). Each paper should be in 10pt font and have no more than10 pages for full papersor4 pages for work-in-progress papers, excluding the bibliography. There is a 2-page limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al.). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]. Submissions must be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4-sized paper.For papers in the work-in-progress category, add the suffix “(WIP)” to your title, such as “Title (WIP)”. 
 To enable double-blind reviewing, submissions must adhere to two rules: 
 author names and their affiliations must be omitted; and, 
 references to related work by the authors should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
 However, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as discussed here. Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign an ACM copyright release. 
 ACM Publications Policies 
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to allACM Publications Policies, includinghref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" - ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects
. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
 Please ensure that you and your co-authorsobtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start, and we have recently made ahref="https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs" - commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors
. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
 href="#authors-take-note" - AUTHORS TAKE NOTE
The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. 
 By submitting the paper, the authors agree that if the paper is accepted, one author will have to register at the conference rate and present the paper in person at the LCTES 2025 conference.

 Call for Papers 
 Programming languages, compilers, and tools are important interfaces between embedded systems and emerging applications in the real world. Embedded systems are aggressively adapted for deep neural network applications, large language models, autonomous vehicles, robots, healthcare applications, etc. However, these emerging applications impose challenges that conflict with conventional design requirements and increase the complexity of embedded system designs. Furthermore, they exploit new hardware paradigms to scale up multicores (including GPUs and FPGAs) and distributed systems built from many cores. Therefore, programming languages, compilers, and tools are becoming more important to address these issues, such as productivity, validation, verification, maintainability, safety, and reliability for meeting both performance goals and resource constraints. 
 The 26th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, Tools and Theory of Embedded Systems (LCTES 2025) solicits papers presenting original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that help in overcoming these challenges. Research papers on innovative techniques are welcome, as well as experience papers on insights obtained by experimenting with real-world systems and applications. Papers can be submitted tohref="https://lctes2025.hotcrp.com/" - https://lctes2025.hotcrp.com/

 Paper Categories 
 Full paper: 10 pages presenting original work (at most 2 additional pages for references and appendix). 
 Poster, work-in-progress and invited paper: 4 pages papers presenting original ideas that are likely to trigger interesting discussions. 
 Accepted papers in both categories will appear in the proceedings published by ACM. In addition, this year’s LCTES will have | Distinguished Paper awards | selected from this year’s accepted paper to recognize the outstanding work among all papers. 
 Special Issue Invitation 
 Accepted full papers will be invited to submit to a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS). A TECS publication will require substantial additional material over the conference publication and will undergo a separate review process. Papers submitted to LCTES (including the WIP papers) will be welcome to submit manuscripts to a special issue of the IEEE Embedded Systems Letters (IEEE ESL). A 4-page IEEE ESL manuscript will require clearly distinct intellectual contribution as compared to the conference paper and will undergo a separate review process.

 Submission 
 Submissions must be in ACM SIGPLAN subformat of the acmart format (available at and explained in more detail athref="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/" - https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/
). Each paper should be in 10pt font and have no more than10 pages for full papersor4 pages for work-in-progress papers, excluding the bibliography. There is a 2-page limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al.). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]. Submissions must be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4-sized paper.For papers in the work-in-progress category, add the suffix “(WIP)” to your title, such as “Title (WIP)”. 
 To enable double-blind reviewing, submissions must adhere to two rules: 
 author names and their affiliations must be omitted; and, 
 references to related work by the authors should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). 
 However, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as discussed here. Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign an ACM copyright release.
