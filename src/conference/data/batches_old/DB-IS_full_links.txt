 Modern databases and information systems essentially differ from their predecessors. Ontology-based and knowledge-based approaches to system development, UML based IS development methodologies, XML databases and heterogeneous information models have come to the fore. All these fundamental aspects are discussed in this book. This publication contains a collection of 22 high quality papers written by 44 authors. These articles present original results in modern database technologies, database applications, data warehousing, data mining, ontologies, and modern information systems. Special emphasis is put on multimedia database systems, heterogeneous data integration methods, view optimizations, ontology engineering tools, modeling and model transformations (MDA). Theoretical aspects as well as technical development issues are considered. The intended audience for this book is researchers, advanced students and practitioners who are interested in advanced topics on databases and information systems.

 History of Baltic DB&IS Conferences 
 Shortly after the three Baltic states – Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania – regained their independence from the USSR at the beginning of the 1990’s, two organisers of the Very Large Data Bases (VLDB) conference – Prof. Janis Bubenko jr. (Sweden, born in Latvia) and Prof. Arne Sølvberg (Norway) – decided to invest a small balance of the VLDB Fund to introduce computer science researchers in the Baltic States into Europe. In 1994, the first computer science conference, called “The Baltic Workshop on National Infrastructure Databases: Problems, Methods, Experiences”, was organized in Trakai, Lithuania, where colleagues from Europe and the United States participated with researchers from the Baltic States. Ever since the conference became an international biennial (International Baltic Conference on Databases and Information Systems), rotating between Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. The conference is classified consistently in category B by Excellence for Research Australia (ERA), its articles are indexed on the Web of Science, SCOPUS, DBLP, etc. 
 The aim of Bubenko and Sølvberg to unite Baltic and European researchers has long been achieved, and after the 14th International Baltic Conference on Databases and Information Systems (Tallinn, 2020) the conference steering committee decided to extend the conference with more modern topics and to decipher the acronym Baltic DB&IS as Digital Business and Intelligent Systems. Although the conference has grown out of the Baltics scope, the conference name still carries it as a reference to its origins and long history.
