 Program 
 Welcome to the website of the 17th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming (FLOPS 2024). FLOPS 2024 is co-sponsored bySpecial Interest Group on Programming and Programming Languages (SIG-PPL),Japan Society for Software Science and Technology (JSSST), in cooperation withACM SIGPLAN. 
 Thehref="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-97-2300-3" - FLOPS 2024 proceedings
are now available online (free to read and download until end of June 2024). 
 href="#about-flops" - About FLOPS
FLOPS aims to bring together practitioners, researchers and implementers of declarative programming, to discuss mutually interesting results and common problems: theoretical advances, their implementations in language systems and tools, and applications of these systems in practice. The scope includes all aspects of the design, semantics, theory, applications, implementations, and teaching of declarative programming. FLOPS specifically aims to promote cross-fertilization between theory and practice and among different styles of declarative programming. 
 Previous FLOPS meetings were held at Fuji Susono (1995), Shonan Village (1996), Kyoto (1998), Tsukuba (1999),href="https://www.ueda.info.waseda.ac.jp/flops2001/" - Tokyo

 Call for Papers 
 FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of declarative programming: 
 functional, logic, functional-logic programming, rewriting systems, formal methods and model checking, program transformations and program refinements, developing programs with the help of theorem provers or SAT/SMT solvers, verifying properties of programs using declarative programming techniques; 
 foundations, language design, implementation issues (compilation techniques, memory management, run-time systems, etc.), applications and case studies. 
 FLOPS promotes cross-fertilization among different styles of declarative programming. Therefore, research papers must be written to be understandable by a wide audience of declarative programmers and researchers. In particular, each submission should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant for its area, and comparing it with previous work. Submission of system descriptions and declarative pearls are especially encouraged. 
 href="#submission" - Submission
Submissions should fall into one of the following categories: 
 Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will be judged on originality, correctness, and significance. 
 System descriptions: they should describe a working system and will be judged on originality, usefulness, and design. 
 Declarative pearls: new and excellent declarative programs or theories with illustrative applications. 
 System descriptions and declarative pearls must be explicitly marked as such in the title. 
 Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshops proceedings may be submitted. Authors must followhref="https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct" - Springer’s Code of Conduct
. See also theACM SIGPLAN Republication Policy. At least one author of each accepted paper should plan to attend the conference in person to present the work: there will be no general facility for online or pre-recorded presentation (but we will do our best to accommodate visa issues and similar unavoidable obstacles). 
 Submissions must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages excluding references, though system descriptions and pearls are typically shorter. The formatting has to conform toSpringer’s guidelines. Regular research papers should be supported by proofs and/or experimental results. In case of lack of space, this supporting information should be made accessible otherwise (e.g., a link to an anonymized web page or an appendix, which does not count towards the page limit). However, it is the responsibility of the authors to guarantee that their paper can be understood and appreciated without referring to this supporting information; reviewers may simply choose not to look at it when writing their review. 
 Papers should be submitted electronically athref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flops2024" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flops2024
. 
 Reviewing process 
 FLOPS 2024 will employ alight double-blindreviewing process; reviewers will not see author names until they submit a review. To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules: 
 author names and institutions must be omitted, and 
 references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work…” but rather “We build on the work of…”). 
 The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. 
 Publication 
 The proceedings will be published by Springer International Publishing in theLecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. 
 We expect to invite the authors of four to seven of the best papers to submit an extended version of their FLOPS paper to a special issue which will appear in the journalScience of Computer Programming (SCP).

 ============================================================================ 
 Call For Papers 
  
 FLOPS 2024: 17th International Symposium on Functional and Logic Programming 
 ============================================================================ 
  
 May 15-17, 2024, Kumamoto, Japan 
  
 https://conf.researchr.org/home/flops-2024 
  
 FLOPS aims to bring together practitioners, researchers and 
 implementers of declarative programming, to discuss mutually 
 interesting results and common problems: theoretical advances, their 
 implementations in language systems and tools, and applications of 
 these systems in practice. The scope includes all aspects of the 
 design, semantics, theory, applications, implementations, and teaching 
 of declarative programming. FLOPS specifically aims to promote 
 cross-fertilization between theory and practice and among different 
 styles of declarative programming. 
  
 Previous FLOPS meetings were held at Fuji Susono (1995), Shonan 
 Village (1996), Kyoto (1998), Tsukuba (1999), Tokyo (2001), Aizu 
 (2002), Nara (2004), Fuji Susono (2006), Ise (2008), Sendai (2010), 
 Kobe (2012), Kanazawa (2014), Kochi (2016), Nagoya (2018), Akita 
 (2020, online), and Kyoto (2022, online). 

*** Scope *** 
  
 FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of declarative programming: 
  
 * functional, logic, functional-logic programming, rewriting systems, 
 formal methods and model checking, program transformations and 
 program refinements, developing programs with the help of theorem 
 provers or SAT/SMT solvers, verifying properties of programs using 
 declarative programming techniques; 
  
 * foundations, language design, implementation issues (compilation 
 techniques, memory management, run-time systems, etc.), applications 
 and case studies. 
  
 FLOPS promotes cross-fertilization among different styles of 
 declarative programming. Therefore, research papers must be written to 
 be understandable by a wide audience of declarative programmers and 
 researchers. In particular, each submission should explain its 
 contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying 
 what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant for its 
 area, and comparing it with previous work. Submission of system 
 descriptions and declarative pearls are especially encouraged. 

*** Submission *** 
  
 Submissions should fall into one of the following categories: 
  
 * Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will 
 be judged on originality, correctness, and significance. 
  
 * System descriptions: they should describe a working system and will 
 be judged on originality, usefulness, and design. 
  
 * Declarative pearls: new and excellent declarative programs or 
 theories with illustrative applications. 
  
 System descriptions and declarative pearls must be explicitly marked 
 as such in the title. Submissions must be unpublished and not 
 submitted for publication elsewhere. Work that already appeared in 
 unpublished or informally published workshops proceedings may be 
 submitted. Submissions must be written in English and can be up to 15 
 pages excluding references, though system descriptions and pearls are 
 typically shorter. The formatting has to conform to Springer’s LNCS 
 guidelines. FLOPS 2024 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. 
  
 For more details, see 
  
 https://conf.researchr.org/home/flops-2024 
  
 Papers should be submitted electronically at 
  
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flops2024 

*** Publication *** 
  
 The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series. We 
 expect to invite the authors of a selection of the best papers to 
 submit an extended version of their FLOPS paper to a special issue 
 which will appear in the journal Science of Computer Programming. 

*** Important Dates *** 
  
 All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE = UTC-12). 
  
 * Abstract due: Wed 6th Dec 2023 
 * Submission deadline: Wed 13th Dec 2023 
 * Notifications: Wed 31st Jan 2024 
 * Final versions due: Wed 28th Feb 2024

 Introduction 
 Declarative languages comprise several well-established classes of formalisms, namely, functional, logic, and constraint programming. Such formalisms enjoy both sound theoretical bases and the availability of attractive frameworks for application development. Indeed, they have been already successfully applied to many different real-world situations, ranging from database management to active networks to software engineering to decision support systems. 
 New developments in theory and implementation fostered applications in new areas. At the same time, applications of declarative languages to novel and challenging problems raise many interesting research issues, including designing for scalability, language extensions for application deployment, and programming environments. Thus, applications drive the progress in the theory and implementation of declarative systems, and benefit from this progress as well. 
 PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, database and constraint programming, and theorem proving. 
 Student grants

 Call for Papers 
 PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, databases and constraint programming, and theorem proving. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Innovative applications of declarative languages 
 Declarative domain-specific languages and applications 
 Practical applications of theoretical results 
 New language developments and their impact on applications 
 Declarative languages and software engineering 
 Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications 
 Practical experiences and industrial applications 
 Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom 
 Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages 
 PADL 2025 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches related to applications, design, and implementation of declarative languages going beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example, advanced database languages and contract languages, as well as verification and theorem-proving methods that rely on declarative languages. 
 PADL 2025 encourages students to participate in the symposium by providing some student grants to partially cover the registration and travel costs. The selection process will give preference to students who present their paper in the symposium. Students from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply. 
 href="#submissions" - Submissions
PADL 2025 welcomesregular papers (max. 15 pages, excluding references)andshort papers (max. 8 pages, excluding references)that describe original and previously unpublished research results on 
 complex and/or real-world applications in industry or in other areas of research, that rely on an innovative use of declarative languages, 
 tools and/or systems developed for such applications, and/or to improve practical aspects of declarative languages, 
 technical results related to the practical aspects of declarative languages. 
 Application and systems descriptions, engineering solutions, and real-world experiences (both positive and negative) are in particular solicited. Regular and short papers will be published in the formal proceedings. 
 PADL 2025 also welcomesextended abstracts (max. 3 pages)on the topics above, that describe new ideas, a new perspective on already published work, or work-in-progress that is not yet ready for a full publication. Extended abstracts will be posted on the symposium website but will not be published in the formal proceedings. 
 All page limits exclude references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style, seehttps://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines 
 The review process of PADL 2025 isdouble-anonymous. In your submission, please, omit your names and institutions; refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others; do not include acknowledgments that might identify you. 
 Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version - for example, details of proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. Reviewers are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers must be understandable without them. 
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their reports. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use: 
 \pagestyle{plain} \usepackage{lineno} \linenumbersThe conference proceedings of PADL 2025 will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published Workshop proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program chairs where it has previously appeared.Previous PADL proceedingscan be found onSpringerLink. 
 Papers should be submitted electronically viahref="https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/padl2025" - EquinOCS
(registration is required if you do not have an account). 
 href="#distinguished-papers" - Distinguished Papers
The authors of a small number of distinguished papers will be invited to submit a longer version for journal publication after the symposium. For papers related to logic programming, that will be in the journalTheory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), and for papers related to functional programming, inJournal of Functional Programming (JFP). The extended journal submissions should be substantially (roughly 30%) extended: explanations for which there was no space, illuminating examples and proofs, additional definitions and theorems, further experimental results, implementational details and feedback from practical/engineering use, extended discussion of related work, and so on. These submissions will then be subject to the usual peer review process by the journal, although with the aim of a swifter review process by reusing original reviews from PADL.
