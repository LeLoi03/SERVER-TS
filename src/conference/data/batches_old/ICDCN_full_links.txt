 Differentially Private Distributed Optimization (129 citations) 
 Feasibility of Fog Computing Deployment based on Docker Containerization over RaspberryPi (121 citations) 
 Research areas of the most cited articles at International Conference of Distributed Computing and Networking: 
 The published articles mostly deal with topics like Distributed computing, Distributed algorithm, Computer network, Algorithm and Asynchronous communication. The published articles focus on Distributed computing but the discussions also offer insight into other areas such as Latency (engineering), Broadcasting and Parallel computing. The works on Computer network tackled in the conference articles bring together disciplines like Computer security and The Internet. 
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for? 
 Computer network 
 Operating system 
 Artificial intelligence 
 The previous edition focused in particular on these issues: 
 International Conference of Distributed Computing and Networking primarily tackles Computer network, Distributed computing, Computer security, Cloud computing and The Internet. Among the topics covered in it are Computer network and Wide area. The Distributed computing works featured in International Conference of Distributed Computing and Networking incorporate elements from Consistency (database systems), Correctness and Eventual consistency. 
 The event addresses concerns in Computer security which are intertwined with other disciplines, such as Scheme (programming language) and Protocol (object-oriented programming). Topics in Cloud computing explored in the conference were investigated in conjunction with research in Scalability, Software deployment and Big data. The research on Network topology discussed in the event draws on the closely related field of Quality of service. 
 The most cited articles from the last conference are: 
 Efficient dispersion of mobile robots on graphs (22 citations) 
 Time-optimal uniform scattering in a grid (14 citations) 
 An accurate missing data prediction method using LSTM based deep learning for health care (12 citations) 
 Papers citation over time 
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue. 
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 Publication chance based on affiliation 
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference. 
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered. 
 Research.com 
 During the most recent 2019 edition,3.85%of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations,13.33%were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another14.67%included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included29.33%of all publications and42.67%were from other institutions. 
 Returning Authors Index 
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year. 
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year. 
 Research.com 
 Returning Institution Index 
 The graph below shows the Returning Institution Index, illustrating the ratio of institutions that participated in both a given and the previous edition of the conference in relation to all affiliations present in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index 
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at thelast edition of a conference, grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C). 
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups: 
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
 Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
 Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
 Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
 Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 
 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
