 PCS Submission Management System 
  
 Please use the Precision Conferences System (PCS) to submit your work. After clicking the link below, please choose “SIGCHI” from the “Society” drop-down list, then “VRST 2025” from the “Conference/Journal” drop-down list. 
 href="https://new.precisionconference.com/vrst2025" - https://new.precisionconference.com/vrst2025
Submission Guidelines 
  
 All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library in the VRST collection. 
 Format 
 Paper submissions must be anonymous for a double-blind review process (see below for more details). 
 All submissions should be prepared using the Word or LaTeX templates from the official ACM Master article template packages and TAPS (see | https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow | ). 
 For LaTeX authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format using \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}. 
 For Word submissions, please use the linked single-column template. 
 Authors should prepare their materials using numbered citations and references. See the TAPS webpage for guidance on how content length corresponds to the page limits for the final version. 
 Submission Lengths 
 Latex: 4 to 9 pages, double column, excluding references 
 Word: approx. 8,000 words including space for figures, tables, etc. 
 Anonymity Guidelines 
 For initial Paper submissions, authors are asked to remove all author and institution information and remove any clues that would directly identify any of the authors (such as the name of the data collecting institution, ethical board/IRB institution names, or acknowledgments). Please anonymize all PDF files. Note that PDF creator programs may automatically include author information in the file metadata. Citations of the authors’ own published work (including online) must be in the third person, in a manner that is not traceable to the identity of the authors. For example, the wording “in [3], Mountain and River proposed…” is acceptable, whereas “in [3], we proposed…” is not. Here, reference [3] is listed explicitly as “Mountain, A. and River, A., Detecting Mountains and Rivers, In Proc. XYZ ’16, 721-741.” We welcome authors to extend their own existing non- or semi-archivable, as well as not-yet-peer-reviewed publications, such as extended abstracts. To avoid accusations of (self)plagiarism in these cases, we ask the authors to upload their work in a special field in PCS. These works can only be viewed by the submission coordinator. 
 Please note that failure to comply with any of the above requirements and guidelines will result in an automatic desk rejection of the paper! 
 Contribution Types 
 We invite many types of research contributions, including interactive systems. However, evaluating systems that are built using existing techniques can be difficult. For example, a system can be built using a known machine-learning technique but it can enable entirely new functionality. In this case, reviewers will need to judge the novelty of the new functionality that the system enables without penalizing the work for leveraging an existing technique. 
 For reference, here’s a paper about evaluating interactive systems that reviewers and authors should both be familiar with: 
 James Fogarty (2017): Code and Contribution in Interactive Systems Research 
 We further accept studies that replicate known findings systematically to confirm or contradict previously found results. 
 Supplementary Materials 
 Submissions may be (optionally) accompanied by additional materials such as images, videos, or electronic documents. These materials do not form a part of the official submission. They will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers. All content should be in a portable format that is unlikely to require the user to download additional programs. For example, you may prefer PDF or HTML for documents, PNG or JPEG for images, and QuickTime or MPEG for videos. The total file size for supplementary materials should not exceed a total of 50MB. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the additional material providing supplementary information or confirmation of results. It is, however, appropriate to refer to video footage in the paper. 
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
 When designing and presenting user evaluations, please consider the following: User evaluations using non-representative or homogeneous participant populations can introduce biases in the results and conclusions. We recommend that researchers strive to use samples that are representative of the population for which the technology is being designed. If representative samples are not possible to collect, we recommend that the limitations of the population studied should be discussed within the paper and care must be taken when making claims about the findings. We recommend that participant demographic information should be reported for user evaluations so that future researchers understand the results based on the population studied. 
 Accessibility 
 We ask authors to try to be as inclusive as possible when preparing a submission. For instance, please provide alt-text for figures and tables and make supplemental videos accessible with subtitles to enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. We recommend that authors read the SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission, as well as the SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos (especially the section “What accessibility considerations should I pay attention to when recording my video?”), which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning. If authors have difficulties with making their submissions accessible, they are encouraged to contact the VRST 2025 Accessibility Chairs by emailinghref="mailto:accessibility@vrst2025.org" - accessibility@vrst2025.org
. 
 Policies 
 At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference, and present their work in person at the conference. As the conference is in-person only, there will not be any opportunity to present remotely. Besides, it’s just so much better to meet your fellow XR enthusiasts in person! 
  
 All standing ACM policies apply to ACM VRST 2025. 
 href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship" - ACM Policy on Authorship | (which also contains statements regarding the use of generative AI) 
 href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions" - ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions 
  
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently committed to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
 AUTHOR’S TAKE NOTE:The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)
