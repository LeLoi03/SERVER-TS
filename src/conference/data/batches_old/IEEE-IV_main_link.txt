 The IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES SYMPOSIUM (IV 2025) 
 is the premier annual forum organized by the IEEE Intelligent Transportation Systems Society (ITSS). IV 2025 will take place in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. Researchers, academics, and practitioners from universities, industry, and government agencies are invited to submit their latest research papers, simulation challenges, and applications on Intelligent Vehicles and Intelligent Vehicle Infrastructures. The symposium will feature Plenary Talks, Technical Sessions, Poster Sessions, Tutorials, Workshops, Exhibitions, and Industrial Demonstrations and Challenges. Also, it will provide a memorable Social Program to all participants around the world. Authors are invited to submit full-length papers up to 6 pages for technical content including figures and references. Additional pages will be charged at the rate of $100 per page and is limited to two pages per paper. Each accepted paper must be covered by at least one non-student registration. Additional papers by the same authors will be charged at the flat rate of $400 per paper
