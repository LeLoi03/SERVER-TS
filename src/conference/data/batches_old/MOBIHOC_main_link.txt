 Welcome to MobiHoc 2025 
 MobiHoc 2025, the 26th International Symposium on Theory, Algorithmic Foundations, and Protocol Design for Mobile Networks and Mobile Computing will be held in Houston, USA, October 27-30, 2025. MobiHoc is a premier international symposium dedicated to addressing challenges in dynamic networks and computing. 
 This year we significantly expand the conference’s scope to include theory, algorithms, and systems research on next-generation networking, communications, and related applications. We want to bring together the top researchers to one venue to build more bridges across different wireless subcommunities. 
 MobiHoc 2025 will feature a highly selective technical program, multiple distinguished keynote addresses, and an exciting panel. In addition, it includes workshops that are focused on areas of emerging interest.

 ACM MobiHoc is a premier conference with a highly selective single-track technical program dedicated to addressing the challenges emerging from networked systems that must operate in the face of dynamics ranging from changing user demands to connectivity and resource availability. Examples of such networked systems include next-generation cellular networks, multi-hop wireless networks, datacenter networks, Internet-of-Thing networks, mobile autonomous systems, cyber-physical systems, and online social networks. We encourage work that presents new modeling tools or performance evaluation methods, novel algorithms, or novel fundamental insights for these systems. 
 We are interested both in innovative works in unexplored and/or emerging topics broadly related to networked systems, and in novel findings and/or new insights that build on existing works.This year, we have significantly adapted the scope of the conference to suit the emerging challenges in networked systems.The specific areas of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Area 1: Modeling, Optimization, and Analysis 
 Modeling and analysis of computer and mobile networks 
 Optimization and control of computer and mobile networks, e.g., capacity planning, resource allocation, routing, and scheduling 
 Measurement and performance monitoring/forecasting for networked systems 
 Anomaly detection and problem diagnosis in networked systems 
 Dependability and fault tolerance in networked systems 
 Area 2: Mobile and Next-Generation Wireless Networks 
 Next-generation mobile networks, including theory and systems for NextG cellular networks, Open-RAN, and RAN Intelligent Control (RIC) 
 Protocol design for mobile networks and mobile computing 
 Experimental studies on mobile networks and networked systems 
 Interplanetary and Non-Terrestrial Networks 
 Wireless networks for localization and tracking 
 Low-power sensor networks and energy-harvesting systems 
 Sensing, communication with new medium, e.g., light/acoustic/mmWave, and integrated sensing and communication 
 Area 3: Machine Learning/AI and Networking 
 Big-data analytics and applications of machine learning to network research 
 Networked machine learning, e.g., federated/decentralized learning, and network support to machine learning 
 Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI for networks and network support for LLMs and generative AI 
 Coded computation and inference in networks 
 Area 4: Edge, Cloud, and Distributed Systems 
 Mobile computing, edge/fog computing, and distributed computing over networks 
 Cloud computing and data center networks, e.g., reconfigurable network topologies 
 Software Defined Networking, Network Function Virtualization, and virtual Radio Access Networks 
 Information-centric networking, network caching, and coded caching 
 Energy efficiency and sustainability of networked systems 
 Area 5: Security, Trust, and Privacy 
 Trust, security, and privacy in networked systems 
 Incentive mechanism and game theory of networked systems, network economics 
 Area 6: Emerging Applications and Systems 
 Internet-of-Things (IoT), networked embedded systems, wearables, and applications, e.g., mobile health 
 Virtual/augmented/mixed reality over networked systems 
 Smart spaces, e.g., smart cities, smart workspace, and smart buildings 
 Networked and mobile unmanned/autonomous systems, e.g., robotic/vehicular/drone networks 
 Goal-oriented semantic communication and networks 
 Blockchain, metaverse, and emerging networked systems 
 Authors canchoose to either keep or omit their names on their submitted paper, i.e., submissions are not required to be double blind. Authors can also prepare technical reports that are made available on their own websites and/or purely archiving websites such as arXiv.org. However, all submissions must comply with thehref="submission.html#dual-submission-policy" - dual submission policy
.Each paper has a chance to submit a one-page rebuttal for the reviews. All submitted papers will be considered for a Best Paper Award. A selected set of papers will be chosen for fast-tracked publication in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking. 
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.
