This year's conference is dedicated to the memory ofDr. Stuart Rubin, our Honorary General Chair. Dr. Rubin was among the warmest of personalities, and had been with IRI since day one. He will be missed, but not forgotten. We are currently planning for several events along with this year's IRI to honor Dr. Rubin. Please stay tuned."I have so many memories about Stuart.""He's such a pioneer. We lost a wonderful friend.""He was such a good friend and a generous, guiding presence in our community, always bringing people together with his wisdom and warmth. His leadership and unwavering dedication to IEEE IRI have left an indelible impact on all of us.""He was a very valued member of the IRI team and will be greatly missed.""I will always remember his wisdom, dedication, humor, and kindness. He will be deeply missed."If you want to share your own thoughts about Dr. Rubin on this webpage, please contactNan Niu-->Read MoreNews

 IRI'25 location and dates (12/9/2024)The 26th edition of IEEE IRI will take place in San Jose, CA, Aug 6-8, 2025. Please stay tuned for our call for papers, important dates, award and committee member nominations, travel support, and more!About IEEE IRI 
 Data science has become the new frontier for business analytics and AI. Such intelligent applications derive fromInformation Reuse and Integration(IRI). IRI seeks to maximize the utility of information by creating simple, rich, and cost-effective knowledge representations. IRI consequently explores strategies for integrating this knowledge into systems and applications. It plays a pivotal role in the capturing, representation, maintenance, integration, validation, and extrapolation of information and the knowledge derived from it. Additionally, IRI applies both information and knowledge for enhancing decision-making in various application domains. 
 This conference explores three major tracks:information reuse,information integration, andreusable systems.Information reuseexplores the theory and practice of optimizing representations;information integrationfocuses on innovative strategies and algorithms for unifying diverse information in novel domains; andreusable systemsfocus on developing and deploying models and corresponding processes that enableInformation ReuseandIntegrationto play a pivotal role in enhancing decision-making processes in various application domains. 
 The IEEE IRI conference serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that address real-world problems with real-world solutions. Theoretical and applied papers are both included. The conference program will include special sessions, open forum workshops, panels, and keynote speeches.

 About IEEE IRI 
 Data science has become the new frontier for self-driving cars and AI. Such intelligent applications derive fromInformation Reuse and Integration(IRI). IRI seeks to maximize the utility of information by creating simple, rich, and cost-effective knowledge representations and ontologies. IRI consequently explores strategies for integrating this knowledge into systems and applications. It plays a pivotal role in the capture, representation, maintenance, integration, validation, and extrapolation of information and the knowledge derived from it; and, it applies both information and knowledge for enhancing decision-making in various application domains.
