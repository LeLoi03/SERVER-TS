Submissions 
 There are two types of publications related to the EUSFLAT 2025 Conference. The first is the full paper in the conference proceedings. The full papers will be reviewed by independent reviewers and in the case of their acceptance, they will be published inLecture Notes Computer Science (LNCS) series, by Springer. The second type of publication is the abstract. The submitted abstracts will be considered by the programme committee mainly from the scope, relevance and the novelty points of view and in the case of their acceptance, they will be published in the Book of Abstracts. 
  
 Abstracts in the joint Book of Abstracts (Final Submission Deadline: April 30, 2025) 
 Preparing abstracts: Submitted abstracts are supposed to be of at most 1-page length. There is neither LaTeX nor MS Word format template as just a plain text is expected. The authors should submit their papers electronically, written in English, due to the given deadline, through EasyChair via the link:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eusflat2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/eusflat2025
. 
  
 Submitting abstracts: The abstract must be submitted through EasyChair system via the link:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eusflat2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/eusflat2025
. Do not enclose any attachment, edit the abstract directly in the online window of the EasyChair system. In the system you can choose one of the proposed special sessions or the general track of EUSFLAT 2025. 
  
 Publishing abstracts: The accepted abstracts will be published in a separate Book of Abstracts published by the University of Latvia. The Book will be equipped with ISBN number and it will contain also abstracts from the full papers submitted to the proceedings. This book will serve as a working material and an online copy will be distributed to all attendants at the conference site. 
  
 Full papers in the EUSFLAT 2025 proceedings (Final Submission Deadline: February 28, 2025) 
 The proceedings of EUSFLAT regarding the full papers will be published in the | Lecture Notes Computer Science (LNCS) series, by Springer | . 
 Authors should consult | href="Springer_Instructions_for_Authors_of_Proceedings_CS.pdf" - Springer’s authors’ instructions | and use the proceedings template, either for | LaTeX | or for | Word | , for the preparation of their papers. The LaTeX templates are also available in | Overleaf | . Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. 
 The length of a submission is at most 12 pages in the LNCS/CCIS one-column page format. 
 The paper must be written in English and submitted in PDF via the | href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eusflat2025" - EasyChair | system by the given deadline. 
 In the system you can choose one of the proposed special sessions or the general track of EUSFLAT 2025. 
 One full registration will allow acceptance of one paper. Each additional accepted paper associated with the same registration will be subject to an additional fee.
