 CALCO 
 Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer science. From data types to development techniques and specification formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from the large body of research proposed and implemented since the pioneering works of the 1960s. TheConference on Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science(CALCO) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science. CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques). 
 Usually, CALCO is co-located withMFPS.

Scope 
 ----- 
 Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer 
 science. From data types to development techniques and specification 
 formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from 
 the large body of research proposed and implemented since the 
 pioneering works of the 1960s. 
  
 CALCO aims to bring together researchers with interests in both 
 foundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in 
 computer science, traditional as well as emerging ones 
  
 CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the 
 forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on 
 Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on 
 Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place 
 in Salzburg (Austria, 2021), London (UK, 2019), Ljubljana 
 (Slovenia,2017), Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015), Warsaw (Poland, 
 2013), Winchester (UK, 2011), Udine (Italy, 2009), Bergen (Norway, 
 2007), Swansea (Wales, 2005). 
  
 The 10th edition will be held in Bloomington, Indiana, co-located with 
 MFPS XXXIX. It is planned as a physical, in-person event, with 
 support for remote presence, both for speakers and for other 
 participants who are unable or unwilling to travel. 

Submission Categories 
 --------------------- 
 CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and 
 coalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four 
 categories of submissions. 
  
 1. Regular papers that report 
 * results on theoretical foundations 
 * novel methods and techniques for software development 
 * experiences with technology transfer to industry. 
  
 2. (Co)Algebraic Pearls papers that 
 * present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way. 
  
 3. Early ideas abstracts that lead to 
 * presentations of work in progress 
 * proposals for original venues of research. 
  
 4. Tool presentation papers that 
 * report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools. 

Topics of Interests 
 ------------------- 
 All topics relating to algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications 
 are of interest for CALCO, and among them 
  
 * Models and logics 
 - Automata and languages 
 - Graph transformations and term rewriting 
 - Modal logics 
 - Proof systems 
 - Relational systems 
  
 * Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics 
 - Abstract data types 
 - Re-engineering techniques (program transformations) 
 - Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques 
 - Semantics of programming languages 
  
 * Methodologies in software and systems engineering 
 - Development processes 
 - Method integration 
 - Usage guidelines 
  
 * Specialised models and calculi 
 - Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems 
 - Concurrent, distributed, mobile, cyber-physical, 
 and context-aware computational paradigms 
 - Systems theory and computational models (chemical, biological, etc.) 
  
 * System specification and verification 
 - Formal testing and quality assurance 
 - Generative programming and model-driven development 
 - Integration of formal specification techniques 
 - Model-driven development 
 - Specification languages, methods, and environments 
  
 * Tools supporting algebraic and coalgebraic methods for 
 - Advances in automated verification 
 - Model checking 
 - Theorem proving 
 - Testing 
  
 * String diagrams and network theory 
 - Theory of PROPs and operads 
 - Rewriting problems and higher-dimensional approaches 
 - Automated reasoning with string diagrams 
 - Applications of string diagrams 
  
 * Quantum computing 
 - Categorical semantics for quantum computing 
 - Quantum calculi and programming languages 
 - Foundational structures for quantum computing 
 - Applications of quantum algebra 

Submissions Guidelines 
 ---------------------- 
 All submissions will be handled via EasyChair: 
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco2023 
  
 The format for all submissions is specified by LIPIcs. Please use the 
 latest version of the style: 
 http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/ 
  
 It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length. 
 Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. 

Regular papers 
 -------------- 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English 
 presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and 
 not submitted for publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be 
 maximum 15 pages long, excluding references. Proofs omitted due to space 
 limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix. 
  
 Proceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs Leibniz 
 International Proceedings in Informatics series. 
  
 A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in Computer 
 Science (http://www.lmcs-online.org), containing extended versions of 
 selected papers, is planned. 

(Co)algebraic pearls 
 -------------------- 
 This is a recent submission category. Explaining a known idea in a new 
 way may make as strong a contribution as inventing a new idea. We 
 encourage the submission of pearls: elegant essays that illustrate an 
 idea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing 
 an application. Pearls are typically short and concise and so should 
 not be longer than regular papers in the format specified by 
 LIPIcs. Authors who feel they need a bit more space should consult 
 with the PC co-chairs. The accepted papers will be included in the 
 final proceedings of the conference. Each submission will be evaluated 
 by at least two reviewers. 

Early ideas abstracts 
 --------------------- 
 Submissions should not exceed 2 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. 
 The volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on 
 the CALCO pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged 
 to disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere. Each 
 submission will be evaluated by at least two reviewers. 

Tool papers 
 ----------- 
 Submissions should not exceed 5 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. 
 The accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of 
 the conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the 
 time of submission for download and evaluation. Each submission will be 
 evaluated by at least three reviewers, and one or more of the reviewers 
 will be asked to download and use the tool. 

Best Paper and Best Presentation Awards 
 --------------------------------------- 
 This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose 
 recipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a 
 Best Presentation Award, elected by the participants.
