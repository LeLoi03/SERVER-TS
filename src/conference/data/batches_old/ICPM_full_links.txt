 Welcome to Montevideo! 
 Source:Uruguay XXI 
 I am delighted and honored to welcome you to the beautiful and vibrant city ofMontevideo, Uruguay, over the River Plate, for the7th International Conference on Process Mining (ICPM 2025)bringing the conference for the first time to Latin America. The 2025 edition of ICPM will be held fromOctober 20 to October 24, 2025, atFacultad de Ingeniería(FING),Universidad de la República(UdelaR). 
 The conference is organized by theCOALresearch group of theInstituto de Computación(InCo), FING, UdelaR. InCo was a pioneer in Latin America in the development of computer science careers in the ICT area, offering nowadays several undergraduate and graduate academic and professional options widely recognized in the region. Uruguay has a thrivingsoftware industryleader in Latin America with several national and international enterprises in Montevideo, as well as apublic sectorleader ine-Government index, and a constant technological development, embracing new ideas, technologies and tools. 
 ICPM has consolidated as the leading event for process mining, where key actors such as vendors, consultants, customers, end-users, students and researches can meet to discuss ideas, share insights, foster innovation, and explore new frontiers in the field. ICPM in Montevideo will continue this tradition, providing a unique opportunity to bring together the Latin American and International scientific process mining community, as well as software enterprises and professionals, with an appealing scientific and industry program, promoting new collaborations and networking opportunities. 
 We are looking forward to meeting you all in Montevideo, Uruguay !

 International Conference on Processs Mining 
 International Conference on Processs Mining 
 The International Conference on Process Mining (ICPM) is the flagship conference of the international process mining community.Thehref="https://icpmconference.org/2019/" - first ICPM conference
that took place inAachen(Germany) in June 2019 turned out to be an immediate success. Over 420 participants attended the first process mining conference. The interaction between top scientists, the leading vendors, and process mining practitioners makes this conference unique. 
 Thehref="https://icpmconference.org/2020/" - second ICPM conference
was organized by theUniversity of Padua(Italy) but took place virtually in October 2020. The conference featured, next to the main scientific track, focused workshops (on specific topics in process mining) and an industry day with presentations about large-scale process mining applications. 
 Thehref="https://icpmconference.org/2021/" - third ICPM conference
was organized by theEindhoven University of Technology(The Netherlands), took place late October - early November 2021 and also featured a mainscientific track, focused workshops and an industry day. However, the setup of the presentations were changed to 15 minutes per presentations followed by a panel discussion per session, which led to engaging discussions. Furthermore, thehref="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-98581-3" - workshop papers
were published open-access. 
 Thehref="https://icpmconference.org/2022/" - fourth ICPM conference
was organized by theFree University of Bozen-Bolzano(Italy), took place from October 23 to October 28, 2022. Like the earlier conferences, this conference featured a main scientific track, focused workshop and an industry day. The presentation setup was changed slightly to allow for 5 minutes of questions following every presentation. 
 Thehref="https://icpmconference.org/2023/" - fifth ICPM conference
was organized by theSapienza University of Rome(Italy), and took place from October 23 to October 27, 2023. 
 Thehref="https://icpmconference.org/2024/" - sixth ICPM conference
was organized by thehref="https://www.dtu.dk/" - Technical University of Denmark (DTU)
(Lyngby, Denmark), and took place from October 14 to October 18, 2024. 
 After the large successes of these first six editions, thehref="https://icpmconference.org/2025/" - Seventh International Conference on Process Mining
href="https://icpmconference.org/2025/" - (
href="https://icpmconference.org/2025/" - ICPM 2025
href="https://icpmconference.org/2025/" - )
will be organized by theUniversidad de la Repúblicaand willtake place in Montevideo, Uruguay, from October 20 to October 25, 2025. The ICPM 2025 website is continuously updated as soon as new aspects of the conference organisation are confirmed! 
 The ICPM conference series was created by the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining after two decades of process mining research. It is the first and only vendor-independent process mining conference and brings together the leading minds in process mining. Seehref="https://icpmconference.org" - https://icpmconference.org
