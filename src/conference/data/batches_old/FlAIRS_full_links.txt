 The Florida 
 Artificial Intelligence 
 Research Society 
 The Florida AI Research Society was founded in 1987 to promote and advance Artificial Intelligence within the State of Florida, including interaction between researchers at the various colleges, universities, and industry. Membership is open to all (Florida residents and non-residents) that attend the yearly conference. 
 From its inception, one major goal of the society has been to promote AI through a conference. These conferences have been held yearly since the spring of 1988. During the first two years, participation was restricted to State of Florida residents. Since 1990, the conference has been open to all. In 1995 the conference title was changed to "The International FLAIRS Conference" to recognize the contribution of the international participants within the conference. The last several years has seen a fairly even split of conference participants between Floridians, North Americans, and Internationals. 
 Devoted to the promotion of Artificial Intelligence in the State of Florida.

Human-Computer Interaction in Aeronautics Conference (HCI) 
 The HCI-Aero conferences on HCI applications in aerospace originated in Toulouse, France. They have been held biannually since 1986, and has alternated between Europe and North American since 1998. The 2002 conference, held in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Volpe National Transportation Systems Center. The conference was held in cooperation with ACM’s Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (ACM SIGCHI). 
 |2002| 
 International Conference on Computational Cultural Dynamics Conference (ICCCD) 
 Computer technology is leading to sweeping changes in how we can reason about groups in diverse cultures. These developments are inherently cross-disciplinary. They blend the behavioral and social sciences—fields such as political science, psychology, journalism, anthropology, and sociology—with technological fields such as computer science, computational linguistics, game theory, and operations research. There is a need to bring these cultures together to help forge a common understanding of principles, techniques, and application areas. That is the purpose of this conference. 
 |2007|2008| 
 International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 
 The International Conference on Machine Learning brought together researchers to exchange ideas and report progress in the computational study of learning. 
 |2003| 
 International Conference on Multiagent Systems (ICMAS) 
 The Conference on Multi-Agent Systems is a joint effort of the North American distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) community, the Japanese multi-agent and cooperative computing (MACC) community, and the European modeling autonomous agents in a multi-agent world (MAAMAW) community. This conference was initiated as a result of the growing recognition of the importance of multi-agent systems and architectures to fundamental issues in computer science and to the development of commercial network applications. 
 |1996|1995| 
 Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) 
 Sponsored by the American Association for Artificial Intelligence 
 Advances in data gathering, storage, and distribution technologies have far outpaced our advances in techniques for helping humans analyze, understand, and digest this information. This has led to an all-too-common data glut situation creating a strong need and a valuable opportunity for extracting knowledge from databases. Both researchers and application developers have been responding to that need. Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) and data mining are areas of common interest to researchers in machine learning, pattern recognition, statistics, intelligent databases, knowledge acquisition, data visualization, high performance computing, and expert systems. KDD applications have been developed for astronomy, biology, finance, insurance, marketing, medicine, and many other fields. The papers in these proceedings focus on such problems. 
 |1998|1997|1996|1995| 
 Midwest AI and Cognitive Science Society (MAICS) 
 The MAICS conference is a relatively small regional conference that traditionally accepts papers from all areas of artificial intelligence and cognitive science, including computational linguistics, logic and automated reasoning, knowledge representation, learning, and philosophy of mind. Graduate students and junior faculty are especially encouraged to submit papers. The broad range of possible topics together with the fact that usually only about 20 to 30 submitted papers are accepted, which are mixed with presentations by well-known scientists, make the MAICS conference a very special event that has served as a first time presentation opportunity for many graduate students and has even attracted international participants. 
 |2000|1999|1998|1997| 
 Multistrategy Learning (MSL) 
 The theme of the conference—multistrategy learning—concerns theoretical and empirical issues in the development of learning systems that employ multiple inferential and/or computational strategies. 
 |1996| 
 Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) 
 The Knowledge Representation (KR) conferences have established themselves as the leading forum for timely, in-depth presentation of progress in the theory and principles underlying the representation and computational manipulation of knowledge. 
 |2018|2016|2014|2012|2010|2008|2006|2004| 
 Symposium on Abstraction, Reformulation, and Approximation (SARA) 
 The Symposium on Abstraction, Reformulation, and Approximation (SARA) was established in 1994 after a series of workshops in 1988, 1990, and 1992.
