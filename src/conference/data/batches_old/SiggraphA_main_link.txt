 “I am so impressed and grateful to the organizers for their remarkable accomplishment of bringing together a seamless and impactful SIGGRAPH Asia. It was a beautifully curated collection of creativity and technology, which was very much needed in this current situation. The event fulfilled beyond my hopes the goal of bringing to the forefront the incredible work done across the world that would have otherwise been hidden underneath today’s noise. Thank you, SIGGRAPH Asia!”
