  Paper Submission Instructions   
  
  To submit a paper to ATSIP’2024, please read the entire submission instructions carefully to verify that your paper document is formatted correctly and that you have all the information you need before starting your paper submission. The following sections contains detailed instructions on formatting your document and completing the submission process, as well as a description of how the review process works and how to prepare for your presentation at the conference if your paper is accepted.    
  
  I. Originality & Plagiarism Policy    
 Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for this conference.  
   
  Registered and Presented papers will be submitted for possible inclusion into IEEE Xplore as well as other Abstracting and Indexing (A&I) databases.  
   
  Papers submitted to ATSIP’2024 will be automatically checked for plagiarism (including self-plagiarism) using electronic databases, including other submissions to the same conference. Severe cases of plagiarism will result in rejection of a manuscript. The most common mistake by authors is cutting and pasting from previous versions of manuscripts describing earlier stages of the same work. The following link provides helpful and detailed guidelines for identifying and handling instances of plagiarism  

 http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/plagiarism.html    

  II. Paper Format      
 Language:   Submitted papers should be written in the English language 
  Number of Pages  :  6 pages max, including figures, tables & references. Papers longer than 6 pages will not be reviewed. 
  Page Size   : A4 format 
  Page Numbering  :  Off 
  File Format  :   PDF only 
  File Size:    4MB maximum 
  Abstract:     It is important that the abstract be a meaningful description of your paper. 
  Keywords:    Choose from 3 to 8  keywords. 
  Color:    Use of color is encouraged, but since readers will usually print the papers in black and white  , it is the author’s responsibility to ensure that all figures/plots can be printed and understood in black and white. Reviewers are not required to read your paper in color. 
  III. Templates      
 To help ensure correct formatting, please use the standard IEEE Transactions templates for Microsoft Word or LaTeX formats found the link below as templates for your submission.      
 https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html    
 As the page indicates, IEEE has recently revised their LaTeX templates. If you had previously downloaded these templates please revisit this site to access the latest version.      
  
  IV. Single-blind review process      
 All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through a Single-blind reviewing process   : authors declare their names and affiliations in the manuscript for the reviewers to see, but reviewers do not know each other's identities, nor do the authors receive information about who has reviewed their manuscript.      
 V. Online Regular Paper Submission      
 The online paper submission system is now open. Submitted papers should be uploaded through the Easychair conference management system.  
  To submit your paper, please follow the instructions below.
