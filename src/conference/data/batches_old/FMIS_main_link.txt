 Historically, formal methods academic research and practical software development have had limited mutual interactions — except possibly in specialized domains such as safety-critical software. In recent times, the outlook has considerably improved: on the one hand, formal methods research has delivered more flexible techniques and tools that can support various aspects of the software development process — from user requirements elicitation, to design, implementation, verification and validation, as well as the creation of documentation. On the other hand, software engineering has developed a growing interest in rigorous techniques applied at scale. 
 The FormaliSE conference series promotes work at the intersection of the formal methods and software engineering communities, providing a venue to exchange ideas, experiences, techniques, and results. We believe more collaboration between these two communities can be mutually beneficial by fostering the creation of formal methods that are practically useful and by helping develop higher-quality software. 
 Originally a workshop event, since 2018 FormaliSE has been organized as a conference co-located with ICSE. The 13th edition of FormaliSE will also take place as a co-located conference of ICSE 2025. 
 Area of interest include: 
 requirements formalization and formal specification; 
 approaches, methods and tools for verification and validation; 
 formal approaches to safety and security related issues; 
 analysis of performance and other non-functional properties based on formal approaches; 
 scalability of formal method applications 
 integration of formal methods within the software development lifecycle (e.g., change -management, continuous integration, regression testing, and deployment) 
 model-based engineering approaches; 
 correctness-by-construction approaches for software and systems engineering; 
 application of formal methods to specific domains, e.g., autonomous, cyber-physical, intelligent, and IoT systems; 
 formal methods for AI-based systems (FM4AI), and AI applied in formal method approaches (AI4FM); 
 formal methods in a certification context 
 case studies developed/analyzed with formal approaches 
 experience reports on the application of formal methods to real-world problems; 
 guidelines to use formal methods in practice; 
 usability of formal methods.

 07:00 - 19:00 | Ready Room Sundayhref="https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2025/icse-2025-social-and-networking" - ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms
athref="https://2025.formalise.org/room/icse-2025-venue-209" - 209
 
 The Ready Room will be available throughout the week. There will be some tables with computers where people can edit presentations (bring on a USB stick) and upload presentations to the presentation rooms through the Contact 1 website. There will also be AV technicians to help if needed. 
 You do not need to use the Ready Room: You have several choices: You can upload your presentation from your own computer in advance of your session (days in advance even) at the Contact 1 website (you will be sent a link). Or you can plug your computer in using an HDMI cable when you are starting your presentation. This last option is available but not recommended, since it increases the chance of delays. 
 There will be some tables and couches in the Ready Room where you can get work done, or have small get-togethers with people. 
 This room will not be ‘quiet’. If you want a quiet place to work or chill out (library quiet, no talking) then Room 209 will be available much of the time. 
 The Ready Room will also have some poster boards.

 Call for Papers 
 We accept papers in three categories: 
 Full research papers | describing original research work and results. We encourage authors to include validation of their contributions by means of a case study or experiments. We also welcome research papers focusing on tools and tool development. 
 Case study papers | discussing a significant application that suggests general lessons learned and motivates further research, or empirically validates theoretical results (such as a technique’s scalability). 
 Research ideas papers | describing new ideas in preliminary form, in a way that can stimulate interesting discussions at the conference, and suggest future work. 
 All papers submitted to the FormaliSE 2025 conference must be written in English, must be unpublished original work, and must not be under review or submitted elsewhere at the time of submission. Submissions must comply with the FormaliSE’s lightweight double-anonymous review process (see below). 
 Full research papers and case study papers can take up to 10 pages including all text, figures, tables and appendices, but excluding references. Research ideas papers can take up to 4 pages, plus up to 1 additional page solely for references. 
 To avoid that authors waste time fitting their papers into the stated limit at the expense of presentation clarity, paper lengths slightly exceeding the stated limit will still be considered, provided that the reviewers find that the presentation is of high quality. 
 All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to theIEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (i.e., title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type). In LaTeX, use\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}without including thecompsocorcompsocconfoptions. Note that IEEE format is being used this year, whereas last year it was ACM format, hence the appearance will differ from year to year. 
 To submit a paper to FormaliSE 2025 usethe following HotCRP link. 
 href="#lightweight-double-anonymous-review-process-for-papers" - Lightweight Double-Anonymous Review Process for Papers
As in recent editions, FormaliSE 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous process. Authors must omit their names and institutions from the title page, cite their own work in the third person, and omit acknowledgments that may reveal their identity or affiliation. The purpose is reducing chances of reviewer bias influenced by the authors’ identities. The double-anonymous process is, however, lightweight, which means that it should not pose a heavy burden for authors, nor should make a paper’s presentation weaker or more difficult to review. Also, advertising the paper as part of your usual research activities (for example, on your personal web-page, in a pre-print archive, by email, in talks or discussions with colleagues) is permitted without penalties. 
 PAPER SELECTION 
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three program committee members that will judge its overall quality in terms of its soundness, significance, novelty, verifiability, and presentation clarity. 
 FormaliSE 2025 will adopt a lightweight response process: if all the reviewers of a given paper agree that a clarification from the authors regarding a specific question could move the paper from “borderline” to “accept”, the chairs will relay the reviewers’ questions to the authors by email, and then share their reply with the reviewers in HotCRP. The goal of lightweight responses is reducing the chance of random decisions on borderline papers. Hence, they will only be used for a minority of submissions; most papers will not require such an author response. Nevertheless, we would ask the corresponding authors of all submissions to make sure that they are available to answer questions by email upon request. 
 PUBLICATION 
 All accepted papers are published as part of the ICSE 2025 Proceedings in the ACM and IEEE Digital Libraries. 
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference and present the paper at the conference — physically or, if the circumstances do not allow so, virtually. Failure to register an author will result in a paper being removed from the proceedings. 
 Keynotes 
 Adversarial Perturbations and Self-Defenses for Large Language Models on Coding Task 
 Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for coding tasks including writing and reasoning about code. They improve upon previous neural network models of code that already demonstrated competitive results when performing tasks such as code summarization and identifying code vulnerabilities . However, it is known that these pre-LLM code models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e. small syntactic perturbations that do not change the program’s semantics, such as the inclusion of “dead code” through false conditions, the addition of inconsequential print statements, or change in control flow, designed to “fool” the models. LLMs can also be vulnerable to the same adversarial perturbations. In this talk we discuss the effect of adversarial perturbations on coding tasks with LLMs and propose effective defenses against such adversaries. The coding tasks we’ll consider include both classification (e.g., use LLMs for summarization, vulnerability detection) and code generation (e.g., use LLMs for code completion, based on prompts plus code snippets).

Assuring AI in Autonomous Driving: Challenges and Emerging Approaches 
 Abstract:Artificial intelligence plays a critical role in autonomous driving, yet it introduces significant assurance challenges. Unlike traditional software, AI lacks explicit specifications and is applied to inherently uncertain, complex, and open problems such as road environment perception. Furthermore, modern AI systems are often opaque, making interpretability and verification difficult. These issues complicate the development of assurance methods that can ensure safety and reliability. 
 In this talk, I will review current approaches and industry standards for AI assurance in autonomous driving, including scenario-based testing and uncertainty estimation. I will discuss assurance methods for both hybrid systems — where AI functions as a component within a classical software stack — and end-to-end AI-driven systems. Finally, I will explore emerging directions for handling edge-case scenarios, including the use of foundation models and dual-processing architectures as potential solutions for enhancing the safety and robustness of end-to-end AI systems.

 Historically, formal methods academic research and practical software development have had limited mutual interactions — except possibly in specialized domains such as safety-critical software. In recent times, the outlook has considerably improved: on the one hand, formal methods research has delivered more flexible techniques and tools that can support various aspects of the software development process — from user requirements elicitation, to design, implementation, verification and validation, as well as the creation of documentation. On the other hand, software engineering has developed a growing interest in rigorous techniques applied at scale. 
 The FormaliSE conference series promotes work at the intersection of the formal methods and software engineering communities, providing a venue to exchange ideas, experiences, techniques, and results. We believe more collaboration between these two communities can be mutually beneficial by fostering the creation of formal methods that are practically useful and by helping develop higher-quality software. 
 Originally a workshop event, since 2018 FormaliSE has been organized as a conference co-located with ICSE. The 13th edition of FormaliSE will also take place as a co-located conference of ICSE 2025. 
 Area of interest include: 
 requirements formalization and formal specification; 
 approaches, methods and tools for verification and validation; 
 formal approaches to safety and security related issues; 
 analysis of performance and other non-functional properties based on formal approaches; 
 scalability of formal method applications 
 integration of formal methods within the software development lifecycle (e.g., change -management, continuous integration, regression testing, and deployment) 
 model-based engineering approaches; 
 correctness-by-construction approaches for software and systems engineering; 
 application of formal methods to specific domains, e.g., autonomous, cyber-physical, intelligent, and IoT systems; 
 formal methods for AI-based systems (FM4AI), and AI applied in formal method approaches (AI4FM); 
 formal methods in a certification context 
 case studies developed/analyzed with formal approaches 
 experience reports on the application of formal methods to real-world problems; 
 guidelines to use formal methods in practice; 
 usability of formal methods.

 The Ready Room will be available throughout the week. There will be some tables with computers where people can edit presentations (bring on a USB stick) and upload presentations to the presentation rooms through the Contact 1 website. There will also be AV technicians to help if needed. 
 You do not need to use the Ready Room: You have several choices: You can upload your presentation from your own computer in advance of your session (days in advance even) at the Contact 1 website (you will be sent a link). Or you can plug your computer in using an HDMI cable when you are starting your presentation. This last option is available but not recommended, since it increases the chance of delays. 
 There will be some tables and couches in the Ready Room where you can get work done, or have small get-togethers with people. 
 This room will not be ‘quiet’. If you want a quiet place to work or chill out (library quiet, no talking) then Room 209 will be available much of the time. 
 The Ready Room will also have some poster boards.

 The Ready Room will be available throughout the week. There will be some tables with computers where people can edit presentations (bring on a USB stick) and upload presentations to the presentation rooms through the Contact 1 website. There will also be AV technicians to help if needed. 
 You do not need to use the Ready Room: You have several choices: You can upload your presentation from your own computer in advance of your session (days in advance even) at the Contact 1 website (you will be sent a link). Or you can plug your computer in using an HDMI cable when you are starting your presentation. This last option is available but not recommended, since it increases the chance of delays. 
 There will be some tables and couches in the Ready Room where you can get work done, or have small get-togethers with people. 
 This room will not be ‘quiet’. If you want a quiet place to work or chill out (library quiet, no talking) then Room 209 will be available much of the time. 
 The Ready Room will also have some poster boards.

 Call for Papers 
 We accept papers in three categories: 
 Full research papers | describing original research work and results. We encourage authors to include validation of their contributions by means of a case study or experiments. We also welcome research papers focusing on tools and tool development. 
 Case study papers | discussing a significant application that suggests general lessons learned and motivates further research, or empirically validates theoretical results (such as a technique’s scalability). 
 Research ideas papers | describing new ideas in preliminary form, in a way that can stimulate interesting discussions at the conference, and suggest future work. 
 All papers submitted to the FormaliSE 2025 conference must be written in English, must be unpublished original work, and must not be under review or submitted elsewhere at the time of submission. Submissions must comply with the FormaliSE’s lightweight double-anonymous review process (see below). 
 Full research papers and case study papers can take up to 10 pages including all text, figures, tables and appendices, but excluding references. Research ideas papers can take up to 4 pages, plus up to 1 additional page solely for references. 
 To avoid that authors waste time fitting their papers into the stated limit at the expense of presentation clarity, paper lengths slightly exceeding the stated limit will still be considered, provided that the reviewers find that the presentation is of high quality. 
 All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to theIEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (i.e., title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type). In LaTeX, use\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}without including thecompsocorcompsocconfoptions. Note that IEEE format is being used this year, whereas last year it was ACM format, hence the appearance will differ from year to year. 
 To submit a paper to FormaliSE 2025 usethe following HotCRP link. 
 href="#lightweight-double-anonymous-review-process-for-papers" - Lightweight Double-Anonymous Review Process for Papers
As in recent editions, FormaliSE 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous process. Authors must omit their names and institutions from the title page, cite their own work in the third person, and omit acknowledgments that may reveal their identity or affiliation. The purpose is reducing chances of reviewer bias influenced by the authors’ identities. The double-anonymous process is, however, lightweight, which means that it should not pose a heavy burden for authors, nor should make a paper’s presentation weaker or more difficult to review. Also, advertising the paper as part of your usual research activities (for example, on your personal web-page, in a pre-print archive, by email, in talks or discussions with colleagues) is permitted without penalties. 
 PAPER SELECTION 
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three program committee members that will judge its overall quality in terms of its soundness, significance, novelty, verifiability, and presentation clarity. 
 FormaliSE 2025 will adopt a lightweight response process: if all the reviewers of a given paper agree that a clarification from the authors regarding a specific question could move the paper from “borderline” to “accept”, the chairs will relay the reviewers’ questions to the authors by email, and then share their reply with the reviewers in HotCRP. The goal of lightweight responses is reducing the chance of random decisions on borderline papers. Hence, they will only be used for a minority of submissions; most papers will not require such an author response. Nevertheless, we would ask the corresponding authors of all submissions to make sure that they are available to answer questions by email upon request. 
 PUBLICATION 
 All accepted papers are published as part of the ICSE 2025 Proceedings in the ACM and IEEE Digital Libraries. 
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference and present the paper at the conference — physically or, if the circumstances do not allow so, virtually. Failure to register an author will result in a paper being removed from the proceedings. 
 Keynotes 
 Adversarial Perturbations and Self-Defenses for Large Language Models on Coding Task 
 Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for coding tasks including writing and reasoning about code. They improve upon previous neural network models of code that already demonstrated competitive results when performing tasks such as code summarization and identifying code vulnerabilities . However, it is known that these pre-LLM code models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e. small syntactic perturbations that do not change the program’s semantics, such as the inclusion of “dead code” through false conditions, the addition of inconsequential print statements, or change in control flow, designed to “fool” the models. LLMs can also be vulnerable to the same adversarial perturbations. In this talk we discuss the effect of adversarial perturbations on coding tasks with LLMs and propose effective defenses against such adversaries. The coding tasks we’ll consider include both classification (e.g., use LLMs for summarization, vulnerability detection) and code generation (e.g., use LLMs for code completion, based on prompts plus code snippets).

Assuring AI in Autonomous Driving: Challenges and Emerging Approaches 
 Abstract:Artificial intelligence plays a critical role in autonomous driving, yet it introduces significant assurance challenges. Unlike traditional software, AI lacks explicit specifications and is applied to inherently uncertain, complex, and open problems such as road environment perception. Furthermore, modern AI systems are often opaque, making interpretability and verification difficult. These issues complicate the development of assurance methods that can ensure safety and reliability. 
 In this talk, I will review current approaches and industry standards for AI assurance in autonomous driving, including scenario-based testing and uncertainty estimation. I will discuss assurance methods for both hybrid systems — where AI functions as a component within a classical software stack — and end-to-end AI-driven systems. Finally, I will explore emerging directions for handling edge-case scenarios, including the use of foundation models and dual-processing architectures as potential solutions for enhancing the safety and robustness of end-to-end AI systems.

 Historically, formal methods academic research and practical software development have had limited mutual interactions — except possibly in specialized domains such as safety-critical software. In recent times, the outlook has considerably improved: on the one hand, formal methods research has delivered more flexible techniques and tools that can support various aspects of the software development process — from user requirements elicitation, to design, implementation, verification and validation, as well as the creation of documentation. On the other hand, software engineering has developed a growing interest in rigorous techniques applied at scale. 
 The FormaliSE conference series promotes work at the intersection of the formal methods and software engineering communities, providing a venue to exchange ideas, experiences, techniques, and results. We believe more collaboration between these two communities can be mutually beneficial by fostering the creation of formal methods that are practically useful and by helping develop higher-quality software. 
 Originally a workshop event, since 2018 FormaliSE has been organized as a conference co-located with ICSE. The 13th edition of FormaliSE will also take place as a co-located conference of ICSE 2025. 
 Area of interest include: 
 requirements formalization and formal specification; 
 approaches, methods and tools for verification and validation; 
 formal approaches to safety and security related issues; 
 analysis of performance and other non-functional properties based on formal approaches; 
 scalability of formal method applications 
 integration of formal methods within the software development lifecycle (e.g., change -management, continuous integration, regression testing, and deployment) 
 model-based engineering approaches; 
 correctness-by-construction approaches for software and systems engineering; 
 application of formal methods to specific domains, e.g., autonomous, cyber-physical, intelligent, and IoT systems; 
 formal methods for AI-based systems (FM4AI), and AI applied in formal method approaches (AI4FM); 
 formal methods in a certification context 
 case studies developed/analyzed with formal approaches 
 experience reports on the application of formal methods to real-world problems; 
 guidelines to use formal methods in practice; 
 usability of formal methods.

athref="https://2025.formalise.org/room/icse-2025-venue-209" - 209
 
 The Ready Room will be available throughout the week. There will be some tables with computers where people can edit presentations (bring on a USB stick) and upload presentations to the presentation rooms through the Contact 1 website. There will also be AV technicians to help if needed. 
 You do not need to use the Ready Room: You have several choices: You can upload your presentation from your own computer in advance of your session (days in advance even) at the Contact 1 website (you will be sent a link). Or you can plug your computer in using an HDMI cable when you are starting your presentation. This last option is available but not recommended, since it increases the chance of delays. 
 There will be some tables and couches in the Ready Room where you can get work done, or have small get-togethers with people. 
 This room will not be ‘quiet’. If you want a quiet place to work or chill out (library quiet, no talking) then Room 209 will be available much of the time. 
 The Ready Room will also have some poster boards.

 Call for Papers 
 We accept papers in three categories: 
 Full research papers | describing original research work and results. We encourage authors to include validation of their contributions by means of a case study or experiments. We also welcome research papers focusing on tools and tool development. 
 Case study papers | discussing a significant application that suggests general lessons learned and motivates further research, or empirically validates theoretical results (such as a technique’s scalability). 
 Research ideas papers | describing new ideas in preliminary form, in a way that can stimulate interesting discussions at the conference, and suggest future work. 
 All papers submitted to the FormaliSE 2025 conference must be written in English, must be unpublished original work, and must not be under review or submitted elsewhere at the time of submission. Submissions must comply with the FormaliSE’s lightweight double-anonymous review process (see below). 
 Full research papers and case study papers can take up to 10 pages including all text, figures, tables and appendices, but excluding references. Research ideas papers can take up to 4 pages, plus up to 1 additional page solely for references. 
 To avoid that authors waste time fitting their papers into the stated limit at the expense of presentation clarity, paper lengths slightly exceeding the stated limit will still be considered, provided that the reviewers find that the presentation is of high quality. 
 All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to theIEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (i.e., title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type). In LaTeX, use\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}without including thecompsocorcompsocconfoptions. Note that IEEE format is being used this year, whereas last year it was ACM format, hence the appearance will differ from year to year. 
 To submit a paper to FormaliSE 2025 usethe following HotCRP link. 
 href="#lightweight-double-anonymous-review-process-for-papers" - Lightweight Double-Anonymous Review Process for Papers
As in recent editions, FormaliSE 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous process. Authors must omit their names and institutions from the title page, cite their own work in the third person, and omit acknowledgments that may reveal their identity or affiliation. The purpose is reducing chances of reviewer bias influenced by the authors’ identities. The double-anonymous process is, however, lightweight, which means that it should not pose a heavy burden for authors, nor should make a paper’s presentation weaker or more difficult to review. Also, advertising the paper as part of your usual research activities (for example, on your personal web-page, in a pre-print archive, by email, in talks or discussions with colleagues) is permitted without penalties. 
 PAPER SELECTION 
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three program committee members that will judge its overall quality in terms of its soundness, significance, novelty, verifiability, and presentation clarity. 
 FormaliSE 2025 will adopt a lightweight response process: if all the reviewers of a given paper agree that a clarification from the authors regarding a specific question could move the paper from “borderline” to “accept”, the chairs will relay the reviewers’ questions to the authors by email, and then share their reply with the reviewers in HotCRP. The goal of lightweight responses is reducing the chance of random decisions on borderline papers. Hence, they will only be used for a minority of submissions; most papers will not require such an author response. Nevertheless, we would ask the corresponding authors of all submissions to make sure that they are available to answer questions by email upon request. 
 PUBLICATION 
 All accepted papers are published as part of the ICSE 2025 Proceedings in the ACM and IEEE Digital Libraries. 
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference and present the paper at the conference — physically or, if the circumstances do not allow so, virtually. Failure to register an author will result in a paper being removed from the proceedings. 
 Keynotes 
 Adversarial Perturbations and Self-Defenses for Large Language Models on Coding Task 
 Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for coding tasks including writing and reasoning about code. They improve upon previous neural network models of code that already demonstrated competitive results when performing tasks such as code summarization and identifying code vulnerabilities . However, it is known that these pre-LLM code models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e. small syntactic perturbations that do not change the program’s semantics, such as the inclusion of “dead code” through false conditions, the addition of inconsequential print statements, or change in control flow, designed to “fool” the models. LLMs can also be vulnerable to the same adversarial perturbations. In this talk we discuss the effect of adversarial perturbations on coding tasks with LLMs and propose effective defenses against such adversaries. The coding tasks we’ll consider include both classification (e.g., use LLMs for summarization, vulnerability detection) and code generation (e.g., use LLMs for code completion, based on prompts plus code snippets).

Assuring AI in Autonomous Driving: Challenges and Emerging Approaches 
 Abstract:Artificial intelligence plays a critical role in autonomous driving, yet it introduces significant assurance challenges. Unlike traditional software, AI lacks explicit specifications and is applied to inherently uncertain, complex, and open problems such as road environment perception. Furthermore, modern AI systems are often opaque, making interpretability and verification difficult. These issues complicate the development of assurance methods that can ensure safety and reliability. 
 In this talk, I will review current approaches and industry standards for AI assurance in autonomous driving, including scenario-based testing and uncertainty estimation. I will discuss assurance methods for both hybrid systems — where AI functions as a component within a classical software stack — and end-to-end AI-driven systems. Finally, I will explore emerging directions for handling edge-case scenarios, including the use of foundation models and dual-processing architectures as potential solutions for enhancing the safety and robustness of end-to-end AI systems.
