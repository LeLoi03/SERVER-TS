 The 19th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering 
 TASE 2025 
 July 14-16, 2025 
 Limassol, Cyprus 
 WELCOME 
 The 19th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering (TASE 2025) will be held in Limassol, Cyprus on July 14-16, 2025. TASE 2025 aims to provide a forum for people from academia and industry to communicate their latest results on innovative advances in software engineering. Modern society is increasingly dependent on software systems that are becoming larger and more complex. This poses new challenges to the various aspects of software engineering, for instance, software dependability in trusted computing, interaction with physical components in cyber physical systems, quality assurance in AI-embedded systems, distribution in cloud computing applications, security and privacy in general. Hence, new concepts and methodologies are required to enhance the development of software engineering from theoretical aspects. 
 TASE 2025 is the 19th in the TASE series. The past TASE symposia were successfully held in Shanghai (’07), Nanjing (’08), Tianjin (’09), Taipei (’10), Xi’an (’11), Beijing (’12), Birmingham (’13), Changsha(’14), Nanjing(’15), Shanghai(’16), Nice(’17), Guangzhou(’18), Guilin(’19), Hangzhou (’20), Shanghai (’21), Cluj-Napoca (’22), Bristol (’23),Guiyang (’24). 
 The proceedings of the TASE 2025 symposium will be published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Springer). The authors of a selected subset of accepted papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers in the journal Science of Computer Programming (https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/science-of-computer-programming).
