 Welcome to the IEEE ICIP 2025 
 Welcome to the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing, IEEE ICIP 2025, in the stunning city of Anchorage Alaska, USA! We are pleased to have you join us at this prestigious event, where prominent experts, academicians, innovative professionals and practitioners, and international collaborative work specialists come together to shape the future of image & video processing and computer vision industry. 
 Anchorage, the Last Frontier, offers a unique setting for our conference. With its spectacular landscapes of majestic mountains, glacial vistas, and pristine wildlife, this vibrant town is not only the gateway to Alaska’s natural beauty but also a hub for dynamic global connections. While you are here, we encourage you to explore the unique charm of Anchorage as this unique city and State offer something for everyone that range from outdoor adventure to a thriving culinary industry. Besides the technical program, we will have an excellent social program that includes activities designed for everyone. Please make sure to stay tuned for updates on our exciting pre-and-post-conference tours coming soon. 
 Our theme for this year’s IEEE ICIP conference is “Imaging in the Age of GenAI,” reflecting our commitment to pushing boundaries and fostering collaboration across diverse fields. 
 IEEE ICIP 2025 is recognized as the Signal Processing Society’s (SPS) largest and most comprehensive conference dedicated to image & video processing and computer vision. During the conference period, September 14 – 17, 2025, you will have the opportunity to engage with distinguished plenary speakers, talented tutorial organizers, and expert workshop planners and to participate in thought-provoking oral and poster sessions, connecting with peers who share your passion for discovery and excellence. In addition, we invite you to take advantage of our top-notch industry program that includes panels, keynote speakers, forums, and more. 
 The Organizing Committee works diligently to craft a high-level scientific and social program for IEEE ICIP 2025 that will normalize outstanding science, engineering, and social interactions. The Organizing Committee members of the conference look forward to welcoming you in person in Anchorage in September 2025.
