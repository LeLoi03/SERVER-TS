 The Ready Room will be available throughout the week. There will be some tables with computers where people can edit presentations (bring on a USB stick) and upload presentations to the presentation rooms through the Contact 1 website. There will also be AV technicians to help if needed. 
 You do not need to use the Ready Room: You have several choices: You can upload your presentation from your own computer in advance of your session (days in advance even) at the Contact 1 website (you will be sent a link). Or you can plug your computer in using an HDMI cable when you are starting your presentation. This last option is available but not recommended, since it increases the chance of delays. 
 There will be some tables and couches in the Ready Room where you can get work done, or have small get-togethers with people. 
 This room will not be ‘quiet’. If you want a quiet place to work or chill out (library quiet, no talking) then Room 209 will be available much of the time. 
 The Ready Room will also have some poster boards.

Info for session 
 The Quiet Room (202) is for anyone who wants to get away from noise and be by themself. 
 It will be available throughout ICSE week except for Sunday, Tuesday and Saturday (since we need need the room for workshops on those days). 
 Please keep this room ‘library quiet’. If you want to listen to a stream or music., please wear headphones. Please do not talk to others or participate in a virtual event where you may have to talk. 
 This room is especially designed to be helpful for the neurodiverse community, who may need to recharge their social battery, or simply get away from noise. 
 Some people may choose to pray in this room. Please respect them when they do this. There is also Room 2A set aside for this purpose. 
 Note that the Ready Room (209) is another room where you can hang out and talk to others or get work done.

 href="#submission-categories" - Submission Categories
Research Paper(max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references) 
 A research paper must address a topic related to software engineering education using appropriate research techniques and proper scholarly writing. Negative and mixed findings are welcome. 
 Experience Report(max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references) 
 An experience report provides anecdotal evidence by describing an experience related to software engineering education and training (typically a course, a teaching or training technique or strategy, or an assessment method) and interprets the experience in terms of actionable advice and lessons learned, but does not need to evaluate it or use rigorous research methods to support its claims. Negative and mixed findings are welcome, provided they can support advice or lessons learned. 
 Industry Paper(max 10 pages, plus up to 2 pages for references) 
 An industry paper is a research paper or an experience report (as described above) that covers the topic of software engineering education and training in industry. In this category, students are industry practitioners who learn about software engineering in an industry setting. 
 Idea Paper(max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references) 
 An idea paper must present a new software engineering education and training idea with a proposed formal evaluation strategy, possibly with some preliminary or informal results. 
 Tool Paper(max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references) 
 A tool paper describes a tool or technology built or customized by the authors that supports software engineering education and training. Papers in this category should discuss the impact of the tool on the learning process. A tool paper can optionally be accompanied by a short video (not exceeding five minutes) demonstrating the tool’s main functionality (if you use this option, please provide the link at the end of the abstract). Tools must be available online so they can be evaluated (also possible on a trial basis) and be mature enough. 
 Replication Paper(max 5 pages, plus 1 page of references) 
 A replication paper describes the repetition of an existing and already published pedagogical intervention (e.g. course, approach, study) in new contexts. The goal is to determine whether the basic findings related to the original pedagogical intervention can be applied to other circumstances. 
 Journal-first Submission(max 1 page) 
 A journal-first submission relates to a software engineering education and training paper already peer-reviewed and published in a journal. The authors will be invited to present their work at CSEE&T. They must submit a one-page presentation proposal consisting of the paper’s title, its authors, an extended abstract, and a pointer to the original journal paper on the journal’s web site. 
 Submissions should not exceed their respective category page limit, including all text, figures, tables, and appendices. The page limits are strict and non-compliance will result in a desk-rejection. 
 Evaluation Criteria 
 Submissions will be evaluated based on their category:

 Lessons | : The extent to which the paper meaningfully discusses lessons learned in terms of what went right, what went wrong, and what could be improved if the experience is repeated. 
 Presentation | : The extent to which the paper’s organization and quality of writing meets the standard: the paper is well-structured, employs clear and correct scholarly language, avoids ambiguity, includes clearly readable figures and tables, and is formatted according to the template specifications. 
 How to Submit 
 All submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the | IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines | (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use | \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} | without including the compsoc or compsocconf options). Submissions | must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above | . Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review. 
 By submitting to CSEE&T 2025, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the | ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism | and the | IEEE Plagiarism FAQ | . In particular, papers submitted to CSEE&T 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and | must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for CSEE&T 2025 | . Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies. 
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including | href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" - ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects | . Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM and IEEE have been involved in ORCID from the start and we have made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
 CSEE&T 2025 will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities in the paper nor in the artifacts, code, videos, tools, documentation, or repositories associated with the submission. The authors must make every effort to honor the | double-anonymous review process | . In particular: | Authors’ names | must be omitted from the submission. 
 All | references | to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. 
 While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to CSEE&T 2025. 
 During review, authors | should not publicly use the submission title | . 
 Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the | href="https://conf.researchr.org/info/icse-2025/submitting-to-icse2025%3A-q%26a" - ICSE 2025 Q&A | . 
 By submitting to the ICSE Research Track, authors acknowledge that they conform to the | href="https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/ethical-requirements/" - authorship policy of the IEEE | , | href="https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/" - submission policy of the IEEE | , and the | href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship" - authorship policy of the ACM | (and associated | FAQ | . This includes following these points related to the use of Generative AI: | “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ­about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” - ACM 
 “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE 
 “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM 
 Submissions to CSEE&T 2025 that meet the above requirements can be made via thehref="https://cseet25.hotcrp.com" - submission site
by the submission deadline.Any submission that does not comply with these requirements may be desk rejected without further review. 
 We encourage the authors to upload their paper info early (and can submit the PDF later) to properly enter conflicts for double-anonymous reviewing. It is the sole responsibility of the authors to ensure that the formatting guidelines, double anonymous guidelines, and any other submission guidelines are met at the time of paper submission. 
 Open Science Policy 
 CSEE&T 2025 aims to follow the ICSE 2025 Open Science policies. In summary, the steering principle is that research results should be made accessible to the public and empirical studies should be reproducible whenever possible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability whenever allowable and applicable. 
 We are aware that some datasets and tools may not be made open and public (e.g., when prohibited by a Non-Disclosure Agreement, when the Ethics Review Board forbids sharing data for participant privacy, when tool source code is commercial-in-confidence, etc.). We also recognize that reproducibility or replicability is not a goal in qualitative research and that, similar to industrial studies, qualitative studies often face challenges in sharing research data. For guidelines on how to report qualitative research to ensure the assessment of the reliability and credibility of research results, see the ICSE 2025 Open Science page. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. However, non-sharing needs to be justified. 
 IMPORTANT: We therefore ask all authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section namedData Availabilityafter theConclusionsection. Authors can also provide anonymized links to anonymized data and repositories in that section or can upload anonymized data using the supplementary material upload option during submission process via thehref="https://cseet25.hotcrp.com" - HotCRP submission site
. Authors who cannot disclose data should provide a short statement explaining the reasons why they cannot share the data in the Data Availability section of their paper, after the Conclusion section. 
 Authors are asked to carefully review any supplementary material to ensure it conforms to the double-anonymous policy employed for ICSE 2025. For example, code and data repositories may be exported to remove version control history, scrubbed of names in comments and metadata, and anonymously uploaded to a sharing site to support review.

 For Authors 
 href="#important-information-for-authors-of-accepted-papers" - Important information for Authors of Accepted Papers
If you have a paper accepted at the conference, please read the information below carefully. 
 Camera Ready versions 
 The Camera-Ready version of your paper is due on February 17, 2025. You will receive a separate email from the IEEE Conference Publishing Services with details about submitting your final pdf and copyright documentation. 
 href="#changes-to-authors-titles" - Changes to authors / titles
If you wish to make any changes to the author list or paper title from what appears in the hotcrp system, please do that within 48 hours of receiving your acceptance notification. After that period, we will not be able to respond to any requests to do this, since with about 800 papers in all tracks and co-located conferences in the pipeline for ICSE2025, such changes are just too complex and costly to process by the volunteer team. 
 Page limits 
 The final version of your paper must not exceed the page limit. It is not possible to buy extra pages. 
 Registration 
 At least one author will be required to register for the conference by February 17, 2025, or else your paper will be withdrawn. Information regarding registration can be found athref="https://conf.researchr.org/attending/icse-2025/registration" - https://conf.researchr.org/attending/icse-2025/registration
For authors who have two or more accepted papers, we would like to see at least one registration per paper. For example, if you are part of a team of two authors who have two accepted papers, then we request that both authors register and attend, however, this is not mandatory. 
 On the registration form, there are questions requesting various pieces of data, so we suggest you get this ready in advance: 
 Email address: If at all possible, use the same email address you have used on your paper so we can properly match you to the paper. 
 Paper IDs: IEEE CPS will send these IDs (maybe more than one if you have more than one accepted paper) when they contact you about the Camera Ready and Copyright. You will need to enter these in the registration form. Separate each by semicolons. The IDs have the form similar to cseet25-p### where ### is the 1 to 3-digit number associated with your original HotCrp submission (e.g., cseet25-p1). Please do specify the full 10-12 character paper id, NOT JUST the number. We need the entire ID, since numbers are reused in different ICSE tracks and co-hosted conferences. 
 IEEE or ACM membership number: If you are not a member, we suggest you join one of these sponsoring organizations to obtain a 17% discount. Membership numbers will be checked with the IEEE and ACM databases. This is not mandatory if you are willing to pay higher fees. 
 Student status: We do not provide a discount for students if they are the only author attending for a multi-author paper. This is because there must be one full (or retired member) registration associated with each paper. However, the 30% student discount will apply to any other ICSE tracks and co-hosted conferences where you have a paper, or if you attend in addition to a co-author who is paying full price. In the latter case, arrange for the co-author to be the one indicating the paper id. 
 Profile URL athref="https://conf.researchr.org/" - https://conf.researchr.org/
– If you have attended other computing conferences recently you likely have already obtained an account on this website. You will need an account in order to obtain several benefits of the conference, including seeing your personal schedule. If you do not have an account, we suggest you obtain one before registering for the conference. If you do have an account, look it up before registering. For example, the profile of the ICSE General Chairs ishref="https://conf.researchr.org/profile/timothylethbridge" - https://conf.researchr.org/profile/timothylethbridge
. 
 Payment for registration is by Visa or Mastercard. If you have no way of paying by either type of credit card, then the conference registration manager will work out another payment method, but there will be an extra charge for that service. 
 Visas 
 If you will need a visa to enter Canada, it is imperative that you register for the conference at the earliest opportunity, and read the following page regarding visas:href="https://conf.researchr.org/attending/icse-2025/visa-and-travel-authorization" - https://conf.researchr.org/attending/icse-2025/visa-and-travel-authorization
To assist with your visa application ICSE 2025 registration managers will send invitation letters to those who request them during registration (for a small fee). 
 FAQ 
 href="#what-if-we-do-not-yet-know-which-author-of-our-multi-author-paper-will-attend-cseet-2025-in-ottawa" - What if we do not yet know which author of our multi-author paper will attend CSEE&T 2025 in Ottawa?
You will have to make your best guess and one of you (at least) will have to register by the camera-ready deadline. If you change your mind later about who will attend, then as long as you have not obtained an invitation letter for a visa, we will let you change the registrant associated with the paper to be another of its authors, and transfer your deposit to this other author for a CAD $50 administrative fee. However, if we have sent you a letter to obtain a visa, we cannot make such a change. 
 What if I end up not being able to attend due to medical reasons or for a denied visa? 
 We will deal with that on a case-by-case basis at a later time, but we reserve the right to request evidence such as a doctor’s note or screen-shots of your submitted visa application (with the date). If you are a paper author there is no refund, unless another author presents the paper (see Q1). No refunds of any amount will be available after February 15th. 
 How do I contact the registration team if I have special issues or problems registering? 
 Registration is being managed by the University of Ottawa office of Continuing Professional Development. Their email address iscpd@uottawa.ca– Please always put ICSE 2025 on the subject line of any email. 
 href="#if-i-receive-an-email-from-maileventsairmailcom-related-to-icse2025-registration-is-this-legitimate" - If I receive an email from
mail@eventsairmail.comrelated to ICSE2025 registration, is this legitimate? 
 Yes, the registration system being used by the University of Ottawa is Eventsair. Confirmations of registration and receipts will come from that email address, with name “uOttawa Office CPD”, and with a subject line that includes “ICSE 2025”. You should also see logos of the conference, of the University of Ottawa, of the IEEE Computer Society and of ACM SIGSOFT in most such emails. 
 When will information about hotels become available? 
 A list of hotels where we have obtained special discounts is available on the ICSE2025 website. We will be enabling people to directly book with hotels and/or provide booking codes during registration. 
 Are there any discounts for travel? 
 Yes we have discounts with AirFrance/KLM, Porter airlines, Westjet and VIA Rail. You will be given the codes to use when you register. 
 Are there any circumstances under which an accepted paper could be withdrawn? 
 Yes: This could occur in several situations: a) If you do not complete the Camera Ready process on time; b) If you do not fulfil the registration process as described above by the camera-ready deadline c) If you do not present the paper in person (without a valid excuse, see Q2); d) If some kind of research misconduct is encountered with your paper (e.g. plagiarism, inappropriate use of AI, falsification of authorship, submitting the same work to multiple venues, or other violations of IEEE and ACM policies). 
 Can I demonstrate the software tools or interactive techniques I have presented in the paper? 
 You may be able to give a brief demonstration of these as part of your in-person presentation at the conference. 
 Can I later on send an extended version of the paper to a Journal? 
 Yes, but you will need to follow the policies of the journal with regard to the extended content required. You must cite the original CSEE&T paper. 
 If I have a paper in CSEE&T, do I also have to register for the full 3 days of the main conference? 
 No - CSEE&T is a separate, co-located event, however if you are coming to Ottawa for CSEE&T, we would definitely encourage you to stay for the ICSE main conference days too if you are able to. 
 Keynotes 
 TheEngaged Learner: From Experience to Learning and Impact 
 Daniela Damian, University of Victoria 
 Abstract: The far-reaching impact of software in our diverse society demands that software developers understand the implications of technology development in people’s lives and work. 
 As educators, we have a unique opportunity—and, I would argue, a responsibility—to create learning environments where students engage with authentic project situations that allow not only technical skill development but also an ongoing reflection on the human and team dynamics involved in software development for a diverse society. Technologies reflect the teams that create them, so it is crucial for students to understand the connection between the quality of their work and how they collaborate with each other and with the people they build technologies for. In this talk, I aim to spark a discussion about the possibilities and challenges of creating learning environments where students become deeply engaged in both their learning journey and the software development process. 
 Using examples from theINSPIRE: STEM for Social Impact programat the University of Victoria, I will describe the implementation of and experiences from a community-based research and innovation hub (INSPIRE) that blends collaborative, experiential learning with societal impact. Through community-engaged projects, the students become fully engaged with those affected by the solutions they design, as well as supportive mentorship within an academic and industry network. Most impactful, they engage in a journey of personal growth through collaboration within diverse teams, learning how different perspectives contribute to the creation of better technologies.

 The Promise and Peril of SE Education in the Age of AI 
 Michael Hilton, Carnegie Mellon University 
 Abstract: AI, and particularly Large Language models have had a seismic impact on the world of Software Engineering. The world is still changing rapidly, and there are still more questions than answers about how the advent of LLMs will impact the world of Software Engineering Education. However, based on previous new technologies, and enduring SE principles, we can make some inferences about how things might go. In this talk we will discuss how we might want to think differently about SE Education in light of these recent changes, consider some of the implications of these new LLM based tools, and discuss how they will affect the students using them. The talk will discuss some concerns about these tools and how they have been influencing students, but also how they might be harnessed to improve SE Education. 
 Bio:Dr. Michael Hilton is a Teaching Professor in the Software and Societal Systems Department in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He is also the Associate Department Head for Education, as well as the director of the Software Engineering Minor/Concentration. He holds a Ph.D. from Oregon State University.
