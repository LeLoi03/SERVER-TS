 EAI MobiQuitous 2025 
 7 – 9 November, 2025 
 Shanghai, China 
 Despite nearly two decades of extensive research in the field of Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing, and the significant maturity of some foundational technologies, many challenges still remain especially when humans interact with the new generation of computing in multiple devices, e.g., lack of security considerations, and improper human-machine interface. The goal of the twenty-second annual EAI International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services (EAI MobiQuitous 2025) is to provide a forum for presenting and discussing high-quality research in such field, involving international practitioners and researchers from diverse backgrounds. EAI MobiQuitous 2025 will thus foster research collaboration through focused discussions, interaction, case studies, and exchange of experiences that will designate future research efforts and directions for Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing. Areas addressed by the conference include systems, applications, social networks, middleware, networking, sensing, data management, data processing and services, all with special focus on mobile and ubiquitous computing.

 View PDFHTML (experimental)Abstract:The integration of diverse health data, such as IoT (Internet of Things), EHR (Electronic Health Record), and clinical surveys, with scalable AI(Artificial Intelligence) has enabled the identification of physical, behavioral, and psycho-social indicators of pain. However, the adoption of AI in clinical pain evaluation is hindered by challenges like personalization and fairness. Many AI models, including machine and deep learning, exhibit biases, discriminating against specific groups based on gender or ethnicity, causing skepticism among medical professionals about their reliability. This paper proposes a Multi-attribute Fairness Loss (MAFL) based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to account for protected attributes in data, ensuring fair pain status predictions while minimizing disparities between privileged and unprivileged groups. We evaluate whether a balance between accuracy and fairness is achievable by comparing the proposed model with existing mitigation methods. Our findings indicate that the model performs favorably against state-of-the-art techniques. Using the NIH All-Of-US dataset, comprising data from 868 individuals over 1500 days, we demonstrate our model's effectiveness, achieving accuracy rates between 75% and 85%.
