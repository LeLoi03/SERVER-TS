JoinSIGIR is the premier international forum for the presentation of new research results and for the demonstration of new systems and techniques in information retrieval. The conference consists of five days of full papers, short papers, resource & reproducibility papers, perspectives papers, system demonstrations, doctoral consortium, tutorials, and workshops focused on research and development in the area of information retrieval. 
  
 SIGIR 2025 is an in-person conference. Despite the challenges it may pose, we believe that an in-person conference is more beneficial in terms of direct engagement and networking opportunities, more dynamic exchange of research ideas, and welcoming and nurturing newcomers.

 SIGIR-AP 2024 
 2ndInternational ACM SIGIR Conference on Information Retrieval in the Asia Pacific 
 December 9-12, 2024, Tokyo, Japan 
 href="https://twitter.com/acmsigir_ap/status/1840676435025101036" - Loading tweet...
About the ConferenceThe annual SIGIR-AP conference is an annual ACM-sponsored international forum that promotes and disseminates information retrieval research and development within the Asia-Pacific region defined as all of Asia, Australasia, and the islands of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The 1st ACM SIGIR-AP conference was held in Beijing in November 2023. Following its success, the 2nd ACM SIGIR-AP conference (SIGIR-AP 2024) will be held in Tokyo from the 9th to the 12th of December 2024. The conference welcomes variable-length contributions related to any aspect of information retrieval and access. Tutorials will be given on Day 1, and the main conference will be held on Days 2-4; a few workshops will be held on Day 4 as well. 

SustainabilityThe conference chairs are also committed to making the conference as sustainable as possible: we want to reduce CO2 emission, food waste, waste of all kinds, and also reduce the workloads of researchers. To this end, the conference chairs work with thesustainability event support desk of Tokyo Convention & Visitors Bureau. One of the green features of SIGIR-AP is that its main conference is a hybrid event: online registrants may participate in the conference from one or more satellite venues outside Japan (detailed TBA). Another unique feature of SIGIR-AP is that it has a SIGIR Revise-and-Resubmit (RR) submission type: authors of rejected SIGIR papers can improve the paper based on SIGIR reviewer comments and submit it to SIGIR-AP together with an explanation of they addressed the reviewer comments. Thus we try to make the efforts of authors and reviewers sustainable.
