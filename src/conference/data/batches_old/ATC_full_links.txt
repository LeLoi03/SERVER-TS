 Introduction 
 The 21st IEEE International Conference on Autonomous and Trusted Computing (ATC 2024) builds upon a rich legacy spanning two decades, serving as a preeminent forum for researchers and practitioners in the field of autonomous and trusted computing. Nowadays, various kinds of novel computing concepts are emerging to enhancing our real and virtual worlds towards smart worlds as well as cyber-physical-social-thinking integrated hyper worlds. Accordingly, computing systems are growing in capability and complexity including hardware software, communications, networks, platforms, services, etc. Autonomous and trusted computing (ATC) aims to discover, develop, and deploy novel networks and systems and their applications. 
  
 The main conference of ATC 2024 will be held on 2-7 December 2024 at Denarau Island, Fiji, and will provide a high-profile, leading-edge forum for scientists, engineers, and researchers to discuss and exchange novel ideas, results, experiences, and work-in-process around the autonomous and trusted computing. ATC conferences have taken a leading role in addressing these challenges and achieving practical advanced computing systems with truly trustworthy services.

 Conference Introduction 
 The smart world is set to enhance everyday things with abilities of sensation, communication, computation and intelligence so that many tasks and processes could be simplified, efficient, and enjoyable. It consists of numerous "smart things" that can be endowed with different levels/forms of intelligence and be connected together for a network level of intelligence. Research on ubiquitous and trustworthy smart world is an emerging research field covering many interdisciplinary areas that benefits humanity and will have significant societal impacts.IEEE SmartWorld 2024 aims to provide a high-profile, leading-edge platform for researchers and engineers to exchange and explore state-of-art advances and innovations in graceful integrations of Cyber, Physical and Social Worlds with Ubiquitous Intelligence.
