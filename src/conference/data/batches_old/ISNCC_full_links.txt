 Publication chance based on affiliation 
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference. 
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered. 
 Research.com 
 During the most recent 2021 edition,100.00%of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations,nan%were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Anothernan%included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range includednan%of all publications andnan%were from other institutions. 
 Returning Authors Index 
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year. 
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index 
 The graph below shows the Returning Institution Index, illustrating the ratio of institutions that participated in both a given and the previous edition of the conference in relation to all affiliations present in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index 
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at thelast edition of a conference, grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C). 
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups: 
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
 Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
 Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
 Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
 Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 
 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.
