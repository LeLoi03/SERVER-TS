.href="" - SOFSEM Profile
SOFSEM maintains a unique position among the annual conferences and symposia in computing. Through itsinvited talks and the selected contributed papers on current research, as well as its well-known familiar atmosphere, SOFSEM is an appreciable mix of an international symposium and a winter school. It is a proven format, combining the presentation of original, high-quality research papers with lectures on trending themes in foundations and their, often interdisciplinary, background.SOFSEM conferences are conducted in person. Traditionally housing all participants at thesamevenue, the conference provides an optimalset-up for discussions, meetings, research initiatives, new contacts, and social interactions. SOFSEMencourages the co-operation and exchange of ideas among researchers across all domains of fundamental computer science and its bordering fields, in all stages of their career. It makes SOFSEM especially attractive for young computer scientists. 
 SOFSEM focuses on novel research and current developments in all key areas in fundamental computer science and its interfaces to the foundations of artificial intelligence (algorithms, AI-inspired methods, computational complexity, formal models). SOFSEM's list of topics of interest was renewed in 2022 and evolves with the developments and trends in foundational research in computing with each edition of the conference.Awards 
 Each year the SOFSEM Program Committee determines which of the contributed papers is/are deservant of theBest Student Paper Awardand theBest Paper Awardof the conference. The winners of the awards are normally posted on the conference website.href="" - Recent SOFSEM Conferences

 href="" - Brief History of SOFSEM
SOFSEM (orig.SOFtware SEMinar) was founded in 1974 as a winter seminar for computer scientists and software engineers in former Czechoslovakia. SOFSEM soon became the foremost national seminar devoted to theoretical and practical problems of software systems. In fact, in these early days of computer science and technology, SOFSEM supplemented the university education and academic research by facilitating a fast transfer of the latest relevant knowledge in computing to its audience. Later on international experts were invited also, to present series of lectures on recent topics. Each SOFSEM consisted of several series of invited lectures of 3 to 5 hours, complemented by selected contributions of participants. Until 1994, the total duration of every SOFSEM was two weeks.Gradually, SOFSEM transformed from a mainly national seminar into an international conference. After the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993 SOFSEM continued, but now alternating between the Czech and Slovak Republics. SOFSEM became recognized for its high-level invited talks and well-chosen tracks that followed the trends in the field. From 1995 onward, the SOFSEM proceedings were included in the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science of Springer. The duration of SOFSEM was shortened to eight days, and the track areas became more and more fixed for a longer time. Over the years, as the field expanded and international collaborations flourished, SOFSEM's unique role withinthe Czech and Slovak computer science communities lessened, yet its significance and position as an international symposium grew. 
 In 2016 the SOFSEM Steering Committee decided that, from then on, SOFSEM conferences could be organized by colleagues anywhere in Europe, i.e. not limited to the Czech or Slovak Republics anymore. The duration of SOFSEM was limited to a week or four days but its format and focus were still left unchanged, with three separate tracks (foundations, software engineering, and data science and engineering), a special theme track (algorithmic computational biology), and a student research forum. In 2022 SOFSEM did not take place, due to the covid-19 pandemic, but the time was used to prepare SOFSEM for the next major step on its new course, namely focusing the conference fully and undividedly to the foundations of computer science, together with its interfaces to closely related areas, especially the computational principles of artificial intelligence and data science.ArchiveEarly history of SOFSEM: | href="https://www.sofsem.cz/sofsem95/history.html" - SOFSEM - History | (SOFSEM'95)

 The registration also includes your reservation for the youth hostel. You can already plan if you like to have a single room (about 55 € per night, meals included), a double room (about 46 €) or a room with >= 3 persons (about 40 €). | Unfortunately, single rooms are fully booked now. | For those who start planning their trip: Talks will start on MON morning right after breakfast, end they will end shortly before lunch on FRI (which we still take in together). The social program will take place on WED afternoon and evening (visiting Reichsburg and conference dinner) and on THU afternoon (top secret ...). We are supposed to leave the youth hostel again after FRI lunch, as the next group will then occupy the whole hostel. 
 The server for new submissions is closed now. The list of accepted papers can be found below. 
 We decided to have one or two online sessions at SOFSEM; so even if you cannot attend in person, it should be possible to present your accepted paper. However, we do prefer the whole event to be organized as an on-site event. In particular, we will not transmit on-site presentations outside the conference (online). 
 We welcome submissions of original research in Foundations of Computer Science and AI, formatted using LNCS style: at most 14 pages (including references) plus a clearly marked appendix. Firm abstract deadline: August 28th, 2023; full papers should be submitted until September 1st, 2023. The reviewing is single-blind. The Easychair submission server is now only open for updates | href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sofsem2024" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sofsem2024 | . 
 We will have a Special Issue with the renowned | Journal of Computer and System Sciences | ( | now confirmed | ). 
 All titles of the invited talks have been added below to the speakers. 
 SOFSEM 24 proceedings will be published in the ARCoSS subline of | LNCS | . 
 There will be a Best Paper and a Best Student Paper Award sponsored by Springer. 
 All invited speakers have confirmed their on-site participation, see below. 
 SOFSEM 24 dates have been fixed: the conference will run for 4.5 days, ending FRI, Feb. 23rd 2024, at noon.

 Explanations 
 Explanation for eligibility of student paper: 
 To be eligible for the best student paper award, at least one of the paper authors must be a full-time (PhD) student at the time of submission, and the student(s) must have made a significant contribution to the paper. 
 Explanation of submissions of original papers: 
 First of all, this means that the contents of a submitted paper must not have been published elsewhere, with a peer review process involved. Hence, do not send your paper to a journal prior to the notification of authors of the conference. Simultaneous submission to other conferences or workshops with published proceedings is also disallowed. Then, there is no doubt about the originality of the paper’s content. There is no need to wait with sending the long version of a paper to a journal until the paper has been presented at the conference, although it is recommended waiting for this event, as sometimes authors receive additional feedback from the audience that is helpful for preparing the journal submission. This is why in Theoretical Computer Science, the current workflow seems to be to first put a technical report version of a paper on ArXive, then submit a short version to some conference, which might also lead to some updates of the ArXive version, and finally submit the full paper to a journal. Also, mind the possibility of being selected for the Special Issue (SI). The selected papers (invited to the SI) will only be announced after the conference.

 href="https://www.sofsem.cz" - SOFSEM
is an annual winter conference devoted to the theory and practice of computer science. The conference traditionally focuses on the latest results and developments of fundamental research in computer science (informatics), inspired by the algorithmic challenges of our time. SOFSEM has a long tradition as a high-quality research conference, and a venue where researchers from academia and industry in all stages of their career can share their insights. The series of SOFSEM conferences began in 1974, and was only interrupted in 2022 due to the covid pandemic. In 2025, at its 50th edition, SOFSEM will be held as a physical event in Bratislava, Slovakia. The proceedings will be published in the subseries ARCoSS (Advanced Research in Computing and Software Science) of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) of Springer.
