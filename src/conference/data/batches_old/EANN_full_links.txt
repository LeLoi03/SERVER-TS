 Update to the EAAAI (ex EANN) Community from the Organisers 
 Dear Colleagues, 
 EAAAI (ex EANN), a Quarter of a Century Event! 
 The 26thEANN 2025 (Engineering Applications of Neural Networks) has already changed in order to adjust to the 21stcentury demands. An international conference with a continuous presence in the literature for more than a quarter of a century. 
 ΕΑΝΝ 2025 has been renamed as the 26thEAAAI 2025 (Engineering Applications and Advances of Artificial Intelligence) in order to cover a wider spectrum of AI research areas and domains. On behalf of the EAAAI organizing and Scientific Committee, it is a real honor and pleasure to welcome all Artificial Intelligence scholars who are looking for a well-established and prestigious forum to communicate and disseminate the innovative advances of their research. It is a fact that AI is continuously digging its way in a vast number of diverse scientific domains. EAAAI (ex EANN) aims to provide a forum for all scientists from both academia and industry who wish to share pioneer ideas, to get to know each other better and to present their research. Moreover, it aims to offer a deep glimpse into the future and to examine important AI ethical aspects. 
 The conference accepts papers from the whole AI spectrum and from every application scientific domain. 
 The EAAAI (ex EANN) conference has been held continuously since 1995. Through the years, it has evolved to a well-respected and mature event. This community comprises of an extended Group of leading scientists, not only from Europe but from all over the globehref="https://eannconf.org/2025/message-of-the-organizers/" - …[read more]
