 WELCOME 
 Welcome to CoDIT 2025 
 TheCoDIT 2025conference is the eleventh (11th) edition in the series of the International Conference onControl,Decision andInformationTechnologies, organized since 2013, the previous onehref="https://https//:codit2024.com" - CoDIT 2024

 CoDIT 2025will be held15-18 July, 2025atSplit, Croatia. The conference serves as a forum for technical exchange among scientists interested in Control, Automation, Robotics, Optimization, Decision, Cybernetics, Computer Science, and Information Technologies. It offers an exceptional platform for both academic and industrial communities to tackle new challenges, share solutions, and explore future research directions. The program will feature plenary lectures, regular technical sessions, and special sessions. 
 Welcome to Split, Croatia 
 Split, located on Croatia’s stunning Dalmatian coast, is a vibrant city that seamlessly blends ancient history with a lively, modern atmosphere. Known for its breathtaking views of the Adriatic Sea, Split is centered around the UNESCO-listed Diocletian's Palace, a massive, well-preserved Roman structure dating back to the 4th century. 
 Walking through its maze of stone streets, visitors encounter a unique mix of ancient ruins, bustling marketplaces, cozy cafes, and contemporary art galleries, giving Split a charm that appeals to both history enthusiasts and modern travelers. The city’s waterfront promenade, Riva, is the social heart of Split. With its palm-lined paths, lively restaurants, and bars, it’s an ideal spot for both locals and visitors to relax and enjoy scenic views of the harbor. 
 Nearby, Marjan Hill offers hiking trails with panoramic views of the city, coast, and nearby islands. Split’s beaches, such as Bačvice, are a popular draw, offering both sandy and rocky spots to unwind by the crystal-clear Adriatic waters. Split is also a gateway to Croatia’s idyllic islands, such as Hvar, Brač, and Vis, making it a top destination for island hopping and maritime adventures. With its perfect blend of cultural heritage, beautiful landscapes, and lively atmosphere, Split captures the essence of Croatia, offering visitors a memorable and diverse experience. 
 The submission deadline for all contributions (Regular Papers, Special Session Papers, and WiP) has been extended until 
 April 7, 2025.
