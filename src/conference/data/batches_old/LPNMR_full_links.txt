 17th International Conference on Logic Programming and Non-monotonic Reasoning 
 October 11-14, 2024 - Dallas, Texas, USA 
 LPNMR 2024is the seventeenth in the series of international meetings on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. LPNMR is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, non-monotonic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The aim of the conference is to facilitate interactions between researchers and practitioners interested in the design and implementation of logic-based programming languages and database systems, and those working in knowledge representation and nonmonotonic reasoning. LPNMR strives to encompass theoretical and experimental studies that have led or will lead to advances in declarative programming and knowledge representation, as well as their use in practical applications. 
 LPNMR 2024 is co-located with theInternational Conference on Logic Programming(ICLP) 2024. 
 A Doctoral Consortium,in collaboration with ICLP,will also be a part of the program. 
 Proceedings 
 Proceedings are available online until November, 15:link.
