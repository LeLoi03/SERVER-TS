Call for papers 
 The International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning (IDEAL)is an annual international conference dedicated to emerging and challenging topics in intelligent data analytics and associated learning systems and paradigms. Following the recent successful events: IDEAL2023 in Évora, IDEAL2022 in Manchester (hybrid), IDEAL2021 (virtual), IDEAL2020 in Guimarães (virtual), IDEAL2019 in Manchester, and IDEAL 2018 in Madrid, the 25th edition, IDEAL2024 will be taking place in Valencia (European Green Capital), Spain. 
 Topics 
 IDEAL 2024 core themes or topics include, but not limited to: 
 Big Data Analytics 
 Machine Learning & Deep Learning 
 Data Mining 
 Information Retrieval and Management 
 Bio and Neuro-Informatics 
 Bio-Inspired Models 
 Agents and Hybrid Intelligent Systems 
 Real-world Applications of Intelligent Techniques 
 Instructions for authors 
 Authors are invited to submit their manuscripts (in pdf format) written in English by the deadline via the conference online submission system (see conference website). All submissions will be peer-reviewed by experts in the field based on originality, significance, quality and clarity. All contributions must be original, must not have been published elsewhere, and must not have been submitted elsewhere during the review period.Papers must not exceed 12 pages (including references) and must comply with the format of Springer LNCS/LNAI Proceedings (seewww.springer.com/lncs). 
 Short papers 
 To encourage emerging results and novel initial developments, especially from PhD students and young researchers,we accept short papers (within 6 LNCS pages, including references). Such papers will also go through our rigorous peer-review process for their novelty and soundness with a quicker turn-around time. Although short papers are mainly for the main track, they can be submitted to any relevant Special Session too (information will be available).The submission system will treat any paper within 6 pages as short papers and PC chairs will ensure a speedy review of them. 
 Special Sessions & Workshops 
 You are welcome to submit a proposal for a Special Session or Workshop on a focused, active or emerging topic in the scope of IDEAL. 
 In addition to the regular sessions, there will be a few special sessions devoted to emerging topics and areas with growing attention – details of approved Special Sessions are given on thehref="https://ideal2024.webs.upv.es/special-sessions/" - Special Sessions page
. If researchers and prospective organisers are interested in proposing another Special Session, please submit a one-page proposal by May 31 to IDEAL Programme Co-Chairs [antonio.tallon@diesia.uhu.es,jjordan@dsic.upv.es], including the following information: 
 The title of the special session 
 The organizers with their affiliations 
 A description of why the topic is of special interest and how it fits into the scope of IDEAL. 
 Each special session preferably consists of four or more presentations. Special sessions receiving less than 3 accepted papers will be merged into the main track.
