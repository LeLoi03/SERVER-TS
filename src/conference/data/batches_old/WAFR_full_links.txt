 WAFR 2024 - 30 years of WAFR 
 Algorithms are a fundamental component of robotic systems: they control or reason about motion and perception in the physical world. They receive input from noisy sensors, consider geometric and physical constraints, and operate on the world through imprecise actuators. The design and analysis of robot algorithms therefore raises a unique combination of questions in control theory, computational and differential geometry, and computer science. 
 The Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR) is a multi-disciplinary single-track workshop with submitted and invited papers on advances on algorithmic problems in robotics. WAFR was created in 1994 as a small-size workshop. It has been held every other year since 1994 and while it spans a relatively small community, it has an established reputation as one, if not the most, important venue for presenting algorithmic work related to robotics. The workshop proceedings will be published in theSpringer Proceedings in Advanced Robotics (SPAR)series. 
 The topics of interest are very broad since the focus of WAFR is on algorithm development and analysis rather than specific problems or applications. Increasingly, robotics algorithms are finding use in areas far beyond the traditional scope of robots. Therefore, while we encourage submissions on fundamental topics such as complexity completeness, and computational geometry, we also welcome papers in applications such as computational biology, virtual environments sensor networks, manufacturing, and medical robotics. Papers on algorithmic developments in traditional areas of robotics, such as motion planning, manipulation, sensing, and mobile robotics, as well as papers in newer areas such as distributed robotics and simultaneous localization and mapping, are also encouraged.

 Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics 
 Robot algorithms are abstractions of computational processes that control or reason about motion and perception in the physical world. Because actions in the physical world are subject to physical laws and geometric constraints, the design and analysis of robot algorithms raises a unique combination of questions in control theory, computational and differential geometry, and computer science. Algorithms serve as a unifying theme in the multi-disciplinary field of robotics. 
 The Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations aims to bring together a group of about sixty researchers to discuss recent trends and important future directions of research on the algorithmic issues related to robotics and automation.

 Special Issue on Workshop on Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR) 
 A special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering. 
 Introduction 
 Papers from the WAFR 2012 Technical Program 
 From the WAFR 2012 Website: 
 The International Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR) is a single-track workshop devoted to recent advances on algorithmic problems in robotics. The workshop proceedings will be published in a hardcover volume in the Springer STAR series, and selected papers will be invited for publication in a special issue of the International Journal of Robotics Research. Other selected papers will be invited for publication in this T-ASE Special Issue. 
 Robot algorithms are a fundamental component of robotic systems. These algorithms process inputs from sensors that provide noisy and partial data, build geometric and physical models of the world, plan high-and low-level actions at different time horizons, and execute these actions on actuators with limited precision. The design and analysis of robot algorithms raise a unique combination of questions from many fields, including control theory, computational geometry and topology, geometrical and physical modeling, reasoning under uncertainty, probabilistic algorithms, game theory, and theoretical computer science.

 Scope, Description, and More Information 
 The focus of WAFR is on the design and analysis of robot algorithms from both theoretical and practical angles. The topics of interest are very broad. We encourage papers on fundamental algorithmic issues, such as complexity, completeness, machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, and new programming paradigms, to name a few. We also encourage papers on applications of robot algorithms to important or new domains, such as manufacturing, legged locomotion, distributed robotics, human-robot interaction, surgical robots, intelligent prosthetics, and brain-controlled robots. Furthermore, robot algorithms are being applied in domains beyond the traditional scope of robotics, e.g., computational biology, computer animation, sensor networks, etc. Papers on these topics are also welcomed.

 Manuscript preparation 
 Manuscripts should be prepared using thehref="https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors" - Springer Proceedings in Advanced Robotics (SPAR)
format. You can download the style/template files below: 
 Proceedings LaTeX2e package | (preferred) 
 MS Word 
 Submissions should not exceed 16 pages + references in this format (references do not count towards this page limit.) 
 As usual for WAFR, submissions are single blind (authors are listed on the manuscript) and there will be no rebuttal phase. 
 Detailed information on manuscript preparation can be foundhere. 
 Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools for Authors 
 Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of a paper submitted to WAFR. The use of content generated by AI in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The AI system used must be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content should be specified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the manner in which the AI system was used to generate the content. The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. Even so, in this case, disclosure is still recommended as the lines between these uses can be difficult to distinguish. 
 Supplementary Material 
 In the submissions before the conference, you can submit supplementary material together with the main manuscript in a separate PDF or ZIP file (50MB max file size). Please note that the program committee members are not required to check the supplementary material when preparing their reviews and we encourage you to make sure your paper is self-contained. No supplementary material will be included in the book.
