 The ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA25) and its co-located conferences will proceed as scheduled and be held in a fully in-person format. City officials are working with the FBI, NOPD, and Louisiana State Police to investigate and reopen the Bourbon Street area as soon as possible after the recent tragedy; the area is expected to be completely re-opened by the beginning of the conference. The Astor Crowne Plaza is fully operational.

 About the Conference 
 The aim of ALENEX is to provide a forum for the presentation of original research in the design, implementation, and experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. 
 Typical submissions will include an extensive experimental analysis of nontrivial algorithmic results, ideally bridging the gap between theory and practice. We also invite submissions that address methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures. 
 Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering. 
 Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to high-performance and cloud computing. 
 Proceedings will be posted online in January 2025. ALENEX is supported by SIAM. 
 Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect that interesting synergies will develop between the co-located conferences. 
 ALENEX will be held jointly with: 
 ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA) 
 SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA)
