 AboutICOCI 2025 
 The International Conference on Computing and Informatics (ICOCI), organized by the School of Computing, Universiti Utara Malaysia, has been a cornerstone event for advancing knowledge and fostering collaboration in the fields of computing and informatics since its inception on 6 June 2006. Over the years, ICOCI has provided a distinguished platform for researchers, academics, practitioners, and industry professionals from around the globe to engage in discussions on cutting-edge research and innovations in these fields. 
 ICOCI has consistently served as a conduit for the sharing of knowledge, bridging the gap between theory and practice, and promoting interdisciplinary collaboration. The conference has grown in stature with each edition, having been held in 2006, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021, and 2023, solidifying its reputation as a premier event in computing and informatics. 
 The 10th edition, ICOCI X, which will be held on 25 - 26 June 2025, marks a significant milestone. This landmark event will explore the theme, “Beyond Binary: AI, Humanity, and The Dawn of IR 5.0.” As the world moves toward the Fifth Industrial Revolution (IR 5.0), where artificial intelligence and human intelligence are expected to converge and collaborate, ICOCI X will provide a critical platform for thought leaders and innovators to examine the ethical, societal, and technological implications of this new era. 
 The School of Computing, Universiti Utara Malaysia, takes great pride in continuing to organize ICOCI as a key driver of knowledge sharing and intellectual growth in the field of computing. ICOCI X will not only celebrate the legacy of the conference but also pave the way for future dialogues and innovations that will shape the future of technology and its impact on humanity. 
 School of Computing (SOC), Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) organizes the 10th International Conference on Computing and Informatics 2025 (ICOCI 2025) from 25 to 27 June 2025. ICOCI has been the platform for researchers and practitioners to share their studies' findings since 2006. Since 2009, the conference has been organized as biannual conference. ICOCI 2025 is the 10th in its series of installment.
