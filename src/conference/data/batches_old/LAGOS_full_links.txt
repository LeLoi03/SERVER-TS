 Geometry of Materials 
 07 Apr 2025 - 11 Apr 2025 • Providence, RI, United States 
 Organizer: 
 Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM) 
 Abstract: 
 The geometric arrangement of a material’s constituents plays an important role in governing its behavior. Concepts from discrete mathematics to describe these geometric arrangements, including notions of rigidity and flexibility, can bring fundamental insight into how a material might respond to stress, be designed, be reconfigured, etc. Beyond materials, the notions of network rigidity can be applied to more abstract networks and geometries, such as those found in data science. This workshop aims to build connections between the field of mathematical rigidity theory, other topics in applied mathematics, and related areas of science and engineering.

 Abstract: 
 In a growing number of applications, one needs to analyze and interpret data coming from massive networks. The statistical problems arising from such applications lead to important mathematical challenges: building novel probabilistic models, understanding the possibilities and limitations for statistical detection and inference, designing efficient algorithms, and understanding the inherent limitations of fast algorithms. The workshop will bring together leading researchers in combinatorial statistics, machine learning, and random graphs in the hope of cross-fertilization of ideas. 
 Topics: 
 combinatorial statistics, random graphs, network inference, network reconstruction, detection, estimation

 ESI Workshop — Uniform Distribution of Sequences 
 22 Apr 2025 - 25 Apr 2025 • Universität Wien, Austria 
 Organizer: 
 Erwin Schrödinger International Institute for Mathematics and Physics (ESI) 
 Abstract: 
 This workshop is devoted to interactions between continued fraction algorithms (in dimension one and mostly higher) and arithmetic, automatic and uniformly distributed sequences. Problems in this area inspired a lot of work in dynamical systems in general, and the techniques that were developed over the years found applications well beyond their original motivation. Milestones in the theory were achieved by Austrian and Dutch mathematicians and collaborations between them: Hlawka-Koksma and Kuipers-Niederreiter.

 Seminar — Chancellor Professor Course: Interdisciplinary Topics in Mathematics: Theory of Combinatorial Limits 
 29 Apr 2025 • UC Berkeley, United States 
 Organizer: 
 Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute (SLMath) 
 Abstract: 
 The course will present basic concepts of the theory of combinatorial limits related to various combinatorial objects such as graphs, permutations, and hypergraphs, and discuss analytic representations of their limits. We will discuss how the theory of combinatorial limits is related to regularity decompositions and how its analytic tools can be applied to various problems in computer science and mathematics, in particular, in extremal combinatorics where Razborov's flag algebra method has led to advances on long-standing open problems (with solutions of the Erdős-Rademacher Problem and the Erdős Pentagon Problem being among the first results obtained using the method). We will demonstrate how the flag algebra arguments can be applied both directly and in a computer-assisted way, including non-asymptotic settings, e.g., to compute particular Ramsey numbers.

 Frieze patterns in algebra, combinatorics and geometry 
 12 May 2025 - 16 May 2025 • CIRM (Marseille Luminy), France 
 Organizer: 
 CIRM – Centre International de Rencontres Mathématiques 
 Abstract: 
 Friezes, introduced 50 years ago by Coxeter, are patterns of integers defined by a simple, local condition. They consist of a finite (or infinite) number of rows written in a lattice, starting with a row of 0s and a row of 1s and satisfying a local SL2-rule: for any four neighbours a, b, c, d forming a diamond we require ad − bc = 1. Since the discovery of links to cluster algebras of type A, a plethora of generalisations have been studied in the last decades. With this workshop, we will provide a platform to establish new links between friezes and research areas in geometry, algebra and combinatorics.

 School — Local Limits of Random Graphs 
 02 Jun 2025 - 13 Jun 2025 • Paris-Saclay University, France 
 Organizer: 
 Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute (SLMath) 
 Abstract: 
 Random graphs are ubiquitous in modern probability theory. Besides their intrinsic mathematical beauty, they are also used to model complex networks. In the early 2000’s, I. Benjamini and O. Schramm introduced a mathematical framework in which they endowed the set of locally finite rooted connected graphs with the structure of a Polish space, called the local topology. The goal of this summer school is to introduce the framework of local limits of random graphs, the concepts of Benjamini-Schramm (or unbiased) limits and unimodularity, as well as the most important applications. The lectures will be delivered by Nicolas Curien (Prof. Paris-Saclay University) and Justin Salez (Prof. Université Paris-Dauphine) and will be complemented by many problem sessions, where students will work in small groups under the guidance of teaching assistants, who are researchers in the field.

 Summer School — Graphical Models in Algebraic Combinatorics 
 23 Jun 2025 - 03 Jul 2025 • Moraga, CA, United States 
 Organizer: 
 Simons Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute (SLMath) 
 Abstract: 
 This school will introduce students to a range of powerful combinatorial tools used to understand algebraic objects ranging from the homogeneous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian to symmetric functions. The summer school will center around two main lecture series "Webs and Plabic Graphs" and "Vertex Models and Applications". While the exact applications differ, both courses will center on graphical models for algebraic problems closely related to Grassmannian and its generalizations. This school will be accessible to a wide range of students. Students will leave the school with a solid grasp of the combinatorics of webs, plabic graphs, and the six-vertex model, an understanding of their algebraic applications, and a taste of current research directions.

 PCMI Summer Session — Probabilistic and Extremal Combinatorics 
 06 Jul 2025 - 26 Jul 2025 • Institute for Advanced Study, Park City, Utah, United States 
 Organizer: 
 IAS/Park City Mathematics Institute 
 Abstract: 
 Extremal graph theory and Ramsey theory are two of the central branches of modern extremal combinatorics, which seeks to understand the size and structure of discrete objects under certain natural constraints. In this course we will explore these topics, seeing both some of the beautiful techniques developed to study such problems, as well as many innocent-looking problems that seem completely out of reach of the currently-known techniques. We will also see some of the many connections these questions have to other areas of mathematics, including geometry, number theory, probability, and theoretical computer science.

 Category Theory, Combinatorics, and Machine Learning 
 15 Sep 2025 - 19 Sep 2025 • Providence, RI, United States 
 Organizer: 
 Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics, Brown University, Providence, RI (ICERM) 
 Abstract: 
 Can machines prove theorems? Can they have mathematical ideas? On one hand, category theory offers a formalism for axiomatising ideas from machine learning. On the other hand, mathematicians are excited about the prospect of utilising machine learning techniques to spot new patterns in vast swathes of combinatorial data and hence formulate new conjectures. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together experts from across algebraic combinatorics, category theory, and machine learning in order to make headway on topics at the intersection of these fields.

 AIM workshop: Flag algebras and extremal combinatorics 
 13 Oct 2025 - 17 Oct 2025 • Pasadena, California, United States 
 Organizer: 
 American Institute of Mathematics, Pasadena, California (AIM) 
 Abstract: 
 This workshop, sponsored by AIM and the NSF, will be devoted to further developing the method of flag algebras and its applications. Flag algebras, developed by Razborov in 2007, allows one to solve problems in combinatorics via streamlined calculations that combine elements from computer engineering and optimization. It led to many recent breakthroughs on long-standing open problems of Erdős, Sós, Turán, Gromov and Zarankiewicz, to name a few. The technique is versatile and can be applied in other settings than graphs and hypergraphs including permutations, oriented graphs, point sets, embedded graphs, and phylogenetic trees.

 Computation in Representation Theory 
 10 Nov 2025 - 14 Nov 2025 • Providence, RI, United States 
 Organizer: 
 Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics, Brown University, Providence, RI (ICERM) 
 Abstract: 
 This workshop encompasses three major aspects of computation within Representation Theory and Algebraic Combinatorics. One concerns the development of efficient algorithms to compute important quantities in order to understand and classify them better. Such problems include structure constants and representation theoretic multiplicities, mutation invariants in cluster algebras, computing dimensions of coinvariant rings, characters of finite-dimensional representations, coefficients of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials, web bases etc. This is closely related to understanding what optimality we could expect and in particular the computational complexity aspects of those problems. Their computational complexity class can also be used to understand the existence of combinatorial interpretations, in particular for major structure constants lacking positive formulas like Kronecker and plethysm coefficients. On the other hand, representation theory has seen important applications within computational complexity theory, in the context of Geometric Complexity Theory and Quantum Information Theory.

 Webs in Algebra, Geometry, Topology and Combinatorics 
 08 Dec 2025 - 12 Dec 2025 • Providence, RI, United States 
 Organizer: 
 Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics, Brown University, Providence, RI (ICERM) 
 Abstract: 
 Webs are diagrammatic tools for representing complex calculations graphically. These diagrams first arose from the representation theory of classical groups, and they have since become important in disparate areas of mathematics. In representation theory, they encode morphisms of quantum groups. In topology, webs give rise to powerful link invariants. In algebra and geometry, Kuperberg's \(mathrm{sl}(3)\) web bases have important relationships with the theory of cluster algebras and affine buildings. In combinatorics, they explain certain dynamics on Young tableaux. Recent work by Gaetz--Pechenik--Pfannerer--Striker--Swanson introduced an \(\mathrm{sl}(4)\) web basis that has exploited and extended exciting connections between webs, plabic graphs, and crystals. There are further connections to total positivity, duality conjectures for cluster algebras and mirror symmetry.
