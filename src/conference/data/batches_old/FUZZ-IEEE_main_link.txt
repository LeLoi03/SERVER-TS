 Topics of Interest 
 FUZZ-IEEE 2025 will represent a unique meeting point for scientists and engineers, both from academia and industry, to interact and discuss the latest enhancements and innovations in the field. The topic of the conference will cover all the aspects of theory and applications in fuzzy sets theory and hybridizations with other artificial and computational intelligence techniques. In particular, FUZZ-IEEE 2025 topics include, but are not limited to: 
 Mathematical and theoretical foundations of fuzzy sets, measures and integrals, 
 Fuzzy control, robotics, sensors, fuzzy hardware and architectures, 
 Fuzzy data analysis, fuzzy clustering, classification and pattern recognition, 
 Type-2 fuzzy sets, computing with words and granular computing, 
 Fuzzy systems with big data and cloud computing, fuzzy analytics and visualization, 
 Fuzzy systems design and optimization, 
 Fuzzy decision analysis, multi-criteria, decision making and decision support, 
 Fuzzy modelling, identification and fault detection, 
 Fuzzy information processing, information extraction and fusion, 
 Fuzzy web engineering, information retrieval, text mining and social network analysis, 
 Knowledge discovery, learning, reasoning and knowledge representation, 
 Fuzzy image, speech and signal processing, vision and multimedia data, 
 Fuzzy databases and information retrieval, 
 Rough sets, imprecise probabilities, possibilities approaches, 
 Fuzzy logic and its Industrial, financial, biological and medical applications, 
 Fuzzy logic in civil engineering and geographical information systems, 
 Fuzzy sets and soft computing in social sciences, linguistic summarization, natural language processing,
