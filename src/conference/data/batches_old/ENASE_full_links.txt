 The mission of ENASE (Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering) is to be a prime international forum to discuss and publish research findings and IT industry experiences with relation to novel approaches to software engineering. The conference acknowledges evolution in systems and software thinking due to contemporary shifts of computing paradigm to e-services, cloud computing, mobile connectivity, business processes, and societal participation. By publishing the latest research on novel approaches to software engineering and by evaluating them against systems and software quality criteria, ENASE conferences advance knowledge and research in software engineering, including and emphasizing service-oriented, business-process driven, and ubiquitous mobile computing. ENASE aims at identifying most hopeful trends and proposing new directions for consideration by researchers and practitioners involved in large-scale systems and software development, integration, deployment, delivery, maintenance and evolution.

 Abstract 
 Web applications are the preferred means of accessing online services. They have been built quickly and can be left with vulnerabilities due to human error and inexperience, making them vulnerable to attacks. As a result, security analysts must analyse and react to countless threats and alerts. Such alerts can not provide sufficient information about the attack performed on the web application, which is crucial for a correct risk assessment and remediation measures. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have been used as a primary defence mechanism against web attacks. However, HTTPS, a widely adopted protocol in web applications, encrypts traffic, hindering NIDS’ efficiency in searching for network security threats and attacks. To enhance web application security, we present an approach that uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect attacks through the analysis of network traffic (including HTTPS) and log-based payload contents. The approach employs anomaly detection by clustering netflows, and then NLP and supervised ML are used on the payload contents of anomalous netflows to identify attacks. Preliminary experiments have been made to detect SQL injection (SQLi), cross-site scripting (XSS), and directory traversal (DT) web attacks.

Preliminary experiments have been made to detect SQL injection (SQLi), cross-site scripting (XSS), and directory traversal (DT) web attacks. 
 AB - Web applications are the preferred means of accessing online services. They have been built quickly and can be left with vulnerabilities due to human error and inexperience, making them vulnerable to attacks. As a result, security analysts must analyse and react to countless threats and alerts. Such alerts can not provide sufficient information about the attack performed on the web application, which is crucial for a correct risk assessment and remediation measures. Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have been used as a primary defence mechanism against web attacks. However, HTTPS, a widely adopted protocol in web applications, encrypts traffic, hindering NIDS’ efficiency in searching for network security threats and attacks. To enhance web application security, we present an approach that uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect attacks through the analysis of network traffic (including HTTPS) and log-based payload contents. The approach employs anomaly detection by clustering netflows, and then NLP and supervised ML are used on the payload contents of anomalous netflows to identify attacks. Preliminary experiments have been made to detect SQL injection (SQLi), cross-site scripting (XSS), and directory traversal (DT) web attacks.
