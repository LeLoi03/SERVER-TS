PacificVis 2025 
 IEEE Pacific Visualization Conference (PacificVis) was born in Kyoto in 2008 as an international event sponsored by IEEE Computer Society with the aim of promoting visualization research and technologies, especially in the Asian-Pacific region. Since then, we had a series of annual events in Beijing (2009), Taipei (2010), Hong Kong (2011), Songdo (2012), Sydney (2013), Yokohama (2014), Hangzhou (2015), Taipei (2016), Seoul (2017), Kobe (2018), Bangkok (2019), Tianjin (2020 and 2021, online), Tsukuba (2022, online), Seoul (2023), and Tokyo (2024). The 18th edition of PacificVis will take place at Chang Yung-fa Foundation International Convention Center in Taipei, Taiwan, and will be hosted by National Taiwan Normal University and Taipei ACM SIGGRAPH over April 22-25, 2025. 
 We hope that all participants will enjoy PacificVis 2025!
