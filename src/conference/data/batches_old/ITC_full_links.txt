Papers Submittals 
 Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished papers describing recent work in the field of testing and testable design. Of particular interest are works dedicated to the topics listed on the right and/or works focused on special tracks such as Automotive Reliability, Reliability of AI HW and usage of AI for Testing, 3D/2.5D and Chiplet Testing, or HW Security. Authors are also invited to submit practical, industry-oriented papers. A special industrial case-study track is dedicated to papers that enable others to learn best industrial practices. 
 Submissions must include: 
 • Title of paper. 
 • Name, affiliation, e-mail address of each author. (Double blind review is not required). 
 • The corresponding author(s). ITC will communicate with the corresponding author(s). 
 • One or two topic(s) from the topic list, or a description of your topic. 
 • An electronic copy of a complete paper of 6~10 pages for regular papers (including regular Industrial case-study papers) or 3~5 pages for short Industrial Practices papers. 
 • An abstract of 35 words or less to be entered online. 
 ITC maintains a competitive selection process for technical papers. Submissions must clearly describe the status of the reported work, its contribution, novelty and/or significance. Supporting data, results (priority is often given to papers with results from real designs) and conclusions, and references to prior work must also be included. 
 Authors are also invited to submit a single-page poster proposal. Posters are a useful way of presenting late-breaking results, getting feedback on an innovative method, or participating without having to write a full paper. Acceptance as a poster does not preclude submission of a more complete work as an ITC paper in 2026. 
 Test Week tutorial and workshop proposals are also welcomed. Deadlines and other information about proposals can be obtained from TTTC at:http://tab.computer.org/tttc 
 For detailed information about the submission process, requirements and deadlines, the selection process, and any other questions regarding the program itself or contact information, please consult the ITC web site athref="http://www.itctestweek.org" - http://www.itctestweek.org

 Aim of the event 
 "Top Picks in VLSI Test and Reliability” (TPTR) is a workshop that collects and presents the most impactful publications, keynotes and invited presentations in the past 6 years in the areas of VLSI test and reliability. 
 For this year’s edition, the workshop is organized in two tracks: 
 The most impactful publications from the past six years in the areas of VLSI test and reliability, as last year. 
 The most impactful keynotes and invited presentations from the past six years, without an associated publication, in the same areas. 
 All articles in conferences and journals published from 2018 until the submission deadline are eligible for track 1. Keynotes or invited talks from an IEEE TTTC-sponsored conference from 2018 until the submission deadline are eligible for track 2. The two submission categories will be evaluated separately. 
 Submission:TPTR accepts self-nominations by authors in the form of a one-page letter. The authors should summarize and highlight the key ideas and contributions of the presentation or publication, describe the influence on ongoing research in the field, and state the potential to positively impact the microelectronics industry in the long term. 
 Review:submitted abstracts will be reviewed by a committee of renowned experts in the field and will be shortlisted. 
 Presentation:an author of each shortlisted publication must attend the workshop in person for a presentation showcasing its influence and impact. The presentation should be more than just replicating the original one. Authors should ensure that 30-40% of the allocated time is dedicated to highlighting its influence on ongoing research in the field and its potential to impact the microelectronics industry. 
 Final selection:the same committee (or a subset of it) will also attend the workshop to select a final list of Top Picks, which will then be invited for submission to an IEEE Design & Test special issue. The submission should not repeat or reword the original publication or presentation; it should be an extended version with new material.

 "Top Picks in VLSI Test and Reliability” will take place in conjunction with thehref="http://www.itctestweek.org" - 2024 IEEE International Test Conference
