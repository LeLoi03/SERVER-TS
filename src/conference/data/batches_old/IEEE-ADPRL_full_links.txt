 Research Interests 
 My primary research interests lie in the intersection ofrobotics,control theory, andmachine learning. What interests me most is the formulation of hybrid theoretical schemes and the development of novel robotic systems to bridge the gap between machine learning and autonomy. I am particularly interested in how learning algorithms and control theory can enable multi-agent systems to efficiently collaborate with minimal information exchange for robotic navigation, exploration, and manipulation tasks. Also, I contribute to the OpenBionics initiative on the design and development of affordable, open-source robot hands and prostheses.

 Title | Bounds of optimal learning 
 Authors | href="/researcher/807v2/dr-roman-belavkin" - Belavkin, R. 
 Abstract | Learning is considered as a dynamic process described by a trajectory on a statistical manifold, and a topology is introduced defining trajectories continuous in information. The analysis generalises the application of Orlicz spaces in non-parametric information geometry to topological function spaces with asymmetric gauge functions (e.g. quasi-metric spaces defined in terms of KL divergence). Optimality conditions are formulated for dynamical constraints, and two main results are outlined: 1) Parametrisation of optimal learning trajectories from empirical constraints using generalised characteristic potentials; 2) A gradient theorem for the potentials defining optimal utility and information bounds of a learning system. These results not only generalise some known relations of statistical mechanics and variational methods in information theory, but also can be used for optimisation of the exploration-exploitation balance in online learning systems.
