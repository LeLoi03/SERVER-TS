 International ACM SIGIR Conference on Innovative Concepts and Theories in Information Retrieval (ICTIR) 
 The ACM SIGIR Conference on Innovative Concepts and Theories in Information Retrieval (ICTIR) is a forum for the presentation and discussion of research related to the foundational aspects of Information Retrieval (IR), co-located each year with the SIGIR conference. 
 The Scope of ICTIR 
 ICTIR welcomes submissions that present scientific results, innovative concepts, or theoretical aspects related to information retrieval research.The conference embraces theory in a broad sense, including formal and cognitive theory, and encourages interdisciplinary research that connects information retrieval with other research disciplines that are theoretically motivated. Other research disciplines include, but are not limited to: artificial intelligence, cognitive science, digital humanities, machine learning, natural language processing, recommendation, and social computing. 
 ICTIR welcomes experiment-based papers, especially those whose results shed some light on the theoretical aspects of IR and related fields. While IR research traditionally demands rigorous experimentation, ICTIR does not see this as a must. That is, the lack of empirical results is not considered a weakness in an ICTIR submission. However, if the work is primarily theoretically driven, it should be presented in a way accessible to a wide audience in the IR community, and accompanied by good justifications and arguments. 
 Specific topics that are particularly welcome are decided by the ICTIR PC chairs each year.

 The 47th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval will be held from 14-18 July, 2024 in Washington D.C., USA. Please stay tuned to this website for the latest updates, and find us atLinkedin,X (Twitter), orWechat! 
  
 SIGIR is the premier international forum for the presentation of new research results and for the demonstration of new systems and techniques in information retrieval. The conference consists of five days of full papers, short papers, resource & reproducibility papers, perspective papers, system demonstrations, doctoral consortium, tutorials, and workshops focused on research and development in the area of information retrieval. This year, SIGIR will also have an industry track (SIRIP), a government day, a Large Language Model Day, various DEI events and social events, ranging from women in IR, student luncheon, welcome reception, and a formal banquet. 
  
 The conference will bein-person. For more details, visitthis page. Stay tuned on our news about early registration and visa letters. We look forward to meeting you in D.C.!

 ACM ICTIR 2025 
 The 11th ACM SIGIR / The 15th International Conference onInnovativeConcepts andTheories inInformationRetrieval 
 July 18, 2025 (Padua, Italy) 
 Co-located withhref="https://sigir2025.dei.unipd.it/index.html" - ACM SIGIR 2025
(July 13-17, 2025) 
 A new chapter in the history of ICTIR:Ten years ago, ICTIR 2015 was established under the ACM SIGIR umbrella. Given the evolving nature of the Information Retrieval field and the needs of the SIGIR community and the conference, ACM ICTIR, formerly known as the “ACM SIGIR International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval”, is renamed to ACM SIGIR International Conference onInnovativeConcepts andTheories inInformationRetrieval. 
 This new branding highlights and clarifies the focus of the conference for the authors, the reviewers, and the organizers. The conference aims to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of research related to thefoundationalaspects of Information Retrieval (IR), including, for example, new or improved models of relevance, ranking, representation, information needs, and evaluation. The conference also welcomes interdisciplinary research that connects information retrieval with other research disciplines that are theoretically motivated. We use the definition of foundation used by ICTIR founders asa scientific result that others can build upon and use for their own research. While IR research traditionally relies heavily on rigorous experimentation, ICTIR does not see this as a must. 
 ICTIR 2025 will be held onJuly 18 in Padua, Italyand invites submissions with substantial and original research oninnovative methodological contributionsto the field of Information Retrieval. This includes original research on the theoretical aspects of Information Retrieval, topics from neighboring fields with a strong and clear connection to Information Retrieval, and novel approaches and methods for developing, improving, and evaluating models related to the field of Information Retrieval. 
 📢Additionally, ICTIR 2025 considers the following theme and especially welcomes research papers related to the following theme:“LLMs + IR, what could possibly go wrong?” 
 📢New to ICTIR, ICTIR 2025 accepts bothregularandSIGIR Revise-and-Resubmit (SIGIR-RR)submissions.
