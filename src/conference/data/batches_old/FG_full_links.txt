 IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2025) June 3-5, 2025, Clearwater, USA.href="https://fg2025.ieee-biometrics.org" - https://fg2025.ieee-biometrics.org
*** Call for Papers *** The IEEE conference series on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition is the premier international forum for research in image and video-based face, gesture, and body movement recognition. Its broad scope includes advances in fundamental computer vision, pattern recognition, computer graphics, and machine learning techniques relevant to face, gesture, and body action, new algorithms, and analysis of specific applications. The 19th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition will be held on 3rd-5th June 2025 in Clearwater, USA as an in-person event. For FG 2025 we are soliciting papers in all areas of face and gesture recognition. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: + Face recognition, analysis, and synthesis, + Gesture recognition, analysis, and synthesis, + Body motion analysis and synthesis, + Action recognition, + Psychological and behavioral analysis, + Technologies and applications *** Paper format and submission *** -- Format -- Submitted papers may not be accepted or under review elsewhere. FG 2025 will consider two different paper types, i.e., Short and Long Papers. Authors should carefully consider the category before submitting a paper. + Short papers: 4 pages + 1 page for references + Long papers: 8 pages + references The main difference between the two is in the size of contributions and not in their importance or technical quality. Please visit the submission page for additional details on paper formatting and paper types. Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore. -- Submission -- FG 2025 will use a two-round reviewing procedure. New papers can be submitted in either the first or the second round. The primary benefit of submitting in Round 1 is that submissions can be invited for resubmission to Round 2, enabling authors to address reviewer concerns and significantly improve their work. Paper submissions are accepted through CMT:href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FG2025/" - https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FG2025/
*** Awards and IEEE TBIOM Special Issue *** Several awards will be given out to the best papers from FG 2025 including (1) the best paper award, (2) the best student paper award and (3) the test-of-time awards. A selection of best reviewed papers from FG 2025 will be invited to contribute to a special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Biometrics Behavior, and Identity Science (IEEE TBIOM). *** Workshops and tutorials *** Workshops and tutorials will be held on June 2 and June 6, 2025. Have a look at the conference website for instructions regarding workshop and tutorial proposals. *** Important Dates *** Round 1 Paper submission: September 23rd, 2024, 11:59pm Notifications to authors: December 13rd, 2024 Round 2 Paper submission: January 25th, 2025, 11:59pm Notifications to authors: March 3rd, 2025 Camera Ready (for all): April 21st, 2025 For more information, visit:href="https://fg2025.ieee-biometrics.org" - https://fg2025.ieee-biometrics.org
