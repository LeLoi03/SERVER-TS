 Welcome to Inner Mongolia123 
 About 2025 21th International Conference 
 The 21st International Conference on Natural Computation, Fuzzy Systems, and Knowledge Discovery (ICNC-FSKD 2025) will take place from July 26–28, 2025, in Hohhot, China. Meaning "The City of Blue" in Mongolian, Hohhot is the vibrant capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and a cultural and economic hub of northern China. Renowned as "The Milk Capital of China," it is famous for its rich dairy industry, breathtaking grassland scenery, and deep-rooted Mongolian heritage. The city blends ancient traditions with modern development, boasting landmarks such as the Dazhao Temple, home to a rare silver Buddha statue, and the Inner Mongolia Museum, which showcases the region’s nomadic history and dinosaur fossils. Visitors can experience traditional Mongolian cuisine, including roasted lamb and fermented mare’s milk, or immerse themselves in the dynamic Naadam Festival, featuring horse racing, wrestling, and archery. With its unique fusion of history, nature, and innovation, Hohhot provides an inspiring setting for ICNC-FSKD 2025. 
 As with the past ICNC-FSKD conferences, all papers in conference proceedings will be submitted to EI Compendex, Scopus, and ISTP (ISI Proceedings). ICNC-FSKD 2005-2024 have all been indexed in EI Compendex, etc. 
 ICNC-FSKD is a premier international forum for scientists and researchers to present the state of the art of data mining and intelligent methods inspired from nature, particularly biological, linguistic, and physical systems, with applications to computers, circuits, systems, control, communications, and more. This is an exciting and interdisciplinary area in which a wide range of theory and methodologies are being investigated and developed to tackle complex and challenging problems. The registration fee includes proceedings, lunches, dinners, banquet, coffee breaks, and all technical sessions. 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit manuscripts written in English. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by experts in the field based on originality, significance, quality and clarity. Authors should use the Latex style files or MS-Word templates obtained from the conference site to format their papers. Authors should submit PDF files of their manuscripts via the online submission system. Submissions imply that the papers have not been submitted elsewhere and will not be submitted elsewhere for publications before the review decisions of this conference.
