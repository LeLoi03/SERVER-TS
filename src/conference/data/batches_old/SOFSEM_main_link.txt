 Aims and Scope 
 The annual SOFSEM conferences are devoted to the latest results and developments offundamental researchincomputer science (informatics), inspired by the algorithmic challenges of our time. SOFSEM has a long tradition as a high-quality research conference, facilitating the scientific interchange among all researchers from academia and industry working on the foundations of computing. SOFSEM is usually held in January or early February. The series of SOFSEM conferences began in 1974.SOFSEM covers all research in thefoundations of computer science and artificial intelligence, including e.g.algorithms (approximation, combinatorial, exact, online, parameterized,randomized, streaming, etc), computational complexity, computational geometry, efficient data structures, discrete optimization, graph structure and algorithms, network analysis, parallel and distributed computing, parameterized complexity, quantum computing, structural complexity, theory and models of computation, automata (cellular, finite, networked, etc), AI-based algorithms andtechniques, computational learning, data compression algorithms, formal models, graph drawing and network layout, intelligent algorithms,machine learning theory, multi-agent algorithms and algorithmic game theory, nature-inspired computing, neural network theory, pattern searching,and other relevant theory topics in computing and AI.News

.href="" - SOFSEM Profile
SOFSEM maintains a unique position among the annual conferences and symposia in computing. Through itsinvited talks and the selected contributed papers on current research, as well as its well-known familiar atmosphere, SOFSEM is an appreciable mix of an international symposium and a winter school. It is a proven format, combining the presentation of original, high-quality research papers with lectures on trending themes in foundations and their, often interdisciplinary, background.SOFSEM conferences are conducted in person. Traditionally housing all participants at thesamevenue, the conference provides an optimalset-up for discussions, meetings, research initiatives, new contacts, and social interactions. SOFSEMencourages the co-operation and exchange of ideas among researchers across all domains of fundamental computer science and its bordering fields, in all stages of their career. It makes SOFSEM especially attractive for young computer scientists. 
 SOFSEM focuses on novel research and current developments in all key areas in fundamental computer science and its interfaces to the foundations of artificial intelligence (algorithms, AI-inspired methods, computational complexity, formal models). SOFSEM's list of topics of interest was renewed in 2022 and evolves with the developments and trends in foundational research in computing with each edition of the conference.Awards 
 Each year the SOFSEM Program Committee determines which of the contributed papers is/are deservant of theBest Student Paper Awardand theBest Paper Awardof the conference. The winners of the awards are normally posted on the conference website.href="" - Recent SOFSEM Conferences

 href="" - Brief History of SOFSEM
SOFSEM (orig.SOFtware SEMinar) was founded in 1974 as a winter seminar for computer scientists and software engineers in former Czechoslovakia. SOFSEM soon became the foremost national seminar devoted to theoretical and practical problems of software systems. In fact, in these early days of computer science and technology, SOFSEM supplemented the university education and academic research by facilitating a fast transfer of the latest relevant knowledge in computing to its audience. Later on international experts were invited also, to present series of lectures on recent topics. Each SOFSEM consisted of several series of invited lectures of 3 to 5 hours, complemented by selected contributions of participants. Until 1994, the total duration of every SOFSEM was two weeks.Gradually, SOFSEM transformed from a mainly national seminar into an international conference. After the split of Czechoslovakia in 1993 SOFSEM continued, but now alternating between the Czech and Slovak Republics. SOFSEM became recognized for its high-level invited talks and well-chosen tracks that followed the trends in the field. From 1995 onward, the SOFSEM proceedings were included in the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science of Springer. The duration of SOFSEM was shortened to eight days, and the track areas became more and more fixed for a longer time. Over the years, as the field expanded and international collaborations flourished, SOFSEM's unique role withinthe Czech and Slovak computer science communities lessened, yet its significance and position as an international symposium grew. 
 In 2016 the SOFSEM Steering Committee decided that, from then on, SOFSEM conferences could be organized by colleagues anywhere in Europe, i.e. not limited to the Czech or Slovak Republics anymore. The duration of SOFSEM was limited to a week or four days but its format and focus were still left unchanged, with three separate tracks (foundations, software engineering, and data science and engineering), a special theme track (algorithmic computational biology), and a student research forum. In 2022 SOFSEM did not take place, due to the covid-19 pandemic, but the time was used to prepare SOFSEM for the next major step on its new course, namely focusing the conference fully and undividedly to the foundations of computer science, together with its interfaces to closely related areas, especially the computational principles of artificial intelligence and data science.ArchiveEarly history of SOFSEM: | href="https://www.sofsem.cz/sofsem95/history.html" - SOFSEM - History | (SOFSEM'95)
