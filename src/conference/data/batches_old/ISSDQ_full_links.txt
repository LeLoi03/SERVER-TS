 The International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences(ISPRS Archives) is the series of peer-reviewed proceedings published by the International Society of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS). In the early years of the Society,Archive Volumeswere published independent of Congress or Technical Commission Symposia.Since Volume XXXII-3/W14, 1999, the Archives are open access publications, they are published under the Creative Common Attribution 3.0 (4.0 since June 2017) License, seehref="https://publications.copernicus.org/for_authors/licence_and_copyright.html" - https://publications.copernicus.org/for_authors/licence_and_copyright.html
for details. 
 The publication costs for each Archives volume are settled through the corresponding conference. Therefore, authors do not have to pay article processing charges. 
 The Archives are listed in the ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI) of the Web of Science, SCOPUS, the E/I Compendex, and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). 
 For decades the physical repository of the archive was hosted by ITC, University of Twente in the Netherlands. ISPRS gratefully acknowledges this support. In 2014 the repository was moved to the Technical Information Library (TIB) at Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover, and is now gradually being made available to the public, as all volumes are being digitised and integrated into this web interface. TIB performs this task as a service to the Society and the spatial science community. ISPRS is greatly indebted to TIB for this kind offer. 
 ISPRS Archives and Annals - automatic citation counts in Google Scholar enhanced 
 In order to solve existing problems with Google Scholar the domain part in the URLs for the two ISPRS proceedings series, the Archives and the Annals, have recently been changed. According to the publisher Copernicus, the old URLs will remain valid to avoid any broken links when referencing existing publications. Nevertheless, we would like to point out that using DOI for the reference is the best choice, as it ensures permanent validity. 
 Volume numbers XLV und XLVIIwere not applied and therefore the proceedings do not exist 
 The following table contains a list of all the ISPRS Archives.
