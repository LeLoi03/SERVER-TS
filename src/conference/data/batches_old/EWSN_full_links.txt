 International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks (EWSN) 
 The International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks is a highly selective, annual forum for presenting research results in the field of networked embedded systems,broadly defined, including for example Wireless Sensor Networks, Internet of Things, or Cyber-Physical Systems. The forum has been established in 2004 as "European Workshop for Wireless Sensor Networks (EWSN)", was renamed to "European Conference on Wireless Sensor Networks (EWSN)" in 2007 to reflect the maturity of the event, and the scope was broadened to "International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks (EWSN)" in 2016 to reflect the broad relevance of technologies covered by the event in multiple domains.href="" - Call for Hosting EWSN 2026

 Specific topics for the conference include (but are not exclusively limited to): 
 AI-operated wireless sensing, actuation, and control systems 
 Applications and opportunities for networked embedded systems in developing countries and emerging markets 
 Applications of wireless embedded networks in varied domains (e.g., health, automation, manufacturing, transportation, etc.)

 SUBMISSION DETAILS 
 Any paper submitted to EWSN 2024 must be original (i.e., not previously published) and not currently under review by any other conference or journal. All submissions in scope of EWSN are equally welcome, and all submissions will be evaluated based on the same criteria. 
 The conference will accept two types of papers – Full Papers (max 12 pages) and Short Papers (max 6 pages). All papers should present original research in the scope described above. No submission should have been published, accepted for publication, or be under review by any other venue (including other conferences, workshops, or journals). Short papers are intended to present preliminary research results or advocate for new research directions; their titles will be prepended with “Vision paper: / Position paper: / WiP paper” in the final proceedings. Note that EWSN 2024 intends to accept a small number of Short Papers to be presented together in a single dedicated session of the conference. Authors should carefully consider the distinction between Full Papers and Short Papers; papers submitted in one category will not be considered in the other category as part of the review process. 
 EWSN 2024 will use a double-anonymous review policy during the initial paper review. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper. Only PC chairs will know the identity of the authors and be able to interact with them during the review process, should the need arise. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed. To promote early dissemination, submission to arXiv (or similar) is allowed, provided cross-citations are not made. I.e., 
 You MAY post a version of your paper on arxiv that lists the names of the authors within the posted version. 
 You MAY NOT reference this arxiv version of your paper from the paper submitted for review at EWSN (this is one half of the cross-citation restriction). 
 You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN under review paper in the arxiv paper (this is the other half of the cross-citation restriction). 
 You MAY reference the arxiv paper in any other papers you submit for review at other conferences. 
 You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN under review paper in any other papers you submit for review at other conferences. 
 Once your paper is accepted, you MAY reference your EWSN paper (you can use "accepted, to appear" until the conference actually happens). 
 Submission will be via HotCRP:href="https://ewsn24.hotcrp.com/" - https://ewsn24.hotcrp.com/
. 
 Decisions will be: accept, reject, or one-shot revision; papers receiving a “one-shot revision” for the winter deadline will be invited to submit a revised paper by the summer deadline. 
 Authors of papers rejected in the winter cycle may submit a revised paper in the summer cycle along with a cover letter explaining how/why the new revision addresses all the concerns raised by the reviewers. 
 Should the program chairs deem this revision to be sufficient, the paper will be considered as a new submission for the summer cycle. Papers submitted to the summer deadline that are deemed by the program chairs to be too similar to a paper rejected from the winter review cycle will be returned without review. 
 Pages must use 8.5″ x 11″ (letter) two-column format, using 10-point type on 11-point leading, with a maximum text block of 7″ wide x 9″ deep with an inter-column spacing of .25″. Submissions with a page size of 11.7 x 8.3 ” (297 x 210 mm / A4) will not be accepted. The page limits include figures, tables, and references. Authors may use the ACM templates for convenience (e.g.,on Overleaf here). 
 All accepted conference and workshop papers, as well as poster, demo, PhD forum, and competition abstracts will be included in the conference proceedings. The proceedings will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library, SCOPUS, and other prominent digital libraries. 
 Generous cash awards sponsored by theTechnology Innovation Institutewill be provided to the best paper, best paper runner-up, and the best presentation award.
