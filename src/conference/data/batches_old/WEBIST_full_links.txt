 The International Conference on Information Systems 
 The International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) is the most prestigious gathering of information systems academics and research-oriented practitioners in the world. Every year its 270 or so papers and panel presentations are selected from more than 800 submissions. The conference activities are primarily delivered by and foracademics,though many of the papers and panels have a strong professional orientation. 
 ICIS was founded in 1980 at UCLA and the first conference was held at the University of Pennsylvaniaasthe " Conference on Information Systems". By 1986, particularly as the result of Canadian and European attendance and participation, " International" was appended to the name, thereby creating the International Conference on Information Systems. ICIS became truly international in 1990 when the conference was first held outside North America in Copenhagen, Denmark.

 IEEE International Conference on Space Mission Challenges for Information Technology / Space Computing Conference (SMC-IT/SCC 2025) 
 The International Conference on Space Mission Challenges for Information Technology (SMC-IT) and the Space Computing Conference (SCC) gather system designers, engineers, computer architects, scientists, practitioners, and space explorers with the objective of advancing information technology, and the computational capability and reliability of space missions. The forums will provide an excellent opportunity for fostering technical interchange on all hardware and software aspects of space missions. The joint conferences will focus on current systems practice and challenges as well as emerging hardware and software technologies with applicability for future space missions. 
 Systems in all aspects of the space mission will be explored, including flight systems, ground systems, science data processing, engineering and development tools, operations, telecommunications, radiation-tolerant computing devices, reliable electronics, space-qualifiable packaging technologies. The entire information systems lifecycle of the mission development will also be covered, such as conceptual design, engineering tools development, integration and test, operations, science analysis, quality control. 
 Seehttps://2024.smcit-scc.space/for last year’s conference website, andhttps://2024.smcit-scc.space/archive.htmlfor a list of prior editions of the conference.

 Deadline for full papers (SMC-IT and SCC) and SCC presentation-only abstracts: April 4, 2025 
 Author acceptance notification: April 25, 2025 
 Registration site open: Apr 4, 2025 
 Final camera-ready versions papers deadline: June 16, 2025 
 Final presentations deadline: June 27, 2025 
 Conference: July 28 – August 1, 2025 
 Sponsored by: IEEE Computer Society - Technical Committee on Software Engineering and Technical Committee on Computer Architecture 
 We invite submissions for the IEEE International Conference on Space Mission Challenges for Information Technology (SMC-IT) and the IEEE Space Computing Conference (SCC). These conferences gather professionals, such as system designers, engineers, computer architects, scientists, practitioners, data scientists, and space explorers, who are committed to advancing information technology and improving the computational capabilities and dependability of space missions. These forums provide a valuable opportunity for in-depth technical dialogues covering various aspects of space mission hardware and software. 
 Systems in all aspects of the space mission will be explored, including flight systems, ground systems, science data processing, engineering and development tools, operations, telecommunications, radiation-tolerant computing devices, reliable electronics, and space-qualifiable packaging technologies. The entire information systems lifecycle of the mission development will also be covered, such as conceptual design, engineering tools development, integration and test, operations, science analysis, and quality control. 
 Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) space applications of the following: 
 SMC-IT 
 Robotics, Cybersecurity, Networking, Memory and Storage, Advanced Ground Control, Advanced Modeling & Digital Twins for Onboard Systems, Data Analytics and Big Data, Fault-Tolerant Processing, Trustable Intelligent/Autonomous Systems, Smart Instruments, Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality and HCI, Manufacturing and Assembly of Large Structures, Improved Operations, Software Reliability for Mission-Critical Applications and Safety of Life. 
 SCC 
 High-Performance Onboard Computing, Components, Radiation, and Packaging, Computing Architectures, Flight Data Processing, Avionics Systems, Machine Learning/Neural Computing, Crew Interfaces, Extreme Environments Computing, Distributed Computing, Infusion and adoption of industry standards for space applications. 
 SMC-IT/SCC Classified Session 
 A SMC-IT/SCC classified session will be held at The Aerospace Corporation, Friday, August 1, 2025 from 0800 to 1200 PDT. The theme of the session is “Unleashing Disruption and Transformation: Emerging Technologies in Space.” All attendees must possess a TS/SCI clearance and be a U.S. Citizen. Please send a message to:smc-it-scc@aero.orgfor additional registration information. 
 Process and Format 
 • The SMC-IT/SCC 2025 Technical Committee is seeking two kinds of submissions at this time: full papers (BOTH SMC-IT AND SCC) and presentations (ONLY SCC). 
 • SMC-IT/SCC 2025 will use a single-pass, full-paper review process. 
 • The full paper is required and peer reviewed prior to deciding on acceptance for the conference, even if an abstract has been submitted. 
 • Full papers can be up to 10 pages, not including references. The paper template can be found on the IEEE website:https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html. 
 • All accepted papers will be published in the IEEE conference proceedings, indexed with the IEEE Xplore database. Note that IEEE has a “Podium and Publish” policy for conferences, which means that no manuscript will be published in IEEE Xplore without first being presented at the conference. 
 • Authors of SCC presentations without a corresponding paper need to submit a 1-page abstract, which will allow the conference organizers to determine if the proposed presentation is germane for the conference, determine which track/session the proposed presentation belongs, and ensure the author is in contact with the track/session chair for feedback prior to the final submission. All presentation-only abstract submissions must be submitted by the full paper deadline. 
 • Submissions must use the templates available at: 
 • All submissions are uploaded via EasyChair:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=smcitscc2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=smcitscc2025
• Selected papers may be invited to appear in a special issue of a reputable journal. More details will be made available in the future. 
 • Note: It is not required to submit an abstract prior to the paper submission. 
 • Note: The SMC-IT/SCC program committee can be found on the conference website.
