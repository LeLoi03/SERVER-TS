 Vision 
 32nd EuroSPI Conference 
 EuroSPI² 2025 (17 - 19 September 2025) will have 10 international thematic workshop streams supported by thematic topic communities and the ICSSP (International System and Software Process Association) conference will take place as a co-located partner event. Each thematic stream integrates both, research sessions and industry / applied science sessions. The thematic streams will be a mix of pitch talks provoking discussions, full presentations and panel discussions which will focus on specific questions of interest. 
 Thematic Workshop Sessions 
 EuroSPI² 2025, (17 - 19 September 2025), hosted by Riga Technical University, Riga, Latvia, will have international key notes as plenary sessions and thematic workshops integrating research and industry experience. Researchers present case studies and new research which can in future be considered by industry and in the workshops. Industry presents best practices from industry and discusses the approaches and methods with experts. The goal is to fertilize the cooperation between research and industry. Additionally we involve strategic EU projects to empower new directions and co-operations. 
 Social Events 
 We believe that networking and creating research and business relationships is important to create a sustainable community for improvement and innovation. While the conference offers ideas, presentations, discussions, knowledge during the day, the social talks after the conference are equally important to establish trust and partnerships. We also believe that Europe integrates many regions with different cultures and to build European trust based partnerships we need to learn about the culture of regions. So please join the networking space and social events. This year we plan to visit a hall in the Latvian society building and with classical music by price winning musicians and a buffet. 
 Key Notes 
 Key notes are plenary sessions by key experts from industry or research. Key notes (if accepted) are used to create key statements in the EuroSPI Youtube channel. We have every year 5 key notes from leading industry and research. Please visit our key notes page and the EuroSPI Youtube channel. We also invite key industry at the EuroSPI technology day, please visit our technology day page and download the free available presentations. 
 Workshop Communities 
 The thematic workshops allow leading industry and research to attend EuroAsiaSPI not only for a conference but also for a dedicated topic based workshop/training event. These workshop are dealing with hot topics and contain key papers and interactive sessions with open discussions. Participants work with the speakers to elaborate key statements to follow up in the next years workshops. The thematic workshops will be published as separate chapters in the annual SPRINGER book in the CCIS series. 
 EuroSPI as a Hybrid Event 
 We will continue to use the advanced technology equipment and organise an onsite and online hybrid event using integrated sound, cameras and video streaming combined with technical and content moderator roles in each workshop. Since EuroSPI² 2020 we have organised this hybrid event very successfully and feedback from attendees encourage us to continue with this new approach. 
 Social Events 
 Europe has many different regional cultures and customs, and still we need to work together in the EU frameworks. Already at the start of EuroAsiaSPI² in 1994 it was decided to place the conference in a different region every year and that the local host organises social events that help us to learn about the hosting culture, the traditions, history and the local food. This has a large influence on what social events EuroAsiaSPI² offers.This year we will plan to explore a famous medieval barbecue restaurant in the Rozena street on 17.9.2025.
