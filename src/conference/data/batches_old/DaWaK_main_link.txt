 Publication 
 All accepted conference papers will be published by Springer in their Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). LNCS volumes are indexed in Scopus; EI Engineering Index; Google Scholar; DBLP; etc. and submitted for indexing in the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI), part of Clarivate Analytics’ Web of Science. 
 The best DAWAK papers will be invited to contribute to the Special Issue of Data & Knowledge Engineering (DKE). 
 Scope 
 DaWaK conference is a high-quality forum for researchers, practitioners and developers in the field of Big Data Analytics, in a broad sense. The objective is to explore, disseminate and exchange knowledge in this field through scientific and industry talks. The conference covers all aspects of DAWAK research and practice, including data lakes, database design (data warehouse design, ER modelling), big data management (tables + text + files), query languages (SQL and beyond), parallel systems technology (Spark, MapReduce, HDFS), theoretical foundations and applications, text and data mining techniques, and deep learning. 
 Topics of Interest 
 The conference will bring together active researchers from the database systems, cloud computing, programming languages and data science communities worldwide. Main topics include: 
 Theoretical models for extended data warehouses and big data 
 Conceptual model foundations for big data 
 Modelling diverse big data sources 
 Parallel processing 
 Parallel DBMS technology 
 Distributed system architectures

 Submission Guidelines 
 DAWAK 2025 follows asingle-blind reviewpolicy. Authors are invited to submit original research contributions or experience reports in English.DaWak will accept submissions of both short and full papers. 
 Short papers | : up to 6 pages on preliminary work, vision papers or industrial applications 
 Full papers | : up to 15 pages (including references and appendixes). Full papers are expected to be more mature, contain more theory or present a survey (tutorial style) of some hot or not yet explored topics. 
 Papers exceeding the page limit or deviating from the formatting requirement are desk rejected. Submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. Duplicate submissions are not allowed and will be rejected immediately without further reviewing. 
 Authors are expected to agree to the following terms: "I understand that the submission must not overlap substantially with any other paper that I am a co-author of or that is currently submitted elsewhere. Furthermore, previously published papers with any overlap are cited prominently in this submission." 
 Questions about this policy or how it applies to a specific paper should be directed to the PC chairs 
 Submission Procedure 
 Papers submission will be managed using HotCRPhref="https://dawak2025.iiwas.org/" - papers submission system
. Authors should consulthref="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" - Springer’s authors’ instructions
and use the proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Please refer tohref="./papers-submission.html" - Paper Submission
procedure page. 
 Accepted papers 
 Authors of all accepted papers must sign a Springer copyright release form. Papers are accepted with the understanding that at least one author will register for the conference to present the paper. Selected high-quality papers, after revision and extension, will be invited to be published, in a special issue of Data & Knowledge Engineering (DKE), Elsevier (IF=2.7).
