2025 ACM SIGMOD/PODS @Berlin, Germany 
  
 Welcome 
 Welcome to the home of the2025 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference, to be held in Berlin, Germany, on June 22 - 27, 2025. 
 The Conference.The annual ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The conference includes a fascinating technical program with research and industrial talks, tutorials, demos, and focused workshops. It also hosts a poster session to learn about innovative technology, an industrial exhibition to meet companies and publishers, and a careers-in-industry panel with representatives from leading companies. 
 The Berlin Area.Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany and is located in the heart of Europe. With 50 lakes, three rivers (Havel, Spree, and Dahme), and eight canals, Berlin is a water city with around 1,000 bridges, significantly more than Venice. The federal capital has about 3.9 million inhabitants and is Germany's number one cultural melting pot. People from all over the world have shaped the city. Nowhere else in Germany can you find so many world-famous sights, events, flair, charm, entertainment options, a vibrant nightlife, a vast shopping world, and boundless culinary diversity. 
 The Conference Hotel.The conference will be held at the InterContinental Berlin, a modern and internationally renowned hotel, distinctive with its checkerboard façade and one of the most famous hotels in Berlin. The location directly at the famous "Tiergarten" and just a short walk from the iconic Brandenburg Gate makes the InterContinental Berlin an exclusive starting point for exploring the multicultural metropolis. It is one of Germany's leading conference and event venues, providing an outstanding stage for events of all kinds. It was honored with the "Europe's Leading Conference Hotel" award at the World Travel Awards 2024.

PODS 2025 CALL FOR RESEARCH PAPERS 
 The Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management, traditional or nontraditional (see https://databasetheory.org/PODS). 
 The 2025 conference will be held in Berlin, Germany. 
 Mission 
 The PODS community has a pivotal position in the research of computer science. It aims to provide a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques, and solutions for the data management challenges that continually arise in our data-driven society. It develops new ways of advancing data management to reflect the rich landscape of data requirements in applications nowadays. Our goal is to develop solutions that ensure high levels of efficiency, scalability, usability, expressiveness, robustness, security, clarity, and privacy, among others. The PODS community is an open space where researchers from various areas related to the principles of computer science can discuss, interact, and propose solutions to problems in data management. 
 Scope 
 PODS seeks scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application and system building in the context of data management. Such articles might be based, among others, on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks that deserve further exploration, providing experimental work that sheds light on the scientific foundations of the discipline, or a rigorous analysis of important industry artifacts. At a time when computer science is increasingly data-centric, it is essential to promote an active exchange of tools and techniques between PODS and other communities focused on data management. PODS thus pays special attention to those papers that help in the urgent process of integrating data management techniques within broader computer science. 
 Topics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to: 
 Database processing: Query evaluation, query optimization, schema management, distributed data processing, approximate data processing 
 Database design: Data models, query languages, schemas, constraints 
 Database access: Data structures, access methods, concurrency, transactions 
 Data quality: Data consistency, data cleaning, data discovery, data exploration 
 Data analysis: Data mining, machine learning, information extraction, data streams 
 Uncertainty: Incomplete data, inconsistent data, probabilistic data 
 Interoperability: Mappings and views, data integration, data exchange, ontology-based data access 
 Responsible data management: Access control, privacy, security, verification, ethical aspects of data management 
 Human-database interaction: data summarization, data visualization, explanation for database queries 
 Connections between database principles and other disciplines

Submission Format 
 Important: The submission format for PODS 2025 is different from that of previous years, for compatibility with the PACMMOD format of the PODS publications. 
 LaTex users must format their submission using the standard ACM "acmsmall" proceedings stylesheet: 
 https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template 
 They must use the following class declaration: 
 \documentclass[acmsmall,review,anonymous]{acmart}A submission can be up to 15 pages, not including references, plus unlimited space for references. Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, of unlimited length, that should be incorporated at submission time; online appendices are not allowed. However, an appendix will be read at the discretion of the program committee. Papers that are longer than 15 pages or do not cohere with the required format style risk rejection without consideration of their merits. The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere, including the formal proceedings of other symposia or workshops. 
 Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms and accepted papers will be published in a PODS 2025 issue of the PACMMOD (https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod) journal. Authors of papers published in the PACMMOD issues of PODS 2025 will be invited to present their work at the SIGMOD/PODS conference. PODS will apply a double-blind reviewing process. This implies that submitted papers must adhere to the double-blind reviewing policy described below and, in addition, authors must provide a list of potential conflicts of interest at the moment of submission. 
 Double-anonymous reviewing 
 PODS 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous reviewing process. This means that submissions must adhere to the following: 
 Author names and institutions must be omitted. 
 References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person. 
 Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed. 
 However, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. 
 Merit-based acceptance 
 The paper selection will be merit-based. We have no a priori limit on the number of accepted papers. As such, paper selection is strongly based on the individual contribution of papers and less so on the number of papers ranked higher in the conference tool. The program committee will judge the work based on originality, quality, clarity of presentation, relevance to the field, and technical depth.
