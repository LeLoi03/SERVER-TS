 Long research papers should present complete work with evaluations on topics related to the Conference. They will have both oral and poster presentations at the conference. Short research papers should present preliminary results or more focused contributions. They will be presented as posters at the conference.

 Semantic descriptors and novel high- or mid-level features, 
 Crowdsourcing, community contributions, and social multimedia, 
 Multimedia retrieval leveraging quality, production cues, style, framing, and affect, 
 Synthetic media generation and detection, 
 Narrative generation and narrative analysis, 
 User intent and human perception in multimedia retrieval, 
 Query processing and relevance feedback, 
 Multimedia browsing, summarization, and visualization, 
 Multimedia beyond video, including 3D data and sensor data, 
 Mobile multimedia browsing and search, 
 Multimedia analysis/search acceleration, e.g., GPU, FPGA, 
 Benchmarks and evaluation methodologies for multimedia analysis/search, 
 Privacy-aware multimedia retrieval methods and systems, 
 Fairness and explainability in multimedia analysis/search, 
 Legal, ethical and societal impact of multimedia retrieval research,

Review Style 
 ACM ICMR follows a double-blind review process for full paper selection. Authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the name(s) of the author(s). Please prepare your paper in a way that preserves anonymity of the authors: 
 Do not put your names under the title, 
 Avoid using phrases such as “our previous work” when referring to earlier publications by the authors, 
 Remove information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs), 
 Check supplemental material for information that may identify the authors’ identity, 
 Avoid providing links to Websites that identify the authors. 
 Abstract and Keywords 
 The abstract and the keywords form the primary source for assigning papers to reviewers. So make sure that they form a concise and complete summary of your paper with sufficient information to let someone who has not read the full paper know what it is about. 
 Submission Instructions 
 See thehref="/authors/paper-submissions" - Paper Submission
section. 
 Presentation Format 
 ACM ICMR 2025 will be an in-person event. All oral talks and demonstrations must be on-site at the conference venue, otherwise they will be removed from the proceedings and no refund given. This includes full papers, BNI papers and doctoral symposium papers. Posters should be presented at the conference, but we will also facilitate online posters using our online conference platform. This platform requires the upload of a poster and short accompanying video. We will be strictly enforcing this policy across all submission types.
