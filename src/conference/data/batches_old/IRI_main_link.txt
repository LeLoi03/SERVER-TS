Conference IRI:

This year's conference is dedicated to the memory ofDr. Stuart Rubin, our Honorary General Chair. Dr. Rubin was among the warmest of personalities, and had been with IRI since day one. He will be missed, but not forgotten. We are currently planning for several events along with this year's IRI to honor Dr. Rubin. Please stay tuned."I have so many memories about Stuart.""He's such a pioneer. We lost a wonderful friend.""He was such a good friend and a generous, guiding presence in our community, always bringing people together with his wisdom and warmth. His leadership and unwavering dedication to IEEE IRI have left an indelible impact on all of us.""He was a very valued member of the IRI team and will be greatly missed.""I will always remember his wisdom, dedication, humor, and kindness. He will be deeply missed."If you want to share your own thoughts about Dr. Rubin on this webpage, please contactNan Niu-->Read MoreNews

 About IEEE IRI 
 Data science has become the new frontier for business analytics and AI. Such intelligent applications derive fromInformation Reuse and Integration(IRI). IRI seeks to maximize the utility of information by creating simple, rich, and cost-effective knowledge representations. IRI consequently explores strategies for integrating this knowledge into systems and applications. It plays a pivotal role in the capturing, representation, maintenance, integration, validation, and extrapolation of information and the knowledge derived from it. Additionally, IRI applies both information and knowledge for enhancing decision-making in various application domains. 
 This conference explores three major tracks:information reuse,information integration, andreusable systems.Information reuseexplores the theory and practice of optimizing representations;information integrationfocuses on innovative strategies and algorithms for unifying diverse information in novel domains; andreusable systemsfocus on developing and deploying models and corresponding processes that enableInformation ReuseandIntegrationto play a pivotal role in enhancing decision-making processes in various application domains. 
 The IEEE IRI conference serves as a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that address real-world problems with real-world solutions. Theoretical and applied papers are both included. The conference program will include special sessions, open forum workshops, panels, and keynote speeches. In recent years, the acceptance rate of IRI has been constantlyunder 30%, maintaining the high quality standard and tradition of our conferernce.

 The full paper submission deadline has been extended to:Monday, April 14, 2025.We look forward to your IRI'25 contributions!This year's conference is dedicated to the memory of Dr. Stuart Rubin, our Honorary General Chair. Dr. Rubin was among the warmest of personalities, and had been with IRI since day one. He will be missed, but not forgotten. 
 To honor Dr. Rubin, we organize a special track on "Symbolic AI and Heuristics for Data Science" during our conference. During the submission process, you can indicate if you would like to have your paper/poster considered for the special track. Judged by the PC members and co-chairs, accepted contributions to the "Symbolic AI and Heuristics for Data Science" theme will be organized in the special track at this year's IRI conference. 
 This conference presents excellent, novel, and contemporary papers covering all aspects of Data - including Scientific Theory and Technology-Based Applications. The IEEE IRI conference and its workshops serve as a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present, discuss, and exchange ideas that address real-world problems with real-world solutions.
