 Since 1994, the RAMiCS conference series has been the main venue for research on relation algebras, Kleene algebras and similar algebraic formalisms, and their applications as conceptual and methodological tools in computer science and beyond. 
 Theoretical aspects include semigroups, residuated lattices semirings, Kleene algebras, relation algebras, quantales and other algebras; their connections with program logics and other logics; their use in the theories of automata concurrency, formal languages, games, networks and programming languages; the development of algebraic, algorithmic category-theoretic, coalgebraic and proof-theoretic methods for these theories; their formalisation with theorem provers. 
 Applications include tools and techniques for program correctness, specification and verification; quantitative and qualitative models and semantics of computing systems and processes; algorithm design, automated reasoning, network protocol analysis, social choice, optimisation and control.

Submissions must provide sufficient information to judge their merits. Additional material may be provided in a clearly marked appendix or by a reference to a manuscript on a web site. Experimental data, software or mathematical components for theorem provers must be available in sufficient detail for referees. Deviation from these requirements may lead to rejection. 
 One author of each accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference. Accepted papers must be produced with LaTeX. Formatting instructions and LNCS style files are available athref="http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html" - http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html

 RAMICS history 
 RAMiCS has been taking place since 1994, first under the acronym ofRelMiCS("Relational Methods in Computer Science") and, after uniting with theAKAconferences ("Applications of Kleene Algebra") as RAMiCS since 2009.

 ProfileGeorg studied theoretical physics and philosophy at the University of Heidelberg and obtained a PhD in computer science from the Max Planck Institute for Informatics in Saarbrücken. After a series of positions at German universities he joined the University of Sheffield in 2005. 
 href="#Researchinterests" - Research interests
Georg works mainly on logical and algebraic methods in computer science, formalised mathematics with interactive theorem provers and program verification and correctness. 
 His interests range from foundational work on the axiomatisation and semantics of sequential and concurrent computing systems to applications in the design and implementation of program verification software.
