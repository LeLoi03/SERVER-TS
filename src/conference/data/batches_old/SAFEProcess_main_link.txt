 The IFAC Safeprocess 2024 will provide the live streaming of technical sessions, roundtables and keynote lectures. However, live interaction is not supported. 
  
 Scope: IFAC SAFEPROCESS is a major international gathering of leading experts in academia and industry. It aims at strengthening contacts between academia and industry to build up new networks and cultivate existing relations. High-level speakers will present the global spectrum of fault diagnosis, process supervision and safety monitoring, state-of-the-art applications, and emerging research directions. The symposium is also meant as a forum for young scientists from all over the world, with the opportunity to introduce their research projects and works to an audience of international experts, young researchers, academics, and students. Fault diagnosis, Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) and Fault-Tolerant Control (FTC) build a major area of research at the intersection of systems and control engineering, artificial intelligence, applied mathematics and statistics, and application fields like chemical, electrical, mechanical, aerospace engineering and transportation systems. IFAC has recognized the significance of this area by launching a 
 triennial symposium series dedicated to these subjects. SAFEPROCESS 2024 is continuing the successful series of symposia.The IFAC SAFEPROCESS 2024 edition will be focused on major topics, i.e., energy, cybersecurity, water systems, and autonomous vehicles. Special sessions, plenary lectures, tutorials, benchmarks, and roundtables will highlight industrial-academic projects, challenges, and applications. 
 Topics & Application Areas 
 The continuous increase in the complexity of modern industrial systems and objects as well as growing reliability demands regarding their operation and control quality are serious challenges for further development of the theory and practice of control and technical diagnostics. Early detection of faults is 
 critical in avoiding performance degradation and damage to machinery or human life. 
 During the SAFEPROCESS Symposium high-level speakers will give talks on a wide spectrum of topics related to fault diagnosis, process supervision, safety monitoring, sustainable, health aware and fault-tolerant control as well as state-of-the-art applications and emerging research directions.The symposium is also meant as a forum for young researchers, with the opportunity to present their scientific ambitions and work to an audience of international communities of technical diagnostics and control. 
 Fault diagnosis, sustainable, health aware and fault-tolerant control have developed into a major research area at the intersection of system and control engineering, applied mathematics and statistics or soft computing as well as application fields such as civil, mechanical, electrical, chemical, computer science, telecommunication, and aerospace engineering. IFAC is recognized as playing a crucial role in this aspect by launching a triennial symposium dedicated to these subjects.

The proposal should include the title of the session, name, affiliation and address of the organizer, a summary of the session topic, and possibly a list of the invited papers with authors and titles. Invited session proposals must be submitted via the PaperCept website, where a session identification code will be assigned. 
  
 Contributors to the invited sessions must submit their full draft papers by November 25, 2023 deadline, specifying the invited session code to which they belong. 
  
 Tutorial session proposals must be sent to the Tutorial Session IPC Chair M. Bonfè 
 (marcello.bonfe@unife.it) by March 1, 2024. A tutorial session should be designed to help the attendees to become familiar with and learn something specific about chosen topics. The specific topic of the tutorial, its objectives, and the background required by the attendees should be clearly identified at the outset. Where appropriate, references for obtaining the background should be provided. The objective of citations in the tutorial sessions should be to provide the attendees with references where concepts can be studied more deeply. A set of selected references should be finally summarised. Tutorial proposals should include the title of the session, name, affiliation and address of the organizer, a summary of the session topics, and a list of the invited speakers (if required) with affiliations, and a preliminary schedule. Titles and abstracts of the talks should be also provided. Tutorial sessions should me no more than 4 – 6 hours. Upon receipt of the proposals, an identification number will be assigned.Student registration entitles the participation to tutorial sessions. Tutorial sessions will be delivered the day before the 
 symposium schedule, i.e. June 4, 2024. 
  
 Roundtable proposalsshould be sent to the IPC Chair C. Verde Rodarte (verde@unam.mx) and the General Symposium Chair S. Simani (silvio.simani@unife.it) byMarch 1, 2024. The general purpose of a roundtable is to hold a close discussion and exploration of a specific topic.The IFAC SAFEPROCESS 2024 edition will be focused on major topics, i.e., energy, cybersecurity, water systems, and autonomous vehicles. Roundtables should be comprised of experts on specific topics, and the organisers of roundtables should include a list of several goals to focus on. The overall objective of roundtables should be to produce a final set of recommendations and driving directions to an emerging topic. The novelty and advantage of roundtables is the live interaction of the experts/panellists and the audience. Dialogue and feedback from the audience and panellists on relevant topics will be enabled using apps and digital tools. The submission of a roundtable proposal should include the title, name, affiliation and address of the organizers, a summary of the addressed topics, and a list of the invited panellists, with affiliations, a preliminaryschedule. Each roundtable should be of no more than 2 hours. Roundtable sessions will be scheduled during the technical sessions of the symposium dates, i.e., June 5 – 7, 2024. 
  
 LiU-ICE Industrial Fault Diagnosis Benchmark Competition: A common challenge of designing diagnosis systems in industrial applications, is limited data availability from relevant fault scenarios and a lack of knowledge of model uncertainty. Development of fault diagnosis design techniques in this situation is the theme of the competition. The case study is the air-flow of an internal combustion engine. Information for competition participants can be found on the benchmark homepage: 
 https://vehsys.gitlab-pages.liu.se/diagnostic_competition/ 
  
 The submission deadline is April 21, 2024. The benchmark and the competition has been provided by Daniel Jung, Erik Frisk, and Mattias Krysander ({daniel.jung, erik.frisk, mattias.krysander}@liu.se) from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Linköping University, Sweden.

WELCOME 
  
 The Organizing Committee has the pleasure of inviting you to participate in the 12th IFAC Symposium on Fault Detection, Supervision and Safety for Technical Processes, to take place in Ferrara, Italy, 4 - 7 June 2024, under the auspices of IFAC, the International Federation of Automatic Control. 
 The SAFEPROCESS Symposium is organized every three years, and for the first time from its first edition in 1991, it takes place in Italy. Therefore, SAFEPROCESS 2024 is continuing the successful series of IFAC symposia held in Baden Baden (Germany, 1991), Espoo (Finland, 1994), Hull (United Kingdom, 1997), Budapest (Hungary, 2000), Washington (United States, 2003), Beijing (China, 2006), Barcelona (Spain, 2009), Mexico City (Mexico, 2012), Paris (France, 2015), Warsaw (Poland, 2018), Pafos (Cyprus, 2022). 
 The SAFEPROCESS Symposium is a major international gathering of leading experts in the academia and industry from all over the worlds. It aims at strengthening the contact between the academia and industry to build up new networks and cultivate existing relations. 
  
 The IFAC Safeprocess 2024 will provide the live streaming of technical sessions, roundtables and keynote lectures. However, live interaction is not supported. 
  
 Scope: IFAC SAFEPROCESS is a major international gathering of leading experts in academia and industry. It aims at strengthening contacts between academia and industry to build up new networks and cultivate existing relations. High-level speakers will present the global spectrum of fault diagnosis, process supervision and safety monitoring, state-of-the-art applications, and emerging research directions. The symposium is also meant as a forum for young scientists from all over the world, with the opportunity to introduce their research projects and works to an audience of international experts, young researchers, academics, and students. Fault diagnosis, Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) and Fault-Tolerant Control (FTC) build a major area of research at the intersection of systems and control engineering, artificial intelligence, applied mathematics and statistics, and application fields like chemical, electrical, mechanical, aerospace engineering and transportation systems. IFAC has recognized the significance of this area by launching a 
 triennial symposium series dedicated to these subjects. SAFEPROCESS 2024 is continuing the successful series of symposia.The IFAC SAFEPROCESS 2024 edition will be focused on major topics, i.e., energy, cybersecurity, water systems, and autonomous vehicles. Special sessions, plenary lectures, tutorials, benchmarks, and roundtables will highlight industrial-academic projects, challenges, and applications. 
 Topics & Application Areas 
 The continuous increase in the complexity of modern industrial systems and objects as well as growing reliability demands regarding their operation and control quality are serious challenges for further development of the theory and practice of control and technical diagnostics. Early detection of faults is 
 critical in avoiding performance degradation and damage to machinery or human life. 
 During the SAFEPROCESS Symposium high-level speakers will give talks on a wide spectrum of topics related to fault diagnosis, process supervision, safety monitoring, sustainable, health aware and fault-tolerant control as well as state-of-the-art applications and emerging research directions.The symposium is also meant as a forum for young researchers, with the opportunity to present their scientific ambitions and work to an audience of international communities of technical diagnostics and control. 
 Fault diagnosis, sustainable, health aware and fault-tolerant control have developed into a major research area at the intersection of system and control engineering, applied mathematics and statistics or soft computing as well as application fields such as civil, mechanical, electrical, chemical, computer science, telecommunication, and aerospace engineering. IFAC is recognized as playing a crucial role in this aspect by launching a triennial symposium dedicated to these subjects.

 registered and paid the registration fee by April 28, 2024 deadline. Standard registration covers two (2) papers. Student registration entitles the participant to submit one (1) paper. 
 The full text of all papers presented in person (no virtual presentations) at the symposium will be published, after the symposium, on the IFAC PaperCept Online website (http://ifac.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl). The best papers will be recommended for publication in various IFAC journals. 
  
 Invited session proposalsshould be anticipated by email to the Invited Session IPC Chair N. Eva Wu (evawu@binghamton.edu) by November 15, 2023. The proposal should include the title of the session, name, affiliation and address of the organizer, a summary of the session topic, and possibly a list of the invited papers with authors and titles. Invited session proposals must be submitted via the PaperCept website, where a session identification code will be assigned. 
  
 Contributors to the invited sessions must submit their full draft papers by November 25, 2023 deadline, specifying the invited session code to which they belong. 
  
 Tutorial session proposals must be sent to the Tutorial Session IPC Chair M. Bonfè 
 (marcello.bonfe@unife.it) by March 1, 2024. A tutorial session should be designed to help the attendees to become familiar with and learn something specific about chosen topics. The specific topic of the tutorial, its objectives, and the background required by the attendees should be clearly identified at the outset. Where appropriate, references for obtaining the background should be provided. The objective of citations in the tutorial sessions should be to provide the attendees with references where concepts can be studied more deeply. A set of selected references should be finally summarised. Tutorial proposals should include the title of the session, name, affiliation and address of the organizer, a summary of the session topics, and a list of the invited speakers (if required) with affiliations, and a preliminary schedule. Titles and abstracts of the talks should be also provided. Tutorial sessions should me no more than 4 – 6 hours. Upon receipt of the proposals, an identification number will be assigned.Student registration entitles the participation to tutorial sessions. Tutorial sessions will be delivered the day before the 
 symposium schedule, i.e. June 4, 2024. 
  
 Roundtable proposalsshould be sent to the IPC Chair C. Verde Rodarte (verde@unam.mx) and the General Symposium Chair S. Simani (silvio.simani@unife.it) byMarch 1, 2024. The general purpose of a roundtable is to hold a close discussion and exploration of a specific topic.The IFAC SAFEPROCESS 2024 edition will be focused on major topics, i.e., energy, cybersecurity, water systems, and autonomous vehicles. Roundtables should be comprised of experts on specific topics, and the organisers of roundtables should include a list of several goals to focus on. The overall objective of roundtables should be to produce a final set of recommendations and driving directions to an emerging topic. The novelty and advantage of roundtables is the live interaction of the experts/panellists and the audience. Dialogue and feedback from the audience and panellists on relevant topics will be enabled using apps and digital tools. The submission of a roundtable proposal should include the title, name, affiliation and address of the organizers, a summary of the addressed topics, and a list of the invited panellists, with affiliations, a preliminaryschedule. Each roundtable should be of no more than 2 hours. Roundtable sessions will be scheduled during the technical sessions of the symposium dates, i.e., June 5 – 7, 2024. 
  
 LiU-ICE Industrial Fault Diagnosis Benchmark Competition: A common challenge of designing diagnosis systems in industrial applications, is limited data availability from relevant fault scenarios and a lack of knowledge of model uncertainty. Development of fault diagnosis design techniques in this situation is the theme of the competition. The case study is the air-flow of an internal combustion engine. Information for competition participants can be found on the benchmark homepage: 
 https://vehsys.gitlab-pages.liu.se/diagnostic_competition/ 
  
 The submission deadline is April 21, 2024. The benchmark and the competition has been provided by Daniel Jung, Erik Frisk, and Mattias Krysander ({daniel.jung, erik.frisk, mattias.krysander}@liu.se) from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Linköping University, Sweden.
