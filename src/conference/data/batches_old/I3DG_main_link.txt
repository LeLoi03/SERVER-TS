 Summary:10 January 2025 deadline; at most 16 pages + references (shorter submissions are welcome); anonymous submission; submission linkhref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2025
Committee notifications and camera-ready dates have been shifted by a few days from the original announcement. 
 The ACM SIGGRAPH Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games (I3D) is the leading conference for real-time 3D computer graphics and human interaction. The symposium brings together researchers, engineers, and industry professionals to discuss their latest work on real-time and interactive computer graphics and related applications. The symposium has a long legacy of innovative and excellent technical content, with influential work on rendering, texture synthesis, collision detection, VR interaction, animation, and many other areas of real-time computer graphics, having been presented at the conference. 
 We invite you to submit papers about real-time 3D graphics, interaction, and games. All accepted papers will be published inPACMCGITIssue I3D 2025 and presented at I3D 2025 in May 2025, which is sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH. 
 Submissions from industry and outside of academia are welcome. Topics include, but are not limited to: 
 Real-time rendering 
 Real-time ray tracing and path tracing 
 Physics-based animation 
 Virtual and augmented reality 
 Deep learning for graphics and simulation 
 Collision detection 
 Real-time computer vision 
 Navigation in virtual environments 
 Texture synthesis 
 Real-time post-processing effects 
 Interactive 3D modeling 
 In-the-wild 3D reconstruction 
 Level-of-detail approaches 
 Pre-computed lighting for real-time applications 
 Visibility computation 
 Real-time surface shading 
 Fast shadows, caustics and reflections 
 Impostors and image-based techniques 
 Motion synthesis and path planning 
 Character and crowd animation and simulation techniques 
 Interaction devices and techniques 
 User studies of interactive techniques 
 Sketch-based 3D modeling and design 
 Video game techniques 
 Content generation techniques for real-time applications 
 Submission Information 
 Research papers should be inhref="https://www.siggraph.org/learn/instructions-authors" - ACM conference format
using theACM small trimjournal size (“acmsmall”). They should contain at most sixteen (16) pages of content, including appendices but excluding references. Optional supplemental material does not count towards this limit. Videos are required for techniques involving motion or animation. 
 There is a single track for paper submission, and authors will be asked to present a 15-20 minute talk on each accepted paper at the conference. At least one (1) author from each accepted paper must register for the conference. 
 Papers must be submitted anonymously and will be evaluated by double-blind peer review from an international paper committee of published authors and tertiary reviewers. There is no rebuttal process. The submission system link is:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=i3d2025
Papers go through a two-round review process. If papers are accepted after the first review round, all mandatory changes must be passed in a second round of peer review by the primary reviewer. 
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to allACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s newhref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" - Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects
. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain anORCIDID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution, and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
