Call for Talks 
 Talk proposals need not be full-length, and should report work in progress relevant to Haskell language design, theory, tools, or applications. Talk proposals will be evaluated by the PC for novelty and relevance to the Haskell community, but are not expected to include finished results. Talk proposals will not be distributed to attendees, but authors of talk proposals may provide links to materials to be included on the program. 
 href="#submission-details" - Submission Details
The tentative submission deadline is15 Sept 2025. Detailed information will be released closer to the deadline. 
 Call for Papers 
 The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2025 will be co-located with the 2025 International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) and the 2025 International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH). 
 The Haskell Symposium presents original research on Haskell, discusses practical experience and future development of the language, and promotes other forms of declarative programming. 
 Topics of interest include: 
 Language design,with a focus on possible extensions and modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the status quo; 
 Theory,such as formal semantics of the present language or future extensions, type systems, effects, metatheory, and foundations for program analysis and transformation; 
 Implementations,including program analysis and transformation, static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and distributed architectures, memory management, as well as foreign function and component interfaces; 
 Libraries,that demonstrate new ideas or techniques for functional programming in Haskell; 
 Tools,such as profilers, tracers, debuggers, preprocessors, and testing tools; 
 Applications,to scientific and symbolic computing, databases, multimedia, telecommunication, the web, and so forth; 
 Functional Pearls,being elegant and instructive programming examples; 
 Experience Reports,to document general practice and experience in education, industry, or other contexts; 
 Tutorials,to document how to use a particular language feature, programming technique, tool or library within the Haskell ecosystem; 
 System Demonstrations,based on running software rather than novel research results. 
 Regular papers should explain their research contributions in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and relating it to previous work, and to other languages where appropriate. 
 Experience reports and functional pearls need not necessarily report original academic research results. For example, they may instead report reusable programming idioms, elegant ways to approach a problem, or practical experience that will be useful to other users, implementers, or researchers. The key criterion for such a paper is that it makes a contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit. It is not enough simply to describe a standard solution to a standard programming problem, or report on experience where you used Haskell in the standard way and achieved the result you were expecting. 
 Like an experience report and a functional pearl, tutorials should make a contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit. What distinguishes a tutorial is that its focus is on explaining an aspect of the Haskell language and/or ecosystem in a way that is generally useful to a Haskell audience. Tutorials for many such topics can be found online; the distinction here is that by writing it up for formal review it will be vetted by experts and formally published. 
 System demonstrations should summarize the system capabilities that would be demonstrated. The proposals will be judged on whether the ensuing session is likely to be important and interesting to the Haskell community at large, whether on grounds academic or industrial, theoretical or practical, technical, social or artistic. Please contact the program chair with any questions about the relevance of a proposal. 
 If your contribution is not a research paper, please mark the title of your experience report, functional pearl, tutorial or system demonstration as such, by supplying a subtitle (Experience Report, Functional Pearl, Tutorial Paper, System Demonstration). 
 href="#submission-details" - Submission Details
Formatting 
 Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines. Authors should use theacmartformat, with thesigplansub-format for ACM proceedings. For details, see: 
 href="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format" - http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format
It is recommended to use thereviewoption when submitting a paper; this option enables line numbers for easy reference in reviews. 
 Functional pearls, experience reports, tutorials and demo proposals should be labelled clearly as such. 
 Lightweight Double-blind Reviewing 
 Haskell Symposium 2025 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules: 
 Author names and institutions must be omitted, and 
 References to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work” but rather "We build on the work of "). 
 The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. 
 A reviewer will learn the identity of the author(s) of a paper after a review is submitted. 
 Page Limits 
 The length of submissions should not exceed the following limits: 
 Regular paper: | 12 pages 
 Functional pearl: | 12 pages 
 Tutorial: | 12 pages 
 Experience report: | 6 pages 
 Demo proposal: | 2 pages 
 There is no requirement that all pages are used. For example, a functional pearl may be much shorter than 12 pages. In all cases, the list of references is not counted against these page limits. 
 Deadlines 
 Paper submission: | 9 June 2025 (Mon) 
 Notification: | 17 July 2025 (Thu) 
 Deadlines are end of dayAnywhere on Earth (UTC-12). 
 href="#submission" - Submission
Submissions must adhere to SIGPLAN’srepublication policy, and authors should be aware of ACM’spolicies on plagiarism. Program Committee members are allowed to submit papers, but their papers will be held to a higher standard. 
 The paper submission deadline and length limitations are firm. There will be no extensions, and papers violating the length limitations will be summarily rejected. 
 Papers should be submitted through HotCRP at: 
 href="https://haskell25.hotcrp.com/" - https://haskell25.hotcrp.com/
Improved versions of a paper may be submitted at any point before the submission deadline using the same web interface. 
 Supplementary material:Authors have the option to attach supplementary material to a submission, on the understanding that reviewers may choose not to look at it. This supplementary material should not be submitted as part of the main document; instead, it should be uploaded as a separate PDF document or tarball. Supplementary material should be uploaded at submission time, not by providing a URL in the paper that points to an external repository. Authors can distinguish between anonymized and non-anonymized supplementary material. Anonymized supplementary material will be visible to reviewers immediately; non-anonymized supplementary material will be revealed to reviewers only after they have submitted their review of the paper and learned the identity of the author(s). 
 Resubmitted Papers:authors who submit a revised version of a paper that has previously been rejected by another conference have the option to attach an annotated copy of the reviews of their previous submission(s), explaining how they have addressed these previous reviews in the present submission. If a reviewer identifies him/herself as a reviewer of this previous submission and wishes to see how his/her comments have been addressed, the conference chair will communicate to this reviewer the annotated copy of his/her previous review. Otherwise, no reviewer will read the annotated copies of the previous reviews. 
 Proceedings 
 Accepted papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library. Their authors will be required to choose one of the following options: 
 Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission-to-publish license (and, optionally, licenses the work with a Creative Commons license); 
 Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission-to-publish license; 
 Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
 For more information, please see ACMCopyright Policyand ACMhref="http://authors.acm.org/main.html" - Author Rights
. 
 Accepted proposals for system demonstrations will be posted on the symposium website but not formally published in the proceedings. 
 Publication date:The official publication date of accepted papers is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. 
 Artifacts 
 Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make auxiliary material (artifacts like source code, test data, etc.) available with their paper. They can opt to have these artifacts published alongside their paper in the ACM Digital Library (copyright of artifacts remains with the authors). 
 If an accepted paper’s artifacts are made permanently available for retrieval in a publicly accessible archival repository like the ACM Digital Library, that paper qualifies for an Artifacts Available badge (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging#available). Applications for such a badge can be made after paper acceptance and will be reviewed by the PC chair. 
 If you have questions, please contact the chairs at:ningningxie@cs.toronto.eduandgarrett-morris@uiowa.edu.

Call for Talks 
 Talk proposals need not be full-length, and should report work in progress relevant to Haskell language design, theory, tools, or applications. Talk proposals will be evaluated by the PC for novelty and relevance to the Haskell community, but are not expected to include finished results. Talk proposals will not be distributed to attendees, but authors of talk proposals may provide links to materials to be included on the program. 
 href="#submission-details" - Submission Details
The tentative submission deadline is15 Sept 2025. Detailed information will be released closer to the deadline. 
 Call for Papers 
 The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2025 will be co-located with the 2025 International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) and the 2025 International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH). 
 The Haskell Symposium presents original research on Haskell, discusses practical experience and future development of the language, and promotes other forms of declarative programming. 
 Topics of interest include: 
 Language design,with a focus on possible extensions and modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the status quo; 
 Theory,such as formal semantics of the present language or future extensions, type systems, effects, metatheory, and foundations for program analysis and transformation; 
 Implementations,including program analysis and transformation, static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and distributed architectures, memory management, as well as foreign function and component interfaces; 
 Libraries,that demonstrate new ideas or techniques for functional programming in Haskell; 
 Tools,such as profilers, tracers, debuggers, preprocessors, and testing tools; 
 Applications,to scientific and symbolic computing, databases, multimedia, telecommunication, the web, and so forth; 
 Functional Pearls,being elegant and instructive programming examples; 
 Experience Reports,to document general practice and experience in education, industry, or other contexts; 
 Tutorials,to document how to use a particular language feature, programming technique, tool or library within the Haskell ecosystem; 
 System Demonstrations,based on running software rather than novel research results. 
 Regular papers should explain their research contributions in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and relating it to previous work, and to other languages where appropriate. 
 Experience reports and functional pearls need not necessarily report original academic research results. For example, they may instead report reusable programming idioms, elegant ways to approach a problem, or practical experience that will be useful to other users, implementers, or researchers. The key criterion for such a paper is that it makes a contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit. It is not enough simply to describe a standard solution to a standard programming problem, or report on experience where you used Haskell in the standard way and achieved the result you were expecting. 
 Like an experience report and a functional pearl, tutorials should make a contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit. What distinguishes a tutorial is that its focus is on explaining an aspect of the Haskell language and/or ecosystem in a way that is generally useful to a Haskell audience. Tutorials for many such topics can be found online; the distinction here is that by writing it up for formal review it will be vetted by experts and formally published. 
 System demonstrations should summarize the system capabilities that would be demonstrated. The proposals will be judged on whether the ensuing session is likely to be important and interesting to the Haskell community at large, whether on grounds academic or industrial, theoretical or practical, technical, social or artistic. Please contact the program chair with any questions about the relevance of a proposal. 
 If your contribution is not a research paper, please mark the title of your experience report, functional pearl, tutorial or system demonstration as such, by supplying a subtitle (Experience Report, Functional Pearl, Tutorial Paper, System Demonstration). 
 href="#submission-details" - Submission Details
Formatting 
 Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines. Authors should use theacmartformat, with thesigplansub-format for ACM proceedings. For details, see: 
 href="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format" - http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format
It is recommended to use thereviewoption when submitting a paper; this option enables line numbers for easy reference in reviews. 
 Functional pearls, experience reports, tutorials and demo proposals should be labelled clearly as such. 
 Lightweight Double-blind Reviewing 
 Haskell Symposium 2025 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules: 
 Author names and institutions must be omitted, and 
 References to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work” but rather "We build on the work of "). 
 The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. 
 A reviewer will learn the identity of the author(s) of a paper after a review is submitted. 
 Page Limits 
 The length of submissions should not exceed the following limits: 
 Regular paper: | 12 pages 
 Functional pearl: | 12 pages 
 Tutorial: | 12 pages 
 Experience report: | 6 pages 
 Demo proposal: | 2 pages 
 There is no requirement that all pages are used. For example, a functional pearl may be much shorter than 12 pages. In all cases, the list of references is not counted against these page limits. 
 Deadlines 
 Paper submission: | 9 June 2025 (Mon) 
 Notification: | 17 July 2025 (Thu) 
 Deadlines are end of dayAnywhere on Earth (UTC-12). 
 href="#submission" - Submission
Submissions must adhere to SIGPLAN’srepublication policy, and authors should be aware of ACM’spolicies on plagiarism. Program Committee members are allowed to submit papers, but their papers will be held to a higher standard. 
 The paper submission deadline and length limitations are firm. There will be no extensions, and papers violating the length limitations will be summarily rejected. 
 Papers should be submitted through HotCRP at: 
 href="https://haskell25.hotcrp.com/" - https://haskell25.hotcrp.com/
Improved versions of a paper may be submitted at any point before the submission deadline using the same web interface. 
 Supplementary material:Authors have the option to attach supplementary material to a submission, on the understanding that reviewers may choose not to look at it. This supplementary material should not be submitted as part of the main document; instead, it should be uploaded as a separate PDF document or tarball. Supplementary material should be uploaded at submission time, not by providing a URL in the paper that points to an external repository. Authors can distinguish between anonymized and non-anonymized supplementary material. Anonymized supplementary material will be visible to reviewers immediately; non-anonymized supplementary material will be revealed to reviewers only after they have submitted their review of the paper and learned the identity of the author(s). 
 Resubmitted Papers:authors who submit a revised version of a paper that has previously been rejected by another conference have the option to attach an annotated copy of the reviews of their previous submission(s), explaining how they have addressed these previous reviews in the present submission. If a reviewer identifies him/herself as a reviewer of this previous submission and wishes to see how his/her comments have been addressed, the conference chair will communicate to this reviewer the annotated copy of his/her previous review. Otherwise, no reviewer will read the annotated copies of the previous reviews. 
 Proceedings 
 Accepted papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library. Their authors will be required to choose one of the following options: 
 Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission-to-publish license (and, optionally, licenses the work with a Creative Commons license); 
 Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission-to-publish license; 
 Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM. 
 For more information, please see ACMCopyright Policyand ACMhref="http://authors.acm.org/main.html" - Author Rights
. 
 Accepted proposals for system demonstrations will be posted on the symposium website but not formally published in the proceedings. 
 Publication date:The official publication date of accepted papers is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. 
 Artifacts 
 Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make auxiliary material (artifacts like source code, test data, etc.) available with their paper. They can opt to have these artifacts published alongside their paper in the ACM Digital Library (copyright of artifacts remains with the authors). 
 If an accepted paper’s artifacts are made permanently available for retrieval in a publicly accessible archival repository like the ACM Digital Library, that paper qualifies for an Artifacts Available badge (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging#available). Applications for such a badge can be made after paper acceptance and will be reviewed by the PC chair. 
 If you have questions, please contact the chairs at:ningningxie@cs.toronto.eduandgarrett-morris@uiowa.edu.
