 grammars, acceptors, and transducers for words, trees, and graphs 
 algebraic theories of automata 
 algorithmic, combinatorial, and algebraic properties of words and languages 
 relations between formal languages and artificial neural networks

 Submission Guidelines 
 Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished research. The proceedings will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) Series. Simultaneous submission to journals or other conferences with published proceedings is not allowed. Submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages excluding bibliography and must follow the LNCS-style LaTeX2e (available athref="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html" - http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html
). 
 In order to facilitate the review process, all proofs omitted due to page limitations can be given in an appendix or made accessible through a reliable link to a freely available electronic preprint. Please note that the paper should be self-contained; reviewers are not required to read any additional pages, thus consulting the appendix is up to the reviewer. Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF through the EasyChair system:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dlt2025" - https://easychair.org/conference?conf=dlt2025
History 
 The first Developments in Language Theory (DLT) conference was organized by G. Rozenberg and A. Salomaa in Turku, Finland in 1993. Since 1993, the DLT conferences were held in every odd year. Since 2001, a DLT conference takes place in Europe in every odd year and outside Europe in every even year. The last 10 editions of the conference took place in:

 Overview 
 The 26th International Conference Developments in Language Theory (DLT-2022) will take place in Tampa, FL, USA on May 9th-13th, 2022.The conference is scheduled to be completely in person. 
 For more information about the DLT conference series, visithref="http://math.utu.fi/dlt/" - DLT Homepage
hosted at University of Turku. This year's DLT will be held in parallel with thehref="/arts-sciences/departments/mathematics-statistics/research/conferences/dtmb2022/" - SCMB Workshop on Discrete and Topological Models in Molecular Biology
(May 9-13). 
 CORonavirus outbreak 
 April 7, 2022:The conference is planned as an in-person event completely. The covid numbers in Florida are very low currently (lowest since the start of the pandemic). The venues we have chosen have good ventilation systems and are large enough to accommodate participants to spread around if they so wish, and keep the physical distance. The lunch is planned as a picnic style. 
 September 27, 2021:At this point we plan to have the conference at the scheduled dates. However, we are closely monitoring the situation with coronavirus COVID-19 and will post updates if it changes in a way impacting the conference. 
 Please email us athref="mailto:dlt2022@usf.edu" - dlt2022@usf.edu
with any questions. 
 The proceedings will be published in theSpringer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) Series. The authors of selected papers will be invited to submit the extended versions of their articles to the special issue of the SpringerTheory of Computing Systemsjournal.

 DLT Award 
 A special DLT award was given to professors Arto Salomaa and Grzegorz Rozenberg during the 20th DLT symposium in Montreal in 2016. The award was given due to their distinguished contributions to automata theory and founding the DLT conference. The award consisted of a DLT Award diploma and an artistic glass work of an owl. 
 Salomaa Prize 
 As a continuation of the DLT Award, an annual prize, named asSalomaa Prize, was created in 2018. The first prize was awarded in the DLT symposium in Tokyo in 2018. The prize consists of a diploma and 2000 euros prize funded by the University of Turku, the home university of Arto Salomaa.
