 Cloudcom 
 2024Register nowThe 15th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science 
 Dec 
 9 - 11 , 2024 
 Abu Dhabi , 
 UAE 
  
 Introduction 
 CloudCom is a premier international conference on Cloud Computing, attracting academia and industrial researchers, practitioners, engineers, and students from the fields of cloud computing, edge computing, virtualization, security and privacy, big data, systems architecture, service-oriented architecture, and high-performance computing. It has a long tradition of emphasizing how to build cloud computing platforms with impact. The conference is co-sponsored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Cloud Computing Association. Every year it attracts world class members to explore the new challenges, present leading-edge innovations, and identify emerging technologies. 
 The 15th CloudCom in 2024 (CloudCom 2024) will continue this well-established tradition and travel to the Middle East to be held in the cosmopolitan city of Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, from December 9 to December 11, 2024.

 SUBMISSION DETAILS 
 Original and unpublished work must be submitted through the online submission system at: 
 href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cloudcom2024" - https://easychair.org/conferences /?conf=cloudcom2024.
Submissions should not exceed 8 pages, including tables, figures, and references in IEEE CS format. The template files for LATEX or WORD can be downloaded from the IEEE sitehttps://www.ieee.org/conferences /publishing/templates.html. Submission must be made in PDF format only with savable text and embedded fonts. The review process will be doubly blind and so a submission should not include any information that may identify the authors of the manuscripts. Technical content of the camera-ready manuscript must be identical to the submitted version except for changes made to address TPC review comments. For each accepted submission, at least one of the co-authors must have a full conference registration and present the work in person. Note the early submission deadline for workshop proposals. 
 Original technical submissions of regular research papers, workshop proposals, and special session proposals on the following tracks are invited:
