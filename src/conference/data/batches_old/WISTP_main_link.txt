 Interests 
 My research is inspired by practical problems, and often interdisciplinary in nature. My main area of research is privacy by design. There I focus on methods to translate vague legal data protection norms into more concrete engineering design principles, and tools that help engineers implement privacy into the systems they develop. Apart from that the following research topics are of interest to me:href="./research-particular.html" - privacy and the Internet of
Things
,href="./research-particular.html" - advanced use of
smart-cards
, andhref="./research-particular.html" - privacy and
identity management
. I also started studying blockchain / distributed ledger technology, mostly to counter the hype surrounding it... I am of course interested in cryptography [:-}] and information security in generalhref="./research-particular.html" - 
. 
 I am also interested in the social and legal aspects of technology and like to engage in the public debate about security and privacy. I explore these issue on myblog. 
 Privacy Design Startegies 
 I have developed eightprivacy design strategiesthat make privacy by design more concrete. They translate vague (legal) privacy norms into more concrete design goals that engineers are more comfortable to work with. 
 More information can be found in the'The Little Blue book'/'Het Blauwe Boekje'. 
 The icons for each of the strategies and other graphics are also available inpdfandSVG(icons only) format. 
  
 People 
 I currently (co)supervise or advise the following PhD students. 
 Nina Hartmann (Radboud University) 
 Yelyzaveta Markova (Radboud University) 
 Mahdi Akil (Karlstad Universitet)
