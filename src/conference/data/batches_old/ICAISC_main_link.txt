 Beware of the fake ICAISC Conference from WASET 
 We would like to bring to your attention the issue of fake conferences organized by WASET (World Academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology). It has come to our notice that WASET has a history of hosting dubious conferences that lack academic rigor and credibility. We advise you to thoroughly research any conference before committing to it and to consult with trusted colleagues or academic advisors if you have doubts. Please read more at:

Submission 
 The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer-Verlag series "Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence", and we strongly recommend the use of the Springer LaTeX style. To ensure reasonable quality and consistency of preparation, it is important that authors adhere strictly to the instructions. Any manuscript submitted in technically unsuitable form will be returned to the author for retyping. Authors should consult Springer’shref="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" - authors’ guidelines
and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for MS Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are also available inOverleaf. Springer encourages authors to include theirORCIDsin their (final) papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. 
 Initial submissions must be FULL papers (preferably 12 pages) and not merely abstracts. Initial submissions have to contain ananonymized PDFand non-anonymized sources. Papers will undergo double-blind reviewing by an international committee, and accepted on the basis of their scientific merit and relevance to the conference topics. Please prepare an anonymized PDF version of the paper being submitted. Please preserve anonymity by avoiding providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgements, links to websites and the literature references. Please refer to your previous work as to a work of someone else. In place of author names, please write "Anonymous ICAISC 2025 submission". Sources of the paper do not have to be anonymized. 
 Every final paper must be accompanied by the copyright form, which we ask a corresponding author to complete and sign. The copyright form in PDF is located atthe Springer web site(Licence to Publish form for LNCS, CCIS or LNBIP). It is sufficient if one author of each contribution signs the form on behalf of all the other authors. the copyright form should be submitted during the final submission as a separate zipped pdf file. Please use the following data to fill the form: 
 Title of the Book/Volume/Conference: ICAISC 2025 Proceedings 
 Volume Editor(s): L. Rutkowski et al. 
 All final submissions should be in a .zip compressed archive including: 
 the source (input) files, i.e. TeX source files for the text and figure files, 
 any style files, templates, and special fonts the authors may have used, 
 MS Word file in the case of using MS Word, 
 the final Postscript (.ps) or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file, 
 the scanned completed and signed copyright form. 
 By submitting the paper to the ICAISC conference the author(s) agree that they did not submit this paper to any other conference and one of them will attend the conference to present the paper. 
 Please note that all papers will be assigned a paper number. You will receive this number after you have completed the paper submission process. Authors are then required to use the paper number assigned to them for all future correspondence regarding this paper.

 The conference is organized in Poland's premier mountain resort Zakopane, the beautiful and picturesque capital of the Polish High Tatra Mountains. Even though Zakopane is called Poland's winter capital, it is an excellent place to visit in spring. Situated at the foot of the Tatra Mountains and the Tatra National Park (with Poland's highest peak, Rysy mountain (2499m)), it offers you a chance to hike on over 240km of marked hiking trails for beginners as well as experienced climbers and explore caves (accessible only in summer). The town boasts many historic monuments, museums, art galleries and exhibitions. On your way to Zakopane you may visit Cracow, one of the most historic Polish cities, with a wonderfully preserved old city center and the largest medieval square in Europe.

You can reach Zakopane by bus from many locations by e.g. FlixBushttps://www.flixbus.pl/autobusy/zakopane. There are airports inCracow(Kraków) and Warsaw (Warszawa, 450 km from Zakopane). There are several flights a day between Warsaw and Cracow (LOT Polish Airlines). Alternatively, you can use a train from Warsaw to get to Cracow or directly to Zakopane (Polish State Railways Time-table). There are several car rental operators at the Cracow airport as well as the Warsaw airport: 
  
 Company | Phone | Fax
