 Call for Papers 
 We invite all members of the international Artificial Intelligence research and industry communities to submit their high-quality, previously unpublished papers to EPIA 2025. 
 The EPIA Conference on Artificial Intelligence is a well-established European conference in the field of AI. The 24th edition, EPIA 2025, will take place in the pitoresque capital of Algarve, Faro, from 1st to 3rd of October, 2025. 
 The purpose of this conference is to promote research in all areas of AI, covering both theoretical/foundational issues and applications, and the scientific exchange among researchers, engineers, and practitioners in related disciplines. 
 EPIA2025 is organized around thematic tracks. These are intended to provide an environment that fosters an active exchange of ideas between attendees within specific sub-areas of AI. 
 Prospective authors should select the thematic track to which their paper is to be submitted. 
 Important dates 
  
 Paper submission deadline: | May 23, 2025 (AoE) 
 Notification of paper acceptance: | July 4, 2025 
 Camera-ready papers deadline: | July 14, 2025 (AoE) 
 Conference: | October 1-3, 2025 
 Submission guidelines 
 Papers should be prepared according to theSpringer LNAI format, using either a LaTeX or a Word template, with a maximum of 12 pages, including references. However, authors should consider any track-specific details in their submission. 
 EPIA 2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for, has already been published in or has already been accepted for publication in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. Authors of EPIA 2025 submissions are also not permitted to submit their paper to a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings during the EPIA 2025 review period. (As a guideline, authors should regard publications with a DOI, ISBN, or ISSN as formal publications. Questions about submission eligibility should be referred to the program chair before the deadline.) These restrictions do not apply to workshops and similar specialized presentations without formally published proceedings. 
 Submitted papers will be subject to a double-blind review process and will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the respective thematic track program committee. 
 It is the responsibility of the authors to remove names and affiliations from the submitted papers, and to take reasonable care to assure anonymity during the review process. Authors should also follow the standards as set out in the Springer Naturehref="https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct" - code of conduct
. 
 All accepted papers will be published by Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, provided that at least one author is registered in EPIA2025 by the early registration deadline. 
 Each accepted paper is required to be presented by one of the authors in a track session. EPIA2025 features the following thematic tracks covering a wide spectrum of AI topics:
