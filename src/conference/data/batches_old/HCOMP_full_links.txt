Welcome to HCOMP 2024! 
 The 12th AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2024) will be held October 16-19th in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and will particularly focus on the theme of ''Responsible Crowd Work for Better AI.'' 
 HCOMP is the premier venue for disseminating the latest research findings on human computation and crowdsourcing. While artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) represent traditional mainstays of the conference, HCOMP believes strongly in fostering and promoting broad, interdisciplinary research. Our field is particularly unique in the diversity of disciplines it draws upon and contributes to including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. We promote the exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing not only among researchers but also engineers and practitioners to encourage dialogue across disciplines and communities of practice. 
 HCOMP 2024 is colocated withACM UIST 2024(October 13-16, 2024). 
 HCOMP 2024 builds on a successful history ofpast meetings: eleven HCOMP conferences (2013–2023) and four earlier workshops, held at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2011–2012), and the ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (2009–2010).

 HCOMP is aimed at promoting the scientific exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing among researchers, engineers, and practitioners across a spectrum of disciplines. The conference was created by researchers from diverse fields to serve as a key focal point and scholarly venue for the review and presentation of the highest quality work on principles, studies, and applications of human computation. The meeting seeks and embraces work on human computation and crowdsourcing in multiple fields, including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence, economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. The conference promotes the exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing not only among researchers, but also engineers and practitioners, to encourage dialogue across disciplines and communities of practice.

 HCOMP is aimed at promoting the scientific exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing among researchers, engineers, and practitioners across a spectrum of disciplines. The conference was created by researchers from diverse fields to serve as a key focal point and scholarly venue for the review and presentation of the highest quality work on principles, studies, and applications of human computation. The meeting seeks and embraces work on human computation and crowdsourcing in multiple fields, including human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, social computing, artificial intelligence, economics, computational social science, digital humanities, policy, and ethics. The conference promotes the exchange of advances in human computation and crowdsourcing not only among researchers, but also engineers and practitioners, to encourage dialogue across disciplines and communities of practice. 
 The 9th AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2021) was held virtually from November 14-18, 2021. The conference is sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

 The 7th volume of the AAAI Conference on Human Computation and Crowdsourcing (HCOMP 2019) contains the papers presented at Skamania Lodge in Washington State near the Columbia Gorge River, USA from October 28-30, 2019. The conference is sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). 
 While artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) represent traditional mainstays of the conference, HCOMP believes strongly in publishing broad, interdisciplinary research. The field is particularly unique in the diversity of disciplines it draws upon and contributes to, ranging from human-centered qualitative studies and HCI design, to computer science and artificial intelligence, to economics and the social sciences, all the way to digital humanities, policy, and ethics. 
 In this volume, the papers emphasize work that generates new insights into the human computation side of HCOMP, such as new understandings about human cognition, human-in-the-loop intelligence systems, human-AI interaction and collaboration, algorithmic and interface techniques for augmenting human abilities to perform tasks, and other issues that affect how humans collaborate with AI systems (such as bias, fairness and interpretability).
