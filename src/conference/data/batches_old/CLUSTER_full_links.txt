 IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing 
 Introduction 
 IEEE Computer Society Task Force on Cluster Computing (TFCC), formed in early 1999, is committed to the promotion of all aspects of cluster computing including research, technological development and education. In order to achieve this, we have launched several activities including promoting an open community discussion, holding events that bring leading experts together, the instigation of a popular book donation program and the provision of advise to commercial bodies. In mid 2004, TFCC and TCSA (Technical Committee on Supercomputing Applications) have merged to form a newTechnical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC), which will continue to promote Cluster Computing activities. 
 Mission and Scope 
 The TFCC annual conference series (part of TCSC from 2005) serves as a major international forum for presenting and sharing recent accomplishments and technological developments in the field of cluster computing as well as the use of cluster systems for scientific and commercial applications. It involves participants (researchers, developers, and users) from academia, industry, laboratories, and commerce, coming together to discuss recent advances and trends in, but not limited to: 
 system modeling and architecture 
 hardware systems and networks 
 single system image 
 system software and tools 
 programming models, environments, and languages 
 algorithms and applications 
 performance modeling and evaluation 
 resource management and scheduling 
 high availability 
 system management and administration
