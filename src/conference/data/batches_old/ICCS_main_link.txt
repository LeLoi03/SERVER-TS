 “Making Complex Systems tractable through Computational Science” 
 TheInternational Conference on Computational Scienceis an annual conference that brings together researchers and scientists from mathematics and computer science as basic computing disciplines, as well as from other various application areas, who are pioneering computational methods in sciences such as physics, chemistry, life sciences, and engineering, as well as in arts and humanitarian fields, to discuss problems and solutions in the area, identify new issues, and shape future directions for research. 
 ICCS 2025 in Singapore, will be the twenty-fifth edition in this series of highly successful conferences. 
 Since its inception in 2001, ICCS has attracted increasingly higher quality and numbers of attendees and papers. The average attendance each year is about 350 participants. The proceedings series have become a major intellectual resource for computational science researchers and serve to define and advance the state of the art of the field. An archive of the previous meetings is available through thehref="previous-iccs/" - Previous ICCS conferences page
. 
 Out of the submitted full papers to the main conference and workshops, we will select some 30% high-quality papers for presentation at the conference and publication in the proceedings. These are published by Springer in theLecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) seriesand indexed by Scopus, EI Engineering Index, Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in ISI Web of Science), and severalother indexing services. The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers. 
 As the conference theme this year is“Making Complex Systems tractable through Computational Science”, papers highlighting the role of Computational Science in tackling the complex problems of today and tomorrow are particularly welcome. 
 This conference will be a unique event focusing on recent developments in: scalable scientific algorithms; advanced software tools; computational grids; advanced numerical methods; and novel application areas. These innovative novel models, algorithms and tools drive new science through efficient application in areas such as physical systems, computational and systems biology, environmental systems, finance, and others. 
 ICCS is co-organised with the Workshops on Computational Science, a set of thematic satellite events that focus on particular aspects of computational science. These workshops provide a way to explore novel areas of computational science and bring communities together around particular sub-topics of the field. For more information please see the call for workshops. 
 ICCS is committed to enhancing diversity and inclusion in the conference, without regard to race, age, religion, ethnicity, nationality, ability, gender identity, sexual orientation, or gender expression. 
 We look forward to welcoming you to ICCS 2025 in Singapore!

 ICCS is co-organised with the Workshops on Computational Science, a set of thematic satellite events that focus on particular aspects of computational science. You can submit your paper to either the Main Conference or any of the Workshops via the same EasyChair link. You can also choose to submit aFull/Short Paperor anAbstract. Please see the table above for the differences between each submission type.Do also note that: 
 1.ICCS and WCS (Workshops on Computational Science) papers will be published in separate proceedings, that is, there will be a LNCS publication for the Main Conference, and a different LNCS publication for the Workshops. But both ICCS and WCS will be published by LNCS, and indexed in the same way. 
 2.The only difference between Full and Short papers is the number of accepted pages. They are otherwise published and indexed in the exact same way. 
 While we encourage full paper submissions, the “Abstract Only” option caters to researchers who can only publish in specific journals or work for companies in circumstances such that they cannot publish at all, but still want to present their work and discuss it with their peers at ICCS. In the “Abstract Only” option, a short abstract is included in the conference program, but not in LNCS. 
 After the conference, the best papers will be invited for a special issue of theJournal of Computational Science(Impact Factor: 3.1) 
 Instructions for Authors 
 The manuscripts of up to15 pages, written inEnglishand formatted according to the Springer LNCS templates, should be submitted electronically viahref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccs2025" - EasyChair.
. 
 The most recent versions of theTemplatesare available for download fromthis link. 
 TheLaTeX2e Proceedings Templatesare also available in the scientific authoring platform Overleaf. 
 Please also make sure to follow Springer’shref="https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19242230/data/v12" - authors’ guidelines
, as well as Springer’shref="https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct" - Book Authors’ Code of Conduct
. 
 Papers must be based on unpublished original work and must be submitted to ICCS only. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper. 
 Do also note that ICCS lays crucial emphasis on the explicit relevance of submitted contributions to Computational Science. All submissions to the conference, whether to the main conference or to the workshops, will be evaluated for this relevance (through a mandatory field in the submission form). Papers that are more relevant to specialized conferences on very specific topics will be desk-rejected before the standard review process begins. 
 To promote open science and to facilitate reproducibility, ICCS encourages data and code sharing. Please keep this in mind when submitting your papers. 
 Deadlinesfor draft paper submission, notification of acceptance, camera-ready paper submission and registration may be found in thehref="../important-dates/" - Important Dates
section. 
 For the camera-ready version, please note that: 
 ICCS authors interested in | href="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/open-access-publishing-in-computer-proceedings" - open access for their papers (open choice) | have the possibility to do so. When you submit your camera-ready paper, if you intend to make it open access, | href="mailto:iccs@computationalscience.nl" - contact us | and we will tell you how to proceed. 
 Springer encourages authors to include their | href="https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid?wt_mc=Other.Other.1.AUT642.ORCID+proceedings+pilot+2017&utm_medium=other&utm_source=other&utm_content=8232017&utm_campaign=1_barz01_orcid+proceedings+pilot+2017" - ORCIDs | in their papers. 
 Springer is now offering the inclusion of | embedded videos | in proceedings papers.
