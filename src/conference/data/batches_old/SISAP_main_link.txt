18th International Conference on 
 Similarity Search and Applications, SISAP 2025 
 The International Conference on Similarity Search and Applications (SISAP) is an annual forum for researchers and application developers in the area of similarity data management. It aims at the technological problems shared by numerous application domains, such as data mining, information retrieval, multimedia retrieval, computer vision, pattern recognition, computational biology, geography biometrics, machine learning, and many others that need similarity searching as a necessary supporting service. Please see thehref="./callforpapers.html" - call for papers
for more details. 
 SISAP 2025 also features adoctoral symposium. If you are a PhD student, please consider submitting a paper about your project. 
 The SISAP initiative (href="https://www.sisap.org/" - www.sisap.org
) is a forum to exchange real-world, challenging and innovative examples of applications, new indexing techniques, common test-beds and benchmarks, source code and up-to-date literature through its web page, serving the similarity search community. Traditionally, SISAP puts emphasis on the distance-based searching, but in general the conference concerns both the effectiveness and efficiency aspects of any similarity search problem. 
 SISAP is recognized as aCORE Bconference. The series started in 2008 as a workshop and has developed over the years into an international conference withSpringer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)proceedings. You can find links to past SISAP proceedings onhref="https://link.springer.com/conference/sisap" - SpringerLink
. 
 A small selection of the best papers presented at the conference will be recommended for inclusion in a special issue ofElsevierInformation Systems. These extended versions will be subject to a second round of peer review at the journal. 
 There will be aBest Paper Award. The best papers will be recognized with a certificate and a monetary prize, thanks toSpringer's sponsorship. 
 SISAP 2025 will take place atReykjavik University (RU) Reykjavik, Iceland.More details will be published soon on this webpage.

 Scope 
 The 18thInternational Conference on Similarity Search and Applications (SISAP) is an annual forum for researchers and application developers in the area of similarity data management. It aims at the technological problems shared by numerous application domains, such as data mining, information retrieval, multimedia retrieval, computer vision, pattern recognition, computational biology, geography, biometrics, machine learning, and many others that make use of similarity search as a necessary supporting service. From its roots in metric indexing, SISAP has expanded to become the only international conference entirely devoted to all issues surrounding the theory, design, analysis, practice, and application of content-based and feature-based similarity search. Since 2021, SISAP has been aCORE Rank Bconference. 
 The conference proceedings will be published by Springer as a volume in theSpringer Lecture Notes in Computer Science(LNCS) series.Important Additional Scholarly Activities at SISAP

 Fifth Doctoral Symposium on Similarity Search and Applications 
 Regular and Special Session Papers 
 The organisers of SISAP 2025 call for novel and original research papers that address the various topics of interest related to the conference. We encourage contributions both to theoretical aspects and applications. 
 Full papers (from 9 to 14 pages) are expected to be descriptions of complete technical work, whereas short papers (of up to 8 pages) can describe innovative approaches or preliminary results which may nevertheless require more work to mature. Vision papers and other position papers should be submitted as short research papers. 
 Special session papers will supplement the regular research papers and be included in the proceedings of SISAP 2025, which will be published by Springer. 
 Regular and special session research papers will be peer-reviewed in adouble-blindreview process. Thus, the submissions must be properly anonymized. 
 A small selection of the best papers presented at the conference will be recommended for inclusion in a special issue ofElsevierInformation Systems. These extended versions will be subject to a second round of peer review at the journal. 
 TheBest Paperwill be recognized with a certificate and a monetary prize, thanks to Springer's sponsorship. 
 Special Sessions 
 Special sessions are mini-venues, each focusing on one state-of-the-art research direction within the field of similarity search and applications. For SISAP 2025, we call for contributions for the following two special sessions: 
 href="call4specialsessionpapers.html#irmc" - IRMC: Interactive Retrieval for Multimedia Collections | (organized by Omar Shahbaz Khan, Rahel Arnold, Fabio Carrara, Ujjwal Sharma) 
 href="call4specialsessionpapers.html#bridges" - BRIDGES: Bridging Past and Present: Similarity Search for Digital Cultural Heritage and GLAM Content | (organized by Rahel Arnold, Dominik BÃ¶nisch, Fabrizio Falchi,Peter Fornaro, Luca Rossetto, Heiko Schuldt) 
 Demonstration Papers 
 SISAP 2025 invites novel, impactful demonstrations aligned with its topics of interest. Submissions (up to 8 pages, including references) must include a mandatory 1-page PDF appendix describing how the demo will be conducted on-site.Demonstrations will be evaluated on novelty, technical challenges, and on-site impact in a single-blind review process. 
 Please see thehref="./demonstrations.html" - call for Demonstrations
for more details. 
 Doctoral Symposium Papers 
 SISAP 2025 Doctoral Symposium provides a forum for PhD students to present their research ideas and receive feedback from senior members of the research community. The Symposium fosters a collaborative environment, encouraging constructive discussions and sharing of ideas. 
 The doctoral symposium papers will be peer-reviewed in a single-blind review process.
