 Hard Topic Theme:Automated Detection and Patching of Software Vulnerabilities 
 This year's hard topic theme solicits research results and technologies that advance our ability to automatically identify and fix software security vulnerabilities. Security vulnerabilities exist in any domain that relies on software, including the Internet of Things, the Web, and cyber-physical systems. Automatically identifying issues in real-world codebases is becoming increasingly challenging, given the complexity of advanced vulnerabilities and the size of commonly used code.

 Call for Submissions 
 ACSAC is an internationally recognized forum where practitioners, researchers, and developers in information system security meet to learn and to exchange practical ideas and experiences. If you are developing practical solutions to problems related to the protection of users, commercial enterprises, or countries' information infrastructures, consider submitting your work to the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference. 
 We solicit submissions that address the application of security technology, the implementation of systems, and the discussion of lessons learned. While we are interested in a variety ofhref="topics/" - topics
, we especially encourage submissions in the area of ourHard Topic Theme,Automated Detection and Patching of Software Vulnerabilities. 
 Submission Types 
 href="papers/" - Technical Papers
We solicit papers offering novel contributions in any aspect of applied security. Papers are encouraged on results that have been demonstrated to be useful for improving information systems security and that address lessons learned from the actual application. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Please ensure that your submission is a PDF file of a maximum of 11 pages, excluding well-marked references and appendices limited to 5 pages. Committee members are not required to read the appendices. 
 Case Studies 
 The Case Studies in Applied Security Track is a critical part of the technical conference. It is an opportunity for professionals to share information that is current without writing a detailed technical paper, but enables attendees to learn about the next generation of products and solutions. It is open to anyone in the community such as vendors, network providers, systems integrators, government civil/federal/military programs or users across the spectrum of computer security applications. Potentially this is where attendees can learn about client needs and vendors solutions. While the Case Studies will not be included in the Proceedings, a Best Case Study Award will be presented to one of the talks, and all Case Studies presentations will be posted to the ACSAC site following the conference. 
 Panels 
 Panels should encourage audience participation and focus on the sharp edges of a topic where there is controversy or where there are widely varying positions. Panels focused on a topic related to the conference theme are especially welcomed, but this is not a hard requirement; some additional topics are listedhref="topics/" - here
. A typical panel proposal should list the moderator, three panel members and an abstract of the proposed topic. 
 Posters 
 The poster session provides an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present their new and innovative preliminary work in an informal, interactive setting. Conference attendees can learn about novel on-going research projects that might not yet be complete, but whose preliminary results are already interesting. Poster presenters will have an opportunity to discuss their work and get invaluable feedback from knowledgeable sources at an early stage of their research. 
 Works in Progress 
 The Works in Progress (WiP) session offers short presentations (5 minutes maximum) of ongoing work. These presentations highlight the most current work in both business and academia, emphasizing goals and value added, accomplishments to date, and future plans. Special consideration is given to topics that discuss real life security experience, including system implementation, deployment, and lessons learned. 
 Workshops 
 ACSAC workshops are on up to date topics that attendees usually rate to provide a useful and exciting forum for information technology professionals (e.g., standards developers, software developers, security engineers, security officers) to exchange ideas, concerns, and opinions. 
 Artifacts Competition 
 This competition invites the submission of applied cybersecurity artifacts that have been published in previous years in academic or industry venues. In particular, the competition aims to identify previously published applied security artifacts that have demonstrated meaningful impact for the security and privacy research communities. For instance, demonstrable impact may be represented by an artifact that has been reused in multiple subsequent publications by different research groups, that has received multiple "stars" and/or "forks" on platforms such as GitHub, or that has been successfully transitioned to a commercial technology. 
 Student Conferenceships 
 ACSAC offers conferenceships to enable students to attend the conference. This program will help pay for some of the cost to attend ACSAC. 
 General Submissions and Speaking Proposals 
 ACSAC does not accept "speaking proposals" per se, however; you are encouraged to submit suggestions in the form of a one paragraph description of a topic and a biography of the proposed presenter. Depending on a proposal's technical content, it may be acceptable as a case study. If a full paper is available, it may be acceptable as a technical paper. If a presentation by a group of related speakers is contemplated, a proposal for this session may be acceptable as a panel. If a proposal for a half day or full day seminar is appropriate, it may be acceptable as a professional development course. If a one or two page technical write-up is available that describes work that is not yet completed, it may be acceptable as a poster. Finally, if your have an interest in a full day interactive dialogue, exchanging ideas, opinions and concerns between multiple presenters and attendees, consider being a workshop presenter.

 ACSAC solicits papers offering novel contributions in any aspect of applied security research. We encourage papers with results that are demonstrably useful for improving cybersecurity and that address lessons learned from practical applications. In particular, we encourage the submission of papers related to our hard topic theme:Automated Detection and Patching of Software Vulnerabilities. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published elsewhere or that have been simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference with proceedings and are under review. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to present at the conference in person, with limited exceptions allowed on a case-by-case basis. 
 Reproduction and Replication (R+R) Papers:Security research is often criticized for the poor reproducibility of its results, a situation we aim to address through artifact evaluation. At the same time, reproduction and replication studies are often undervalued in academic publishing. Thus, in addition to regular papers and artifact evaluations, this year we are also soliciting studies that confirm, question, or clarify the results of previous research. These papers must contain the prefix “R+R:” in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form. 
 We encourage submissions to follow the ACM guidelines onreproducibility(different team, same experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-use) andreplicability(different team, different experimental setup, i.e., artifact re-implementation). Note, however, that submissions need to go beyond re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper(s) or re-implementing their approach. We are looking for submissions that not only replicate existing studies but also critically assess, clarify and extend their findings and limitations. This includes, but is not limited to, the verification of existing research results, ensuring their validity and reliability across different contexts, lessons learned when applying research results in real-world (industry) settings, and the adaption of artifacts to contemporary cybersecurity challenges. 
 Reproduction and replication papers will be held to the same scientific standards as original technical papers, will be reviewed by the full program committee, will appear in the proceedings, and will be presented at the conference as part of the technical program. We also particularly encourage these types of papers to provide their artifacts. 
 Review Process:Paper submissions will be judged based on novelty, relevance to the conference topics, technical correctness, quality of the evaluation, and presentation clarity. Papers will undergo a double-blind review process in two rounds. At the end of Round 1, papers for which a strong consensus towards rejection is reached will be notified of the early rejection decision, giving them the opportunity to improve their paper based on the reviewers’ feedback and to resubmit to other venues. Papers that advance to Round 2 will be assigned additional reviewers. At the end of Round 2, the authors of papers that advanced to this stage will have an opportunity to respond to the reviewers’ questions and comments. After the authors' response period, the papers will be further discussed by the Program Committee (PC) to reach a final decision. 
 Three outcomes are possible: Accepted, Minor Revision, and Rejected. The Minor Revision decision is reserved to papers that can be considered as conditionally accepted, assuming improvements required by the reviewers are made within the available revision time window and are approved by the PC. A PC member will be assigned as shepherd for Minor Revision papers, to guide the authors through the revision process and to lead the discussion on the revised paper among the reviewers. The revision requirements may include both presentation improvements and additional experiments that the PC believes are necessary to significantly improve the paper and that should be feasible within a limited time frame. While Minor Revision papers that do not meet the required changes may be rejected, the expectation is that most papers will be able to satisfy the required improvements and be finally accepted into the conference program. Both the author's responses and the discussions around revision requirements for Minor Revision papers will be handled anonymously, via the paper submission system. 
 Paper Artifacts:Authors of accepted papers are expected to submit their software and data artifacts for formal evaluation by theArtifacts Evaluation Committeeand to make them publicly available to the entire community. During submission, authors of papers whose main contributions and experimental results rely primarily on new or reproduced artifacts (e.g., code and/or data) are expected to indicate whether they will separately submit their artifacts for evaluation, if their paper is accepted, and should acknowledge this intention by ticking the related box on the submission platform. This acknowledgement will be visible to the reviewers and may therefore be taken into consideration during the review process. Authors who have justifiable reasons to not submit their artifacts for evaluation (in case their paper is accepted) should add a comment in the corresponding comment box in the submission form. Additionally, during paper submission authors can optionally provide a URL pointing to a repository containing their paper artifacts. While artifacts will be formally evaluated only if the paper is accepted, as explained above, reviewers may also take into account the availability and quality of the paper artifacts during the main paper review process, before making a final decision (please refer to the paper submission form for additional details). 
 Important:When preparing the artifacts repository for inclusion in the paper submission form, please take extra care to not include authors’ information in the repository or artifacts content, so as not to break the anonymity of the paper submission. Additional information and recommendations on anonymizing the artifacts repository can be foundhere. 
 Ethical Considerations:Papers that might raise ethical concerns (e.g., papers that use human subjects, leverage potentially sensitive data, or describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems) must include an Ethical Considerations section that properly describes what procedures have been followed to minimize potential harm. Such papers should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties, whether an institutional ethics committee reviewed the research, or how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software/system vendors or owners before publication. 
 Paper Format:Please ensure that your submission consists of a PDF file of no more than 11 double-column pages, excluding well-marked references and appendices limited to a maximum of 5 pages. The full PDF document must not exceed a total of 16 pages. Please note that PC members are not required to read the appendices and that page limits will be strictly enforced. 
 Papers must be appropriately anonymized to the dual anonymous review process. Author names and affiliations must not be included in the PDF submission. Authors can cite and refer to their own prior work, but must do so in the third person, as if it was written by someone else. In the rare case that citing previous work in the third person is not possible, please anonymize the reference and notify the Program Chairs. 
 Submissions must be generated using the double-column IEEE format (see template available athttps://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). LaTeX submissions must use the IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b template with the \documentclass[conference,compsoc]{IEEEtran} documentclass option. Papers should be formatted for US letter (not A4). All papers must be submitted exclusively through the ACSAC 2024 paper submission system. Note that paper title and abstract registration is not necessary ahead of the paper submission. 
 All formatting guidelines and constraints (e.g., page limits and anonymity) will be strictly enforced. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. The Program Chairs will also desk reject papers that do not include enough content (e.g., are too short) or do not match the conference’s topics of interest below.

 Conflicts of Interest 
 Authors are required to specify their conflicts of interest with Program Committee (PC) members when submitting a paper. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the following definition. A paper author has a conflict of interest with a PC member when and only when one or more of the following conditions holds: 
 The PC member is an author of the paper. 
 The PC member has been working at the same institution or company as one of the paper authors in the past two years. 
 The PC member has been a collaborator of one of the paper authors in the past two years. Collaborations include being Co-PI on grants (either funded or pending) and being a coauthor on one of the paper author’s publications (either published or unpublished). Any ongoing collaboration, even if it has not produced a publication or a grant submission yet, counts as a conflict under this policy.The PC member is or was one of the paper author’s primary thesis advisors, no matter how long ago. 
 One of the paper’s authors is or was the PC member’s primary thesis advisor, no matter how long ago. 
 The PC member is a relative or close personal friend of one of the paper’s authors. 
 For any other situation where the authors feel they have a conflict with a PC member, they must explain the nature of the conflict to the PC chairs, who will mark the conflict if appropriate. The program chairs will review declared conflicts. Papers with incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection. 
 Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion 
 ACSAC adheres to the IEEE’s Computer Society Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion guidelines. Authors are encouraged to consider DEI issues as they prepare their submissions (e.g., keep in mind thatWords Matter). For any suggestions, concerns, or complaints regarding DEI-related biases or harassment, we encourage you to reach out to the Conference Chairs. All communications regarding DEI will be treated as confidential. 
 What makes a good ACSAC paper? 
 We've gone through the papers submitted in recent years, and have collected a set ofhref="what_makes_a_good_paper.php" - characteristics of good ACSAC papers
. These should be read by anyone considering submitting a paper.
