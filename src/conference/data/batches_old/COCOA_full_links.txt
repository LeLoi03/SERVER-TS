 Present CFP : 2024 
 The 17th Annual International Conference on Combinatorial Optimization and Applications (COCOA 2024) will be held during December 6-8, 2024 in Beijing, China. Original research papers in the areas of combinatorial optimization and its applications are solicited. In addition to theoretical results, we are particularly interested in submissions that report on experimental and applied research of general algorithmic interest. Special consideration will be given to research that is motivated by real-world problems. Experimental and applied papers are expected to show convincingly the usefulness and efficiency of the algorithms discussed in a practical setting. 
  
 The topics include, but are not limited to: 
 Algorithms and Data Structures 
 Approximation Algorithms 
 Operation Research 
 Communication Network Optimization 
 Energy Efficient Wireless Sensor Networks 
 Optimal Resource Management 
 Social Networks 
 Complex Network Optimization 
 Computational Algebra 
 Computational Geometry 
 Computational Biology 
 Computational Financing 
 Computational Game Theory 
 Computational Learning Theory 
 Computational Number Theory 
 Bioinformatics 
 Graph Theory 
 Graph Search 
 Distributed Computational Systems 
 Urban Transportation Networks 
 Mobile Ad Hoc Networks

 Important Date 
 Submission Due Date: August 15, 2024 23:59 AoE 
 Notification of Decision: September 20, 2024 23:59 AoE 
 Final Version Submission: October 10, 2024 23:59 AoE 
 Author Registration Due: October 10, 2024 23:59 AoE 
  
 The submission should contain scholarly exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including the motivation and a clear comparison with related work. The length of the submission should not exceed 12 pages in LNCS style (including references, but excluding the optional appendix). Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are available in Overleaf. Please make sure to hide all author-related information, we will conduct double-blind review process. 
  
 Submitted papers must describe work not previously published. They must not be submitted simultaneously to any other conference with refereed proceedings or to journals. We regard the following case as a simultaneous submission. Submission of drafts which contain the essentially same results from papers under review in other conferences or journals at the moment of the submission. Only electronic PDF submission will be allowed via the Springer Online Conference System. Please submit your paper at https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/cocoa2024. For the complete author guideline, please access Springer's official Springer_Instructions_for_Authors_of_Proceedings_CS.pdf Submissions that deviate significantly from these guidelines may be rejected without consideration of their merit.. 
  
 The conference proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. After the conference, selected papers will be published in special issues of journals: Journal of Combinatorial Optimization and Theoretical Computer Science.
