The International Conference on Model-Based Software and Systems Engineering provides a platform for participants from all over the world to present research results and application experience in using model-based techniques for developing all sorts of systems. Model-based software engineering has emerged over many years as an approach for developing IT systems in which models take a central role, not only for the analysis of these systems but also for their construction. More recently, a similar approach has become increasingly widely used not only for software systems, but also for physical, cyber-physical and business systems. This model-based software and systems engineering approach relies on an increasingly rich ecosystem of techniques, languages and tools. MODELSWARD is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners alike to come together and discuss, moving this ecosystem forward.

 13th International Conference on Model-Based Software and Systems Engineering (MODELSWARD 2025) 
 Date: Feb 26, 2025 6:00 am – Feb 28, 2025 4:00 pm 
 Location: Porto, Portugal 
 URL:href="https://modelsward.scitevents.org" - https://modelsward.scitevents.org
The International Conference on Model-Based Software and Systems Engineering provides a platform for participants from all over the world to present research results and application experience in using model-based techniques for developing all sorts of systems. Model-based software engineering has emerged over many years as an approach for developing IT systems in which models take a central role, not only for the analysis of these systems but also for their construction. More recently, a similar approach has become increasingly widely used not only for software systems, but also for physical, cyber-physical and business systems. This model-based software and systems engineering approach relies on an increasingly rich ecosystem of techniques, languages and tools. MODELSWARD is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners alike to come together and discuss, moving this ecosystem forward. 
  
 This conference aims at fostering the further development and application of model-based techniques for the construction and analysis of software and systems. Papers reporting on original work in any of the areas listed below are welcome. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors will be published in the MODELSWARD proceedings. The submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three experts in this area, and acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. The conference is open to full research and (short) work-in-progress papers. Sessions are planned for both oral and poster presentations. 
 CONFERENCE AREAS 
 Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas: 
 1. METHODOLOGIES, PROCESSES AND PLATFORMS 
 2. APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT
