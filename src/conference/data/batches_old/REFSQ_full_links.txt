 Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ) 2025 
 Welcome to the website of theRequirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ) 2025conference. 
 The31st International Working Conference on Requirement Engineering: Foundation for Software Qualitywill take place from the 7th to 10th of April 2025 in Barcelona, Catalunya, Spain (live, in-person). 
 Special Theme: Social REsponsibility 
 The technological progress, the increasing digitalization and emerging trends offer great potential to positively support and facilitate our everyday life. Due to this tremendous influence that technology nowadays has on our society, it is (increasingly) important to carefully consider the impact that digital solutions have on our society during development activities. 
 RE is a socio-technical discipline that aims to understand and analyze the needs of stakeholders affected by the introduction of digital solutions and to communicate these needs to the development team. This mediator role enables our community to have a major impact on the goals, capabilities, functionalities and qualities of digital solutions and thus take RESPONSIBILITY for the social impact that these solutions bring. 
 With this special theme we aim to raise awareness for this“Social REsponsibility”, to share challenges / ideas / project experience and to foster discussions around the following questions: 
 How can our RE community contribute to the “social good”? 
 How to support “Responsible Design” through requirements engineering? 
 How to actively involve the society (respectively large / heterogeneous stakeholder groups) into RE activities (e.g., co-creation / co-design)? 
 How to systematically derive, engineer and evaluate social values and impact? 
 How to align social needs and “intelligent” systems evolution? 
 About REFSQ 
 The REFSQ working conference is the leading European conference series on requirements engineering. It is the goal of REFSQ to foster the creation of a strong European RE community across industry and academia. Since 1994, Requirements Engineering continued to be a dominant factor influencing the quality of software, systems and services. REFSQ seeks contributions which report on novel ideas and techniques that enhance the quality of RE’s products and processes, as well as reflections on current research. Interaction is a traditional and distinctive feature of REFSQ with the aim of promoting an active and fruitful discussion among the participants. In addition to the high-quality scientific program, REFSQ also features a highly interactive Industry Track, Workshops, Posters and Tool demos, and a Doctoral Symposium.

 Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ) 
 The REFSQ working conference is the leading European conference series on requirements engineering. It is the goal of REFSQ to foster the creation of a strong European RE community across industry and academia. Since 1994, Requirements Engineering continued to be a dominant factor influencing the quality of software, systems and services. REFSQ seeks contributions which report on novel ideas and techniques that enhance the quality of RE’s products and processes, as well as reflections on current research. REFSQ has a long tradition of being a highly structured and interactive forum.
