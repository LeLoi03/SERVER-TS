Intelligence and security informatics (ISI) is an interdisciplinary field involving academic researchers in information technology, social and behavioral sciences, computer science, law, and public policy, as well as industry consultants, practitioners, security managers, and chief information security officers who support physical and cyber security missions at the individual, organizational, national, and international levels. Over the past two decades, the IEEE ISI Conference has evolved from its traditional orientation towards the intelligence and security domain to a more integrated alignment of multiple domains, including technology, humans, organizations, and security, aiming to advance our understanding of the interrelationships between these different components, and by integrating recent advances from different domains. 
 The ISI 2025 conference invites academic researchers in the field of ISI and related areas, as well as IT, security, and analytics professionals, and industry consultants and practitioners in the field, to submit papers and workshop proposals. Research relevant toartificial intelligence security,LLM security, and human behavior in security contexts is strongly encouraged.All accepted papers will be included in the proceedings at IEEE Xplore.
