 The Seventeenth International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS 2024) from June 6-8, 2024 in Kananaskis, Alberta, Canada. The symposium co-chairs were Ariel Felner and Jiaoyang Li. 
 The International Symposium on Combinatorial Search is meant to bring researchers in such areas together to exchange ideas and cross-fertilize the field. SoCS serves researchers and submissions in all fields that use combinatorial search, including artificial intelligence, planning, robotics, constraint programming, meta-reasoning, operations research, navigation, and bioinformatics. Papers exploring the boundaries between combinatorial search and planning & scheduling research are particularly welcome, given the co-location with the 2024 International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS 2024). The papers included in this issue have been organized into three categories — technical papers, position papers, and extended abstracts.

International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS)Welcome! 
 Heuristic search and combinatorial optimizationare currently very active areas of research. For example, researchers investigate how to search in real-time, how to search with limited (possibly external) memory, how to solve sequences of similar search problems faster than with isolated searches, how to improve the runtime of the searches over time, how to trade-off between the runtime and memory consumption of the search and the resulting solution quality, and how to focus the searches with sophisticated heuristics such as pattern databases. Their results are published in different conferences such as IJCAI, AAAI, ICAPS, NIPS, ICRA, and IROS. 
 The International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS) is meant to bring these researchers together to exchange their ideas and cross-fertilize the field. Thus, in addition to seeking separate answers to questions like how to design more accurate memory-based heuristics, more I/O-efficient disk-based search algorithms, or more efficient clause-learning strategies, the symposium is intended to stimulate thoughts on combining various techniques that originated in different areas of search. 
 Thehref="http://socs25.search-conference.org" - Eighteenth International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS 2025)
will be held from 11 to 15 August in Glasgow, Scotland. SoCS 2025 is co-located withhref="https://cp2025.a4cp.org/" - CP 2025

 The Eleven Annual Symposium on Combinatorial was held Stockholmsmässan (Stockholm International Fairs) in Stockholm, Sweden, from July 14–15, 2018. The symposium cochairs were Vadim Bulitko and Sabine Storandt. The proceedings were published by AAAI Press. 
 The objective of SoCS is to network researchers working in the area of combinatorial search. This area is important to several research communities, including artificial intelligence in general and auto- mated planning, operations research, and robotics in particular. SoCS is thus a meeting attended by ex- perts of different subfields, providing an excellent opportunity to foster collaboration, and to boost cross-fertilization among these subfields. This year, SoCS was part of the Federated AI Meeting (FAIM) which also included the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence and the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-ECAI), the International Conference on Au- tonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS), the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) and the International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning (ICCBR). SoCS sessions running in parallel with workshops and tutorials of other conferences as well as joint coffee breaks allowed the attendees to exchange ideas. 
 The program committee accepted 25 of the 46 full paper submissions (54.3 percent acceptance rate) and both extended abstracts.

To bring in new ideas, every year SoCS features a special scope on a related research area. Previous SoCS events have provided a special focus on automated planning (2010), search in robotics (2011), grid-based path planning (2012), and algorithm engineering (2013). In 2014, SoCS specifically invited submissions from researchers in the big data community and related areas that work on large search problems. This special scope on big data has not been a clear success, but attracted a smaller number of stronger submissions outside the traditional AI search communities. SoCS 2014 was held in cooperation with AAAI and collocated with the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI 2014)

 Heuristic search and other forms of combinatorial search optimizations are currently very active areas of research in artificial intelligence, robotics, planning, and other areas of computer science. The International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS) is meant to bring researchers in such areas together to exchange ideas and cross traditional academic boundaries. SoCS-2010 is the third event in this series. A special scope this year is on the relationship between search in domain-independent planning and domain-specific search. For SoCS-2010 we also invited participation from the algorithmics community to share their recent successes in path planning in road networks. 
 This was an important year for SoCS as archival proceedings were established for the first time. These proceedings are the result of hard work by many, from researchers to reviewers and the publisher. 
 This volume contains all of the papers from the symposium held 8–10 July, 2010 at Stone Mountain near Atlanta, Georgia USA. The program includes 17 oral paper presentations, 6 poster papers, 2 position papers, and and 7 short summaries of papers presented at other conferences.
