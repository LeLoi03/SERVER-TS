 IEEE WCCI 2024 
 The IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence 
 Thank you for attending IEEE WCCI 2024 in Yokohama, Japan! We hope to see you at IEEE WCCI 2026! 

IEEE WCCI 2024 is the world’s largest technical event on computational intelligence, featuring the three flagship conferences of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS) under one roof: The International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN), the IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE) and the IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE CEC). 
 ALL AUTHOR VIDEO LINKS HAVE BEEN SENT VIA EMAIL. IF YOU HAVE NOT RECEIVED THEM PLEASE LET US KNOW. 
 IEEE WCCI 2024 will be held in Yokohama, Japan. Yokohama is a city that inspires academic fusion and multidisciplinary & industrial association. The Yokohama area boasts a number of universities, institutes and companies of advanced information technology, electronics, robotics, mobility, medicine and foods. 
 IEEE WCCI 2024 held in this area will strongly inspire the attendees to imagine next-generation science and technology as the fusion of AI, physiology and psychology as well as a cooperation with intelligence-related industries. 
 IJCNN 2024The International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) covers a wide range of topics in the field of neural networks, from biological neural networks to artificial neural computation. 
 IEEE CEC 2024The IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (IEEE CEC) covers all topics in evolutionary computation from theory to real-world applications. 
 FUZZ-IEEE 2024The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE) covers all topics in fuzzy systems from theory to real-world applications.

 IEEE WCCI 2024 will be primarily an in-person conference. However, the organization acknowledges that for a wide variety of reasons not all members can physically attend the conference and that traveling may simply be impossible. Therefore, the conference will provide the possibility for remote presentation (live online talk with live online Q&A) for remote authors. At least one remote author must register for the conference (regular registration, as IEEE Member or Non-Member). 
 In addition to delivering the live online talk, remote authors are also asked to provide a recording their talk, which will be made available to all attendees to be viewed at their own convenience. The recorded talk will also be used as a backup just in case there are Internet connection problems during the live online talk. Remote attendees can attend only online sessions whereas on-site attendees can attend all sessions (i.e., both online and on-site sessions).
