 EASE 2025 
 Welcome to the website of the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025 edition. 
 EASE is an internationally leading venue for academics and practitioners to present and discuss their research on evidence-based software engineering, and its implications for software practice. EASE is ranked as A conference in CORE. The 29th edition of EASE will take place in Istanbul, Turkey. 
 EASE 2025 welcomes high-quality submissions, describing original and unpublished research for the following tracks: full research papers, short papers & emerging results, industry, posters & vision, journal-first, and a doctoral symposium. There will also be co-located events, including workshops and tutorials, and a track planned for journal-first presentations. Please see the “Tracks” menu above for more detailed information on each track.

 Call for Papers 
 The International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE) is one of the premier conferences for research related to empirical software engineering. The EASE research track seeks high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results. 
 href="#topics" - Topics
EASE welcomes papers addressing topics related to evaluating and assessing software products, processes, practices, tools & techniques, including: 
 Meta-science (e.g., papers about research methods and methodological issues, whether empirical or conceptual) 
 Infrastructure and techniques for conducting empirical studies on software engineering 
 Theory development, operationalization, testing, and application 
 Applications of evaluation and assessment in specific contexts, such as: | Software Requirements 
 Software Architecture 
 Data-Driven Software Engineering 
 Global Software Engineering 
 Software Design 
 Software Construction 
 Software Testing 
 Software Operations 
 DevOps and Continuous Delivery 
 Software Maintenance 
 Software Configuration Management 
 Software Engineering Management 
 Software Engineering Models and Methods 
 Software Engineering Process (e.g., agile, hybrid) 
 Software Quality 
 AI-Based Software Development 
 Human factors and behavioral aspects of Software Engineering 
 Software development practices and process improvement 
 Sustainability in Software Engineering 
 Inter- or multi-disciplinary studies intersecting software engineering 
 Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering 
 Ethics in Software Engineering 
 EASE also welcomes studies with negative findings or non-significant results. 
 How to Submit 
 All papers must be submitted in PDF format through the web-based submission systemhref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ease2025" - EasyChair for EASE 2025
. Submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, including all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Up to two additional pages containing ONLY references are permitted. 
 All submissions should use the officialACM Primary Article Template. Deviating from the ACM formatting instructions may lead to a desk rejection. LaTeX users should use the following options: 
 \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} \acmConference[EASE 2025]{The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering}{17–20 June, 2025}{Istanbul, Türkiye}Authors must comply with the SIGSOFT Open Science PolicySIGSOFT Open Science Policies. 
 EASE 2025 will employ a double-anonymous review process. Do not include author names or affiliations in submissions. All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. Any online supplements, replication packages, etc., referred to in the work should also be anonymized. Advice for sharing supplements anonymously can be foundhere. 
 By submitting to EASE, authors agree to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and FalsificationACM Policy on Plagiarism, etc.. If the research involves human participants/subjects, the authors must adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjectshref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" - ACM Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects
. 
 Review Criteria 
 The reviewers will be encouraged to do a standards-based review. To see the criteria for standards-based reviews, please use this tool:href="https://acmsigsoft.github.io/EmpiricalStandards/form_generator/Checklist.html?role=author" - Empirical Standards Checklist
. 
 The reviews will evaluate submissions additionally against the following criteria: 
 Soundness: | The extent to which the paper’s contributions and innovations address its research questions and are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods 
 Significance: | The extent to which the paper’s contributions can impact the field of software engineering and under which assumptions (if any) 
 Novelty: | The extent to which the contributions are sufficiently original with respect to the state-of-the-art 
 Verifiability and Transparency: | The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to understand how an innovation works, how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, and how the paper supports independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions. 
 Presentation: | The extent to which the paper’s quality of writing meets the high standards of EASE, including clear descriptions, adequate use of the English language, absence of significant ambiguity, clearly readable figures and tables, and adherence to the formatting instructions provided above.
