 "These days, when generative AI is getting so much attention, it is even more important to understand what the field of semantics brings to the table. This conference is an excellent venue to do just that." 
 Frank van Harmelen 
 Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam 
 "The Semantics conference is really unique as an active meeting place not only between academics and industry but also between industry and industry. Semantics is the place to be if you want to find out what is happening with semantic technologies." 
 Ruben Verborgh 
 Professor of Decentralized Web Technology - Ghent University and University of Oxford 
 "SEMANTiCS is where theory meets practice. Lively conversations between industry and academia foster creativity and innovation."

 Motivation 
 The 18th International Conference on Metadata and Semantics Research (MTSR'24) will be held in Athens. 
 MTSR is an annual international inter-disciplinary conference, which brings together academics, researchers and practitioners in the specialized fields of metadata, ontologies and semantics research. The conference provides an opportunity for participants to share knowledge and novel approaches in the implementation of semantic technologies across diverse types of information environments and applications. These include Open Access Repositories and Digital Libraries, Cultural Informatics, Digital Humanities, E-learning applications, Search Engine Optimization and Information Retrieval, Research Information Systems and Infrastructures, e-Science and e-Social Science applications, Agriculture, Food and Environment, Bio-Health & Medical Information Systems. 
 Topics 
 Contributions are welcome on Metadata in general, Ontologies, Semantic Web, Linked Data, Automatic Metadata Generation, Open-Access Repositories, Digital Libraries, Knowledge Management, Software Engineering, Cultural Informatics, Digital Humanities, E-learning applications, Information Retrieval, e-Science and e-Social Science applications, Agriculture, Food and Environment, Bio-Health and Medical Information Systems, including but not limited to:

 href="/track/decentralized-apps-blockchains-p2p" - Decentralized Applications, Blockchains and P2P systems 
 Submission procedure 
 The following types of submissions are invited: 
 Full papers (12 pages, CCIS format) reporting completed research 
 Short papers (6 pages, CCIS format) presenting ongoing or preliminary research 
 Presentations and Posters (3-4 pages) 
 Proposals for Tutorials, Workshops, Demos and Panels (1-3 pages providing a description) 
 Submissions should be original and not previously submitted, published and under review to other Conferences or Journals. All submissions will be reviewed on the basis of relevance, originality, importance and clarityfollowing a double-blind peer review process. Submitted papers have to follow the LNCS proceedings formatting style and guidelines. Authors of accepted submissions will be asked to register to the Conference and present their work in the form of either oral presentation or poster presentation. 
 Interested authors can submit toEasyChair. 
 Conference Proceedings 
 Proceedings will be published by Springer in CCIS (Communications in Computer and Information Science) book series (http://www.springer.com/series/7899). CCIS is abstracted/indexed in Scopus, SCImago, EI-Compendex, Mathematical Reviews, DBLP, Google Scholar. CCIS volumes are also submitted for the inclusion in ISI Proceedings. 
 Other Publication Opportunities 
 Selected papers might be considered for a revised and extended version to be published in a range of international journals, including the International Journal of Metadata, Semantics and Ontologies (Inderscience) and Data Technologies and Applications (Emerald), previously published as (Program) and The Electronic Library (Emerald). 
 Awards 
 There are two types of awards: the Best paper award and the Best student paper award, both sponsored byeuroCRIS. 
 Best paper award: This award will be presented to the authors of the best full research paper submitted and presented to the conference. 
 Best student paper award: MTSR sponsors a paper competition to recognize excellence in a conference paper contribution whose primary author is a student (normally at a PhD or MRes level). The student is required to present the paper at the MTSR 2024 conference. Submissions are evaluated on their originality, scientific merits, structure, and clarity of composition. 
 The author of an awarded paper, and co-authors if any, will be entitled to:Receive a signed and stamped official award certificate by the conference organizers 
 Promote their achievement on MTSR conference webpage, and MTSR Social Media 
 Get invited to submit an extended and revised version of the awarded paper for publication in the | href="https://www.inderscience.com/jhome.php?jcode=ijmso" - International Journal of Metadata, Semantics and Ontologies | ( | Inderscience | ); 
 ○ Each award comes with the price of a free access/registration to next year’s MTSR. including all conference materials, together with the printed/digital conference proceedings 
 ○ This voucher, in case of many co-authors, is valid only for one author of the awarded paper, and only for the MTSR conference that follows the year after receiving the award.
