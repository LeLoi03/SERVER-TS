 href="#it-is-our-great-pleasure-to-announce-that-dr-juraj-somorovsky-js-upb-professor-at-paderborn-university-germany-will-give-a-keynote-at-iwct-2025-titled-lessons-learned-from-systematic-security-testing-of-tls" - It is our great pleasure to announce that Dr. Juraj Somorovsky [JS-UPB], Professor at Paderborn University (Germany), will give a keynote at IWCT 2025 titled “Lessons learned from systematic security testing of TLS”!
Abstract: Transport Layer Security (TLS) is one of the most important cryptographic protocols, securing a vast range of communications, including web traffic, email, chat, and VPNs. Given its widespread importance, TLS implementations have become prime targets for numerous famous attacks, such as CRIME, DROWN, Logjam, and various padding oracle exploits. These attacks have devastating impact and allow, for example, the leak of sensitive information such as cryptographic keys or confidential dog pictures. Identifying and assessing TLS attacks has thus become a critical focus for the security research community. 
 To detect TLS attacks automatically, we developed a flexible tool for TLS security evaluations called TLS-Attacker. In tour talk, we present our research on TLS vulnerabilities and demonstrate how we leveraged TLS-Attacker with various systematic analysis techniques, such as large-scale scanning, state learning, and fuzzing, to uncover weaknesses in TLS implementations. Finally, we show how combinatorial testing integrated into TLS-Attacker leveraged a practical TLS test suite called TLS-Anvil. With TLS-Anvil, we found new exploits, cryptographic problems, and interoperability issues. While the detected issues prove the usefulness of combinatorial testing for TLS, we also show that building such a test suite from the specification brings many challenges. 
 Juraj is IT-Security professor at the Paderborn University [JS-UPB] and his main research interests include system security, network security, and applied cryptography. He is also a co-founder ofHackmanit GmbH, a company that provides practical trainings and penetration tests in the areas of Web security, Single Sign-On, and applied cryptography. 
 At Paderborn University, Juraj leads the “System Security” group [SYSSEC] that focuses in both research and teaching on system security, network security, applied cryptography, and censorship. Their expertise has contributed to the discovery of critical security vulnerabilities such asDROWN,ROBOT,Efail,ALPACA, andRaccoon. The SYSSEC group systematically analyzes such vulnerabilities and develops test tools to identify and fix them, for example the very flexible and capable toolTLS-Attackerfor analysing TLS libraries.

 About IWCT 
 The14th International Workshop on Combinatorial Testing (IWCT 2025)is to be held in conjunction with ICST 2025, focusing on combinatorial methods in testing, which can target software, systems-of-systems or other domains. The workshop welcomes academic research submissions as well as industrial experience reports. We would like to highlight that this year, IWCT 2025 seeks to broaden its application domains of combinatorial methods used in general testing problems and therefore not only invites contributions from the software testing domain concerning - but not limited to - AI/ML-based, autonomous, concurrent or real-time systems, security of hard- and software, cloud computing and cloud architectures and software product lines, but also welcomes contributions on using combinatorial testing in other domains such as - including, but not limited to - biotechnology applications, mechanical engineering, manufacturing, quantum computing, finance and disaster management research. 
 Combinatorial Testing (CT), or Combinatorial Interaction Testing (CIT), is a widely applicable generic methodology and technology for software verification and validation, considered a testing best practice. In a combinatorial test plan, all interactions between parameters up to a certain level are covered. For example, in pairwise testing, for every pair of parameters, every pair of values will appear at least once. Studies show that CT is more efficient and effective than random testing of software. 
 CT has gained significant interest in recent years, both in research and in practice. However, many issues still remain unresolved, and much research is still needed in the field. For example, while pairwise testing is a well recognized and popular test planning method, investigations of actual failures in a number of software and systems convincingly show that pairwise testing is usually not sufficient, so higher strength CT (i.e., t-way for t > 2) may be needed. 
 In addition, the combinatorial test plans need to exclude invalid combinations of test values that cannot be executed, which limits the degrees of freedom the algorithms have, thus complicating the problem. Moreover, modeling languages and tools for easily capturing the input test space are also required for real-life applicability of CT. Other obstacles for wide acceptance of CT in industry are the gap between the generated test plans and executable tests, and the difficulty in determining expected results for the generated tests. Finally, empirical studies on CT, as well as thorough comparison with other methods, are also required. 
 In this workshop, we plan to bring together researchers actively working on combinatorial testing, and create a productive and creative environment for sharing and collaboration. IWCT being the primary venue dedicated to CT, yet there are many researchers working in the field, we expect, like in previous years, to see high responsiveness to take part in the workshop. Researchers attending the workshop will have an opportunity to publish their work in a dedicated venue, create new collaborations and take active part in the growing community of researchers working in the field. 
 The workshop will also be a meeting place between academia and industry, thus uniting academic excellence and industrial experience and needs. This will allow participants from academia to learn about the industrial experience in practical application of CT to real-life testing problems, and together with the colleagues from industry identify the difficulties that are obstacle to wider application of CT, and should be addressed in future research. Industrial participants will have an opportunity to meet the leading scientists in the field, and hear about the latest advances and innovations.

 Call for Papers 
 We invite submissions of high-quality papers presenting original work on both theoretical and practical aspects of applying combinatorial methods to testing problems, targeting software, systems-of-systems or other domains (including, but not limited to, biotechnology, mechanical engineering, manufacturing, quantum computing, finance and disaster research). 
 Each submission (in any category) must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). All papers will be reviewed by at least three members from the program committee. If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to attend the workshop in-person with an author registration and present the paper for it to be published in the ICST 2025 workshop proceedings. 
 Please direct any questions concerning submissions to IWCT 2025 to:href="mailto:iwct2025@sba-research.org" - iwct2025@sba-research.org
href="#submission" - Submission
EasyChair instance of ICST 2025, please select track ‘IWCT 2025’:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icst2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icst2025
href="#full-and-short-papers" - Full and short papers
We invite submissions for full papers (up to 10 pages, including references) as well as short papers (up to 4 pages, including references). Accepted papers in these two categories – full and short – will be part of the proceedings of IWCT 2025. 
 Journal-First 
 The aim of the Journal-First (JF) submission category is to further enrich the program of IWCT, as well as to provide an overall more flexible path to publication and dissemination of original research that is within the scope of IWCT. A submission in this category must adhere to the following criteria: 
 It should be clearly within the scope of the workshop. 
 It should be recent: it should have been accepted and made publicly available in a journal (online or in print) by January 1, 2023 or more recently. 
 It has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, Journal-First tracks of other conferences or workshops. 
 The submission has to be in the form of a 2-page extended abstract and has to provide a concise summary of the published journal paper. 
 Journal-First submissions must be marked as such in the submission’s title, and must explicitly include full bibliographic details (including a DOI) of the journal publication they are based on. Since the referenced journal papers have already been reviewed and accepted by the corresponding journals, submissions in the JF category will not be reviewed again for technical content. Submissions will be judged on the basis of the above criteria, but also considering how well they would complement the workshop’s technical program. Accepted submissions in this category will be part of the proceedings of IWCT 2025, with the title equal to the original title of the article with the prefix “Summary of”. 
 Posters 
 In addition to the traditional program topics from the past years, and taking advantage of the fact that some of the lead CT tool developers have expressed interest in participating again in the fourth iteration of the CT competition, we would like to offer with the poster session a low-threshold opportunity – especially targeting industry – to present activities within the scope of the workshop to the participants of IWCT. A tool demonstration can be given alongside a poster. In case a poster contribution wishes to provide more details or information, but does not want to submit a short or full paper, the authors can choose to submit in addition to the poster a maximal 2-page extended abstract detailing the content of the poster. The title of the extended abstract has to have the prefix “Extended Abstract of Poster” and these extended abstracts – if accepted – will also appear in the proceedings of IWCT 2025. 
 href="#post-proceedings-of-iwct-2025-in-section-vi-of-journal-sn-computer-science" - Post-proceedings of IWCT 2025 in Section VI of Journal SN Computer Science
We plan to organize a call among the best papers of the workshop to submit extended versions to the journal SN Computer Science in the Section ‘Combinatorial Methods and Models in System Testing’ (https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/23087782/data/v2). More information will be provided at the workshop. 
 href="#topics-for-submissions" - Topics for submissions
Topics of interest for submissions include, but are not limited to: 
 Combinatorial testing workflow 
 Modeling the input space for CT – the input to CT algorithms consists of the desired strength of coverage, a set of parameters together with their respective values, and constraints on value combinations. This input should capture correctly the points of variability in testing the system. While this input is clearly crucial for the effectiveness of CT, it is a difficult problem. 
 Efficient algorithms to generate test plans with small size for t-way testing for t > 2, involving support of constraints on combinations that are possible. 
 Determination of expected system behavior for each test case – while the test cases are automatically generated by the CT algorithm, determining the expected system behavior is currently usually a manual task. 
 Executing CT test plans – the result of CT algorithms is a list of tests, where a test is represented by a value assignment for each parameter. There is still significant effort in transforming this representation into actual tests that a tester or testing tool can execute. 
 Combinatorial testing based fault localization. 
 Implementation of CT in existing testing infrastructures. 
 Handling changes in test requirements – current CT methods focus on one-time generation of a test plan from a given set of requirements, but test requirements are almost never static, and tend to change between different releases and versions. However, generating a new plan of tests for each release may not be practical either. 
 Real-world experience in deployment of combinatorial testing 
 Empirical studies and feedback from practical applications of CT. 
 CT targeting AI/ML-based systems. 
 CT targeting security, including hardware and chip security. 
 CT targeting autonomous, concurrent and real-time systems. 
 CT targeting cloud computing systems and use of combinatorial methods in cloud architecture. 
 CT targeting feature models for software product lines. 
 CT targeting other domains; e.g., study of gene regulations and other biotechnology applications, mechanical engineering, testing in manufacturing hardware, quantum computing domain, financial domain or disaster management. 
 Applicability of combinatorial testing 
 Comparison and combination of CT with other dynamic verification methods. 
 Investigation of historical records of failures to determine the kind of CT which may have detected underlying faults. 
 Methodology used for test space modeling and determination of interaction coverage requirements. 
 Evaluation and return of investment metrics to assess the degree of usefulness of CT. 
 Discussion of challenges and open problems in the application of CT in an industrial setting. 
 Combinatorial and complementing methods 
 Combinatorial analysis of existing test plans – analyzing test plans not generated by a CT algorithm in light of a combinatorial test space. 
 Test plan reduction and completeness – both under stable, and under changing test requirements. 
 CT and coverage metrics – combining the two, and studying the relation between them.

2022-07-07The keynote speakers of the IWCIA 2022 are: Bhargab Bhattacharia, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India who will give the lecture“Digital Geometry in Medical Diagnostics and Biochemistry” on Wednesday, July 13, 13:30-14:30 (italian time) Benedek Nagy, Eastern Mediterranean University, Famagusta,… 
 ScopeImage analysis is a scientific discipline providing theoretical foundations and methods for solving problems appearing in a wide range of areas, as diverse as medicine, robotics, defense, and security. As a rule, the processed data are discrete; therefore, the “discrete approach” to image analysis appears to be a natural one and has an increasing importance. It is based on studying combinatorial properties of the considered digital data sets. Combinatorial image analysis often features various advantages (in terms of efficiency and accuracy) over the more traditional approaches based on continuous models requiring numeric computation.

 IWCIA 2025 is the twenty-third in a series of International Workshops on Combinatorial Image Analysis. It will be held in hybrid mode with base in Szeged, Hungary, September 24-26, 2025. The scientific program of the workshop consists of keynote talks and contributed papers.The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (approved). 
 Scope 
 Image analysis is a scientific discipline providing theoretical foundations and methods for solving problems appearing in a wide range of areas, as diverse as medicine, robotics, defense, and security. As a rule, the processed data are discrete; therefore, the “discrete approach” to image analysis appears to be a natural one and has an increasing importance. It is based on studying combinatorial properties of the considered digital data sets. Combinatorial image analysis often features various advantages (in terms of efficiency and accuracy) over the more traditional approaches based on continuous models requiring numeric computation. 
 The Workshop is a forum for current research on the following (or similar) research subjects which are directly or potentially applicable to image analysis: 
 Combinatorial problems in the discrete plane and space 
 Lattice polygons and polytopes 
 Digital/combinatorial geometry and topology 
 Digital manifolds 
 Geometry of digital curves and surfaces 
 Analysis and processing of digital surfaces with singularities (such as “pinched digital surfaces”) 
 Homotopy of digital manifolds; thinning algorithms and skeletons 
 Boundary tracking of digital solids; Geometric characteristics of object boundaries 
 Multigrid convergence analysis of metric-based descriptors 
 Tilings and patterns; Combinatorial pattern matching 
 Computational geometry and imaging sciences 
 Integer programming, linear programming, and graph theoretic models and approaches to problems of image analysis 
 Image representation, segmentation, grouping, and reconstruction 
 Processing “very large” digital pictures; Methods for image compression 
 Parallel architectures and algorithms 
 Fuzzy and stochastic image analysis 
 Discrete tomography 
 Grammars and models for image or scene analysis and recognition; cellular automata 
 Mathematical morphology and image analysis 
 Applications in medical imaging, biometrics, computer vision, image understanding, robotics, metrology, and others 
 AI and machine learning in imaging and 
 image analysis 
 The submitted papers are expected to meet high standards satisfying serious evaluation criteria. Each paper will be reviewed thoroughly by at least two members of the Program Committee. Double-blind review process will be applied to ensure maximal objectiveness. 
 Prof. Dr. Jovisa Zunic, a fellow of the Mathematical Institute of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (Belgrade, Serbia), was born in Serbia in 1961. He worked at the University of Novi Sad for more than a decade and held positions at Cardiff University (Cardiff, UK) and the Department of Computer Science at Exeter University (Exeter, UK) for almost two decades. 
 His research interests included computer vision, image processing, digital and discrete geometry, shape representation and encoding of digital objects, discrete mathematics, combinatorial optimization, number theory, wireless networks, neural networks, and pattern recognition. He published more than 150 research papers, most of which appeared in leading journals in the fields of computer science and mathematics. His Erdos number is 2 (via Prof. Aleksandar Ivic). 
 Prof. Zunic served as an editor or editorial board member for several high-ranking scientific journals. Under his supervision, numerous graduate students successfully developed as scientists. In 2004, alongside Prof. R. Klette, he organized the 10th edition of IWCIA in Auckland, New Zealand. 
 He passed away on March 25, 2025.
