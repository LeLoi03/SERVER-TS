 HRI’25 Conference: Robots for a Sustainable World 
 Welcome to HRI’25, the 20th edition of the ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction. 
 At HRI, researchers and practitioners from all over the world meet to discuss and explore the intersection of robotics and artificial intelligence with our human, social world. 
 This year, the conference will focus on a special theme:Robots for a Sustainable World. We all face the pressing global challenge of achieving sustainability in every facet of our lives;we want to ensure that robotics is part of the solution, rather than part of the problem.

 Overview of Submission Types 
 There are many ways to contribute to the HRI conference, though the most common is to submit a paper of some new work or research you have done. The work is then evaluated by a group of experts (peer review process) and, if accepted, you’ll have the opportunity to present it in a short talk, poster, video, demo, etc. at the conference.This guide will give you a quick understanding of the different ways you can present your work at HRI. 
 Mature research work is often submitted as aFull Paperto the HRI conference. In terms of quality and rigor, full papers are similar to a journal publication in other fields. The papers typically present the outcome of several months or years of hard work. They are anonymous submissions and are thoroughly peer reviewed in a two-stage process that includes an opportunity for authors to respond to the reviewers’ comments before a final decision is made on the paper (rebuttal). You can submit your work under one of several specific tracks (see details on thehref="https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2025/full-papers#description_tracks" - Full Paper page
) to ensure that you get the most qualified reviewers for your submission. Accepted Full Papers are published in the main conference proceedings. 
 Another way of contributing to the HRI conference is by submitting aShort Contribution. The aim of Short Contribution papers is to promote the sharing, reuse, and replication of existing scientific work by submitting datasets or code related to human-robot interaction or by reporting on a replication study. The Short Contributions follow a rigorous review process and are published in the main conference proceedings. 
 If you’ve been working on something you consider especially thought-provoking, controversial or methodologically unusual or risk-taking, you may want to think about writing analt.HRIcontribution. The subject matter of alt.HRI papers often cuts across HRI themes and the discussion that alt.HRI papers generate can be considered as important as the paper itself. The alt.HRI papers are of similar rigor, quality and length as Full Papers. 
 In addition to the above paper types, the HRI conference has aLate Breaking Reportstrack. This is a chance to write up your early research and present it as a Poster at the conference. This is usually a smaller contribution than a Full Paper and a great way to get feedback at the HRI conference. 
 Finally, there are a few other venues through which you can present HRI work at the conference: 
 If you’ve done a great movie about your work, submit it to our | Video | category and get a chance to win a special prize! 
 If you want to submit a specialized installation of some kind or want to show your robot in action, then you should submit to | Demonstrations | . If you’re a startup looking for a place to show off your robotic system or related software: this could also be a great place to advertise your work or products. 
 Our | Student Design Competition | is an opportunity to submit a novel, wacky, crazy, alternative or bizarre work which doesn’t fit into any other place. 
 Workshops | are a great way to find your peer group! Let’s say you are interested in a specific topic, such as personal care robots for older adults or appearance design for robots — and you want to meet others with the same interest. Find a few people with similar interests at other institutions or companies. Even for startups trying to find your lead users or people pushing the boundaries of your field, workshops can be a great way to find those people. Workshops can be half or full-day, and attract about 10-25 people. They’re collaborative events, about meeting new people and presenting early work in a field: if you want to teach people how to do something, then that’s a | Tutorial | . 
 If you are a student in HRI, thePioneers Workshopprovides a great venue to present your work and meet with other students.

 Overview of Submission Types 
 There are many ways to contribute to the HRI conference, though the most common is to submit a paper of some new work or research you have done. The work is then evaluated by a group of experts (peer review process) and, if accepted, you’ll have the opportunity to present it in a short talk, poster, video, demo, etc. at the conference.This guide will give you a quick understanding of the different ways you can present your work at HRI. 
 Mature research work is often submitted as aFull Paperto the HRI conference. In terms of quality and rigor, full papers are similar to a journal publication in other fields. The papers typically present the outcome of several months or years of hard work. They are anonymous submissions and are thoroughly peer reviewed in a two-stage process that includes an opportunity for authors to respond to the reviewers’ comments before a final decision is made on the paper (rebuttal). You can submit your work under one of several specific tracks (see details on thehref="https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2025/full-papers#description_tracks" - Full Paper page
) to ensure that you get the most qualified reviewers for your submission. Accepted Full Papers are published in the main conference proceedings. 
 Another way of contributing to the HRI conference is by submitting aShort Contribution. The aim of Short Contribution papers is to promote the sharing, reuse, and replication of existing scientific work by submitting datasets or code related to human-robot interaction or by reporting on a replication study. The Short Contributions follow a rigorous review process and are published in the main conference proceedings. 
 If you’ve been working on something you consider especially thought-provoking, controversial or methodologically unusual or risk-taking, you may want to think about writing analt.HRIcontribution. The subject matter of alt.HRI papers often cuts across HRI themes and the discussion that alt.HRI papers generate can be considered as important as the paper itself. The alt.HRI papers are of similar rigor, quality and length as Full Papers. 
 In addition to the above paper types, the HRI conference has aLate Breaking Reportstrack. This is a chance to write up your early research and present it as a Poster at the conference. This is usually a smaller contribution than a Full Paper and a great way to get feedback at the HRI conference. 
 Finally, there are a few other venues through which you can present HRI work at the conference: 
 If you’ve done a great movie about your work, submit it to our | Video | category and get a chance to win a special prize! 
 If you want to submit a specialized installation of some kind or want to show your robot in action, then you should submit to | Demonstrations | . If you’re a startup looking for a place to show off your robotic system or related software: this could also be a great place to advertise your work or products. 
 Our | Student Design Competition | is an opportunity to submit a novel, wacky, crazy, alternative or bizarre work which doesn’t fit into any other place. 
 Workshops | are a great way to find your peer group! Let’s say you are interested in a specific topic, such as personal care robots for older adults or appearance design for robots — and you want to meet others with the same interest. Find a few people with similar interests at other institutions or companies. Even for startups trying to find your lead users or people pushing the boundaries of your field, workshops can be a great way to find those people. Workshops can be half or full-day, and attract about 10-25 people. They’re collaborative events, about meeting new people and presenting early work in a field: if you want to teach people how to do something, then that’s a | Tutorial | . 
 If you are a student in HRI, thePioneers Workshopprovides a great venue to present your work and meet with other students.
