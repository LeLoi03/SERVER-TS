Hagit Attiya, Technion 
 Joseph Y. Halpern, Cornell University 
 Christos Papadimitriou, Columbia University and Archimedes AI 
 will present their view of the future of scientific research in their fields, particularly the challenges and threats posed by recent developments in computer science, engineering, and academicresearch and education. 
 Venue 
 SIROCCO 2025 will take place in the historic town ofDelphi(external link), Greece, at theEuropean Cultural Centre of Delphi(external link). ThisUNESCO World Heritage site(external link), once home to the oracle of Apollo and the omphalos, the 'navel of the world', is renowned for its profound blend of natural beauty and sacred history. Known as the seat of the high priestess Pythia of the Temple of Apollo, Delphi was considered the center of the world by the ancient Greeks, primarily due to the Oracle of Delphi where the priestess dispensed prophecies. Conveniently located just a few hours’ drive from Athens, Delphi is easily accessible for international attendees. Participants will enjoy breathtaking views of theAmphissa Olive Grove(external link)and the Itea Bay from theCentre’s guest rooms(external link), which are equipped with modern amenities. Additionally, Delphi hosts the renownedDelphi Archaeological Museum(external link), one of Greece’s most visited cultural treasures.

 SIROCCO Prize 
 SIROCCO Prize for Innovation in Distributed Computingwas established to recognize individuals whose research contributions expanded the collective investigative horizon in SIROCCO’s area of interest. That is, they formulated new problems, or identified new research areas, that were at the time of their introduction, unorthodox and outside the mainstream, but later attracted the interest of the SIROCCO community. This community is interested in the relationships between information and efficiency in decentralized computing. The prize recognizes originality, innovation, and creativity — the qualities that reflect the spirit of the SIROCCO conference.
