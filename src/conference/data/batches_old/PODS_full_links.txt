 PODS 
 PODS 
 PODS, the Symposium on Principles of Database Systems, is the premier international conference on the theoretical aspects of database systems. PODS started in 1982. It is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Management of Data (SIGMOD). Since 1991, PODS has been held jointly with the SIGMOD conference, combining the full spectrum of database research, from the most abstract and fundamental to the most pragmatic. A single registration gives attendees access to both PODS and SIGMOD sessions and copies of both proceedings. 
 PODS papers are distinguished by a rigorous approach to widely diverse problems in databases, often bringing to bear techniques from such fields as computational logic, finite model theory, complexity theory, algorithm and data structure design and analysis, and many others. In addition to approximately 25 research papers selected from a large number of submissions, the conference includes invited tutorials and keynote talks.
