 33rd International Symposium on the Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer 
 and Telecommunication Systems 
 The MASCOTS conference is a well-established forum for state-of-the-art research on the measurement, modeling, and performance analysis of computer systems and networks. The 33rd edition of this conference will take place onOctober 21-23, 2025at the Amphithéâtre Roussy, Sorbonne University in Paris, France. The conference will bring together academia and industry to present and discuss their latest research results. The technical program for the 3-day conference will include keynote talks and refereed paper presentations, including workshops. 
 We encourage original submissions describing state-of-the-art research in the areas of the performance evaluation of computer systems and networks as well as in related areas. Papers describing results of theoretical and/or practical significance are welcome. Experimental, modeling, and simulation studies are all in the scope of the conference. Papers focusing on novel performance evaluation methods or providing insights on design and runtime management tradeoffs are particularly encouraged. 
 The deadline for paper submissions isMay 18th, 2025. 
 Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore, subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. 
 Some of the best submitted papers that fall below the acceptance threshold for the main conference program, will be invited to the MASCOTS’25 Workshop. If they are orally live presented at the workshop by one registered author, they will then be published in the MASCOTS’25 proceedings as 4-page short papers. 
 A selection of accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended version to the prestigious Performance Evaluation (PEVA) journal. The MASCOTS 2024, 2023 and 2022 proceedings are available at IEEE Xplore. 
 Criteria for Paper Acceptance: 
 Pertinence with respect to the call for papers 
 Timeliness and relevance of the topic of the paper 
 Soundness of the research methodology, and evidence of advancement with respect to the state of the art 
 Appropriateness and relevance of the bibliographic references 
 Organization and quality of the text, figures and data that is presented. 
 All questions about the conference should be emailed to mascots2025 at easychair dot org
