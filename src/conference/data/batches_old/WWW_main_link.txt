 Since the invention of the World Wide Web in 1989, The Web Conference (formerly known as the International World Wide Web Conference, abbreviated as WWW) is a yearly international academic conference on the topic of the future direction of the World Wide Web. This conference has been the premier venue to present and discuss progress in research, development, standards, and applications of the topics related to the Web. Over the past three decades, The Web Conference has been the forum where some of the most fundamental Web technologies have been introduced, such as the Anatomy of a Large Scale Web Search Engine in 1998 prefiguring Google, the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003, and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007 (see also the Test of Time Award past recipients). The conference assembles scholars, researchers, policymakers, practitioners, and end-users with one unifying goal: to envision and create the future of the Web. 
  
 The 2025 ACM Web Conference will offer a high-quality program made of research sessions, posters, and demonstrations, a PhD symposium for the junior scholars, workshops, tutorials, a developers track for the practitioners as well as thought-provoking keynote speakers, panels, special tracks, and colocated special days. 
  
 The 2025 ACM Web Conference is an in-person conference with rich virtual components including live streaming of keynotes, oral presentations, workshops, and tutorials, as well as access to pre-recorded videos of talks, and the Whova platform for interaction with all conference attendees. 
  
 We thank you for participating and look forward to seeing you in Sydney, Australia!
