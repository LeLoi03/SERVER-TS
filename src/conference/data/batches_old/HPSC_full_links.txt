 Aims and Scope 
 The 2025 Conference on Advanced Topics and Auto Tuning in High-Performance Scientific Computing (ATAT 2025) focuses on the scientific impacts of the latest computer architectures and the approaches to achieve high-performance computing on these leading-edge computers. Advances in many-core architectures, high-end computers, and the integration of AI and deep learning technologies have revealed their significance in scientific discoveries and engineering achievements. These technologies not only enhance computational performance but also enable innovative approaches to solving complex scientific problems through data-driven methodologies. However, the complexity of these newly developed computers, along with the challenges of optimizing AI and deep learning algorithms, leads to contemporary issues in achieving the best efficiency of highly promising computational capabilities. The conference encourages interdisciplinary communications between researchers from applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, physical sciences, engineering, and industry to prompt innovations and breakthroughs in this exciting field. The main themes include, but are not limited to, simulations, numerical methods, applications, hardware, software, and particularly algorithm auto-tuning via statistical methods, AI-driven models and deep learning techniques in high-performance computing. 
 Forum 
 The Role of AI in Advancing Computational Education 
 The Role of AI in Advancing Computational Education will examine how AI is reshaping the design and delivery of computational courses, emphasizing curriculum adaptation and instructional support. With the integration of AI, traditional teaching approaches are evolving to incorporate personalized learning paths, intelligent content recommendations, and real-time feedback. This forum will delve into two core themes: 
 1.Transforming Computational Curriculum Design: 
 This discussion will focus on how AI necessitates changes in the content and structure of computational education. Key topics include the balance between coding skills and higher-level computational concepts, the integration of machine learning and data science modules, and the shifting weight of traditional versus modern topics. Participants will explore how to optimize course design to reflect the growing influence of AI-driven tools and practices. 
 2.AI as an Enabler for Course Delivery: 
 This segment will investigate how AI can enhance teaching and learning processes through adaptive learning systems, automated grading, and virtual teaching assistants. Real-world examples of AI-powered platforms providing immediate feedback, personalized resources, and scalable instructional support will be highlighted. 
 By addressing these themes, the forum aims to provide insights into how AI can revolutionize computational education, making it more efficient, inclusive, and aligned with the demands of the modern technological landscape.
