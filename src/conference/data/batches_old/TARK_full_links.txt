Theoretical Aspects of Rationality and Knowledge 
  
 The mission of the bi-annual TARK conferences is to bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields - including Artificial Intelligence, Cryptography Distributed Computing, Economics and Game Theory, Linguistics, Logic, Philosophy and Psychology, in order to further our understanding of interdisciplinary issues involving reasoning about rationality and knowledge. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, semantic models for knowledge, for belief and for uncertainty, bounded rationality and resource-bounded reasoning commonsense epistemic reasoning, epistemic logic, logics of knowledge and action, formal analysis of games, applications of reasoning about knowledge and other mental states, belief revision, and the role of knowledge in general information flow. TARK has been influential in building interfaces between the above disciplines, and in accelerating new research trends, both through the actual event and the circulation of its proceedings.Conference Websites

 Deadline for submissions: March 28, 2025, anywhere on earth (extended from March 21). 
 Scope and Mission: The mission of the TARK conferences is to bring together researchers from a wide variety of fields, including Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Game Theory, Decision Theory, Philosophy, Logic, Linguistics, and Cognitive Science, in order to further our understanding of interdisciplinary issues involving reasoning about rationality and knowledge. Previous conferences have been held bi-annually around the world. The information of all previous TARK conferences can be accessed athref="http://www.tark.org" - http://www.tark.org
. 
 Topics of interest: These include, but are not limited to, semantic models for knowledge, belief, awareness and uncertainty, bounded rationality and resource-bounded reasoning, commonsense epistemic reasoning, epistemic logic, epistemic game theory, knowledge and action, applications of reasoning about knowledge and other mental states, belief revision, computational social choice, algorithmic game theory, and foundations of multi-agent systems. 
 Content: Strong preference will be given to papers whose topic is of interest to an interdisciplinary audience, and papers should be accessible to such an audience. Papers will be held to the usual high standards of research publications. In particular, they should: 
 1) contain enough information to enable the program committee to identify the main contribution of the work; 
 2) explain the significance of the work—its novelty and its practical or theoretical implications; and 
 3) include comparisons with and references to relevant literature. 
 Style: Extended abstracts should be no longer than 10 pages (excluding references). Optional technical details such as proofs may be included in an appendix. One author of each accepted paper will be expected to present the paper at the conference. Note that the 10 page limit is to ensure that the reviewers can read and express an opinion on the submission within a short time. Please ensure that the main text for the reviewers stays within this limit. 
 Format: To format your paper, please use the EPTCS LaTeX style from:http://style.eptcs.org/. 
 TARK reviewing is not double-anonymised, so author names can be included in the submission.
