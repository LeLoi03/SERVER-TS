 Sharif, students present papers at ICSME 2024Oct 23, 2024By School of ComputingDr. Bonita Sharif and Kang-il ParkDr. Bonita Sharif and her students presented papers at thehref="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsme-2024" - International Conference of Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)
2024 earlier this month. 
  
 Dr. Sharif, graduate student Kang-il Park, and undergraduate student Michael DeJournett all traveled to Flagstaff, Arizona, Oct. 6–11 to attend the 40th International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution 2024 and the IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization (VISSOFT). 
  
 Park, a doctoral student in the School of Computing (advised by Dr. Sharif), also attended the Doctoral Symposium at ICSME. He presented his dissertation progress via a presentation and a poster and received feedback from a group of expert senior software engineering researchers on his research. 
  
 Citation: Park, K. “Assessing Software Developer Productivity and Emotional State Using Biometrics.” International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution Doctoral Symposium Track (ICSME 2024). 
  
 Dr. Sharif co-presented a paper withDoug Durham(of Don’t Panic Labs and Nebraska Global) on their collaboration in software engineering research and education.

 Students Kang-il Park,Isaac Baysinger(UNL graduate and now Software Engineer at Viavi Solutions), and Michael DeJournett were part of a paper on how UML layouts and working memory affect defect identification that was published at the 12th IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization (VISSOFT). DeJournett and Dr. Sharif co-presented this paper. VISSOFT is a small community of targeted software visualization research. This was DeJournett’s first published paper and presentation at a software engineering conference.3

 Dr. Sharif also published a paper with UNL student Nate Liess, who helped in the qualitative analysis of videos to understand how developers layout diagrams. This analysis turned out to be a much more difficult task than initially anticipated. This poster generated a lot of discussion from international visualization researchers. Several suggestions on how to evaluate layouts visually were discussed. 
  
 Citation: Sharif, B., Liess, N., Maletic, J. I. (2024), “Exploring How Developers Layout UML Class Diagrams”, 12th IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization (VISSOFT), Oct 6-7, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA 
  
 Dr. Sharif and her team of collaborators also published a tool demo paper at the 12th IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization (VISSOFT), which won the best tool demo award. The tool paper extended the previous visualization software for eye tracking data (collected byiTrace) and expanded it to incorporate token-based heatmaps and support for scarf plots. Visualizing eye-tracking data on realistic systems is a challenge. When done correctly, these visualizations help in uncovering developer behaviors during software tasks. Josh Behler from Kent State demonstrated iTrace-Visualize live at the tool demo session. “The tool demo session at VISSOFT is one of the best sessions because you can play with tools live and test them out with their authors. This session was the most fun,” said Sharif. 
  
 Citation: Behler, J., Villalobos, G., Pangonis, J., Sharif, B., Maletic, J. I. (2024), “Extending iTrace-Visualize to Support Token-based Heatmaps and Region of Interest Scarf Plots for Source Code”, 12th IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization (VISSOFT), Oct 6-7, Flagstaff, Arizona, USA, – Best Tool Demo Award 
  
 Dr. Sharif acknowledges that a lot of this work is possible because of the motivated and driven students we have in the School of Computing. “After some reflection on what lessons were learned from this trip, it is time to move forward and continue pursuing the next research endeavor,” said Sharif.

IEEE VIS: Visualization & Visual Analytics 
 November 2 to 7inVienna, AustriaWelcome to IEEE VIS 2025 
 IEEE VIS 2025 will be the year’s premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics. The conference will convene an international community of researchers and practitioners from universities, government, and industry to exchange recent findings on the design and use of visualization tools. 
 In 2025, the conference is again moving to the old continent, and we cannot wait to welcome you to the heart of Europe in the beautiful city of Vienna! Vienna is awelcoming hostthat excels at traditional hospitality, and a highly efficient modern city. It is a major urban center but still has the largest proportion of green space of any large European city. In addition to the well-known cultural highlights, the capital’s outstanding infrastructure sets Vienna apart as a remarkably clean and safe city. The public transportation network and short walking distances between attractions mean it takes no time to get around, with some of Europe’s most beautiful sights and the finest culinary delicacies around every corner. Sustainability is a key factor - from renewable energy forms and the outstanding drinking water fresh from the city’s taps. Like many other events in Vienna, VIS 2025 will be certified as agreen meeting. 
 We will do our best to plan an extraordinary experience for you and will cheer together for IEEE VIS’ past and future!
