 AusPDC 2025 
 University of Queensland, Brisbane, 10 February – 14 February 2025 
 23nd Australasian Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (AusPDC 2025) 
 AusPDC 2025will be held in conjunction withAustralasian Computer Science Week(ACSW 2025), Brisbane,10 February - 14 February 2025. 
 Scope of the Symposium 
 The Australasian Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (AusPDC) stands as a premier gathering for distributed systems researchers in the Australasian region, covering a diverse array of topics within parallel and distributed computing. 
 In 2025, we are proud to unveil a revitalized event, featuring an expansive program that includeskeynotesfrom prominent Australian researchers,invited technical paper presentations, engagingDemonstrations and tutorials,Panel Discussions, andindustry presentations. 
 The 23rd installment of this symposium will convene in 2025at theUniversity of QueenslandinBrisbane, Australia. It will be held as an integral part of the Australian Computer Science Week (ACSW 2025), the foremost occasion for Computer Science researchers in the Australasian region. 
 The symposium primarily targets researchers from Australia and New Zealand. However, in the spirit of parallel and distributed computing, which aims to foster collaboration among distributed virtual organizations, we actively encourage international researchers to submit papers and participate. 
 Topics of interest for the symposium include (but are not limited to): 
 Cloud/Fog/Edge computing 
 Serverless computing and FaaS 
 Quantum Computing 
 Microservice application management and orchestration 
 Cluster management (e.g., container management systems, GPU cluster management) 
 High-performance computing 
 Artificial intelligence applied to distributed and parallel systems 
 Mobile, sensor networks 
 Internet of Things 
 Distributed stream processing 
 Big Data processing and analytics 
 Virtualization, containers, unikernels, orchestration, and other enablers 
 Security, trust, and privacy in Clouds/Fog/Edge 
 Large-scale data management (e.g., storage, placement, replication) 
 Network function virtualisation and software-defined networks 
 Distributed Ledger Technologies and Blockchains 
 Service computing and workflow management 
 Performance evaluation and modelling 
 Datacentre and Interconnection networks 
 Performance accelerators 
 Parallel programming models, languages, and compilers
