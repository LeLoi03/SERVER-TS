 International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation, and Robotics (ICINCO) 
 The purpose of the International Conference on Informatics in Control, Automation and Robotics (ICINCO) is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners interested in the application of informatics to Control, Automation and Robotics. Four simultaneous tracks will be held, covering intelligent control systems, optimization, robotics, automation, signal processing, sensors, systems modelling and control, and industrial engineering, production, and management. Informatics applications are pervasive in many areas of control, automation, and robotics. This conference intends to emphasize this connection.
