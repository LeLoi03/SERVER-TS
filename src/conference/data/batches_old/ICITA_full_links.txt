 ICITA 2025 
 The 19th International Conference on Information Technology and Applications (ICITA 2025) will be held in Oslo, Norway on 14 - 16 October 2025. The conference is an annual event and recognized as one of the major series of conferences in Information Technology (IT in short). ICITA continues to retain its tradition of being a high quality conference. The event will open an opportunity for academics and industry professionals worldwide to exchange their knowledge of the state-of-the-art research and development in information technology and applications. It will help participants establish new links and extend professional networks. This conference addresses the importance that IT professionals stretch across narrowly defined subject areas and constantly acquire a global technical and social perspective. ICITA 2025 offers such an opportunity to facilitate cross-disciplinary and social gatherings. 
 All accepted papers will be published as book chapters in a High Quality book by Springer Book"Lecture Notes in Network Systems Series"in both hardcopy as well as electronic version in ISSN (Print): 2367-3370 and ISSN (electronic):2367-3389 
 Since 2002 ICITA has maintained a high conference standard, and several thousand academics and Information Technology professionals have used it as a presenting, publishing and networking medium for their research findings. We are confident that more will be achieved during the next ten years! The conference will be held at the Science Park, Oslo, Norway, from 14 - 16th of October, 2025. The aim of International Conference on Information Technology and Applications is to provide a platform for academics and engineers in computer technology to meet, exchange ideas, and establish professional networks. It is a forum which will focus on specific disciplinary research as well as on multi-disciplinary studies. The uniqueness of ICITA is that it enables scientists in the world to communicate not only about technical issues, but also any of the other areas which use technology.
