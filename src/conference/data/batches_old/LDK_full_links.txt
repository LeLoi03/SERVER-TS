We invite submissions to the fifth biennial conference on Language, Data and Knowledge (LDK 2025) to be held in Naples, Italy in September 2025. This conference aims to bring together researchers from across different disciplines concerned with the acquisition, treatment, curation and the use of language data in the context of data science and knowledge-based applications. This edition builds upon the success of the inaugural event held in Galway, Ireland in 2017, the second LDK in Leipzig, Germany in 2019, the third LDK in Zaragoza, Spain in 2021, and the fourth LDK in Vienna, Austria in 2023.

 We welcome submissions of relevance to the topics listed below. Submissions can be in the form of: 
 Long papers: 9–12 pages; 
 Short papers: 4–6 pages. 
 All submission lengths are given including references. Accepted submissions will be published in an open-access conference proceedings volume and indexed in ACL anthology and DBLP, free of charge for authors. TheACL templatesshould therefore be used for all conference submissions. 
 As the reviewing process is single-blind, submissions should not be anonymised.Papers should be submitted via OpenReview at the following address: 
 href="https://openreview.net/group?id=LDK/2025/Conference" - https://openreview.net/group?id=LDK/2025/Conference
All papers must represent original work. When submitted, the submission must not have been previously published*, and the material in it must not have been/be submitted for review at another journal or conference while under review at LDK 2025. 
 *This excludes papers on preprint archives, such as arXiv, which we do not consider to have been previously published. 
 The conference will be hybrid (face-to-face and remote). Note that at least one author of each accepted paper must register to present the paper at the conference (either remotely or on-site).
