 ENTER25 eTourism conference 
 eTourism towards 2060 
 17-21 February 2025 – Wrocław, Poland 
 Welcome to the 32nd ENTER eTourism conference 
 Dear ENTER participants: 
 It’s our great pleasure to welcome you all to the ENTER25 eTourism Conference,eTourism towards 2060, hosted in the beautiful city of Wroclaw. This event promises to be an inspiring and memorable experience—academically, professionally, and socially. We hope you enjoy reconnecting with colleagues, forging new collaborations, and creating wonderful memories. As ENTER25 concludes, we trust you’ll already be looking forward to ENTER26! 
 This conference would not be possible without the efforts and dedication of many individuals and organizations. We extend our deepest gratitude to: 
 Our hosts, the WSB Merito University in Wroclaw, led by its Chancellor, Prof. Joanna Nogieć. 
 Wiktoria Król-Cieciorowska, Dagmara Lukaszewska and their team at the Convention Bureau of Wroclaw, alongside the Wroclaw Tourism Organisation. 
 The IFITT Board has also been instrumental in supporting the organization of this conference: Mattia Rainoldi, Dr. Yoo Ri Kim, Muhammad Khogali, Dr. Katerina Berezina, Dr. Jelena Dorcic, Dr. Sergio Ibanez Sanchez, Dr. Johanna Heinonen and Patience Tropo. 
 Our Research Track Chairs, Dr. Lyndon Nixon, Dr. Aarni Tuomi and Professor Peter O’Connor and the experts who helped review the more than 100 submissions received. 
 The Ph.D. Workshop Chairs: Professor Ulrike Gretzel, Dr. Kasha Minor, Professor Rodolfo Baggio, Dr. Arkadiusz Tomczyk and Dr. Agnieszka Pawlak-Wolanin, who managed more than 35 Ph.D. proposals. 
 The industry practitioners who have agreed to be with us during the conference and who will be part of the more than 25 panels that will take place. 
 And, of course, our generous sponsors, who are acknowledged in the following pages of this document. 
 Most importantly, thank you, our participants. IFITT is a community, and without your support, dedication, and engagement, neither IFITT nor ENTER could exist. Thank you for making the journey to Wroclaw and for being part of this collective effort to advance eTourism research and practice. We sincerely hope this conference exceeds your expectations. 
 We trust that ENTER25 will help shape the future of IFITT, starting with the Future Workshop that will take place on Tuesday. IFITT and its flagship event, ENTER, need to re-establish their place in the debate on how technology can help improve the tourism industry, especially at a time like now, when AI is becoming mainstream and presents different challenges and opportunities. And when the tourism industry is under pressure to be more socially, economically and environmentally sustainable. 
 Once again, welcome to Wroclaw and to ENTER25! Let’s all make this a conference to remember. 
 Professor Dimitrios Buhalis, Chair of ENTER25 
 Professor Jacques Bulchand-Gidumal, President of IFITT

 ENTER25 eTourism conference 
 Call for contributions 
 17-21 February 2025 – Wrocław, Poland 
 Conference theme 
 eTourism Towards 2060:Information and communication technologies (ICTs) continue to revolutionize travel, tourism, and hospitality. Over 30+ years, the ENTER eTourism conference has been at the forefront of providing insight on the use and impact of new technologies for travel, tourism and hospitality practitioners and researchers. However, the rapid development and deployment of new developments, including Generative AI (GenAI), service robotics, Internet of Things, and Extended Realities (XR) technologies, among others, call for a rapid and careful reassessment of ICT in tourism, particularly including ethical and societal considerations. If an AI-assistant books the wrong itinerary, who is to blame? Will customer service bots replace human workers? What is best for both the tourist and the tourism industry, as well as economies and societies as a whole? 
 This call for contributions invites the academic and professional eTourism community to challenge and co-create the next decades of e-tourism, preparing tourism stakeholders for what the future will bring. 
 href="https://ifitt.net/enter-conference/enter-25/" - ENTER25 eTourism conference
continues the tradition of bringing together people, ideas, and research from all over the world to find answers to the burning questions the industry is facing. This year, some of these questions include: 
 What will / can / should the future of tourism look like? 
 What role can new ICT technologies such as AI, robotics, IoT and XR play in creating a sustainable future for e-tourism? 
 How can technology help create businesses and organizations that are agile, innovative, and resilient in a time of constant flux? 
 What is the role of technology in accelerating sustainable development? 
 How will emerging technologies impact the customer and employee experience? 
 How will technologies reshape the tourism and hospitality higher education landscape? 
 What challenges and dangers does technological disruption bring to the tourism and hospitality field and how can we address them? 
 TheInternational Federation for IT and Travel & Tourism (IFITT)together with IFITT Poland, call for the global eTourism community, academics, technology, and travel and hospitality business, destinations, and NGOs to contribute to ENTER Conference and think about how technologies will continue shaping the future of the tourism industry. The conference, with the themeeTourism Towards 2060, contributes to the science and practice of tourism and provides various stakeholders with possibilities to network, innovate, learn, experience, and develop the tourism field. 
 We invite the entire academic and professional research community to submit cutting-edge research and the latest case studies on emergent and innovative ICT concepts, applications, and business models to be shared at the ENTER25 eTourism conference.

 Ph.D. Workshop Proposals 
 The future development of tourism is not only a challenge for the tourism industry and researchers but also for Ph.D. students. Focusing on the next generation of researchers is key to improving the quality of research and to contributing to the challenging development of information and communication technology research in tourism. 
 The ENTER25 eTourism conference organizes a one-day workshop for Ph.D. students who are encouraged to present their research proposals (early to advanced stages) related to information and communication technologies in travel and tourism and receive valuable comments and advice from members of the IFITT community in a supportive environment. Students can also find answers to their academic and research career questions and expand their network with peers, researchers, industry, and universities from around the world. 
 Benefits for participants of the Ph.D. workshop
