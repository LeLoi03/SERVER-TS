 The 18th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM 2025) 
 Objectives 
 Digital and computational solutions are the prevalent means for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of mathematical information. Separate communities have developed to investigate and build computer based systems for automated deduction, computer algebra, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user interfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their integration can lead to synergies offering significant added value. The Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM) offers a venue for discussing and developing solutions to the great challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas. 
 The conference addresses research from these areas, and it usually adds workshops and a doctoral programme.

 TheConference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM)is an organization and a conference dedicated to promoting the advancement of machine-supported reasoning, computation, and knowledge management in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. CICM is the result of convergence of various research communities that organize a joint annual conference in which they are represented as conference tracks: Calculemus, Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML), and Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM). This is the CICM home page. 
 Next Meeting: 
 href="2025" - CICM-18 | will be held in Brasília, Brazil, Oct 6-11 2025, co-chaired by Valeria de Paiva and Peter Koepke, and organized by Mauricio Ayala-Rincón.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- More and more mathematical information is digitally processed, generated communicated, stored and curated. CICM brings together the many separate communities that have developed theoretical and practical solutions for mathematical applications such as computation, deduction, knowledge management, and user interfaces. It offers a venue for discussing problems and solutions in each of these areas and their integration. CICM 2024 invites submissions in all topics relating to intelligent computer mathematics, in particular but not limited to * theorem proving and computer algebra * mathematical knowledge management * digital mathematical libraries *** Important Dates *** Formal submissions - Abstract deadline: March 25, 2024 - Full paper deadline: April 1, 2024 - Reviews sent to authors: May 7, 2024 - Rebuttals due: May 10, 2024 - Notification of acceptance: May 24, 2024 - Camera-ready copies due: June 7, 2024 - Conference: August 5-9, 2024 Doctoral programme applications - Submission deadline: June 13, 2024 - Notification of acceptance: June 28, 2024 *** Programme committee *** The program committee is listed athref="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://cicm-conference.org/2024/cicm.php?event=&menu=pc__;!!IBzWLUs!TmlTNzVo57tHdBST23f1Mxi0Z3_bs6Utac0sqWc1lV6XkJkrg2PJU3qx5yYfC-uvocvieMPlnPn_fJn9FuiaIzrb38FCGBPfdy8jjlU6$" - https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://cicm-conference.org/2024/cicm.php?event=&menu=pc__;!!IBzWLUs!TmlTNzVo57tHdBST23f1Mxi0Z3_bs6Utac0sqWc1lV6XkJkrg2PJU3qx5yYfC-uvocvieMPlnPn_fJn9FuiaIzrb38FCGBPfdy8jjlU6$

The CICM community appreciates the varying nature of the relevant research in computer mathematics and invites submissions of two different forms: *** Formal Paper Submissions *** Formal submissions will be reviewed rigorously and accepted papers will be published in a volume of Springer LNAI: * regular papers (up to 15 pages + bibliography) present novel research results * project and survey papers (up to 15 pages + bibliography) summarize existing results * system and dataset descriptions (4 to 5 pages + bibliography) present digital artifacts *** Doctoral Symposium: Two-Page Abstracts*** The doctoral programme provides PhD students a forum to present early results to receive constructive feedback and mentoring. To attend, submissions of two-page abstracts are expected in which the focus and research questions of the expected PhD theses are described; details on completed research tasks and remaining research plans should be given. In addition to these abstract, a two-pages CV of the applicant should also be submitted, detailing background information (name university, supervisor), education (sought degree, previous degrees), employments and relevant research experience (publications, attended conferences/workshops). *** Submissions *** All submissions should be made via EasyChair athref="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2024__;!!IBzWLUs!TmlTNzVo57tHdBST23f1Mxi0Z3_bs6Utac0sqWc1lV6XkJkrg2PJU3qx5yYfC-uvocvieMPlnPn_fJn9FuiaIzrb38FCGBPfd7q8e5_M$" - https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm2024__;!!IBzWLUs!TmlTNzVo57tHdBST23f1Mxi0Z3_bs6Utac0sqWc1lV6XkJkrg2PJU3qx5yYfC-uvocvieMPlnPn_fJn9FuiaIzrb38FCGBPfd7q8e5_M$
