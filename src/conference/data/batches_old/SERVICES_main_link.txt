 The 2025 IEEE World Congress on SERVICES (SERVICES 2025)is solely sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society under the auspice of the Technical Community on Services Computing (TCSVC). With six theme conferences, the scope of SERVICES 2025 covers all aspects of services computing and applications, current or emerging. 
 Centered around services computing, SERVICES 2025 covers various systems and networking research pertaining to cloud, edge and Internet-of Things (IoT), as well as technologies for intelligent computing, learning, Big Data and blockchain applications, addressing critical issues such as knowledge network, high performance, security, privacy, dependability, trustworthiness, and cost-effectiveness. 
 In addition to co-located theme-topic conferences, the Congress will also include symposia and workshops supporting deep-dive discussions on emerging important topics, and complement the SERVICES 2025 program with industry and application presentations and panels. 
 Authors are invited to prepare early and submit original papers to any of these conferences at www.easychair.org. All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. Accepted and presented papers will appear in the conference proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. 
 SERVICES 2025 is the only premier professional event for the services computing field offered by IEEE.
