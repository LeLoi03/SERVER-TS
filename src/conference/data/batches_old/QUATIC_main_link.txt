 AIMS AND SCOPE 
 The International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology (QUATIC) is a leading scientific conference that gathers experts from industry and academia to exchange ideas and approaches regarding all quality aspects in ICT software and systems engineering and management. This forum fosters lively discussion on furthering the state-of-the-art, defining future directions, and disseminating advanced new methods, techniques, and tools. QUATIC 2025, now in its 18th edition, will be hosted in Lisbon, Portugal's capital, which is known for its rich history, stunning architecture, and vibrant culture. The city is famous for its iconic yellow trams, historic neighborhoods like Alfama and Bairro Alto, and landmarks like BelÃ©m Tower and the JerÃ³nimos Monastery. It blends old-world charm with modern energy. 
 QUATIC 2025 invites practitioners and researchers to submit technical papers reporting original research and experience results in all topics and sub-fields of Quality in ICT process, product, and applications domains, as well as sharing practical studies. 
  
 The conference is organized intothematic tracksthat serve as dedicated discussion venues on focused topics of interest, mixing well-established traditional QUATIC topics and newly proposed tracks, covering breakthrough research challenges: 
 Requirements Engineering 
 Cloud computing and System Architecture 
 Edge computing and Cyber Physical systems 
 Verification, Validation, and Testing 
 Evolution and maintenance 
 Process Improvement and Analytics 
 Security and Privacy 
 Green and Sustainable Computing 
 Human, Ethical and Social Aspects 
 Quality in the Age of AI 
  
 The relevant topics specific to each track are available from the conference web site athref="/thematic-tracks" - https://2025.quatic.org/thematic-tracks
SUBMISSIONS 
 QUATIC 2025 accepts the following types of contributions: 
 Research and experience papers(full papers, between 12 and 16 pages). Full papers should describe novel and scientifically rigorous contributions to any aspect related to the quality of ICT systems. Experience papers should present original reports on relevant industrial case studies. 
 Innovative and exploratory papers(short papers, between 6 and 8 pages). Short papers should describe new, unconventional approaches that fundamentally challenge established research directions and current state of practice, but which are at an early stage of investigation. 
 All papers must conform to theSpringer Computer Science Proceedings guidelinesand be submitted through the EasyChair link, selecting the track that best suits their field. 
 QUATIC 2025 will employ a double-blind review process. Authors of full and short papers should submit a PDF version of their paper without names and affiliations, or other elements that allow the authors' identification, to guarantee a double-blind review process. 
 Authors need to comply with thehref="https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct" - Springer Nature Code of Conduct
andhref="https://www.quatic.org/ethics" - QUATIC's Code of Ethical Conduct
, and submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the track's Program Committee. Work without substantial new material or failing to follow length and formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected and, therefore, will not be reviewed. TheiThenticate plagiarism checkerwill be used to verify the submissions' originality. 
 PROCEEDINGS 
 QUATIC is an in-person conference, as direct interaction among participants enhances the overall experience and fosters meaningful discussions. To ensure the quality of the technical program and encourage active participation, accepted full and short papers must be presented onsite by at least one of their authors to be included in the conference proceedings. 
 As with previous QUATIC editions, QUATIC 2025 proceedings will be published in a Springer conference series volume and indexed in DBLP, Google Scholar, EI-Compendex, Mathematical Reviews, SCImago, and Scopus, and also submitted for inclusion in ISI Proceedings.
