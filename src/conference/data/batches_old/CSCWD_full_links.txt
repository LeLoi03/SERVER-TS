 IEEE CSCWD 2025 – IEEE 28th International Conference on ComputerSupported Cooperative Work in Design 
 By mcoustaty 
 10 September, 2024 
 May 5 – 7, 2025, Compiègne, France 
 Scope of the Conference 
 Design of complex artifacts and systems requires the cooperation of multidisciplinary design teams. The 2025 28th International Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD 2025) provides a forum for researchers and practitioners involved in different but related domains to confront research results and discuss key problems. The scope of CSCWD 2025 includes the research and development of collaboration technologies and their applications to the design of processes, products, systems, and services in industries and societies. Collaboration technologies include theories, methods, mechanisms, protocols, software tools, platforms, and services that support communication, coordination and collaboration among people, software and hardware systems. Related fields of research include human-computer interaction, business process management, collaborative virtual environments, enterprise modeling, security and privacy, as well as social aspects and human factors related to collaboration and design. The major topics of interest to the conference include, but are not limited to: 
 Collaboration theory and methodology 
 Design of collaboration methods, processes, mechanisms, and protocols 
 Collaboration across disciplines (design science, service science and data science) 
 Innovative collaborative approaches (crowdsourcing, social media) 
 Collaborative computing (Cloud/Edge Computing, Web services, Blockchains) 
 Cyber-physical systems, Industry 4.0, digital twins, industrial metaverse 
 Large Language Models, Industrial Foundation Models 
 Industrial Internet, IoT, sensor networks 
 Security and privacy in collaborative systems 
 Collaboration technology applications 
 Submission of Papers 
 Papers reporting original research results and experience are solicited. Each paper, written in English, is limited to 6 pages (IEEE proceedings format), including references and illustrations. Electronic submissions in PDF format are strongly recommended. Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present the paper. Submission Web Site:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cscwd2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cscwd2025

 Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design 
 Our Goal 
 The Technical Committee on Computer Supported Cooperative Work in Design (CSCWD) is an international special interest group of researchers working in the fields of collaboration technologies and applications to the design of processes, products, systems, and services in industries and societies. Collaboration technologies include theories, methods, mechanisms, protocols, software tools, platforms, and services that support collaboration and coordination among people, software and hardware systems. Related fields of research include collaborative workflows, collaborative virtual environments, collaborative workspaces, collaborative wireless sensor networks, collaborative processing of Big Data, interoperability, ontology and semantics, security and privacy, as well as social aspects and human factors related to collaboration. Application domains include aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, construction, logistics, transportation, power and energy, smart home and intelligent building, healthcare and homecare, infrastructure, administration, social networks, and entertainment. We provide a forum for researchers and practitioners involved in different but related fields to confront research results and discuss key problems. 
 Join Us 
 Interact with researchers and practitioners within an established international collaboration network with a history of successful international annual conferences since 1996. 
 Exchange research ideas and developing international collaborative projects. 
 Publish research results in a timely manner through international conferences and journal special issues. 
 Demonstrate leadership by organizing special sessions at SMC and CSCWD conferences and editing journal special issues. 
 Meet old friends and make new ones from different parts of the world.
