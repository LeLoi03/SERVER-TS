Welcome to the web site of the 32ndIEEE International Symposium on Computer Arithmetic, to be held in El Paso, TX, USA. May 4-7, 2025. 
 Computer arithmetic has always been at the core of the digital age, and is currently driving innovation in domains such as artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, signal processing, and security. Since 1969, the ARITH symposia have served as the flagship conference for presenting scientific work on the latest research in computer arithmetic. ARITH 2025 is the latest in this series, and we invite you to participate. 
 See thearchivespage for more information on previous symposia.

CALL FOR PAPERS 
 href="cfp.pdf" - PDF version of CFP
ARITH 2025 welcomes submissions of conference papersdescribing recent scientific advances related to computer arithmetic. Papers under review elsewhere are not acceptable for submission to ARITH 2025. By submitting a paper, authors implicitly confirm that they are solely submitting it to ARITH 2025. Submissions must be in English and made through the EasyChair website:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=arith2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=arith2025
. 
 Submissions for full papers should not exceed8 pages(no extra pages) using the IEEE Computer Society Conference format (two columns), while short and industry papers should not exceed4 pages(no extra pages). Accepted papers will be presented at the conference and included in the conference proceedings and in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. However, for review purposes, full papers may be submitted with up to20 pages, and short/industry papers with up to10 pages, using12pt font size,single column, anddouble spacing. 
 For formatting instructions, please refer to:http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html. 
 The review process for ARITH 2025 isdouble-blind. Author names, affiliations, and grants must be anonymized in submitted papers and self-references should be handled as third-party references. Papers not complying with this policy will be administratively rejected. While non-anonymous preprints or code repositories are not considered a violation of this policy, reviewers are discouraged from seeking them out. Authors should provide anonymized versions of any related artifacts where applicable.
