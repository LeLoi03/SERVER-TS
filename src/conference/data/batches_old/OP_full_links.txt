 Call for site preliminary bids: 2026 SIAM Conference on Optimization The board of the SIAM Activity Group on Optimization is calling for pre-proposals to host and jointly organize with SIAM the 2026 SIAM Conference on Optimization (SIOPT 2026). This solicitation is open to optimization research groups in any continent. Given the previous locations, applications from outside North America are particularly encouraged. The SIOPT conference is held every three years and is the flagship event of our SIAG on Optimization. The conference is usually held in the last weeks of May. SIOPT 2023 has counted with more than 1000 participants. SIAM will support the conference, including use of SIAM’s abstract submission system, provision of the official conference website siam.org and production of the conference program. SIAM will either have sole financial control (including risk) of the conference or be in partnership with a local institution. Preliminary bids should be brief and contain information pertaining to the location, facilities, logistics (accommodation and transportation), likely local organizers, and factors that impact registration fees such as the availability of discounted meeting space or potential local sponsors. Preliminary bids will be examined by the SIAG/OPT and SIAM Officers, which will then decide the next steps to be taken. A final decision will be made by the end of 2023. The selected bid will be asked to fill out the proposal form available under “SIAM Activity Group Conference” on the following page:href="https://www.siam.org/conferences/about-siam-conferences/propose-a-conference" - https://www.siam.org/conferences/about-siam-conferences/propose-a-conference
The deadline to apply is August 15, 2023. Please send your preliminary bid to SIAG/OPT Program Director, Gabriele Eichfelder (href="https://listserv.zib.de/mailman/listinfo/opt-net" - gabriele.eichfelder at tu-ilmenau.de
).
