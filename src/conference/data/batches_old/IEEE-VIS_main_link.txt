IEEE VIS: Visualization & Visual Analytics 
 November 2 to 7inVienna, AustriaWelcome to IEEE VIS 2025 
 IEEE VIS 2025 will be the year’s premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics. The conference will convene an international community of researchers and practitioners from universities, government, and industry to exchange recent findings on the design and use of visualization tools. 
 In 2025, the conference is again moving to the old continent, and we cannot wait to welcome you to the heart of Europe in the beautiful city of Vienna! Vienna is awelcoming hostthat excels at traditional hospitality, and a highly efficient modern city. It is a major urban center but still has the largest proportion of green space of any large European city. In addition to the well-known cultural highlights, the capital’s outstanding infrastructure sets Vienna apart as a remarkably clean and safe city. The public transportation network and short walking distances between attractions mean it takes no time to get around, with some of Europe’s most beautiful sights and the finest culinary delicacies around every corner. Sustainability is a key factor - from renewable energy forms and the outstanding drinking water fresh from the city’s taps. Like many other events in Vienna, VIS 2025 will be certified as agreen meeting. 
 We will do our best to plan an extraordinary experience for you and will cheer together for IEEE VIS’ past and future!

 Submission Guidelines and Reviewing Criteria 
 As the leading academic event on visualization research, IEEE VIS expects important, impactful, and potentially transformative contributions. Submissions will be judged on their scientific quality and novelty, potential impact, degree to which the evidence supports the findings, appropriateness of methodology, and the research process followed. After the initial notification of review results, selected papers are only conditionally accepted and will undergo a full revision and review cycle: only papers that improve according to the required changes will be accepted after the second round review. 
 IEEE VIS 2025 also features a separate short papers track. You can find more information in thehref="shortpapers" - call for participation for short papers
. 
 When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully read and adhere to thehref="paper-submission-guidelines" - paper submission guidelines
. 
 Reviewers should be familiar with thehref="review-instructions" - guidelines for reviewing papers for VIS
. 
 Accessibility 
 We highly recommend screen reader accessible final submissions. Please see thehref="/year/2025/info/call-participation/make-pdf-accessible" - VIS Accessibility Guide
to learn how you can make your contribution accessible. 
 Open Access Policy 
 Visualization research is best communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, all paper authors are encouraged to share their accepted paper in an open-access repository in accordance with IEEE copyright regulations. We also recommend that authors include sufficient supplemental materials with their submission so that their work can be easily scrutinized and used or extended by future researchers and practitioners. For instructions on how to post an accepted paper to an open-access repository and recommendations on sharing supplemental materials, please see thehref="https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/info/open-practices/open-practices" - VIS Open Practices Guidelines
. Additionally, funding agencies and research organizations may have specific rules concerning Plan S compliance: impacted authors should check and comply with their respective organizational rules.Email:opc@ieeevis.org

 Submission Guidelines and Reviewing Criteria 
 As the leading academic event on visualization research, IEEE VIS expects important, impactful, and potentially transformative contributions. Submissions will be judged on their scientific quality and novelty, potential impact, degree to which the evidence supports the findings, appropriateness of methodology, and the research process followed. After the initial notification of review results, selected papers are only conditionally accepted and will undergo a full revision and review cycle: only papers that improve according to the required changes will be accepted after the second round review. 
 IEEE VIS 2025 also features a separate short papers track. You can find more information in thehref="shortpapers" - call for participation for short papers
. 
 When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully read and adhere to thehref="paper-submission-guidelines" - paper submission guidelines
. 
 Reviewers should be familiar with thehref="review-instructions" - guidelines for reviewing papers for VIS
. 
 Accessibility 
 We highly recommend screen reader accessible final submissions. Please see thehref="/year/2025/info/call-participation/make-pdf-accessible" - VIS Accessibility Guide
to learn how you can make your contribution accessible. 
 Open Access Policy 
 Visualization research is best communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, all paper authors are encouraged to share their accepted paper in an open-access repository in accordance with IEEE copyright regulations. We also recommend that authors include sufficient supplemental materials with their submission so that their work can be easily scrutinized and used or extended by future researchers and practitioners. For instructions on how to post an accepted paper to an open-access repository and recommendations on sharing supplemental materials, please see thehref="https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/info/open-practices/open-practices" - VIS Open Practices Guidelines
. Additionally, funding agencies and research organizations may have specific rules concerning Plan S compliance: impacted authors should check and comply with their respective organizational rules.Email:opc@ieeevis.org
