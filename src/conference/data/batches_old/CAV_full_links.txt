 About 
 CAV is the premier international conference on computer-aided verification. It provides a forum for a broad range of advanced research in areas ranging model checking and automated theorem proving to testing, synthesis and related fields. Research reported in CAV includes the application of formal methods to many kinds of systems,including hardware, software and communication protocols. It covers many system models, including finite-state and infinite state systems, hybrid systems and probabilistic systems. It encompasses both theory and industrial case studies. The common thread is the use of automation to help designers build more reliable systems. 
 CAV is held each year in July, and usually alternates between North America and Europe. It began as a workshop held in 1989 in Grenoble France. Subsequently, CAV was organized as a conference by Edmund Clarke, Robert Kurshan, Amir Pnueli and Joseph Sifakis. It has been held each year since 1990. A list of past and planned CAV conferences by year can be found below. 
 The current steering committee of CAV consists of: 
 Orna Grumberg, The Technion 
 Aarti Gupta, Princeton University 
 Daniel Kröning, University of Oxford 
 Ken McMillan, UT Austin
