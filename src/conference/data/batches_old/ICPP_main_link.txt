 September 8 -11, 2025 
 54th International Conference on ParallelProcessing 
 at TheCatamaran Resort HotelSan Diego, CA 
 In cooperation with: 
 The International Conference on Parallel Processing (ICPP) is one of the oldest continuously running computer science conferences in parallel computing in the world. It is a premier forum for researchers, scientists, and practitioners in academia, industry, and government to present their latest research findings in all aspects of the field. 
  
 The conference theme this year is “Looking Ahead in a Changing Landscape”, highlighting the opportunities and changes taking place under the influence of AI and quantum computing and creating collaborative opportunities within our multidisciplinary community. 
 ICPP 2025 will be organized around eight tracks which includes System Architecture & Hardware Components, Programming Environments & System Software, Multidisciplinary, Algorithms, Performance, Application & Use cases, AI in Computing and Quantum Computing.
