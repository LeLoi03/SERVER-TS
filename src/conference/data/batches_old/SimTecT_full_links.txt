 Simulation Australasia Affiliation 
  
 Share |FacebookXEmailLinkedInJune 23, 2015 - Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.SimGHOSTS, aka the Gathering of Healthcare Simulation Technology Specialists, a 501(c)(3) non profit organization based out of the United States announced an affiliation agreement with Australia-based Simulation Australasia. SimGHOSTS Executive Director James Cypert said of the agreement "We are excited to be directly connecting and collaborating with the Simulation Australia organization, which innovating not just the industry of healthcare simulation, but the global simulation industry as a whole. There is a clear need for SimGHOSTS to explore and learn from the many industries operating simulation technology and Simulation Australia overwhelmingly provides this unique opportunity." 
  
 John Stewart explained of the new affiliation that "The SimGHOSTS executive team is rich with innovative energy and our organization looks forward to engaging with them and the global healthcare simulation technology community they serve". 
  
 Aims of this Affiliation: 
 Promoting each respective organization and their endeavors amongst relevant networks and wider communities through a variety of routes including traditional and online marketing methods 
 Sharing & developing new knowledge, skills and resources to benefit the respective membership communities of each organization 
 Providing opportunities for collaboration at individual, institutional and organization-wide levels 
 Enhancing the dissemination of innovations and solutions to community identified problems amongst members and the wider simulation community 
 Establishing pathways for professional development and recognition of the Simulation Technology Specialist in healthcare including training programs and research 
 About Simulation Australia 
 In 1994 the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) collaborated with industry and academic representatives on a Co-operative Research Centre (CRC) proposal for simulation-related research and development. While that proposal was not funded, project participants were enthused and decided to form an association, led by industry, to further the use and development of simulation in Australia. DSTO also hoped that such an association would manage a newly established annual simulation conference. 
  
 In 1996, after planning and negotiation, the Simulation Industry Association of Australia (SIAA) was formed. Its primary goal was to conduct an annual conference, which it did so. SimTecT is held in May/June each year. SIAA had a mission of advancing the research, development, and use of simulation technologies and practices in Australian industry, academia, and government. As SimTecT grew in size and interest in, and awareness of, simulation also expanded, and it became evident that being an ‘industry’ association was a limiting factor on growth and potential. 
  
 The Board undertook an extensive review of operations and future possibilities, and in 2010 SIAA became Simulation Australia whose vision is to be the – National Peak body for the simulation community in Australia and recognized as such by relevant decision-makers in government, business and education. 
  
 With the purpose of promoting – 
 The use of simulation for the benefit of providers, practitioners and users in order to increase the use of simulation in achieving organizational goals, for the advancement of Australia's economy and society.

 Healthcare Simulation Conferences & Workshops 
 Featured Medical Simulation Conferences 
 href="#aioseo-2025-general-clinical-simulation-conference-listings" - 2025 General Clinical Simulation Conference Listings: 
 ‌Healthcare Simulationconferences are an absolute must for healthcare professionals who seek to start or expand their institution’s clinicalsimulation programs. As there are very few educational pathways forMedical Simulationprofessionals, participation in healthcare simulation conferences likeSimGHOSTS,IMSHorINACSLis a crucial step in the development or expansion of the healthcare simulation institution’s program and development of individual and team members’ professional careers. 
 TheHow to Get the Most Out of Your First Healthcare Simulation Conferencearticle is a great article to read in preparation for a healthcare simulation conference attendance. The internationalclinical simulationcommunity is incredibly generous to share resources and help for other areas as required. Healthcare simulation conferences are an excellent way to be able to see what other clinical simulation professionals are up to, hot topics and new concepts and ideas. 
 Healthcare simulation conferences are also a great opportunity for those who work in clinical simulation to be able to showcase their work and receive feedback from renowned leaders in healthcare simulation. Presentation at a healthcare simulation conference allows individuals and teams the opportunity to be able to plan, prepare and deliver a number of different clinical simulation conference presentations such as talks and workshops. The ability to present in this manner takes a lot of practice and is a great skill to acquire. 
 Networking is one of the best parts of attendance at a healthcare simulation conference. Speak to as many people as possible to be able to meet new people in the healthcare simulation industry. Go to the conference with questions and interests at the forefront of mind to share and network with others over. Collect business cards and allow others to introduce other people of interest as well. Be brave and talk to a favorite speaker and share the impact that their presentation has had. There may be opportunities to link in with other centers forhref="https://www.healthysimulation.com/healthcare-simulation/research-journals/" - research
and collaborations to do with healthcare simulation. Be sure to express interest and ask questions. 
 There are plenty of fantastic global conferences coming up in 2024 that provide a range of focused healthcare simulation learning, networking, and vendor engagement opportunities, so save the dates for these special events listed below.
