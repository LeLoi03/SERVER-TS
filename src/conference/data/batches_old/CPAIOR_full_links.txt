About CPAIORThe aim of the CPAIOR conference series is to bring together interested researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) to present new techniques or new applications, and to provide an opportunity for researchers in one area to learn about techniques in the others. A main objective of this conference series is to give researchers the opportunity to show how the integration of techniques from different fields can lead to interesting results on large and complex problems. 
  
 Typically, papers presented at CPAIOR actively combine, integrate, or contrast approaches from more than one of the areas. High quality papers from a single area are usually also welcome. Finally, application papers showcasing CP/AI/OR techniques on innovative and challenging applications or experience reports on such applications have been strongly encouraged. 
  
 After a successful series of five CPAIOR international workshops in Ferrara (Italy), Paderborn (Germany), Ashford (United Kingdom), Le Croisic (France), and Montreal (Canada), in 2004 CPAIOR became a conference with the first meeting held in Nice (France) with more than 100 participants. In the subsequent years, CPAIOR was held in Prague (Czech Republic), Cork (Ireland), Brussels (Belgium), Paris (France), Pittsburgh (USA), Bologna (Italy), Berlin (Germany), Nantes (France), Yorktown Heights, NY (USA), Cork (Ireland), Barcelona (Spain), Banff (Canada), Padova (Italy), Delft (Netherlands), Thessaloniki (Greece), Zoom, Vienna (Austria), Los Angeles, CA (USA), Nice (France), and Uppsala (Sweden), while the upcoming meeting takes place in Melbourne (Australia). 
  
 Proceedings of this peer-reviewed conference are published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. In some cases, a selection of papers is published in a special issue of a journal after another round of reviewing. This has been standardized in recent years via a Journal Fast-Track reviewing process.

 The22ndInternational Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, 
 and Operations Research 
  
 Melbourne,Australia 
 November 10-13,2025 
 Co-located withhref="https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/" - ICAPS 2025
 
 The aim ofCPAIORis to bring together researchers fromConstraint Programming(CP),Artificial Intelligence(AI), andOperations Research(OR) to present new techniques, applications, and theoretical & practical insights from a wide array of problems, fostering opportunities for experts in one area to learn about techniques from the others. 
 The conference series also emphasises how the integration of techniques from different fields can lead to new results on difficult problems, encouraginginterdisciplinary collaborationandinnovative problem-solving. On that end, papers and presentations that actively combine, integrate, or contrast approaches from more than one of the areas are especially welcomed. High-quality papers from a single area, as well as applications showcasing CP/AI/OR on challenging practical problems, are also a focus of the conference series. 
 CPAIOR 2025is the 27th edition of the meeting (the first five of which were workshops), and the 22ndedition of the conference with formal published proceedings. Please check thehref="https://cpaior.org/" - website of the CPAIOR conference series
