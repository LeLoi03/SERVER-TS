InConference AnnouncementsISCO2024 
 Date:May 22-24, 2024 
 Venue:School of Mathematics at University of La Laguna, Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain 
  
 It is our pleasure to invite you to participate at ISCO2024,href="https://eventos.ull.es/111018/detail/isco-2024.html" - https://eventos.ull.es/111018/detail/isco-2024.html
. It is the coming edition of a series of meetings known as “International Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization” (ISCO). Previous editions were in Tunisia (2010), Athens (2012), Lisbon (2014), Vietri (2016), Marrakesh (2018), Montreal (2020) and Paris (2022). Each edition consists of a 3-day international conference on Combinatorial Optimization preceded by a 2-day doctoral school. The coming 3-day conference will run from 22 to 24 May 2024, preceded by a 2-day school on 20 and 21 May 2024. The venue will be the School of Mathematics at University of La Laguna (in La Laguna, Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain). 
 The aim of the ISCO2024 organizers is to create the best possible atmosphere in Tenerife to facilitate interaction between participants, selecting innovative submissions on all areas of Combinatorial Optimization to create an interesting scientific program, enriched with plenary talks by top motivational invited speakers, and complemented with attractive social activities. 
 Feel free to distribute this invitation to everybody that could be interested in Combinatorial Optimization. Scientific presentations in the conference must follow a submission process, where we accept two types of proposals. “Regular papers” (up to 12 pages, deadline is 31 December 2023) and “Extended abstracts” (up to 3 pages, deadline is 15 February 2024). Each submission will be evaluated by the Program Committee and will be answered (accepted or rejected) by 15 March 2024. An author of each accepted submission must be registered at ISCO2024 before 31 March 2024. Accepted Regular Papers with a registered author will be published in a pre-conference proceeding (LNCS by Springer). You can find example of accepted regular papers of previous ISCO editions inhref="https://link.springer.com/conference/isco" - https://link.springer.com/conference/isco
orhref="https://dblp.org/db/conf/iscopt/index.html" - https://dblp.org/db/conf/iscopt/index.html

ISCO (Integer Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization) is a biannual symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, stochastic optimization, graphs and combinatorics. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited. 
 Each ISCO conference is preceded or followed by a Spring School lectured by international Combinatorial Optimization searches. This school is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also opened to older colleagues.

 A bit of history 
 Thefirstissue of ISCO was held in Hammamet, Tunisia inMarch 2010. This first attempt gathered more than 200 participants in a beautiful mediterranean country. The plenary sessions as well as all the talks have shown the large spectrum of our Combinatorial Optimization domain. Pierre Bonami from University of Méditerranée, Gerard Cornuéjols from Carnegie Mellon University and Andrea Lodi from University of Bologna have given a Spring School on "Cutting plane methods for integer and combinatorial optimization". 
  
 A selection of short papers presented at ISCO 2012 has been published by Springer-Verlag in the Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics (ENDM):href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/15710653/36/supp/C" - ISCO2010 ENDM volume

ISCO (Integer Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization) is a biannual symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, stochastic optimization, graphs and combinatorics. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited. 
 Each ISCO conference is preceded or followed by a Spring School lectured by international Combinatorial Optimization searches. This school is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also opened to older colleagues.

 A bit of history 
 Thefirstissue of ISCO was held in Hammamet, Tunisia inMarch 2010. This first attempt gathered more than 200 participants in a beautiful mediterranean country. The plenary sessions as well as all the talks have shown the large spectrum of our Combinatorial Optimization domain. Pierre Bonami from University of Méditerranée, Gerard Cornuéjols from Carnegie Mellon University and Andrea Lodi from University of Bologna have given a Spring School on "Cutting plane methods for integer and combinatorial optimization". 
  
 A selection of short papers presented at ISCO 2012 has been published by Springer-Verlag in the Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics (ENDM):href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/15710653/36/supp/C" - ISCO2010 ENDM volume

 Thesecondissue has been moved to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea in Athens, Greece inApril 2012. This second conference has been organized with colleagues from the Athens University Of Economics & Business in the deep center of the famous town. From this conference, ISCO topics has been extended to Theoretical Computer Science aspects of Combinatorial Optimization. A Spring School was organized around "Mathematical Programming and Design of Approximation Algorithms" with lectures by David Shmoys and David Williamson from Cornell University, USA.

 href="" - What is ISCO?
ISCO (Integer Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization) is a biannual symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, stochastic optimization, graphs and combinatorics. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited. 
 Each ISCO conference is preceded or followed by a Spring School lectured by international Combinatorial Optimization searches. This school is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also opened to older colleagues.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Approximation algorithms 
 Branch-and-bound algorithms

 A bit of history 
 Thefirstissue of ISCO was held in Hammamet, Tunisia inMarch 2010. This first attempt gathered more than 200 participants in a beautiful mediterranean country. The plenary sessions as well as all the talks have shown the large spectrum of our Combinatorial Optimization domain. Pierre Bonami from University of Méditerranée, Gerard Cornuéjols from Carnegie Mellon University and Andrea Lodi from University of Bologna have given a Spring School on "Cutting plane methods for integer and combinatorial optimization". 
  
 A selection of short papers presented at ISCO 2012 has been published by Springer-Verlag in the Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics (ENDM):href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/15710653/36/supp/C" - ISCO2010 ENDM volume

 A special issue in2010 DAM special issuehas been published. 
  
 Thesecondissue has been moved to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea in Athens, Greece inApril 2012. This second conference has been organized with colleagues from the Athens University Of Economics & Business in the deep center of the famous town. From this conference, ISCO topics has been extended to Theoretical Computer Science aspects of Combinatorial Optimization. A Spring School was organized around "Mathematical Programming and Design of Approximation Algorithms" with lectures by David Shmoys and David Williamson from Cornell University, USA.
