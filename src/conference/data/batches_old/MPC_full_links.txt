 Graham Hutton 
 Professor ofComputer Scienceat theUniversity of NottinghamMy research interests are in themathematics of program construction. The aim of my research is to develop simple but powerful techniques for writing and reasoning about computer programs, by recognising and exploiting their underlying mathematical structure. Most of my work takes place in the context of functional languages such as Haskell and Agda. 
 I'm co-leader of the Functional Programming Lab, director of the Midlands Graduate School, an editor of the Journal of Functional Programming, and an ACM Distinguished Scientist. I've also served as vice-chair of the ACM Special Interest Group on Programming Languages steering committee chair of the International Conference on Functional Programming, program committee chair of the Haskell Symposium, and board member of the Haskell Foundation. 
 Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better.-- Edsger Dijkstra

 href="" - I'm from Glasgow in Scotland.  After completing a BSc and PhD at the University
of Glasgow, I spent a few years as a researcher in Gothenburg and
Utrecht, before moving to Nottingham where I am Professor of
Computer Science.  I'm married to the lovely Annette, and we have
two grown up sons.  In my spare time I enjoy cars, cooking,
board games, and restoring our house.

 Supports institutions of higher education to fund scholarships for academically talented low-income STEM majors and to study and implement a program of activities that support their recruitment, retention and graduation. 
 Supports institutions of higher education to fund scholarships for academically talented low-income STEM majors and to study and implement a program of activities that support their recruitment, retention and graduation. 
 Synopsis 
 The main goal of the S-STEM program is to enable academically talented, low-income students to pursue successful careers in promising STEM fields. Ultimately, the S-STEM program seeks to increase the number of academically promising low-income students who graduate with an S-STEM eligible degree and contribute to the American innovation economy with their STEM knowledge. Recognizing that financial aid alone cannot increase retention and graduation in STEM, the program provides awards to institutions of higher education (IHEs) not only to fund scholarships, but also to adapt, implement, and study evidence-based curricular and co-curricular[a]activities that have been shown to be effective in supporting recruitment, retention, transfer (if appropriate), student success, academic/career pathways, and graduation in STEM. 
 To be eligible, scholars must be domestic low-income students with academic ability, talent, or potential and demonstrated unmet financial need who are enrolled in an associate, baccalaureate, or graduate degree program in an S-STEM eligible discipline. Proposers must provide an analysis that articulates the characteristics and academic needs of the population of students they are trying to serve. NSF is particularly interested in supporting the attainment of degrees in fields identified as critical needs for the Nation. It is up to the proposer to make a compelling case that such a field serves a critical need in the United States. 
 [a]an activity at a school or college pursued in addition to the normal course of study. 
 S-STEM Eligible Degree Programs 
 Associate of Arts, Associate of Science, Associate of Engineering, and Associate of Applied Science 
 Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Engineering and Bachelor of Applied Science 
 Master of Arts, Master of Science, and Master of Engineering 
 Doctoral (Ph.D. or other comparable doctoral degree) 
 S-STEM Eligible Disciplines 
 Disciplinary fields in which research is funded by NSF, including technology fields associated with the S-STEM-eligible disciplines (e.g., biotechnology, chemical technology, engineering technology, information technology, etc.). 
 The following degrees and disciplines areexcluded: 
 Clinical degree programs, including medical degrees, nursing, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, physical therapy, and others not funded by NSF, are ineligible degrees. 
 Programs for STEM teacher certification or licensure currently covered by the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program (NOYCE) are ineligible for S-STEM funding. 
 Business school programs that lead to Bachelor of Arts or Science in Business Administration degrees (BABA/BSBA/BBA) are not eligible for S-STEM funding. 
 Masters and Doctoral degrees in Business Administration are also excluded. 
 Proposers are strongly encouraged to contact Program Officers before submitting a proposal if they have questions concerning degree or disciplinary eligibility. 
 The S-STEM program particularly encourages proposals from 2-year institutions, Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs), predominately undergraduate institutions, and urban, suburban, and rural public institutions.
