 Welcome to DAS 2024 
  
 Welcome to DAS 2024, the premier satellite workshop of the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR). Formerly an independent event, DAS now integrates seamlessly with ICDAR, symbolizing a significant milestone in the convergence of specialized focus with broader scholarly discourse within the field of document analysis. At DAS 2024, we envision a dynamic program that encapsulates the intersection of system-level perspectives and challenges in document analysis and recognition. As part of the IAPR workshop series, DAS 2024 promises to be a pivotal event, offering a platform for researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts to explore the latest advancements and exchange insights. Our agenda boasts keynote speeches by leading experts, alongside a diverse array of oral and poster presentations showcasing cutting-edge research achievements. Participants will engage in stimulating group discussions, led by esteemed professionals, fostering a comprehensive educational experience tailored to a broad academic audience. 
 Moreover, DAS 2024 will feature interactive sessions providing firsthand exploration of prototype systems, offering invaluable insights into their operational mechanisms and potential through live demonstrations. These sessions aim to address practical challenges while highlighting opportunities for innovation in document analysis and recognition. In essence, DAS 2024 serves as a beacon for the exchange of innovative ideas and collaborative discovery. By spotlighting the frontiers of current research and fostering a dynamic forum for academic and professional growth, our workshop sets the stage for the emergence of new technologies and methodologies in the field. We invite you to join us in shaping the future direction of document analysis and recognition at DAS 2024. Together, let us reaffirm its essential role in advancing global knowledge and information management.
