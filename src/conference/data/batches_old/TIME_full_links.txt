 Introduction 
 TIME has been for more than twenty years the only yearly multidisciplinary international event dedicated to the topic of time in computer science. The purpose of the symposium is to bring together active researchers in different research areas involving temporal representation and reasoning. The symposium also welcomes research papers on the related topics of spatial and spatio-temporal representation and reasoning. In the early years, most contributions came from the Artificial Intelligence community, but the number of contributions from other areas such as Temporal Logic and Verification and partly from Temporal Databases has been increasing in the last years. 
 More details about TIME and the previous editions of this symposium can be found via the following link:href="https://time-symposium.org/" - https://time-symposium.org/
. 
 Call For Papers 
 Topics 
 In this symposium, in addition to theoretical and practical work inArtificial Intelligence,Databases, andLogic and Reasoning, we invite submissions focusing on the development, deployment, and evaluation ofMachine Learning Systemsthat fall under the scope of the symposium. Such systems papers will be evaluated primarily on the quality of the empirical evaluation and reusability. Topics for TIME 2024 include (but are not limited to): 
 Spatial and temporal reasoning 
 Time in natural language processing 
 Reasoning about action and change 
 Complex event recognition and forecasting 
 Planning and planning languages 
 Ontologies of time and space-time 
 Belief and uncertainty in temporal knowledge

Authors:Sophie Pinchinat 
 AbstractDynamic Epistemic Logic is a modal logic dedicated to specifying epistemic property changes along the dynamic behavior of a multi-agent system. The models that underlie this logic are (epistemic) states together with transitions caused by events, the occurrence of which may modify the current state. We first develop a setting where the entire dynamics of the system starting from an initial state is captured by a single infinite tree, in a way similar to what has been considered for Epistemic Temporal Logic, and second go through the current state-of-the-art regarding strategic reasoning, with a focus on planning problems in this infinite structure.

Authors:Przemysław Andrzej Wałęga 
 AbstractI will introduce DatalogMTL - an extension of Datalog, augmenting it with operators known from metric temporal logic (MTL). DatalogMTL is an expressive language which allows us for complex temporal reasoning over a dense timeline and, at the same time, remains decidable. I will provide an overview of research on DatalogMTL by discussing its computational complexity, syntactic and semantic modifications, practical reasoning approaches, applications, and future research directions.

Authors:Johann Eder, Roberto Posenato, Carlo Combi, Marco Franceschetti, and Franziska S. Hollauf 
 AbstractSimple temporal networks with uncertainty (STNUs) have achieved wide attention and are the basis of many applications requiring the representation of temporal constraints and checking whether they are conflicting. Dynamic controllability is currently the most relaxed notion to check whether a system can be controlled without violating temporal constraints despite uncertainties. However, dynamic controllability assumes that the actual duration of a contingent activity is only known when the end event of this activity takes place. The recently introduced notion of agile controllability considers when this duration is known earlier, leading to a more relaxed notion of temporal feasibility. We extend the definition of STNUs to STNUOs (Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty and Oracles) to represent the point in time at which information about a contingent duration is available. We formally define agile controllability as a generalization of dynamic controllability considering the timepoints of information availability. We propose a set of constraint propagation rules for STNUOs leading to an algorithm for checking agile controllability.

Authors:Ivelina Stoyanova, Nicolas Museux, Sao Mai Nguyen, and David Filliat 
 AbstractThis article presents Open the Chests, a novel benchmark environment designed for simulating and testing activity recognition and reactive decision-making algorithms. By leveraging temporal logic, Open the Chests offers a dynamic, event-driven simulation platform that illustrates the complexities of real-world systems. The environment contains multiple chests, each representing an activity pattern that an interacting agent must identify and respond to by pressing a corresponding button. The agent must analyze sequences of asynchronous events generated by the environment to recognize these patterns and make informed decisions. With the aim of theoretically grounding the environment, the Activity-Based Markov Decision Process (AB-MDP) is defined, allowing to model the context-dependent interaction with activities. Our goal is to propose a robust tool for the development, testing, and bench-marking of algorithms that is illustrative of realistic scenarios and allows for the isolation of specific complexities in event-driven environments.

Authors:Periklis Mantenoglou and Alexander Artikis 
 AbstractComposite event recognition (CER) frameworks reason over streams of low-level, symbolic events in order to detect instances of spatio-temporal patterns defining high-level, composite activities. The Event Calculus is a temporal, logical formalism that has been used to define composite activities in CER, while RTEC_{∘} is a formal CER framework that detects composite activities based on their Event Calculus definitions. RTEC_{∘}, however, cannot handle every possible set of Event Calculus definitions for composite activities, limiting the range of CER applications supported by RTEC_{∘}. We propose RTEC_{fl}, an extension of RTEC_{∘} that supports arbitrary composite activity specifications in the Event Calculus. We present the syntax, semantics, reasoning algorithms and time complexity of RTEC_{fl}. Our analysis demonstrates that RTEC_{fl} extends the scope of RTEC_{∘}, supporting every possible set of Event Calculus definitions for composite activities, while maintaining the high reasoning efficiency of RTEC_{∘}.

Authors:Guillermo Badia, Carles Noguera, Alberto Paparella, Guido Sciavicco, and Ionel Eduard Stan 
 AbstractMany-valued logics, often referred to as fuzzy logics, are a fundamental tool for reasoning about uncertainty, and are based on truth value algebras that generalize the Boolean one; the same logic can be interpreted on algebras from different varieties, for different purposes and pose different challenges. Although temporal many-valued logics, that is, the many-valued counterpart of popular temporal logics, have received little attention in the literature, the many-valued generalization of Halpern and Shoham’s interval temporal logic has been recently introduced and studied, and a sound and complete tableau system for it has been presented for the case in which it is interpreted on some finite Heyting algebra. In this paper, we take a step further in this inquiry by exploring a tableau system for Halpern and Shoham’s interval temporal logic interpreted on some finite {FL_{ew}}-algebra, therefore generalizing the Heyting case, and by providing its open-source implementation.

 AbstractSimple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty (STNU) are a well-known constraint-based model expressing sets of activities (e.g., a schedule or a plan) related by temporal constraints, each having possible durations in the form of convex intervals. Uncertainty comes from some of these durations being contingent, i.e., the agent executing the plan cannot decide the actual duration at execution time. To check that execution will satisfy all the constraints, three levels of controllability exist: the Strong and Dynamic Controllability (SC/DC) has proven both useful in practice and provable in polynomial time, while Weak Controllability (WC) is co-NP-complete and has been left aside. Moreover, controllability checking algorithms are propagation strategies, which have the usual drawback, in case of failure, to prove unable to locate the contingents that explain the source of non-controllability. This paper has three contributions: (1) it substantiates the usefulness of WC in multi-agent systems (MAS) where another agent controls a contingent, and agents agree just before execution on the durations; (2) it provides a new WC-checking algorithm whose performance in practice depends on the network structure and is faster in loosely connected ones; (3) it provides the failing cycles in the network that explain non-WC.

Authors:Luke Hunsberger and Roberto Posenato 
 AbstractTemporal constraint networks are data structures for representing and reasoning about time (e.g., temporal constraints among actions in a plan). Finding and computing negative cycles in temporal networks is important for planning and scheduling applications since it is the first step toward resolving inconsistent networks. For Simple Temporal Networks (STNs), the problem reduces to finding simple negative cycles (i.e., no repeat nodes), resulting in numerous efficient algorithms. For Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty (STNUs), which accommodate actions with uncertain durations, the situation is more complex because the characteristic of a non-dynamically controllable (non-DC) network is a so-called semi-reducible negative (SRN) cycle, which can have repeat edges and, in the worst case, an exponential number of occurrences of such edges. Algorithms for computing SRN cycles in non-DC STNUs that have been presented so far are based on older, less efficient DC-checking algorithms. In addition, the issue of repeated edges has either been ignored or given scant attention. This paper presents a new, faster algorithm for identifying SRN cycles in non-DC STNUs. Its worst-case time complexity is O(mn + k²n + knlog n), where n is the number of timepoints, m is the number of constraints, and k is the number of actions with uncertain durations. This complexity is the same as that of the fastest DC-checking algorithm for STNUs. It avoids an exponential blow-up by efficiently dealing with repeated structures and outputting a compact representation of the SRN cycle it finds. The space required to compactly store accumulated path information while avoiding redundant storage of repeated edges is O(mk + k²n). An empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the new algorithm on an existing benchmark.

 AbstractWe provide a unified framework in which the three emotions at the heart of narrative tension (curiosity, suspense and surprise) are formalized. This framework is built on non-monotonic reasoning which allows us to compactly represent the default behavior of the world and to simulate the affective evolution of an agent receiving a story. After formalizing the notions of awareness, curiosity, surprise and suspense, we explore the properties induced by our definitions and study the computational complexity of detecting them. We finally propose means to evaluate these emotions’ intensity for a given agent listening to a story.

Authors:Luke Hunsberger and Roberto Posenato 
 AbstractA Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) is a data structure for representing and reasoning about temporal constraints on activities, including those with uncertain durations. An STNU is dispatchable if it can be flexibly and efficiently executed in real time while guaranteeing that all relevant constraints are satisfied. The number of edges in a dispatchable network affects the computational work that must be done during real-time execution. Recent work presented an O(k n³)-time algorithm for converting a dispatchable STNU into an equivalent dispatchable network having a minimal number of edges, where n is the number of timepoints and k is the number of actions with uncertain durations. This paper presents a modification of that algorithm, making it an order of magnitude faster, down to O(n³). Given that in typical applications k = O(n), this represents an effective order-of-magnitude reduction from O(n⁴) to O(n³).

Authors:Luke Hunsberger and Roberto Posenato 
 AbstractA Probabilistic Simple Temporal Network (PSTN) is a formalism for representing and reasoning about actions subject to temporal constraints, where some action durations may be uncontrollable, modeled using continuous probability density functions. Recent work aims to manage this kind of uncertainty during execution by approximating a PSTN by a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) (for which well-known execution strategies exist) and using an STNU execution strategy to execute the PSTN, hoping that its probabilistic action durations will not cause any constraint violations. This paper presents significant improvements to the robust execution of PSTNs. Our approach is based on a recent, faster algorithm for finding negative cycles in non-DC STNUs. We also formally prove that many of the constraints included in others' work are unnecessary and that our algorithm can take advantage of a flexible real-time execution algorithm to react to observations of contingent durations that may fall outside the fixed STNU bounds. The paper presents an empirical evaluation of our approach that provides evidence of its effectiveness in robustly executing PSTNs derived from a publicly available benchmark.

Authors:Ajdin Sumic, Thierry Vidal, Andrea Micheli, and Alessandro Cimatti 
 AbstractSimple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty are a powerful and widely used formalism for representing and reasoning over convex temporal constraints in the presence of uncertainty called contingent constraints. Since their introduction, they have been used in planning and scheduling applications to model situations where the scheduling agent does not control some activity durations or event timings. What needs to be checked is then the controllability of the network, i.e., that there is a valid execution strategy whatever the values of the contingents. This paper considers a new type of multi-agent extension, where, as opposed to previous works, each agent manages its own separate STNU, and the control over activity durations is shared among the agents: what is called here a contract is a mutual constraint controllable for some agent and contingent for others. We will propose a semantically enriched version of STNUs that will be composed into a global Multi-agent Interdependent STNUs model. Then, controllability issues will be revisited, and we will focus on the repair problem, i.e., how to regain failed controllability by shrinking some of the shared contract durations, here in a centralized manner.

Authors:Francesco Chiariello 
 AbstractIn this work, we present a novel approach to learning Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulae from event logs by leveraging statistical techniques from sequential analysis. In particular, we employ the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT), using Trace Alignment to quantify the discrepancy between a trace and a candidate LTL formula. We then test the proposed approach in a controlled experimental setting and highlight its advantages, which include robustness to noise and data efficiency.

Authors:Jean-François Condotta and Yakoub Salhi 
 AbstractInconsistency measures serve to quantify the level of contradiction present within a knowledge base. They can be used for both consistency restoration and information extraction. In this article, we specifically explore inconsistency measures applicable to Disjunctive Temporal Problems (DTPs). We present a framework that extends traditional propositional logic approaches to DTPs, incorporating both new postulates and adaptations of existing ones. We identify and elaborate on various properties that establish relationships among these postulates. Furthermore, we introduce multiple inconsistency measures, adopting both a conventional approach that particularly leverages Minimal Inconsistent Subsets and a DTP-specific strategy based on constraint relaxation. Finally, we show the applicability of the inconsistency measures in DTPs through two real-world applications.

Authors:Eric Alsmann and Florian Bruse 
 AbstractHigher-Order Recursion Schemes (HORS) have long been studied as a tool to model functional programs. Model-checking the tree generated by a HORS of order k against a parity automaton is known to be k-EXPTIME-complete. This paper introduces timed HORS, a real-time version of HORS in the sense of Alur/Dill'90, to be model-checked against a pair of a parity automaton and a timed automaton. We show that adding dense linear time to the notion of recursion schemes adds one exponential to the cost of model-checking, i.e., model-checking a timed HORS of order k can be done in (k+1)-EXPTIME. This is shown by an adaption of the region-graph construction known from the model-checking of timed CTL. We also obtain a hardness result for k = 1, but we strongly conjecture that it holds for all k. This result is obtained by encoding runs of 2-EXPTIME Turing machines into the trees generated by timed HORS.

Authors:Ibrahim Delibasoglu and Fredrik Heintz 
 AbstractAnomaly detection in time series data is a critical task in various domains, including finance, healthcare, cybersecurity and industry. Traditional methods, such as time series decomposition, clustering, and density estimation, have provided robust solutions for identifying anomalies that exhibit distinct patterns or significant deviations from normal data distributions. Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning have further enhanced these capabilities. This paper introduces a novel method for anomaly detection that combines the strengths of autoencoders and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with an reconstruction error feedback mechanism based on Mean Squared Error. We compare our method against classical techniques and recent approaches like OmniAnomaly, which leverages stochastic recurrent neural networks, and the Anomaly Transformer, which introduces association discrepancy to capture long-range dependencies and DCDetector using contrastive representation learning with multi-scale dual attention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior overall performance in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score. The source code is available at http://github.com/mribrahim/AE-FAR

Authors:Massimo Benerecetti, Laura Bozzelli, Fabio Mogavero, and Adriano Peron 
 AbstractThe precise identification of the expressive power of logic languages used in formal methods for specifying and verifying run-time properties of critical systems is a fundamental task and characterisation theorems play a crucial role as model-theoretic tools in this regard. While a clear picture of the expressive power of linear-time temporal logics in terms of word automata and predicate logics has long been established, a complete mapping of the corresponding relationships for branching-time temporal logics has proven to be a more elusive task over the past four decades with few scattered results. Only recently, an automata-theoretic characterisation of both CTL* and its full-ω-regular extension ECTL* has been provided in terms of Symmetric Hesitant Tree Automata (HTA), with and without a suitable counter-freeness restriction on their linear behaviours. These two temporal logics also correspond to the bisimulation-invariant semantic fragments of Monadic Path Logic (MPL) and Monadic Chain Logic (MCL), respectively. Additionally, it has been proven that the counting extensions of CTL* and ECTL*, namely CCTL* and CECTL*, enjoy equivalent graded versions of the HTAs for the corresponding non-counting logics. However, while Moller and Rabinovich have proved CCTL* to be equivalent to full MPL, thus filling the gap for the standard branching-time logic, no similar result has been given for CECTL*. This work completes the picture, by proving the expressive equivalence of CECTL* and full MCL, by means of a composition theorem for the latter logic. This also indirectly establishes the equivalence between HTAs and their first-order extensions HFTAs, as originally introduced by Walukiewicz.

Authors:Massimo Benerecetti, Marco Faella, and Fabio Mogavero 
 AbstractWe study the problem of model checking linear temporal logic formulae on finite trajectories generated by polyhedral differential inclusions, thus enriching the landscape of models where such specifications can be effectively verified. Each model in the class comprises a static and a dynamic component. The static component features a finite set of observables represented by (non-necessarily convex) polyhedra. The dynamic one is given by a convex polyhedron constraining the dynamics of the system, by specifying the possible slopes of the trajectories in each time instant. We devise an exact algorithm that computes a symbolic representation of the region of points that existentially satisfy a given formula φ, i.e., the points from which there exists a trajectory satisfying φ.

Authors:Giorgio Lazzarinetti, Sara Manzoni, Italo Zoppis, and Riccardo Dondi 
 AbstractThe analysis and summarization of temporal networks are crucial for understanding complex interactions over time, yet pose significant computational challenges. This paper introduces FastMinTC+, an innovative heuristic approach designed to efficiently solve the Minimum Timeline Cover (MinTCover) problem in temporal networks. Our approach focuses on the optimization of activity timelines within temporal networks, aiming to provide both effective and computationally feasible solutions. By employing a low-complexity approach, FastMinTC+ adeptly handles massive temporal graphs, improving upon existing methods. Indeed, comparative evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms established benchmarks with remarkable efficiency and accuracy. The results highlight the potential of heuristic approaches in the domain of temporal network analysis and open up new avenues for further research incorporating other computational techniques, for example deep learning, to enhance the adaptability and precision of such heuristics.

 Simple temporal networks with uncertainty (STNUs) have achieved wide attention and are the basis of many applications requiring the representation of temporal constraints and checking whether they are conflicting. Dynamic controllability is currently the most relaxed notion to check whether a system can be controlled without violating temporal constraints despite uncertainties. However, dynamic controllability assumes that the actual duration of a contingent activity is only known when the end event of this activity takes place. The recently introduced notion of agile controllability considers when this duration is known earlier, leading to a more relaxed notion of temporal feasibility. We extend the definition of STNUs to STNUOs (Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty and Oracles) to represent the point in time at which information about a contingent duration is available. We formally define agile controllability as a generalization of dynamic controllability considering the timepoints of information availability. We propose a set of constraint propagation rules for STNUOs leading to an algorithm for checking agile controllability.Subject Classification
