 ICIW 2025: Call for Papers 
 Onsite and Online Options: In order to accommodate various situations, we are offering the option for either physical presence or virtual participation (pdf slides or pre-recorded videos). 
 The International Conference on Internet and Web Applications and Services continues a series of co-located events that covers the complementary aspects related to designing and deploying of applications based on IP&Web techniques and mechanisms. 
 ICIW 2025 comprises five complementary tracks. They focus on Web technologies, design and development of Web-based applications, and interactions of these applications with other types of systems. Management aspects related to these applications and challenges on specialized domains are aided at too. Evaluation techniques and standard position on different aspects are part of the expected agenda. 
 Internet and Web-based technologies led to new frameworks, languages, mechanisms and protocols for Web applications design and development. Interaction between web-based applications and classical applications requires special interfaces and exposes various performance parameters. 
 Web Services and applications are supported by a myriad of platforms, technologies, and mechanisms for syntax (mostly XML-based) and semantics (Ontology, Semantic Web). Special Web Services based applications such as e-Commerce, e-Business, P2P, multimedia, and GRID enterprise-related, allow design flexibility and easy to develop new services. The challenges consist of service discovery, announcing, monitoring and management; on the other hand, trust, security, performance and scalability are desirable metrics under exploration when designing such applications. 
 Entertainment systems became one of the most business-oriented and challenging area of distributed real-time software applicationsâ€™ and special devicesâ€™ industry. Developing entertainment systems and applications for a unique user or multiple users requires special platforms and network capabilities. 
 Particular traffic, QoS/SLA, reliability and high availability are some of the desired features of such systems. Real-time access raises problems of user identity, customized access, and navigation. 
 Particular services such interactive television, car/train/flight games, music and system distribution, and sport entertainment led to ubiquitous systems. These systems use mobile, wearable devices, and wireless technologies. 
 Interactive game applications require particular methodologies, frameworks, platforms, tools and languages. State-of-the-art games today can embody the most sophisticated technology and the most fully developed applications of programming capabilities available in the public domain. 
 The impact on millions of users via the proliferation of peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing networks such as eDonkey, Kazaa and Gnutella was rapidly increasing and seriously influencing business models (online services, cost control) and user behavior (download profile). An important fraction of the Internet traffic belongs to P2P applications. 
 P2P applications run in the background of userâ€™s PCs and enable individual users to act as downloaders, uploaders, file servers, etc. Designing and implementing P2P applications raise particular requirements. On the one hand, there are aspects of programming, data handling, and intensive computing applications; on the other hand, there are problems of special protocol features and networking, fault tolerance, quality of service, and application adaptability 
 Additionally, P2P systems require special attention from the security point of view. Trust, reputation, copyrights, and intellectual property are also relevant for P2P applications. 
 On-line communications frameworks and mechanisms allow distribute the workload, share business process, and handle complex partner profiles. This requires protocols supporting interactivity and real-time metrics. 
 Collaborative systems based on online communications support collaborative groups and are based on the theory and formalisms for group interactions. Group synergy in cooperative networks includes online gambling, gaming, and children groups, and at a larger scale, B2B and B2P cooperation. 
 Collaborative systems allow social networks to exist; within groups and between groups there are problems of privacy, identity, anonymity, trust, and confidentiality. Additionally, conflict, delegation, group selection, and communications costs in collaborative groups have to be monitored and managed. 
 Building online social networks requires mechanism on popularity context, persuasion, as well as technologies, techniques, and platforms to support all these paradigms. 
 During the last years, different web applications based on the use of Internet environments have been introduced to help teachers and students in the learning-teaching process. These web applications, mainly supported by Internet systems and services, are changing the traditional educational process not only in Higher Education (HE) qualifications, but also in open learning for any type of course. Nowadays, there exist different public and commercial Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) aimed at helping teachers to manage courses and contents, as well as to support the studentsâ€™ learning process. In this sense, VLE are an important factor contributing towards the change from traditional educational methodologies to new paradigms including active teaching. This implies not only a shift in the way of tackling learning and teaching, but also new challenges for software engineers and developers. Virtual Learning Environments have to be built bearing in mind their mandatory use through the Internet, thus requiring important characteristics and capabilities such as security, good latency, several tools for interoperability, storage management, etc. 
 Also, the age of information and communication has revolutionized the way companies do business, especially in providing competitive and innovative services. Business processes not only integrates departments and subsidiaries of enterprises but also are extended across organizations and to interact with governments. On the other hand, wireless technologies and peer-to-peer networks enable ubiquitous access to services and information systems with scalability. This results in the removal of barriers of market expansion and new business opportunities as well as threats. In this new globalized and ubiquitous environment, it is of increasing importance to consider legal and social aspects in business activities and information systems that will provide some level of certainty. There is a broad spectrum of vertical domains where legal and social issues influence the design and development of information systems, such as web personalization and protection of users privacy in service provision, intellectual property rights protection when designing and implementing virtual works and multiplayer digital games, copyright protection in collaborative environments, automation of contracting and contract monitoring on the web, protection of privacy in location-based computing, etc. 
 We solicit both academic, research, and industrial contributions. We welcome technical papers presenting research and practical results, position papers addressing the pros and cons of specific proposals, such as those being discussed in the standard fora or in industry consortia, survey papers addressing the key problems and solutions on any of the above topics short papers on work in progress, and panel proposals. 
 Industrial presentations are not subject to the format and content constraints of regular submissions. We expect short and long presentations that express industrial position and status. 
 Tutorials on specific related topics and panels on challenging areas are encouraged. 
 The topics suggested by the conference can be discussed in term of concepts, state of the art, research, standards, implementations, running experiments, applications, and industrial case studies. Authors are invited to submit complete unpublished papers, which are not under review in any other conference or journal in the following, but not limited to, topic areas. 
 All topics and submission formats are open to both research and industry contributions.

 There is a community providedLaTeX template: the CTAN packageiaria(with full IARIA formatting rules, including IARIA citation style, but for providing citation style it is tightly bound to pdflatex+biblatex+biber). In addition, there is alsoiaria-lite(not bound to pdflatex+biblatex+biber, but compatible with any TeX stack; thus, it cannot provide the IARIA citation formattings, but only the titlepage and content-related IARIA formatting rules). Based on the iaria package, there is a minimal working example asOverleaf template. When you are using the LaTeX templates, please still adhere to the additionaleditorial rules.
