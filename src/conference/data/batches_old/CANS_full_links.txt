About the conference 
  
 The International Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS) 
 is a premier forum for presenting research in the field of cryptology 
 and network security. The conference seeks academic, industry, and 
 government submissions on all theoretical and practical aspects of 
 cryptology and network security. This year marks the 24th iteration of 
 the conference and will be held at Osaka, Japan. Proceedings of this 
 year's conference will be published by Springer LNCS; proceedings of 
 previous iterations of the conference can be found online. 
  
 Submission guidelines 
  
 High quality papers on unpublished research and implementation 
 experiences may be submitted. All papers must be original and not 
 substantially duplicate work that has been published at, or is 
 simultaneously submitted to, a journal or another conference or workshop 
 with proceedings. All submissions must be written in English and span no 
 more than 20 pages in the Springerâ€™s Lecture Notes in Computer Science 
 (LNCS) format, including title, abstract, and bibliography. The 
 introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level 
 understandable by a non-expert reader and explain the context to related 
 work. 
 Submitted papers may contain supplementary material in the form of 
 well-marked appendices or a separate file archive (particularly for 
 source code, data files, etc.). Note that supplementary material will 
 not be included in the proceedings. Moreover, the main paper should be 
 intelligible without requiring the reader to consult the supplementary 
 material; the reviewers may optionally refer to the supplementary 
 material, but are also permitted to base their assessment on the main 
 paper alone. 
  
 Submissions must be anonymous (no author names, affiliations, 
 acknowledgments, or obvious references). The conference will also 
 consider short papers of up to eight pages in the LNCS format, excluding 
 the bibliography (max 2 pages), for results that are not yet fully 
 fleshed out or that simply require fewer pages to describe but still 
 make a significant contribution. 
 All submissions must be processed with LaTeX2e according to the 
 instructions given by Springer. Submitted manuscripts must be typeset in 
 plain Springer LNCS format, in particular without changing the font 
 size, margins or line spacing. Submissions not meeting these guidelines 
 may be rejected without consideration of their merits. 
 Papers must be submitted via EasyChair. The deadline for submissions is 
 17 April anywhere on earth (AoE). 
  
 Important dates 
 Submission: 17 April AoE. Papers must be submitted via EasyChair. 
 Notification: 10 July 
 Camera-ready: 14 August 
 Conference: 17â€“20 November 
  
 Presentation requirements 
 At least one author of every accepted paper must register and pay the 
 full registration fee (non-student) for the conference by the early 
 registration deadline indicated by the organizers. Papers without a 
 registered author will be removed from the sessions. Authors must 
 present their own paper(s). Session proceedings, including all accepted 
 papers, will be published in LNCS and will be available at the 
 conference.
