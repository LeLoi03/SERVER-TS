IEEE VIS: Visualization & Visual Analytics 
 November 2 to 7inVienna, AustriaWelcome to IEEE VIS 2025 
 IEEE VIS 2025 will be the year’s premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics. The conference will convene an international community of researchers and practitioners from universities, government, and industry to exchange recent findings on the design and use of visualization tools. 
 In 2025, the conference is again moving to the old continent, and we cannot wait to welcome you to the heart of Europe in the beautiful city of Vienna! Vienna is awelcoming hostthat excels at traditional hospitality, and a highly efficient modern city. It is a major urban center but still has the largest proportion of green space of any large European city. In addition to the well-known cultural highlights, the capital’s outstanding infrastructure sets Vienna apart as a remarkably clean and safe city. The public transportation network and short walking distances between attractions mean it takes no time to get around, with some of Europe’s most beautiful sights and the finest culinary delicacies around every corner. Sustainability is a key factor - from renewable energy forms and the outstanding drinking water fresh from the city’s taps. Like many other events in Vienna, VIS 2025 will be certified as agreen meeting. 
 We will do our best to plan an extraordinary experience for you and will cheer together for IEEE VIS’ past and future!
