 Saikat Dutta 
 I am an Assistant Professor in theDepartment of Computer ScienceatCornell University.My research interests are at the intersection ofSoftware EngineeringandMachine Learning. I am a member of the growinghref="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/research/software-engineering" - Software Engineering Group
at Cornell. 
  
 I received my PhD in Computer Science from theUniversity of Illinois Urbana-Champaignin Summer 2023, advised byProf. Sasa Misailovic. Before joining Cornell, I spent a year as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, working withProf. Mayur Naik. You can find my CVhref="papers/curriculum-vitae.pdf" - here
. 
  
 Prospective students: I am looking for skilled and motivated undergraduates, PhD students, and postdocs to join my group. If you are interested in working with me, please drop me an email. If you are a prospective PhD student, apply to theCornell CS PhD program.Also readthis. 
  
 Summer Internship for undergraduates:if you are looking for a research opportunity for summer please apply to the UIUC+ Summer Undergraduate Research in Software Engineering. Open to international students!Apply here. 
  
 Research Interests 
 My research interests are at the intersection of Software Engineering and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in 1) developing novel techniques and tools to improve the reliability of Machine Learning-based systems, and 2) leveraging Machine Learning to solve challenging tasks in Software Engineering. 
  
 My research focuses on following themes:Automated Test Generation and Debugging for Machine Learning libraries 
 [FSE 2018][FSE 2019]Using Machine Learning for Automated Software Engineering
