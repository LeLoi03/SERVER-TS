Network and Operating System Support for Digital Audio and Video (NOSSDAV) 
 NOSSDAV is a uniquely interactive and discussion-oriented workshop attended by top researchers, students, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss new ideas and future directions in multimedia applications, networking, operating systems, and other related areas of computing. Over the years, the scope of NOSSDAV has broadened to include networked games, sensor networks, multimedia interfaces and peer-to-peer networking. 
 NOSSDAV takes place annually and is co-located withACM MMSys. NOSSDAV is guided by the ACM MMSys Steering Committee.

 NOSSDAV is a workshop with a long-standing tradition focusing on both emerging and established multimedia systems research topics especially high-risk/high-return ideas. The single-track format brings together academic and industry researchers and practitioners to engage in fruitful and constructive discussions. NOSSDAV encourages papers identifying fundamental open problems in multimedia systems research, advocate new radical ideas or offer counterarguments or critique on the existing state of the art; NOSSDAV prefers exciting-even-if-incomplete papers or reports on promising ideas that may be supported by well-reasoned arguments. 
 NOSSDAV takes a broad perspective on all areas of multimedia systems. Authors are especially encouraged to submit papers with real-world experimental results and datasets. This includes new ideas relating to (but not limited to): 
 Virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR) and immersive systems 
 Deep learning approaches to improve multimedia delivery and processing 
 Cloud architectures for multimedia coding and processing 
 Wireless, mobile, IoT and embedded systems for multimedia applications 
 Medical, surveillance and autonomous driving multimedia systems 
 Network-distributed media processing 
 Networked GPUs/TPUs, graphics and virtual environments 
 Audio/Image/Video Analytics Systems 
 System Support for Multimedia Interaction with humans 
 Internet-Scale Multimedia Systems 
 Large-language Model and AI-Generated Multimedia Systems 
 Submission Process 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit an electronic version of full papers, in PDF format, up to six (6) printed pages plus one (1) page solely for references in length (double columnACM style format) at the workshop Web site.Authors must prepare their papers in a way that preserves the anonymity of the authors (double blind).Please do NOT include the author names under the title. The workshop proceedings will be published by ACM Digital Library.

 Assistant Professor 
 Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering 
 Rutgers University - New Brunswick 
  
 Email: yao.liu AT rutgers DOT edu 
 I joined the ECE Department at Rutgers University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2021. Previously, I was an Associate Professor (with tenure) in the Department of Computer Science at Binghamton University, State University of New York. 
 My research areas include Internet immersive streaming, multimedia systems mobile computing, and edge/cloud computing. My current work addresses system-level challenges in future immersive streaming technologies such as 360-degree and volumetric video delivery. I am a recipent of the NSF CAREER award (project page). 
 News:Our paper "Applying VertexShuffle Toward 360-Degree Video Super-Resolution" receivedBest Paper Awardat the 32nd Workshop on Network and Operating Systems Support for Digital Audio and Video (NOSSDAV 2022). 
 My PhD student, Chao Zhou, is a winner of Binghamton University'sDistinguished Dissertation Award. Congratulations Chao!
