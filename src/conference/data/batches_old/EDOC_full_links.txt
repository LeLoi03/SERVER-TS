International EDOC conference series 
 EnterpriseDesign,Operations andComputing 
 The EDOC conference series brings together leading computer science researchers IT decision makers, enterprise architects solution designers and practitioners to discuss enterprise computing challenges, models and solutions from the perspectives of academia, industry and government. The conference emphasizes a holistic view of enterprise applications engineering and management, fostering integrated approaches that can address and relate processes, people and technology. 
 Remembering Prof. Maria-Eugenia Iacob 
 The EDOC Steering Committee is deeply saddened by the news of the passing of Prof. Maria-Eugenia Iacob, an esteemed member of the EDOC community and full professor at the High-tech Business and Entrepreneurship Department at the University of Twente, The Netherlands. 
 Maria was well-known for her contributions to Enterprise Architecture. She co-authored the influential “Enterprise Architecture at Work” book, as well as many scientific publications pushing forward the field of Enterprise Computing. 
 She was a prolific author at EDOC, with about 30 contributions over the years. Among the many papers she published in EDOC, a key one in 2003 described the early results of the impactful ArchiMate project, while she was working at the Telematica Instituut (Telematics Institute). She started working at the University of Twente in 2006, to have more time for research, but also to educate and inspire students on the topics of Enterprise Architecture and Enterprise Systems Engineering. Her EDOC papers on these topics were often co-authored with her students. Many of her students became regular EDOC contributors after their graduation. Maria also served as EDOC workshops chair, and co-organized workshops at EDOC, e.g. the 3M4SE Workshop on Models and Model-driven Methods for Service Engineering. Her impact on the EDOC community is cherished and will be remembered. 
 We extend our condolences to her family, friends, and all those touched by her dedication and passion.
