 Conference Focus 
 ICS is the premier international forum for the presentation of research results in high-performance computing systems held since 1987. The focus of ICS is the high performance computers and computation: 
 Architecture including power-aware, parallel I/O, grid-based, web-based, continuous monitoring self-healing, fault-tolerant, embedded 
 Productivity including benchmarks, performance evaluation studies, specialized languages program development tools 
 Systems including compilers, operating systems, schedulers, runtime optimization 
 Applications including numeric and non-numeric, scientific, biological, industrial, massive sensory processing 
 Theoretical underpinnings of any of the above topics as well as analysis and experimental evaluation of systems. 
  
 The ICS 25th Anniversary Volume published by ACM can be foundhere. This volume contains the most influential papers presented at the conference in its first 25 years, together with the authors' retrospectives. It can be purchased from Barnes and Noble or Amazon.
