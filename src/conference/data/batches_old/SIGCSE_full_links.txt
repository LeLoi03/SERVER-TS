Welcome to Nijmegen 
 Nijmegen is a city in the east of the Netherlands. It is located close to the German border, and at the same time very well-connected with both the Dutch capital Amsterdam and the nearby national airport. 
 Nijmegen is the oldest city in the Netherlands, with a city center full of important historical locations. Nijmegen was founded by the Romans as an important base because of its strategic location. The city of Nijmegen is exciting, interesting, and has a turbulent history. 
 And it’s not just a rich cultural history that Nijmegen has to offer. Nijmegen is a lively city with many cozy restaurants, bars and terraces that give the city a young vibe. Furthermore, you can find examples of modern architecture. For instance, a spectacular water management project ‘Room for the River’ was completed a few years ago, involving a change of the course of the river and the creation of an artificial island. 
 Conference venue 
 The ITICSE 2025 conference will take place at Radboud University. The green campus of the university is located outside the city center of Nijmegen and is easily accessible by bike or public transport. Radboud University is a broad university where research and education go hand in hand. Students and staff members feel connected to each other, to society, and to the world around them. For the conference, we are happy to welcome you at the Faculty of Science, in the modern Huygens Building.

 SIGCSE Virtual 2024 
 href="#welcome-to-sigcse-virtual-2024" - Welcome to SIGCSE Virtual 2024!
The ACM Virtual Global Computing Education Conference (SIGCSE VIRTUAL) is organized by the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) and is the newest SIGCSE conference. Similar to the other SIGCSE conference, it addresses problems common among educators working to develop, implement and/or evaluate computing programs, curricula, and courses. 
 SIGCSE Virtualis a bi-annual online-only conference taking up the opportunities offered by the virtual space. It would be held in the September to December timeframe on the years CompEd is not held. Where CompEd prioritizes in-person attendance, SIGCSE VIRTUAL will only support remote attendance. The first SIGCSE Virtual will be held in Dec 2024 fully online.
