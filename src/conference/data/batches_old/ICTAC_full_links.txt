 About ICTAC 
 The International Colloquium on Theoretical Aspects of Computing (href="https://ictac.isp.uni-luebeck.de/about" - ICTAC
) was founded in 2004. It takes place every year preferably in a developing country. The aim of the colloquium is to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia, industry and government to present research results, and exchange experience, ideas, and solutions for their problems in theoretical aspects of computing. Beyond these scholarly goals, another main purpose of the conference is to promote cooperation in research and education between participants and their institutions, from developing and industrial countries.

 Scope 
 The ICTAC conference series aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to present research and exchange ideas and experiences within theoretical aspects of computing through methods and tools for system development. ICTAC also aims to promote research cooperation between developing and industrial countries. 
 Topics 
 The conference concerns all aspects of theoretical computer science, including, but not limited to: 
 Formal languages and automata 
 Semantics of programming languages 
 Logic in computer science 
 Lambda calculus, type theory, and category theory 
 Domain-specific languages 
 Theories of concurrency and mobility 
 Theories of distributed computing 
 Models of objects and components 
 Coordination models 
 Timed, hybrid, embedded, and cyber-physical systems 
 Security and privacy 
 Static analysis 
 Software verification 
 Software testing 
 Program generation and transformation 
 Model checking and theorem-proving 
 Theoretical aspects of quantum computing 
 Theory and methods of trustworthy AI 
 Applications and experiences 
 Publication 
 All accepted papers in categories will appear in the proceedings of the conference that will be published as a volume in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. 
  
 All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Their authors must be prepared to sign a copyright transfer statement. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference by the early registration deadline, and present the paper. 
  
 There will be a special issue for selected papers from ICTAC 2024 in theElsevier’s journal Theoretical Computer Science. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 We solicit submissions, related to the topics of ICTAC, in the following categories: 
 Full papersdescribing original research contributions 
 Short papersdescribing original work in progress, new ideas, and emerging challenges; and 
 Tool papersdescribing tools supporting formal techniques for software modeling, system design, and verification. 
 Submissions must not exceed 16 pages (excluding a bibliography of a maximum of 2 pages). Short and tool papers should not exceed 8 pages. 
 Submissions must not have been published or be under consideration for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged based on originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference’s topics. 
  
 All contributions to ICTAC 2024 have to be submitted electronically in PDF format via Easy Chair 
  
 href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac24" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ictac24

Papers must be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer LNCS papers (seehttp://www.springer.com/lncs), without modifications of margins and other space-saving measures. Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ instructions and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. 
 Venue 
 ICTAC 2024 will be held in Bangkok, Thailand, organized by the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT) and Leiden University. A two-day tutorial and training lectures preceding the conference will take place at the AIT campus in the north of Bangkok. The main conference will be held at the Berkley Hotel conveniently located in the heart of Bangkok.
