 Scope 
 The VECoS conference series focuses on the analysis of computer and communication systems, where functional and extra-functional properties are inter-related. VECoS encourages the cross-fertilization between the various formal verification and evaluation approaches, methods and techniques, especially those developed for concurrent and distributed hardware/software systems. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Abstraction techniques 
 Assessment for real-time systems 
 AI & Formal methods 
 Compositional verification 
 Correct-by-construction design 
 Data-driven testing 
 Dependability assessment techniques 
 Discrete-event and hybrid systems Modeling and Simulation 
 Equivalence checking 
 Model-based Security assessment 
 Model-checking 
 Parameterized verification 
 Performance and robustness evaluation 
 Probabilistic verification 
 QoS evaluation, planning and deployment 
 RAMS (Reliability-Availability-Maintainability-Safety) assessment 
 Rigorous system design 
 Security protocols verification 
 Supervisory control 
 Verification & validation of IoT 
 Verification & validation of safety-critical systems 
 Worst-case execution time analysis 
 Application domains 
 adaptive systems, cloud computing, communication protocols, computer graphics, computer vision, computer-supported collaborative work systems, cyber-physical systems, cybersecurity, high-performance computing, image processing, intelligent software, internet of things, learning-enabled systems, logistics systems, manufacturing of the future, mobile and wireless networking, operations research, programming languages, real-time and embedded operating systems, service-oriented systems, telecommunication systems, ubiquitous systems, web services, wireless sensor networks and workflow systems.
