 Achieving Digital Integration in the Age of AI 
 The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) presents both opportunities and challenges for organizations striving for seamless digital integration. ICIS 2025, themed “Achieving Digital Integration in the Age of AI,” invites scholars and practitioners to explore how AI can unify diverse digital systems, enhance interoperability, and drive innovation across industries, transforming the way we work, connect, and innovate. 
 Set against the dynamic landscape of Nashville – a city where technology, business, and entertainment converge – ICIS 2025 will highlight AI’s transformative impact on critical sectors, including fintech, supply chain and logistics, digital entertainment, social and media ecosystems, and healthcare. Through cutting-edge research, industry insights, and collaborative discussions, the conference will explore how AI is reshaping these sectors, creating new opportunities, and posing critical challenges. 
 Building on previous ICIS themes, ICIS 2025 will serve as a platform to advance our understanding of AI-powered digital integration and its role in shaping the future. 
 Submit your best upcoming work as completed research papers or short papers to ICIS 2025. The conference will also include Panels, Professional Development Workshops, the Digital Leadership Forum (formerly known as the CIO Forum), TREOs, and a Paper-a-thon, in addition to 25 tracks covering all areas of IS research.
