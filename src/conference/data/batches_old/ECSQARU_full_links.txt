 The 18th European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches to Reasoning with Uncertainty (ECSQARU 2025) will be held in Hagen (Germany), on September 23-26, 2025. 
 About ECSQARU 
 The biennial ECSQARU conferences (href="http://www.ecsqaru.org/" - www.ecsqaru.org/
) constitute a major forum for advances in the theory and practice of reasoning under uncertainty, with a focus on bringing symbolic and quantitative aspects together. Contributions come from researchers interested in advancing the scientific knowledge and from practitioners using uncertainty techniques in real-world applications. The scope of the ECSQARU conferences encompasses fundamental issues, representation, inference, learning, and decision making in qualitative and numeric uncertainty paradigms. 
 Previous ECSQARU events have been held in Arras (2023), Prague (2021), Belgrade (2019), Lugano (2017), Compiegne (2015), Utrecht (2013), Belfast (2011), Verona (2009), Hammamet (2007), Barcelona (2005), Aalborg (2003), Toulouse (2001), London (1999), Bonn (1997), Fribourg (1995), Granada (1993), and Marseille (1991).
