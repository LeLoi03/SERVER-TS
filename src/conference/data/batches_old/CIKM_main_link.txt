 Topics of Interest 
 We encourage submissions of high-quality research papers on the general areas of artificial intelligence, data science, databases, information retrieval, and knowledge management. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following areas:Data acquisition and processing (e.g., IoT Data, Data Quality, Data Privacy, Mitigating Biases, Data Wrangling, Data exploration, Data Preparation, Valuation, and Trading) 
 Data Integration and aggregation (e.g., Semantic Processing, data provenance, data linkage, data fusion, knowledge graph, data warehousing, data lake, privacy and security, modeling, information credibility) 
 Efficient data processing (e.g., serverless, data-intensive computing, database systems, indexing and compression, architectures, distributed data systems, dataspaces, customized hardware) 
 Special data processing (e.g., multilingual text, sequential, stream, time series, spatio-temporal, (knowledge) graph, multimedia, scientific, and social media data) 
 Analytics and machine learning (e.g., OLAP, data mining, machine learning and AI, scalable analysis algorithms, algorithmic biases, event detection and tracking, algorithmic interpretability) 
 Neural Information and knowledge processing (e.g., graph neural networks, domain adaptation, transfer learning, network architectures, neural ranking, neural recommendation, and neural prediction) 
 Information access and retrieval (e.g., Information Retrieval with Large Language Models, Question Answering and Dialogue Systems, Open-ended Question Answering Systems, Generation of Knowledge Graphs from Unstructured data, Retrieval Models, Query Processing, Personalization, Recommender Systems, Filtering Systems) 
 Users and interfaces for information systems (e.g., user behavior analysis, user interface design, perception of biases, interactive information retrieval, interactive analysis, spoken interfaces) 
 Evaluation (e.g., performance studies, benchmarks, online and offline evaluation, best practices) 
 Crowdsourcing (e.g. task assignment, worker reliability, optimization, trustworthiness, transparency, crowdsourcing in the era of large language models) 
 Mining multi-modal content (e.g., natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, content understanding, knowledge extraction, knowledge representations) 
 Data presentation (e.g., visualization, summarization, readability, VR, speech input/output) 
 Fairness, Ethics, and Explainability in Information and Knowledge Management (e.g., fairness, accountability, ethics, explainability) 
 Applications (e.g., urban systems, biomedical and health informatics, legal informatics, crisis informatics, computational social science, data-enabled discovery, social networks, education, business) 
 Generative AI for Data and Knowledge Management (e.g., GenAI for structured and unstructured data processing, GenAI for data synthesis and simulation, GenAI for information summarization, content creation, and visualization) 
 Resource Efficient Generative AI models for knowledge management (e.g., model compression, distributed learning, and leveraging edge computing to reduce computational overhead.) 
 Paper Submissions 
 Authors are invited to submit original, full-length research papers that are not previously published, accepted to be published, or being considered for publication in any other forum. Full-length papers should satisfy the standard requirements of top-tier international research conferences.Manuscripts should be submitted to CIKM 2025 Easychair site in PDF format, using the 2-column ACM sigconf template, seehttps://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. Full papers cannot exceed 9 pages, including an appendix, plus unlimited references (paper content is limited to 9 pages, that means that if you have an appendix, then it should be included within that page limit. It is also ok if you do not have an appendix and instead 9 pages of content). Rejected full papers will not be considered for publication as short papers. The review of manuscripts will be double-blind, and submissions not properly anonymized will be desk-rejected without review.Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, are prohibited unless this produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. AI tools may be used to edit and polish authors’ work, such as using LLMs for light editing of their text (e.g., automate grammar checks, word autocorrect, and other editing of author-written text), but text “produced entirely” by generative/AI models is not allowed.At least one author of each accepted paper must register to present the work on-site in Seoul, Korea as scheduled in the conference program.The official publication date is when the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 Dual Submission Policy 
 Submitting papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences (or any venue with published proceedings) is not allowed. However, it is allowed to make an abstract submission by May 16, 2025 (without uploading the paper PDF) for a paper that is still under review as long as the ongoing review process ends by the full paper final deadline of May 23, 2025. You need to withdraw your submission in case the paper is accepted or still under review by May 23, 2025.Authors are allowed to submit papers that have been presented or are to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Authors may also submit anonymized work already available as a preprint (e.g., in arXiv). In this case, the authors must modify the title and abstract while refraining from citing the manuscript to preserve anonymity. 
 Authorship Policy 
 Before paper submission, authors are advised to reviewhref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship" - ACM’s authorship policy
carefully. The full list of author names, including the ordering, must be finalized by paper submission deadline (changes can still be made after the abstract submission). There cannot be any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after the paper submission deadline.In submission, CIKM requires full disclosure of all use of generative AI tools in all stages of the research (including the code and data) and the writing. Any use of any GenAI tool requires a clear statement of the role and details on which parts of the research and paper writing were created with assistance from generative AI tools. For information on permitted use and required disclosure, see:https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/frequently-asked-questionsSubmissions will be checked for potential plagiarism both plagiarism detection systems and manually– including against concurrent conference submissions (i.e., RecSys, NeurIPS). 
 ACM Conflict of Interest Policy 
 All authors must adhere to the ACM Conflict of Interest policy. For full details, please visit this site: 
 https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest 
 Desk Rejection Policy 
 Submissions that fail to adhere to the anonymity, length, or formatting requirements, or violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty—such as plagiarism, author misrepresentation, or falsification—may be subject to desk rejection by the chairs. 
 ACM Policy Against Harassment 
 All authors and participants must adhere to the ACM Policy Against Harassment. For full details, please visit this site:
