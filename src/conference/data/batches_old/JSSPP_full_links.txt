 JSSPP Keynote was delivered byWalfredo Cirne (Google):href="./2024/Managing_Private_Clouds_with_Flex_ JSSPP_2024.pdf" - Managing Private Clouds
. 
 Abstract: This talk defines the Private Cloud Management program and presents Flex, Google’s solution for it. It covers how Flex makes Google’s easier to operate, as well as the key techniques used to make it more efficient. It also discusses how we preserve governance by charging internal users the resources they prompted Google to buy, in spite of aggressive resource sharing and on-demand allocation.JSSPP is on Slack
