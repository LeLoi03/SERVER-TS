 General call for paper 
 The 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025) will take place between July 22-26, 2025 in Palermo, Italy. 
 THE AIED 2025 THEME 
 “AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future” 
 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is progressing at an unprecedented rate, with generative AI and related technologies leading this transformative shift. These advancements are set to reshape education in significant ways, offering novel opportunities to enhance both teaching and learning processes. At the same time, more ‘traditional’ AI techniques continue to be developed, bringing in new insights. AI is expanding the horizons of what is achievable in education, enabling the creation of personalised and dynamic learning experiences. As these technologies continue to evolve, they equip educators with powerful tools to gain deeper insights into student needs, tailor instruction and resources to individual learning paths, and promote greater student engagement. AI is no longer merely an auxiliary tool — it is fundamentally transforming the core of educational practices, making learning environments more adaptive, accessible, and impactful. 
 The AIED 2025 conference, themed“AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future,”centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education. By harnessing AI’s capacity to personalise learning experiences, educators can address the diverse needs of students and mitigate educational disparities, particularly among underserved and marginalised communities. This year’s theme also underscores the critical importance of ethical AI integration, ensuring that these advanced technologies are deployed responsibly to uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and privacy. We welcome submissions that investigate how AI can act as a catalyst for cultivating a more equitable and inclusive educational environment, ultimately empowering both teachers and students in the pursuit of a more just and accessible future. 
 AIED 2025 will be the 26th edition of this conference series. The AIED Society, organiser of the AIED conference, aims at advancing science and engineering of intelligent human-technology ecosystems that support learning. The conference will be the latest of a longstanding series of international conferences, known for high quality and innovative research on AI-assisted systems and cognitive science approaches for educational computing applications.AIED is ranked A in CORE (top 16% of all 783 ranked venues), the well-known ranking of computer science conferences. AIED is a venue for researchers, decision makers, stakeholders and practitioners in the areas of AI in Education, and especially welcomes teachers and industry, particularly SMEs involved in AIED. Due to the growth of this important area, AIED 2025 is implementing for the first time a track-based system. 
 Discover the Tracks 
 We are excited that this year’s conference is moving to a new track-based system! To help potential authors in selecting what track to submit to, we will be hosting two recorded information sessions: 
 one on | Monday February 3rd | at 8AM Eastern Standard Time | / 1PM Greenwich Mean Time / 9PM China Standard Time 
 and one on | Tuesday February 4th at 8AM EST | / 1PM GMT / 9PM CST.

 Thus, for its main paper submissions, AIED 2025 solicits empirical and theoretical papers relating to both AI and education in the following lines of research and application, which represent our research tracks: 
 Track 1 –AIED architectures and tools 
 Papers submitted to this track should describe novel advances related to the engineering and development of AIED systems. Papers may be concerned with describing proof-of-concepts that demonstrate the feasibility of novel techniques, as well as real- world implementations that show the potential for reuse or adaptation by other researchers. Example research areas with applications in education include, but are not limited to, multi-agent architectures; tangible interfaces, wearables; speech technologies; virtual and augmented reality; A/B experimentation platforms. Innovative, domain-specific learning application architectures and tools also find a home in this track, for example, language, science, engineering, mathematics, medicine, military, industry, sports; scaling up and large-scale deployment of AIED systems. While papers may describe an evaluation of the system or tool with end-users, the primary scientific contribution of papers submitted to this track should be technical and systems-oriented. 
 Sample Keywords:AI system (e.g., tutoring systems, conversational agents, assessment systems, learning management systems, simulations), AI devices and tools, newly developed, proof-of-concept, feasibility studies 
 Track 2 –Machine learning and Generative AI 
 Papers submitted to this track should describe advances in or applications of AI-based techniques within education, involving knowledge representation and machine learning. Generative AI-based techniques are also welcome within this track. Data-driven processing techniques (including educational data mining, deep learning, machine learning) in education will constitute the main focus of this track. Example areas are natural language processing for education, video data mining for education, etc. Papers will likely address novel contributions related to modeling learner, teacher, and other stakeholder processes and outcomes, or contributions to representing learning domains. Evaluation techniques in this track rely on computational analyses related, for example, to the accuracy, validity, or reliability of predictive or generative models. While papers will likely describe evaluations on previous datasets or newly collected data, the primary scientific contribution of these papers will be to AI and its application. 
 Sample Keywords:classifiers, predictive models, learner modeling, learning analytics, LLMs, clustering, data mining, process data, deep learning, feature engineering/extraction 
 Track 3 –Learning, teaching and pedagogy 
 Papers submitted to this track should describe approaches to teaching, learning and evaluations of AIED systems and environments that relate to pedagogical techniques, learning processes, and outcomes, conceived broadly. Both quantitative (survey, correlational, comparative, experimental etc.) and qualitative (case study, ethnography, phenomenology, grounded theory, action research etc.) analysis, as well as mixed-methods approaches are encouraged under this paper category. AIED systems targeted here include, but are not limited, to: AI-assisted tutoring and scaffolding; Motivational diagnosis and feedback; Learner engagement/presence; Interactive pedagogical agents and learning companions; Agents that promote cognition, metacognition, self-regulation, co-regulation, motivation and positive affect; Adaptive question-answering and dialogue, Data-driven modeling (educational data mining, deep learning, machine learning,…); Learning analytics and teaching support, Learning with simulations; Explainability of models for teaching and learning. Learning targeted here refers to both formal and informal learning, including game-based learning; digital collaborative/cooperative and group learning; social networks; inquiry learning; social dimensions of learning; communities of practice; ubiquitous learning environments; learning through construction and making; learning grid; lifelong learning; learning in informal settings (museum, workplace, etc.); learning in the physical space; learning of motor skills. Evaluations here include studies on human learning. Learning spaces include massive open online courses; remote learning at any learning level including k-12 schools, higher education; synchronous, asynchronous, blended learning; mobile learning; active learning in virtual settings; video-based learning; mixed reality and learning. Papers may involve a novel system or a previously existing system, but the primary scientific contribution should be towards understanding the effects of the system and its features on learners, teachers, or other stakeholders. Studies where the focus of the research is fundamentally on the constructs of learning are suitable for this track. 
 Sample Keywords:Cognitive, behavioral, affective states of learners, pedagogy, effects on learner 
 Track 4 –Human-centered design and design-based research 
 Papers submitted to this track should address design principles for AIED systems or methods for designing such systems, as well as broadening understanding of contextual and individual factors that might informusers’ interactions with these systems. Papers submitted to this track can explore the design, use, and evaluation of human-AI hybrid systems for learning: research that explores the potential of human-AI interaction in educational contexts; systems and approaches in which educational stakeholders and AI tools build upon each other’s complementary strengths to achieve educational outcomes and/or improve mutually. Solutions explored in this trackinclude human-AI partnership: shared decision making between systems and users that promote agency and improve learning. Both quantitative and qualitative analysis user-centered design methods are encouraged under this paper category. Papers may involve the study of systems or prototypes that do not currently contain AI, as long as the primary purpose of the paper is to inform the design of AIED systems, putting the user (human) in the center. Evaluations in this track should focus on human-centeredness, or be a means to support human-centred design; or focus on the design and formative studies of AIED systems; in this context, they may include other aspects of the human side of human-AI interaction, such as on human cognition, affect, motivation, engagement, and attitudes. While these papers may also involve the development of a mockup for a new system, the primary scientific contribution should be towards human-centred design, or principles for the design of features of similar systems in similar contexts (as opposed to focusing on the technical implementation of a specific system). 
 Sample Keywords:human in the centre AI, human-AI partnership, human-in-the-loop, augmented or hybrid systems, humans in the decision-making/ design process, usability with human involvement 
 Track 5 –Teaching AIPapers submitted to this track should involve methods, principles, or technologies for teaching AI or supporting the development of AI literacy. This includes studies on skills and knowledge that enable individuals to understand, use, and critically evaluate AI; definitions of AI literacy; learning to use AI; developing a basic understanding of how AI works; learning to communicate and collaborate with AI; learning to live with AI, understanding limitations and problems of AI. This track especially welcomes work done by or in collaboration with teachers at all levels, from primary to university education. Papers in this track should preferably be based on empirical studies, including small-scale, classroom sized studies; although larger scale studies and theoretical contributions around the topic of teaching AI are also welcomed. Thus, the primary scientific contribution should be towards analysing or improving methods of teaching AI and development of AI literacy. 
 Sample Keywords:education about AI, teaching AI, AI literacy, critical reflection on AI applications, data literacy 
 Track 6 –Ethics, Equity, and AIED in SocietyPapers submitted to this track should take a perspective on AIED as it relates to society at different levels, more broadly, including the ethics of AIED, or designing AIED systems for a more equitable and just future. This includes AIED equity and inclusion-related theoretical or practical studies on socio-economic, gender, and racial issues; AI-assisted techniques to support students from under-resourced schools and communities; sponsorship, scientific validity, participant’s rights and responsibilities, data collection, management and dissemination. Additionally, it includes papers on ethics of AI in education, such as papers on explainability, transparency, accountability, and responsible AIED; learner consent and opt out; surveillance and privacy; the impact of AIED on teachers, learners and classrooms from an ethics perspective; teacher empowerment and student agency; the community’s responsibility for commercial applications; AIED ethical frameworks and principles for application. This track also includes AIED for development themes, such as leveraging AI technology to address and improve various aspects of development in societies and education, particularly in low and middle-income countries; AIED divide; AIED unplugged; Low-cost solutions; low-tech solutions; frugal Innovation; Jugaad Innovation. These papers may include systematic reviews of the literature or position papers on a particular issue. Both empirical results and theory are welcome in this track, with the primary contribution towards ethics, equity and society. 
 Sample Keywords:Bias, algorithmic fairness, privacy, transparency, data collection and reuse-analysis, ethics, population groups (gender, racial/ethnic groups, minorities, cultural differences), the generalizability of models, measurement issues and biases, equity, inclusion 
 Track 7 –Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modelling for EducationPapers submitted to this track should include conceptual or theoretical models, methods, knowledge representation, reasoning related to AIED research and AIED systems. Papers will likely address novel contributions related to theoretical aspects of modelling learners (including open learner models), teachers, and other stakeholders, contributions to representing learning domains or modelling the processes involved in AIED systems. Other areas include, but are not limited, to theoretical contributions and modelling of: facilitators, tasks and problem-solving processes; models of groups and communities for learning; modeling motivation, metacognition, and affective aspects of learning; ontological modeling; computational thinking and model-building; representing and analysing activity flow and discourse during learning; representing and modeling psychomotor learning. Expanding and evaluating cognitive, motivational and affective theories within AIED context also constitutes a target of this track. Papers in this track can further be using bottom-up and top-down approaches to analyse data, in order to inform motivational, learning, and cognitive theories, and gain better understanding of the socio-cognitive nature of learning. The primary contribution of these papers can be of empirical results analysing theoretical aspects, or direct contributions to theories and theoretical models applicable to AIED. 
 Sample Keywords:knowledge discovery, theory confirmation, theory modification about learning science, cognition, motivation, gathering empirical evidence with a heavy focus on theory, learner models, user models, domain models 
 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 The AIED Society values diversity, equity, and inclusion (and related principles under this broad umbrella) as essential and fundamental values for the AIED community to uphold. Thus, in AIED 2025, we encourage authors to: 
 Write with care toward inclusive language (e.g., understanding identify-first vs. person-first language, gender neutral language, appropriate demographic categories and terminology, and avoiding the conflation of distinct dimensions such as race and ethnicity, or sex and gender). 
 Report methodology including descriptions of sample characteristics (e.g., demographic data), any procedures for inclusive and representative sampling, any barriers to inclusive and representative sampling, and the ethical issues addressed both in the research methodology and the AIED approaches or tools being researched. For example, it is important to report the strategies used to control or reduce bias against populations of any kind (e.g. benefit or bring prejudice to a particular gender, race, or people with different economic status) when collecting, using, or aggregating data both for the research and for the AIED approach or tool being researched. 
 Consider how their theoretical frameworks and findings are related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. For example, authors may discuss how these issues influence key assumptions, hypotheses, and methods. 
 Address implications or appropriate interpretations of their findings with respect to diversity, inclusion and equity. 
 Submission Instructions 
 We invite the following main submissions to the conference, to be submitted directly to one of the above research tracks:

Short papers will be presented as short oral talks. 
 Submissions must follow Springer policies on publication (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process):https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v. 
 Please note that presenters ofpapers accepted to the main conference are expected to be on-site to give their presentations and to interact with the audience. An online streaming option will be set-up for remote observers. Scholarships are available for researchers who lack funding to present at the conference, see website for more information. Workshops may however run hybrid, at the discretion of their organisers (for further information, see their websites). 
 Papers accepted to be published in the conference proceedings must have a unique onsite author registration (i.e., one registration per paper). 
 Authors should note that following AIED 2024,there will be NO downgrade path from main submissions to posters. Authors whose papers submitted as main submissions are not accepted either as full or short paper are encouraged to revise and consider other submission types such as the late-breaking results or workshops. Note that due to the nature of the submission type,posters are to be presented physically at the conference; no remote presentation of posters will be allowed. 
 We will announce further details for other submission types within AIED 2025 including: 
 Blue Sky: position papers envisioning the future of AIED 
 WideAIED: papers on research and ideas toward widening participation in AIED (e.g. by social scientists, share experiences in the area, …). 
 Invited papers from the International Journal of AIED 
 Late-breaking results 
 Practitioners and Industry 
 Doctoral Consortium 
 Interactive events (e.g. demos) 
 Review Process 
 All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the program committee, followed by a metareview conducted by a senior member of the program committee (all double-masked) to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation. It is important to note that the work presented should not have been published previously or be under consideration in other conferences of journals. Any paper caught in double submission will be rejected without review. 
 Anonymity 
 The review process will be double-masked, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous. To this end, authors should: 
 Eliminate all information that could lead to their identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, projects and/or systems) 
 Cite own prior work (if needed) in the third person 
 Eliminate acknowledgments and references to funding sources 
 Data collection, reporting, and analysis 
 Authors should be clear and specific about the composition of human-sourced data. Who were the participants? What was the distribution of gender, race, ethnicity, or related variables? If corpus data or training data were sourced from humans, a similar description could be offered. 
 Skewed or non-representative samples would not necessarily trigger a “reject” decision, but authors should acknowledge the demographic imbalances and discuss the potential impact on data, results, or conclusions. A more compelling paper would describe steps taken to generate an inclusive and representative sample (this is basic science, but often overlooked for convenience). 
 Authors are encouraged to discuss/justify how demographic variables are included in the analyses. If they are not included or “covaried out” please justify. If they are included, what are the assumptions? Are there “categorical effects”? Are the effects of different demographic variables independent, interdependent, or intersectional? What valid conclusions can be drawn? What erroneous conclusions need to be avoided or tempered? 
 Ethics 
 Authors should demonstrate some awareness of how ethical issues (including but not limited to equity, inclusion, accessibility) impact their data, methods, tools, approaches, products, and findings. How are different demographic groups or communities differentially connected to the work? People who are developing educational technologies need to think about access and use, for example. Corpus analyses need to address the impact of skewed/exclusive datasets and potential outcomes (e.g., algorithmic bias). 
 Submission Procedure and Publication of Accepted Contributions 
 All submissions must be in Springer format. Papers that do not use the required format may be rejected without review. Authors should consultSpringer’sauthors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers.
