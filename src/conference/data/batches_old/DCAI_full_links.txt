 22nd International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence 
 University of Lille (France) 
 25th-27th June, 2025 
 href="https://www.dcai-conference.net" - www.dcai-conference.net
The 22nd International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2025 is an annual forum that will bring together ideas, projects and knowledge associated with distributed computing and artificial intelligence, and their application in different areas. This meeting will be held in University of Lille (France) within PAAMS'25, from 25th-27th June, 2025. 
 Nowadays, most computing systems, ranging from personal laptops/computers to cluster/grid/cloud computing systems, are capable of parallel and distributed computing. Distributed computing performs an increasingly important role in modern signal/data processing, information fusion and electronics engineering (e.g., electronic commerce, mobile communications and wireless devices). Particularly, applying artificial intelligence in distributed environments is becoming an element of high added value and economic potential. Research on Intelligent Distributed Systems has matured over the last decade and many effective applications are now being deployed. Artificial intelligence is changing our society. Its application in distributed environments, such as the Internet, electronic commerce, mobile communications, wireless devices, distributed computing, is becoming more widespread, and is becoming an element of high added value and economic potential, in both industry and research. These technologies are changing constantly as a result of the large research and technical effort being undertaken in both universities and businesses. The exchange of ideas between scientists and technicians from both academic and business backgrounds is essential to facilitating the development of systems that meet the demands of today's society. Technology transfer in this field is still a challenge and for that reason this type of contributions will be given special consideration at this symposium.

Distributed computing performs an increasingly important role in modern signal/data processing, information fusion and electronics engineering (e.g., electronic commerce, mobile communications and wireless devices). Particularly, applying artificial intelligence in distributed environments is becoming an element of high added value and economic potential. Research on Intelligent Distributed Systems has matured over the last decade and many effective applications are now being deployed. Artificial intelligence is changing our society. Its application in distributed environments, such as the Internet, electronic commerce, mobile communications, wireless devices, distributed computing, is becoming more widespread, and is becoming an element of high added value and economic potential, in both industry and research. These technologies are changing constantly as a result of the large research and technical effort being undertaken in both universities and businesses. The exchange of ideas between scientists and technicians from both academic and business backgrounds is essential to facilitating the development of systems that meet the demands of today's society. Technology transfer in this field is still a challenge and for that reason this type of contributions will be given special consideration at this symposium.

 DCAI'24: 21st International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence

 SCOPE 
 The 21st International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2024 is an annual forum that will bring together ideas, projects and knowledge associated with distributed computing and artificial intelligence, and their application in different areas. This meeting will be held in University of Salamanca (Spain) within PAAMS'24, from 26th-28th June, 2024. 
 Nowadays, most computing systems, ranging from personal laptops/computers to cluster/grid/cloud computing systems, are capable of parallel and distributed computing. Distributed computing performs an increasingly important role in modern signal/data processing, information fusion and electronics engineering (e.g., electronic commerce, mobile communications and wireless devices). Particularly, applying artificial intelligence in distributed environments is becoming an element of high added value and economic potential. Research on Intelligent Distributed Systems has matured over the last decade and many effective applications are now being deployed. Artificial intelligence is changing our society. Its application in distributed environments, such as the Internet, electronic commerce, mobile communications, wireless devices, distributed computing, is becoming more widespread, and is becoming an element of high added value and economic potential, in both industry and research. These technologies are changing constantly as a result of the large research and technical effort being undertaken in both universities and businesses. The exchange of ideas between scientists and technicians from both academic and business backgrounds is essential to facilitating the development of systems that meet the demands of today's society. Technology transfer in this field is still a challenge and for that reason this type of contributions will be given special consideration at this symposium.

 DCAI 2024 Conference hosted a Special Session supported by TECTONIC Project 
 TheUniversity of Calabria(UNICAL) recently participated in the International Conference “Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence” (DCAI’24), held in Salamanca from June 26 to 28, 2024. This prestigious event brought together experts and researchers from around the world to discuss the latest developments in distributed computing and artificial intelligence. 
 As part of the TECTONIC project, two PhD students on secondment from the Department of Biology, Ecology and Earth Sciences (DiBEST) of the University of Calabria had the opportunity to present their research in a Special Session of the conference, entitled “New Perspectives and Solutions in Cultural Heritage.” 
 Maria Pia Albanese and Martina Cirone respectively presented their research titled “Forensic Investigations for Discriminating Decontextualized Artifacts: Preliminary Data from a Research Project in Cultural Heritage” and “Biodeterioration and New Sustainable Conservation Strategies: The Case of Iblean Calcarenites in the Sicilian Baroque. Preliminary Results.” 
 The Special Session dedicated to the TECTONIC project and Cultural Heritage topics provided an important platform for networking and collaboration among researchers from various institutions, offering numerous opportunities to discuss future developments in the field. 
 The TECTONIC project continues its mission of promoting scientific and technological excellence, supporting young researchers, and contributing to the growth of the global scientific community.
