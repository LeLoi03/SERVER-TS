History 
 ICFCA, CLA and ICCS are three highly relevant conferences in the field of formal concept analysis (FCA) and related areas. All three conferences contribute significantly to advancing the understanding and application of formal concept analysis. In particular: 
 href="http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/program?id=1363" - ICFCA stands for the International Conference on Formal Concept Analysis . This conference serves as a platform for researchers working on formal concept analysis to present their latest findings, exchange ideas, and discuss advancements in the field. 
 CLA refers to Concept Lattices and Their Applications . This conference series primarily focuses on the theoretical foundations, algorithms, and applications of formal concept analysis and concept lattices. 
 ICCS stands for the International Conference on Conceptual Structures . While not exclusively focused on formal concept analysis, ICCS explores conceptual structures and related theories, including formal concept analysis, ontology, knowledge representation, and semantic technologies. 
 On October 2023, representatives of the three conferences approved the merging of the three conferencesICFCA,CLA and ICCSand creating a new joint event, theInternational Joint Conference on Conceptual Knowledge Structures (CONCEPTS).This merger aimed to create a unified and comprehensive forum for researchers, academics, and professionals from various disciplines interested in formal concept analysis, conceptual structures, and related fields to exchange ideas, present their research, and discuss the latest advancements in these areas. For this purpose, the overall organization of CONCEPTS will follow the existing rules and traditions of the three conferences.
