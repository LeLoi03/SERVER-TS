 ABOUT 
 Welcome to the 30th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC).The first IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications (ISCC ) was held in 1995 in response to the growing interaction between the fields of computers and communications. ISCC takes place annually, usually in the Mediterranean region, in locations such as Egypt, Cyprus, Tunisia, Portugal, Morocco, Italy, Brazil, France, and Greece. 
 This year (2025), the 30th IEEE Symposium on Computers and Communications will be held inBologna, Italyby the summer, fromthe 2ndtothe 5th of July. 
 ISCC sessions will include presentations on new research results and tutorials. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the computer and communications areas that the Call for Papers considers. Accepted papers will be included in the ISCC 2025 Conference Proceedings, which will be subject to independent peer-review procedures for quality, and may be eligible for inclusion in theIEEE Xplore® Digital Library. Merit, relevance, and originality will guide paper acceptance. Best Paper Award and Best Student Paper Awards will be presented. 
 IEEE ISCC 2025, in its 30th edition, will provide an insight into the unique world stemming from the interaction between the fields of computers and communications. IEEE ISCC 2025 will provide an international technical forum for experts from industry and academia to exchange ideas and present results of ongoing research in most state-of-the-art areas of computers and communications.
