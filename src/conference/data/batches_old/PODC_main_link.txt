 Paper submission 
 A submitted paper should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A submission should strive to be accessible to a broad audience, as well as having sufficient details for experts in the area. 
 Regular Papers:A regular paper must report on original research that has not been previously published. It is not permitted to submit the same material concurrently to journals or conferences with proceedings. Format and length requirements for submissions are stated below. All ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in a paper, including full proofs and experimental results, where applicable, should be included in the submission. 
 Brief Announcements:A brief announcement may describe work in progress or work presented elsewhere. A brief announcement may also report on original research results that can be fully presented in the limited space available. The title of a brief announcement must begin with “Brief Announcement: ”. 
 Submission format:All submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. 
 Alternatively, papers can also be submitted by using the official ACM Master article LaTeX template acmart.cls, version 1.80 or greater, using the following documentclass instruction: 
  
 \documentclass[acmsmall,nonacm,anonymous]{acmart} 
 The template is available athttps://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. 
 The following instructions equally apply in both cases. 
  
 Regular submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information (see paragraph on double-blind reviewing below), and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper’s contributions.There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the “full version” of their paper as the submission.Each submission should contain within the initial10 pagesfollowing the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. Each submission must contain full proofs of all claims in the paper.Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first 10 pages will be read at the committee’s discretion.Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. 
  
 Brief announcement submissions must have a length of at most 5 pages including title, abstract, and the references. 
 Submissions not conforming to the rules stated in this call, as well as papers outside the scope of the conference, may be rejected without consideration. 
  
 Best practices for citations: Alphabetical orderings of authors can lead to biases. Therefore, authors are encouraged to avoid “et al.” in citations, and instead mention all author names. 
 Double-blind reviewing 
 The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear anywhere in the submission. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC chair by email. 
 Conflict of interest 
 Indications of conflicts of interest will be required in the submission form. 
 A conflict of interest is limited to the following: 
 A family member or close friend. 
 A Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years. 
 A person with the same affiliation. 
 A person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
 Frequent collaborators, or collaborators who have jointly published papers within the last two years. 
 If you feel that you have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, contact the PC chair or one of the Theory of Computing Advocates affiliated with this conference (Faith Ellen and Idit Keidar). The PC chair may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for a conflict of interest. 
 Publication 
 Accepted regular papers of up to 10 pages and brief announcements of up to 3 pages in two-column ACM proceedings format will be included in the conference proceedings. They must be formatted with the ACM Master templates using 
 \documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}. 
  
 If more space than available in the proceedings for an accepted paper is needed, a full version must be available publicly, e.g. on arXiv, by the due date for the proceedings version, and the proceedings version must refer to this. 
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. 
 It is expected that papers that are published at PODC 2025 are presented by one of the authors in person at the conference. In exceptional circumstances (e.g., because of visa issues), a limited number of exceptions can be approved by the PC chair. A paid conference registration by one of the authors of each accepted paper will be required in any case. 
 Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of the journal Distributed Computing. Up to two selected papers will be considered for publication in the Journal of the ACM.
