 Scope & background 
 List of topics 
 Information for authors 
 Software systems are rapidly becoming more intelligent in the functionality they offer to users. They are also becoming more decentralized, with components that act autonomously and must communicate among themselves or with human users, to achieve their goals. Examples of such systems include those in healthcare, disaster management, e-business and smart grids. A multi-agent perspective is crucial to the proper conceptualization deployment, and governance of such systems. Rooted in solid computational and software engineering foundations, this perspective offers abstractions such as intelligent agents protocols, norms, organizations, trust and incentives, among others. As a large, but still growing research field of Computer Science, multi-agent systems today remain a unique enabler of interdisciplinary research.

 PRIMA 2025 invites submissions of original, unpublished work strongly relevant to Multi- Agent Systems. Apart from theoretical work, we encourage the submission of reports on the development of applications or prototypes of deployed agent systems, and of experiments that demonstrate novel agent system capabilities. In addition to this, we also encourage the submission of position and review papers that are of particular relevance to the multi-agent community. 
  
 Type of submissions: 
 Full papers, 16 pages plus references 
 Short papers, 4 pages plus references 
 Position papers, 2 pages plus references 
  
 The papers submitted must be in theLNCS format. All submitted papers must be in a form suitable fordouble-blindreview. Specifically, in order to make blind reviewing possible, authors must omit their names and affiliations from the paper. Also, while the references should include all published literature relevant to the paper, including previous work of the authors, it should not include unpublished works. When referring to one's own work, use the third person rather than the first person. For example, say"Previously, Foo and Bar [2] have shown that…", rather than "In our previous work [2], we have shown that…". Such identifying information can be added back to the final camera-ready version of accepted papers. 
  
 The papers can be submitted viahref="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PRIMA2025/Submission/Index" - CMT
. 
  
 All papers will be reviewed by at least 2-3 experts in the area following a detailed review form that will assess the paper based on the significance and novelty of the idea, the technical description of the proposal, clarity and organization, the evaluation methodology and any ethical considerations. 
  
 All accepted papers will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series (LNCS/LNAI).
