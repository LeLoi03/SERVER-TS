2025 ACM SIGMOD/PODS @Berlin, Germany 
  
 Welcome 
 Welcome to the home of the2025 ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference, to be held in Berlin, Germany, on June 22 - 27, 2025. 
 The Conference.The annual ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The conference includes a fascinating technical program with research and industrial talks, tutorials, demos, and focused workshops. It also hosts a poster session to learn about innovative technology, an industrial exhibition to meet companies and publishers, and a careers-in-industry panel with representatives from leading companies. 
 The Berlin Area.Berlin is the capital of the Federal Republic of Germany and is located in the heart of Europe. With 50 lakes, three rivers (Havel, Spree, and Dahme), and eight canals, Berlin is a water city with around 1,000 bridges, significantly more than Venice. The federal capital has about 3.9 million inhabitants and is Germany's number one cultural melting pot. People from all over the world have shaped the city. Nowhere else in Germany can you find so many world-famous sights, events, flair, charm, entertainment options, a vibrant nightlife, a vast shopping world, and boundless culinary diversity. 
 The Conference Hotel.The conference will be held at the InterContinental Berlin, a modern and internationally renowned hotel, distinctive with its checkerboard fa√ßade and one of the most famous hotels in Berlin. The location directly at the famous "Tiergarten" and just a short walk from the iconic Brandenburg Gate makes the InterContinental Berlin an exclusive starting point for exploring the multicultural metropolis. It is one of Germany's leading conference and event venues, providing an outstanding stage for events of all kinds. It was honored with the "Europe's Leading Conference Hotel" award at the World Travel Awards 2024.
