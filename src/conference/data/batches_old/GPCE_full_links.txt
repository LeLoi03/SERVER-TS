 Call for Papers 
 The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE) is a programming languages conference focusing on techniques and tools for code generation, language implementation, and product-line development. 
 href="#topics-of-interest" - Topics of Interest:
GPCE seeks conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and technical contributions to its topics of interest, which include but are not limited to: 
 program transformation, staging, 
 macro systems, preprocessors, 
 program synthesis, 
 code-recommendation systems, 
 domain-specific languages, 
 generative language workbenches, 
 language embedding, language design, 
 domain engineering, 
 software product lines, configurable software, 
 feature interactions, 
 applications and properties of code generation, 
 language implementation, 
 AI/ML techniques for generative programming, 
 generative programming for AI/ML techniques, 
 low code / no code approaches. 
 GPCE promotes cross-fertilization between programming languages and software development and among different styles of generative programming in its broadest sense. 
 Authors are welcome to check with the PC chair whether their planned papers are in scope. 
 Paper Categories 
 GPCE solicits four kinds of submissions: 
 Full Papers: reporting original and unpublished results of research that contribute to scientific knowledge for any GPCE topic. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography. 
 Short Papers: presenting unconventional ideas or new visions in any GPCE topics. Short papers do not always contain complete results as in the case of full papers, but can introduce new ideas to the community and get early feedback. Note that short papers are not intended to be position statements. Accepted short papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented at the conference. Short paper submissions must not exceed 6 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text ‚Äú(Short Paper)‚Äù appended to their titles. 
 Tool Demonstrations: presenting tools for any GPCE topic. Tools must be available for use and must not be purely commercial. Submissions must provide a tool description not exceeding 6 pages excluding bibliography and a separate demonstration outline including screenshots also not exceeding 6 pages. Tool demonstration submissions must have the text ‚Äú(Tool Demonstration)‚Äù appended to their titles. If they are accepted, tool descriptions will be included in the proceedings. The demonstration outline will only be used to evaluate the planned demonstration. 
 Generative Pearl: is an elegant essay about generative programming. Examples include but are not limited to an interesting application of generative programming and an elegant presentation of a (new or old) data structure using generative programming (similar to Functional Pearl in ICFP and Pearl in ECOOP). Accepted Generative Pearl papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented at the conference. Generative Pearl submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text ‚Äú(Generative Pearl)‚Äù appended to their titles. 
 Paper Selection 
 The GPCE program committee will evaluate each submission according to the following selection criteria: 
 Novelty. Papers must present new ideas or evidence and place them appropriately within the context established by previous research in the field. 
 Significance. The results in the paper must have the potential to add to the state of the art or practice in significant ways. 
 Evidence. The paper must present evidence supporting its claims. Examples of evidence include formalizations and proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, and case studies. 
 Clarity. The paper must present its contributions and results clearly. 
 Best Paper Award 
 Following the tradition, the GPCE program committee will select the best paper among accepted papers. The authors of the best paper will be given the best paper award at the conference. 
 href="#paper-submission" - Paper Submission
The submission page will be announced soon. 
 All submissions must use thehref="http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format" - ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format ‚Äúacmart‚Äù
. Be sure to use thelatest LaTeX templates and class files, the SIGPLAN sub-format, and 10-point font. Consult thesample-sigplan.textemplate and use the document-class\documentclass[sigplan,anonymous,review]{acmart}. 
 To increase fairness in reviewing, GPCE uses thedouble-blind review processwhich has become standard across SIGPLAN conferences: 
 Author names, institutions, and acknowledgments should be omitted from submitted papers, and 
 references to the authors‚Äô own work should be in the third person. 
 No other changes are necessary, and authors will not be penalized if reviewers are able to infer authors‚Äô identities in implicit ways. 
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM‚Äôs new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts. 
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. 
 For additional information, clarification, or answers to questions, contact the program chair. 
 ACM Artifact Badges (New!) 
 There as been quite some momentum in recent years to improve replication and reproducibility in software engineering. Starting the 2024 edition, we want to give authors the chance to apply for an ACM Artifact Badge. Even though the artifact submission is not mandatory, we recommend authors to submit their artifacts to reach a higher impact with their research. 
 Authors that want to apply for an ACM Artifact Badge are asked to add a brief paragraph in the ACKs section of their submission. The paragraph should indicate which ACM Badge is the submission aiming for (see ACM page linked below) and what is part of the artifact. The paragraph may be removed for the final version of the paper, if it is clear from the manuscript what constitutes the artifact. 
 The review of artifact badges will not be available during the author rebuttal period and received artifacts will be announced shortly before the camera ready version is due to by authors of accepted submissions only. Hence, artifacts for rejected submissions may not be reviewed at all.

 The two-day program of GPCE 2022 is over. Thank you very much to all attendees and contributors. The proceedings are available on ACM Digital Library. URL:https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/3564719 
 ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE) is a venue for researchers and practitioners interested in techniques that use program generation, domain-specific languages, and component deployment to increase programmer productivity, improve software quality, and shorten the time-to-market of software products. In addition to exploring cutting-edge techniques of generative software, our goal is to foster further cross-fertilization between the software engineering and the programming languages research communities. 
 Generative and component approaches and domain-specific abstractions are revolutionizing software development just as automation and componentization revolutionized manufacturing. Raising the level of abstraction in software specification has been a fundamental goal of the computing community for several decades. Key technologies for automating program development and lifting the abstraction level closer to the problem domain are Generative Programming for program synthesis, Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for compact problem-oriented programming notations, and corresponding Implementation Technologies aiming at modularity, correctness, reuse, and evolution. As the field matures Applications and Empirical Results are of increasing importance. 
 GPCE 2022 will be co-located with SPLASH, APLAS, DLS, SAS, and SLE. The conference will be hosted in Auckland, New Zealand. Any author who cannot travel is allowed to ‚ÄúZoom in‚Äù during the allocated slot.

 Call for Papers 
 The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE) is a programming languages conference focusing on techniques and tools for code generation, language implementation, and product-line development. 
 GPCE seeks conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and technical contributions to its topics of interest, which include but are not limited to: 
 program transformation, staging, macro systems, preprocessors, program synthesis, and code-recommendation systems, 
 domain-specific languages, language embedding, language design, and language workbenches, 
 feature-oriented programming, domain engineering, and feature interactions, 
 applications and properties of code generation, language implementation, and product-line development. 
 GPCE promotes cross-fertilization between programming languages and software development and among different styles of generative programming in its broadest sense. 
 Authors are welcome to check with the PC chair whether their planned papers are in scope. 
 Paper Categories 
 GPCE solicits three kinds of submissions: 
 Full Papersreporting original and unpublished results of research that contribute to scientific knowledge for any GPCE topics. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography. 
 Short Paperspresenting unconventional ideas or new visions in any GPCE topics. Short papers do not always contain complete results as in the case of full papers, but can introduce new ideas to the community and get early feedback. Note that short papers are not intended to be position statements. Accepted short papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented at the conference. Short paper submissions must not exceed 6 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text ‚Äú(Short Paper)‚Äù appended to their titles. 
 Tool Demonstrationspresenting tools for any GPCE topics. Tools must be available for use and must not be purely commercial. Submissions must provide a tool description not exceeding 6 pages excluding bibliography and a separate demonstration outline including screenshots also not exceeding 6 pages. Tool demonstration submissions must have the text ‚Äú(Tool Demonstration)‚Äù appended to their titles. If they are accepted, tool descriptions will be included in the proceedings. The demonstration outline will only be used for evaluating the submission. 
 Paper Selection 
 The GPCE program committee will evaluate each submission according to the following selection criteria: 
 Novelty. Papers must present new ideas or evidence and place them appropriately within the context established by previous research in the field. 
 Significance. The results in the paper must have the potential to add to the state of the art or practice in significant ways. 
 Evidence. The paper must present evidence supporting its claims. Examples of evidence include formalizations and proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, and case studies. 
 Clarity. The paper must present its contributions and results clearly. 
 Best Paper Award 
 Following the tradition, the GPCE 2022 program committee will select the best paper among accepted papers. The authors of the best paper will be given the best paper award at the conference. 
 href="#paper-submission" - Paper Submission
Papers must be submitted using HotCRP:href="https://gpce2022.hotcrp.com/" - https://gpce2022.hotcrp.com/

 Title: Language Design meets Verifying Compilers 
 Date: December 6th, 2022 
 Abstract: The dream of developing compilers that automatically verify whether programs meet their specifications remains an ongoing challenge. 
 Such ``verifying compilers'' are (finally) on the verge of entering mainstream software development. This is partly due to advancements made over the last few decades but also the increasingly significant and complex role software plays in the modern world. As computer scientists, we should encourage this transition and help relegate many forms of software errors to the history books. One way of increasing adoption is to design languages around these tools, which look, on the surface, like regular programming languages. That is, to seamlessly integrate specification and verification and offer something that, for the everyday programmer, appears as nothing more than glorified type checking. This requires, amongst other things, careful consideration as to which language features mesh well with verification and which do not. The design space here is interesting and subtle but has been largely overlooked. In this talk, I will attempt to shed light on this murky area by contrasting the choices made in two existing languages: Dafny and Whiley. 
 Best Paper Award 
 The Program Committee of GPCE 2022 has decided to give the GPCE 2022 Best Paper Award to: 
 Type System for Four Delimited Control Operators by Chiaki Ishio and Kenichi Asai (Ochanomizu University). 
 Reviewers‚Äô recommendation: ‚ÄúType System for Four Delimited Control Operators‚Äù introduces a language that incorporates four well-known control operators (shift, control, shift0, control0) with a new unified type system derived from a double-CPS interpreter. The reviewers appreciated the technical depth of the work, the thorough comparison to previous systems, and the well-structured exposition. One particularly impressive aspect of the work is the mechanization of the main theorems in Agda, which lends significant credibility to the results. The system is likely to serve as a useful basis for type systems that support additional control features such as answer-type polymorphism and algebraic effects." 
 Congratulations! 
 Yukiyoshi Kameyama, on behalf of the GPCE2022 Program Committee

 Exploring GitHub Actions through EGAD: An Experience Report 
 Published inInternational Workshop on Smalltalk Technologies (IWST 23), 2023 
 We present our experience developing and using EGAD (Explorable GitHub Action Domain Model) and share valuable insights we gained. Our focus is on three key areas: (i) onboarding of Glamorous Toolkit (GT), (ii) creating a comprehensive and explorable domain model of GA, and (iii) highlighting the potential of EGAD as a research workbench.
