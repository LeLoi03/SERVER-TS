 Overview 
 The aim of thehref="http://lopstr.webs.upv.es/" - LOPSTR series
is to stimulate and promote international research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively, friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress. 
 LOPSTR 2025 will be held in-person atUniversity of Calabriain Rende, Italy and will be co-located withhref="https://ppdp25.github.io/site/" - PPDP 2025

. At least one of the authors of an accepted paper is required to attend the conference and present the paper. Information about venue and travel will be made available later. 
 Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large, including, but not limited to: 
 synthesis 
 transformation 
 specialization 
 inversion 
 composition 
 optimisation 
 specification 
 analysis and verification 
 testing and certification

 Call for papers 
 TBAPAPER SUBMISSION 
 Submissions can be made in two categories: 
 Regular Papers (15 pages max.) 
 Short Papers (8 pages max.) 
 References will NOT count towards the page limit. Additional pages may be used for appendices not intended for publication. Reviewers are not required to read the appendices, and thus papers should be intelligible without them. All submissions must be written in English. 
 Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers/tools that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings. 
 Submissions of Regular Papers must describe original work. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC Chairs in case of questions). 
 Submissions of Short Papers may include presentations of exciting if not fully polished research or tool demonstrations that are of academic and industrial interest. Tool demonstrations should describe the relevant system, usability, and implementation aspects of a tool. 
 All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volume. 
 After the symposium, a selection of a few best papers will be invited for submission to rapid publication in the Journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). Authors of selected papers will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions to be considered for publication. The papers submitted to TPLP will be subject to the journal's standard reviewing process. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 Authors should submit an electronic copy of the paper (written in English) in PDF, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science style. Each submission must include on its first page the paper title; authors and their affiliations; contact author's email; abstract; and three to four keywords which will be used to assist the PC in selecting appropriate reviewers for the paper.Authors should consult Springer's author instructions at thehref="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" - author's page
, and use their proceedings templates, eitherfor LaTeX(available also inOverleaf) orhref="https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/conference-proceedings/editors/word-template/19338734" - for Word
, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include theirORCID identifiersin their papers.In addition, upon acceptance, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign aConsent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. 
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their report. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use: 
 \pagestyle{plain} 
 \usepackage{lineno} 
 \linenumbers 
  
 Papers should be submitted via EasyChair:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2025

 onUnsplashLOPSTR was founded byKung-Kiu Lauin 1991. It has taken place annually since. 
 The next LOPSTR symposium,href="https://lopstr.github.io/2025/" - LOPSTR 2025
, will be held in Rende (Italy) in September 9-10, 2025. 
 Its original title wasInternational Workshop on Logic Program Synthesis and Transformation, and the workshop was intended to focus on logic programs. The title was changed toInternational Workshop on Logic-based Program Synthesis and Transformationin 1998 to reflect a widening of its scope. It was changed toInternational Symposium on Logic-based Program Synthesis and Transformationin 2002. 
 Currently, the aim of the LOPSTR series is to stimulate and promote international research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any language paradigm. 
 LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively, friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress. 
 LOPSTR is usually co-located with PPDP (International ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming).

 PAPER SUBMISSION | Submissions can be made in two categories: | Regular Papers (15 pages max.) 
 Short Papers (8 pages max.) | References will NOT count towards the page limit. Additional pages may be used for appendices not intended for publication. Reviewers are not required to read the appendices, and thus papers should be intelligible without them. All submissions must be written in English. 
 Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers/tools that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal, conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings. Submissions of Regular Papers must describe original work. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC Chairs in case of questions). 
 Submissions of Short Papers may include presentations of exciting if not fully polished research or tool demonstrations that are of academic and industrial interest. Tool demonstrations should describe the relevant system, usability, and implementation aspects of a tool. All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volume. 
 After the symposium, a selection of a few best papers will be invited for submission to rapid publication in the Journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). Authors of selected papers will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions to be considered for publication. The papers submitted to TPLP will be subject to the journal's standard reviewing process. 
 SUBMISSION GUIDELINES | Authors should submit an electronic copy of the paper (written in English) in PDF, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science style. Each submission must include on its first page the paper title; authors and their affiliations; contact author's email; abstract; and three to four keywords which will be used to assist the PC in selecting appropriate reviewers for the paper. Authors should consult Springer's authors' instructions on the author's page, and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX (available also in Overleaf) or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, upon acceptance, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. 
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their report. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use: \pagestyle{plain \usepackage{lineno} \linenumbers

 OVERVIEW | Building on the ideas of Floyd-Hoare logic, dynamic logic was introduced in the 70's as a formal tool for reasoning about, and verify, classic imperative programs. Over time, its aim has evolved and expanded; DL can be seen now as a general set of ideas and tools devised for representing, describing and reasoning about diverse kind of actions, including (but not limited to) frameworks tailored for specific programming problems/ paradigms (e.g., separation logics), settings for modelling new computing domains (e.g., probabilistic, continuous and quantum computation), frameworks for reasoning about information dynamics (e.g., dynamic epistemic logics) and systems for reasoning about long term information dynamics (e.g., learning theory). 
 Both its theoretical relevance and practical potential make DLs a topic of interest in a number of scientific venues, from wide-scope software engineering conferences to modal logic specific events. The aim of the DaLí 2025 workshop is to bring together, in a single place, researchers with a shared interest in the formal study of actions (from Academia to Industry and more, from Mathematics to Computer Science and beyond) to present their work, foster discussions and encourage collaborations. 
 Previous editions of DaLí took place in Brasília (2017), Porto (2019), online (2020, 2022) and Tblisi (2023). 
 Submissions are invited on the general field of dynamic logic, its variants and applications. A more detailed topic description will be found in the webpage. 
 SUBMISSIONS AND PROCEEDINGS | We solicit two categories of papers: | Regular papers - describing original research results, case studies, or surveys, should not exceed 15 pages (excluding bibliography of at most two pages). 
 Short papers - describing original research results or case studies, maybe in an incubation phase, with 6 to 8 pages (excluding bibliography of at most one page). | Papers must be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer LNCS papers. All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. Papers can be submitted through Easychair: | href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dal2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dal2025 | A post-proceedings volume in Springer LNCS is being arranged. A special issue of the event with extended papers will be published in Journal of Logical and Algebraic Methods in Programming (Elsevier).
