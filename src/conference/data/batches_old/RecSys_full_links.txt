 Search:18th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems 
 Bari, Italy, 14–18 October 2024

The ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys) is the premier international forum for the presentation of new research results, systems and techniques in the broad field of recommender systems. RecSys brings together the major international research groups working on recommender systems, along with many of the world’s leading companies active in e-commerce and other adjacent domains. It has become the most important annual conference for the presentation and discussion of recommender systems research. RecSys 2024, the eighteenth conference in this series, will be held in Bari, Italy. It will bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their latest results and identify new trends and challenges in providing recommendation components in a range of innovative application contexts. In addition to the main technical track, the RecSys 2024 program will feature keynote and invited talks, tutorials covering state-of-the-art in this domain, a workshop program, an industrial track and a doctoral symposium. 
 Statement on Inclusion and Safety 
 As the organizers of RecSys 2024, we are committed to providing an inclusive, safe, and respectful conference environment for all attendees. As we increasingly realize the impact of our community’s work on society, we appreciate now more than ever the importance of providing an inclusive and accessible conference that brings together a diverse recommender systems community. 
 As an ACM conference, RecSys and its organizers, speakers, and attendees are bound by theACM Policy Against Discrimination and Harassment, which applies to both the conference venue and social media. As organizers, this is a policy that we fully endorse. 
 RecSys has made efforts over the last several years to be an accessible and inclusive community, across various perspectives, and we have sought throughout our planning of RecSys 2024 to continue and expand those efforts. The General Chairs (Pasquale Lops and Tommaso Di Noia) welcome your input. 
 Accessibility and Inclusion at RecSys.The RecSys conference values and cares about diversity, accessibility and inclusion. We have always been diverse in terms of disciplinary backgrounds (e.g. including both HCI- and data-focused work), professional affiliations (e.g. strong representation from both academia and industry), and application domains of our work. We are aware that members in our community may come from historically underrepresented groups, for which we wish to pro-actively encourage and support increased participation. To ensure the conference and its activities are accessible to all, we also explicitly seek to address the visible or invisible support needs members of our community may have. 
 Publications and Presentations.RecSys hosts a variety of scientific discussions. Historically, we have prepared guidelines for accessible and inclusive presentations. We would like to emphasize that inclusive, safe and respectful addressing does not only apply to conference presentations, but also to the whole process leading towards these presentations, including the way in which research is presented and reviewed. We therefore would like to encourage our community members to already keep our best practice guidelines on inclusive language in mind, when preparing their manuscripts and peer reviewing. 
 Contact.Should you experience or witness a violation of the anti-harassment policy, or have any other concerns regarding your ability to fully and safely participate in the conference, please email the RecSys General Chairs; you can also directly reach them at the conference venue. 
 We hope you have an amazing RecSys.

At least one author from each contribution must attend the conference in person to present their work and address audience questions during the Q&A/poster session. No pre-recorded videos will be permitted. Contributions that are not presented in person by an author—whether on the main stage, during a poster session, or at co-located events—may be removed from the proceedings at the discretion of the respective chairs.
