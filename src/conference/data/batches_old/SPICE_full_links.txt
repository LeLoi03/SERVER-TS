 Practical Experience in DevOps Implementation 
  
 Liliia Bodnar, Mykola Bodnar, Kateryna Shulakova, Oksana Vasylenko, Roman Tsarov and Eduard Siemens 
  
 Abstract:This scientific article serves as a comprehensive exploration of the amalgamated technical expertise derived from hands-on involvement in commercial projects. Its primary objective is to harmonize the training of upcoming DevOps engineers with the dynamic demands of the real-world market. The focus of our investigation lies in the intricate stages of сontinuous integration (CI) processes, meticulously shaped by the practical experiences of seasoned DevOps engineers. Delving into these stages, we unveil invaluable insights that extend their applicability to benefit both IT instructors and active DevOps practitioners. The elucidation of these stages is firmly grounded in the pragmatic utilization of a diverse array of DevOps practices. By drawing from the multifaceted experiences encountered in real-world scenarios, our article presents a nuanced understanding of the challenges and triumphs that permeate the field of DevOps. This nuanced approach not only enhances the theoretical knowledge imparted to future engineers but also provides a reservoir of practical wisdom that can be readily applied in professional settings. That is, оur undertaking encapsulates the core objective of bridging the disjunction between theoretical knowledge and practical application within the domain of DevOps.

 Modeling & Simulation SPICE 
 We are proud to announce that the Modeling & Simulation (M&S) SPICE v0.9 specification is now officially listed byiNTACS® – and available for free download in thehref="https://intacs.info/spice-center" - SPICE Center
! 
 Lack of trust in models and simulations essentially limits their usage and application. The aerospace industry started to tackle this problem 30 years ago and proposed some initial concepts, methods, and simulation maturity models. In the automotive industry, the development and approval of highly automated vehicles is requesting reliable simulations for virtual testing. Similar pathways can be identified in other domains, like in Rail or Healthcare, where regulators are essentially imposing specific requirements on models and simulations to be fulfilled. 
 Working Group for Quality Assurance 
 The above mentioned conditions put Modeling & Simulation into a new position and setting, and therefore also require new ways of doing and handling simulations. Quality assurance of models and simulations is substantial for (physical and data-driven) informed decision support as well as decision-making. 
 About a year ago, SETLabs established the iNTACS® Working Group “Modeling & Simulation SPICE.” This group comprises experts from organizations such asVIRTUAL VEHICLE,SEMP Consulting GmbH,VAIVA,TUV SÜD, andKnorr-Bremse. Together, they have successfully developed and published a specific Process Assessment Model for essentially building trust in Modeling & Simulation.

Quality Assessment Framework 
 The Figure below indicates the relation of M&S SPICE to the so called Credibility Assessment Frameworks for demonstration of quality-assured simulations, where M&S SPICE serves as a solid basis for quantification of modeling and simulation process capabilities (figure from M&S SPICEhref="https://intacs.info/component/rsfiles/download-file/files?path=SPICE%2BDocuments%252FModeling%2Band%2BSimulation%2BSPICE%252FModeling%2Band%2BSimulation%2BSPICE%2BPAM%2Bv09.pdf&Itemid=104" - v0.9 Specification
). 
 Instantiation of an application-specific Credibility Assessment FrameworkThe essential objective of the working group was to provide a domain-independent assessment model for structured application of Modeling & Simulation within the scope of model-based product development and operations. It builds on the Credible Simulation Process Framework (CSPF) from theprostep ivipAssociation and aligns with AUTOMOTIVE SPICE®. 
 At this year’s VDI ConferenceSIMVECin Baden-Baden, Martin Benedikt presented the embedment of the PRM into so-called Credibility Assessment Frameworks, providing a solid foundation for simulation-based decision support and decision-making.

 What is SPICE? 
 In the world of software, SPICE is not a flavor ingredient, but an abbreviation. It stands for “SoftwareProcessImprovement andCapability dEtermination”. 
 Originally, SPICE was a project funded by the European Union. The goal of this project was to develop a counterpart to CMMI – a systematic illustration of best practices to support the improvement of an organization.
