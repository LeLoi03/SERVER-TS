 A non-exhaustive list of relevant topics explored at the conference include: 
 unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning 
 representation learning for planning and reinforcement learning 
 representation learning for computer vision and natural language processing 
 metric learning and kernel learning 
 sparse coding and dimensionality expansion 
 hierarchical models 
 optimization for representation learning 
 learning representations of outputs or states 
 optimal transport 
 theoretical issues in deep learning 
 societal considerations of representation learning including fairness, safety, privacy, and interpretability, and explainability
