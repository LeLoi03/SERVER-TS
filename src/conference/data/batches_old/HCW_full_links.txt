 HCW 2025 
 The thirty-fourth Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop (HCW) will be held at the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, onJune 4, 2025. HCW is annually organized in conjunction with the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS). We are now inviting authors to submit original research in topics related to HCW 2025 by Sunday,February 9, 2025. Please see thehref="/cfp.html" - Call for Papers
for more details. 
 Heterogeneous computing systems comprise growing numbers of increasingly more diverse computing resources that can be local to one another or geographically distributed. The opportunity and need for effectively utilizing heterogeneous computing resources has given rise to the notions of cluster computing, grid computing, and cloud computing. HCW encourages paper submissions from both the research and industry communities presenting novel ideas on theoretical and practical aspects of computing in heterogeneous computing environments. 
 The proceedings of HCW 2025 will be distributed at the conference and submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library after the conference.

 ======================================================================== Call For Papers Thirty-Third IEEE Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop (HCW) to be held in conjunction with IPDPS 2024, May 27, 2024 San Francisco, Californiahref="https://hcw-ipdps.org/" - https://hcw-ipdps.org/
======================================================================== In conjunction with the 38th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS 2024) Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society through the Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP) Most modern computing systems are heterogeneous, either for organic reasons because components grew independently, as it is the case in desktop grids, or by design to leverage the strength of specific hardware, as it is the case in accelerated systems. In any case, all computing systems have some form of hardware or software heterogeneity that must be managed, leveraged, understood, and exploited. The Heterogeneity in Computing Workshop (HCW) is a venue to discuss and innovate in all theoretical and practical aspects of heterogeneous computing: design, programmability efficient utilization, algorithms, modeling, applications etc. HCW 2024 will be the thirty-third annual gathering of this workshop. Topics ------ Topics of interest include but are not limited to the following areas: * Heterogeneous multicore systems and architectures: Design exploration, and experimental analysis of heterogeneous computing systems such as Graphics Processing Units heterogeneous systems-on-chip, Artificial Intelligence chips, Field Programmable Gate Arrays, big.LITTLE, and application-specific architectures. * Heterogeneous parallel and distributed systems: Design and analysis of computing grids, cloud systems, hybrid clusters datacenters, geo-distributed computing systems, and supercomputers. * Deep memory hierarchies: Design and analysis of memory hierarchies with SRAM, DRAM, Flash/SSD, and HDD technologies; NUMA architectures; cache coherence strategies; novel memory systems such as phase-change RAM magnetic (e.g., STT) RAM, 3D Xpoint/crossbars, and memristors. * On-chip, off-chip, and heterogeneous network architectures: Network-on-chip (NoC) architectures and protocols for heterogeneous multicore applications; energy, latency reliability, and security optimizations for NoCs; off-chip (chip-to-chip) network architectures and optimizations; heterogeneous networks (combination of NoC and off-chip) design, evaluation, and optimizations; large-scale parallel and distributed heterogeneous network design, evaluation and optimizations. * Programming models and tools: Programming paradigms and tools for heterogeneous systems; middleware and runtime systems; performance-abstraction tradeoff; interoperability of heterogeneous software environments; workflows; dataflows. * Resource management and algorithms for heterogeneous systems: Parallel algorithms for solving problems on heterogeneous systems (e.g., multicores, hybrid clusters grids, or clouds); strategies for scheduling and allocation on heterogeneous 2D and 3D multicore architectures; static and dynamic scheduling and resource management for large-scale and parallel heterogeneous systems. * Modeling, characterization, and optimizations: Performance models and their use in the design of parallel and distributed algorithms for heterogeneous platforms; characterizations and optimizations for improving the time to solve a problem (e.g., throughput, latency, runtime); modeling and optimizing electricity consumption (e.g., power, energy); modeling for failure management (e.g., fault tolerance, recovery, reliability); modeling for security in heterogeneous platforms. * Applications on heterogeneous systems: Case studies; the confluence of Big Data systems and heterogeneous systems; data-intensive computing; scientific computing. This year we wish to focus on and expand submissions and presentations in the following “hot topics” areas; therefore we especially invite submissions in the following three areas: * Heterogeneous Integration of Quantum Computing: Design exploration, and analysis of architectures and software frameworks enabling heterogeneous integration of classical computing and quantum computing (e.g., heterogeneous quantum computers, error correction, and heterogeneous applications that use both classical and quantum logic, benchmarks for heterogeneous quantum computers). * Heterogeneity and Interoperability in Software & Data Systems: Design, exploration, and analysis of architectures and software frameworks for interoperability in software and data systems (e.g., semantic frameworks, interoperability for heterogeneous Internet-of-Things systems, model-driven frameworks). * Heterogeneous Computing for Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL): Design, exploration, benchmarking, and analysis of accelerators and software frameworks for ML and DL applications on heterogeneous computing systems.

 Title:Hetero: Where we’ve been, Where we are, and What Next? 
 Abstract: My first connection with hetero was back in my assembly language days on the PDP 11/60 with DEC’s EMT instruction which allowed users to design functions by writing their own microcode that appropriately manipulated the data path. Even then, there were mostly naysayers objecting to the extra challenges in repurposing the data path at the accompanying extra expense. In their view, the data path had one fixed use. I never bought into that in the same way that I think having eleven quarterbacks on the field makes no sense to me. Later, when chip multiprocessors became the sine qua non of microarchitecture, they insisted on homogeneous processors since hetero meant hiring extra design teams. I remember a panel I was on at HiPEAC in 2010 where my fellow panelists all agreed homogeneous processors was the only thing that made sense economically. We have successfully overcome that nonsense, and in fact pretty much everyone now agrees that future chips will make abundant use of accelerators. In my view the obvious next step is to make the microarchitectures heterogeneous, and turn those structures over to the compiler to allow their effective use. Again the pushback is, “No, that will get rid of portability, and no company will ever allow that…for obvious reasons.” My answer: “Economics be damned!” In this talk I hope to put hetero in perspective, and discuss why portability is not always the right answer. 
 Bio: Yale Patt is a teacher at the The University of Texas at Austin, where he still enjoys teaching freshmen, seniors, and graduate students, doing research, and consulting more than 60 years after first getting involved with computer technology. He earned obligatory degrees from reputable universities, and has received more than enough awards for his research and teaching. More information is available on his websiteusers.ece.utexas.edu/~pattfor those who are interested.
