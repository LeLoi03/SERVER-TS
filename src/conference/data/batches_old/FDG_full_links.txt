 About FDG 
 TheFoundations of Digital Games(FDG) conference series seeks to promote the exchange of information concerning the scientific foundations of digital games, technology used to develop digital games, and the study of digital games and their design, broadly construed. The conference is held yearly in late Spring or early Summer, and attracts an international audience of 150-200 attendees. The focus of the conference is the presentation of papers describing novel research results. FDG is typically held in cooperation with one or more special interest groups of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the proceedings of the conference from 2008 onward are archived in the ACM Digital Library. 
 The conference series was originally created by Kent Foster and John Nordlinger at Microsoft, and was known as the Microsoft Academic Days on Game Development in Computer Science Education (GDCSE). The research focus of GDCSE was education using (and about) computer game technology. In 2009, the conference changed its name to the Foundations of Digital Games, and expanded its scope to become a "big tent" computer games research conference, covering a spectrum of computer game research topics while retaining a strong interest in educational uses of games. In the run-up to the 2009 conference, Microsoft transferred ownership and organization of the conference to theSociety for the Advancement of the Study of Digital Games (SASDG), a nonprofit corporation with an academic board of directors. 
 Past proceedings may be found through the ACM Digital Library's collection:href="https://dl.acm.org/conference/fdg" - FDG: Foundations of Digital Games

 Conference Theme & Vision 
 FDG 2025 will have the theme „Accessible Worlds, United Through Play.“ This theme underscores the vital role of gaming in fostering inclusive communities, strengthening work of diverse groups, and making games and gaming accessible for all. Works addressing this theme could look at the creation of accessible gaming environments, enhancing connectivity among varied gaming communities, and promoting equitable, interdisciplinary and sustainable collaboration in game development, game design, and game studies. The conference theme extends to diversity, equity and inclusivity in both the gaming experience and its creation, and we encourage papers that investigate these aspects in broad terms. 
 We welcome all contributions related to digital games and play, but particular emphasis will be placed on those that align with this year’s theme. Interpretations of the theme are flexible; if you feel your work resonates with „Accessible Worlds, United Through Play,“ please indicate this in your submission. We are excited to see how your research contributes to this important area.
