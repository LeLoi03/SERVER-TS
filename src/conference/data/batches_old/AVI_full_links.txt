 Since 1992, AVI has been a biennial appointment for a vast international community of experts with a broad range of backgrounds. Throughout three decades, the Conference has attracted leading researchers of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) from all over the world, offering a forum to present and disseminate new technological results, paradigms, and visions for HCI and user interfaces. 
 Because of advanced technology and new possibilities for user interaction, AVI has broadened the topics it covers, still keeping its primary focus on the conception, design, implementation, and evaluation of novel visual interfaces. 
 The maintopicscan be seen in thehref="/calls/paper-submission" - Call for Papers
. 
 While rooted in Italy, AVI is an actual international conference concerning the nationality of participants, authors of papers, and program committee members. The mixture of carefully selected research contributions paired with cordial Italian hospitality creates a unique conference atmosphere, which has made AVI an internationally recognized brand.

LONG AND SHORT RESEARCH PAPERS 
  
 We solicit high-quality original research papers in the area of advanced visual interfaces and Human-Computer Interaction in general. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by an international panel of experts. 
 Accepted long and short research papers will be included in the Proceedings published by ACM Press and available in the ACM Digital Library. 
  
 Long and Short papers are publications that address AVI 2024 topics and describe original, unpublished research. Submissions must be anonymized. 
 The maximum length of long papers is 8 pages (with one additional page for references). 
 The maximum length of short papers is 4 pages (with one additional page for references). 

POSTER PAPERS 
  
 The AVI 2024 Poster Track allows researchers and practitioners to present their work in progress and obtain precious feedback from their peers in an informal setting. 
 Poster submissions must be up to 2 pages (with one additional page for references), not anonymized. 

DEMO PAPERS 
  
 The demo track is intended to provide a forum to showcase innovative implementations, systems and technologies demonstrating new ideas about interactive visual interfaces. We are looking for implementations of novel and exciting concepts or systems related to the main topics of AVI. 
 Demo papers must be up to 2 pages (with one additional page for references), not anonymized. 

SUBMISSION FORMAT 
  
 All the papers mentioned above, i.e., long and short research papers, posters, and demos, require online submission. Authors must format submissions according to the ACM SIGCONF template. Please find the templates below: 
 Latex for Overleaf: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty 
 Word Template: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template 
  
 Long and short papers must be anonymized, removing information (such as authorship, acknowledgments, name of an application, or software, or project) that can suggest the authors' identity. Citation to authors' previous work should not be anonymous and should be in third person in the text, e.g., "As described by [10]" and not "As described in our previous work [10]". 

Papers must be submitted online on EasyChair 
 https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=avi2024 
 Authors are required to send a 250-word abstract by the abstract deadline, one week before final submission, to speed up the paper assignment to reviewers. 

WORKSHOP PROPOSALS 
  
 We invite proposals for workshops that will facilitate the exchange of new ideas in all areas related to advanced visual interfaces and Human-Computer Interaction. We invite organizers to propose either half-day or one-day long workshops held on June 3 or June 4, 2024, at the AVI2024 venue. 
 Workshop proposals must be submitted following the instructions on: https://avi2024.dibris.unige.it/calls 

TUTORIALS 
  
 We encourage the proposal of tutorials on specific topics related to AVI and general HCI approaches, methodologies, or technologies. 
 Tutorial proposals must be submitted following the instructions on: 
 https://avi2024.dibris.unige.it/calls 

DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM 
  
 The goal of the Doctoral Consortium is to provide a setting for PhD students to present their work and receive feedback on their doctoral research plan and progress. Students will be offered the opportunity to articulate and discuss their problem statement, goals, methods, and results. The Doctoral Consortium also aims at providing students with guidance on various aspects of their research from established researchers and the other students participating in the sessions. Finally, the Doctoral Consortium seeks to motivate students in the development of their scientific curiosity and facilitate their networking within the research community. 

PROCEEDINGS 
  
 Accepted full and short research papers, poster papers, demo papers, and workshop descriptions will appear in the Proceedings published by ACM Press. They will be available in the ACM Digital Library. For each accepted paper, at least one author must register to AVI 2024 by the early registration deadline for authors and present the paper at the Conference.

 AVI 30th Anniversary 
  
 Since 1992, AVI has been a biennial appointment for a vast international community of experts with a broad range of backgrounds. Throughout three decades, the Conference has attracted leading researchers of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) from all over the world, offering a forum to present and disseminate new technological results, paradigms and visions for HCI and user interfaces. 
 Because of advanced technology and new possibilities for user interaction, AVI has broadened the topics it covers, still keeping its primary focus on the conception, design, implementation and evaluation of novel visual interfaces. 
  
 While rooted in Italy, AVI is an actual international conference concerning the nationality of participants, authors of papers and program committee members. The mixture of carefully selected research contributions paired with cordial Italian hospitality creates a unique conference atmosphere, which has made AVI an internationally recognized brand. 
  
 AVI 2022 is under the patronage of Sapienza Università di Roma, Dipartimento di Informatica. 
  
 We look forward to your participation in AVI2022!

 Important notice 
 Unfortunately, on the night of Sunday 5th June, a fire started in the SPA of the Hotel Villa Tuscolana. 
 We are doing everything possible to ensure this has the most negligible impact on the conference and the attendees' stay. 
 AVI remembers prof. Michele Risi, who passed away prematurely last Saturday, February 12th. 
 Professor at University of Salerno, he was a member of our Program Committee.
