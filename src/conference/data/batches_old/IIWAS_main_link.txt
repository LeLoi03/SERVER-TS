 Scope 
 Data and information are crucial in providing evidence based decision making in many aspect of human activities, as an individual or as a group. The way information and communication technology are used to collect, process, analysis and store data has always evolves. New techniques are invented, existing techniques are improved and old techniques are integrated to the new. Each of these provided some challenges and opportunities to our research community in finding the best way to meet these challenges. iiWAS provides research community with the opportunity to share and discuss their ideas. 
  
 Prior to 2020, iiWAS has been held in Munich (2019), Yogyakarta (2018), Salzburg (2017), Singapore (2016), Brussels (2015), Hanoi (2014), Vienna (2013), Bali (2012), Ho Chi Minh City (2011), Paris (2010), Kuala Lumpur (2009), and Linz (2008). iiWAS2020, iiWAS2021 and iiWAS2022 conferences were held as virtual conferences. iiWAS2023 was held as in person conference in Bali, Indonesia and iiWAS2024 was held in person in Bratislava, Slovak Republic.
