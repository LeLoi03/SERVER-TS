on 21-11-2024 
 The purpose of the International Conference on Computer-Human Interaction Research and Applications (CHIRA) is to bring together professionals, academics, and students interested in advancing research and practical applications of interaction design & human-computer interaction. Four parallel tracks will be held, covering different aspects of Computer-Human Interaction, including Human Factors and Information Systems, Interactive Devices, Interaction Design, and Adaptive and Intelligent Systems. 
  
 Papers describing original work on advanced methods, prototypes, systems, tools, and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are encouraged. Accepted papers will be presented at the conference by one of the authors and published in the Proceedings of CHIRA, which will be placed in at least one Digital Library and sent for indexation by the major international indexes. 
  
 CONFERENCE AREAS 
 Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas: 
  
 1. HUMAN FACTORS FOR INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS, RESEARCH, AND APPLICATIONS 
 2. INTERACTIVE DEVICES 
 3. INTERACTION DESIGN 
 4. ADAPTIVE AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS 
  
 PAPER SUBMISSION 
 All papers must be submitted through the online submission platform PRIMORIS and should follow the instructions and templates that can be found under Guidelines and Templates. After the paper submission has been completed, authors will receive an automatic confirmation e-mail.

 Abstract 
 This study examines the impact of motion design on user perceptions and interactions with robotic arms, which are expanding from industrial applications to supporting daily human tasks. The research investigates how different motion components influence user perceptions and preferences. Employing an online questionnaire, we analyze participants’ responses to videos of robotic arms performing laundry sorting tasks, revealing significant relationships between motion modalities, erratic behavior, and characteristic attribution. The findings contribute to the design of robotic arm movements to effectively communicate and engage with users, enhancing human-robot interaction in both industrial and social contexts.

 Upcoming Conferences 
 EUSSET organizes a yearly conference namedECSCW – The EUSSET Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, which is an international venue on practice-centred computing and the design of cooperative and collaborative technologies. From 2018 this conference unites the “old” bi-annual ECSCW conference with thebi-annual International Conference on the Design of Cooperative Systems (COOP). 
 ECSCW was earlier called the European Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, for it has been traditionally held in Europe, though since its very beginning it has arouse interest in the international CSCW community. In 2025 the conference was renamed to highlight its international nature.
