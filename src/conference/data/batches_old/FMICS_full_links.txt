 1.ERCIM's oldest active Working GroupFollowing an initial successful workshop bringing together ERCIM members interested in formal verification, held in Pisa in December 1992 Stefania Gnesi and Diego Latella, CNR, Pisa proposed to create an ERCIM working group dedicated to Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems (FMICS). Although at that time model checking was in its early days, the early ERCIM FMICS community was already aware of the great potential of formal verification techniques. 
 Since then, the WG, chaired in succession by Diego Latella (ISTI-CNR), Hubert Garavel (INRIA), Stefania Gnesi (ISTI), Pedro Merino (SparCIM), Alessandro Fantechi (ISTI), Radu Mateescu (INRIA), and Tiziana Margaria (LERO), has kept pace with the development of formal verification techniques - and model checking in particular. The series of annual workshops, began in 1996 and sponsored by the WG, have promoted an ongoing scientific discussion focussed on identifying the most efficient verification techniques, with a keen eye to their industrial applicability. Most of the members of the FMICS community have strong links with industry and have thus contributed to the slow but constant introduction of formal methods in the development cycle of industrial critical systems witnessed in the last decade. The WG has also addressed other readily applicable verification techniques, such as static analysis by abstract interpretation. Similarly, the whole formal development lifecycle has been addressed, for example in the 2008 FMICS workshop where considerable attention was paid to the recent diffusion of Model Driven Development in industry. 
 In 2008,issue number 75 of the ERCIM Newshosted a joint special session edited by Pedro Merino, coordinator of the WG, and Erwin Schoitsch, coordinator of the DES Dependable Embedded System WG, featuring almost 30 articles many of which reporting advances on the application of formal methods in industry. 
 The FMICS workshop series has always been open to contributions from outside the ERCIM community and strong links have been maintained with other organizations, such as Formal Methods Europe. In November 2009, the FMICS workshop was held during the FM week, a special gathering of events organized this year by the FME association. 
 2.BackgroundFormal methods have been advocated as a means of increasing the reliability of systems, especially those which are safety or business critical, but the industrial uptake of such methods has been slow. This is due to the perceived difficulty of mathematical nature of these methods, the lack of tool support, and the lack of precedents where formal methods has been proven to be effective. It is even more difficult to develop automatic specification and verification tools due to limitations like state explosion, undecidability, etc. This working group will bring together researchers of the ERCIM consortium in order to promote the use of formal methods within industry. 
 The behaviour of reactive systems is largely conditioned by the interaction with events of the external environment the sequentialization of which is not predictable. The complexity of the systems' behaviour increases considerably when the timing dependencies in the execution of events are taken into account. 
 The above features are typical of a large class of systems including control systems, automation systems, and communication systems and results in the extreme difficulty of the verification of their correctness. 
 In the industrial context correctness verification is usually performed by means of testing; the system is provided with input sequences drawn from a proper "coverage set" and its resulting behaviour is observed. 
 Due to the multiplicity of possibilities both for inputs to a system and originating from more and more use of parallelism and concurrency this approach turns out to be very costly and in any case it does not allow for the exhaustive verification of the correctness of the system. It allows only to detect errors which take place during the execution sequences used for the test. 
 In the last decade several theories have been developed which aim at coping with the problem of systems correctness by means of formal methodologies for the specification, design and verification of systems. These theories have been extended in order to deal with time, probability and stochastic aspects of behaviours. 
 Also real-time models where time is a dense quantity and verification can be done algorithmically (automatically) has been developed. 
 More recently, international standards for safety recommend the use of such methodologies, especially for critical systems. 
 Nevertheless, the use of formal methods in the industry is still quite limited. Apparently, major reasons for that are the notational difficulty of most formal methods available nowdays and the lack of integration between them. Notational complexity is often a deterrent to the use of formal methods stronger than the advantages of such methods. This is reinforced by the lack of models which support all the activities of system development: 
 requirements specification 
 validation of the specification 
 design 
 verification of the final product against the requirements 
 For each of the above activities different techniques have been developed independently. They are usually not at all integrated neither compatible and quite often they have been tried only on toy-examples, bringing to results which are rather difficult to compare. Finally, most of the automatic tools developed for supporting the use of formal methods lack of industrial strength and so turn out to be unpractical when used in the industrial context.3.ObjectivesThe main objectives of the WG are:To bring together scientists mainly of, but not only of institutions within ERCIM who are active in the field of formal methods and are willing to exchange their experience in the industrial usage of formal methods. 
 To coordinate efforts in the transfer of the formal methods technology and knowledge to the industry. 
 To promote research and development for the improvement of formal methods and tools with respect to their usage in the industry. 
 The above objectives will be met by means of:Workshops where the participation of industrial professionals will be solicited. 
 Development projects with industrial partners. 
 Research projects and researchers mobility.

 The yearly conference of the ERCIM Working Group on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems, FMICS [L1], the key conference at the intersection of industrial applications and formal methods, reached its 29th edition. This year the participants met in Milan, Italy, during 9-11 September 2024. 
 The aim of the FMICS conference series is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners interested in the development and application of formal methods in industry. It strives to promote research and development for improving formal methods and tools for industrial applications. 
 FMICS 2024 [L2] was chaired by Anne Haxthausen (Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby) and Wendelin Serwe (Inria Grenoble, France) and organised by the general chairs Matteo Pradella and Matteo Rossi (Politecnico di Milano, Italy) and their team as a co-located event of FM 2024, the 26th International Symposium on Formal Methods. As part of this co-location, FM and FMICS organised a joint Industry Day on 11 September. This is one of the reasons for which FMICS 2024 overall attracted about 100 participants from many countries worldwide, from academia as well as industry, making this a very well attended edition. 
 The international program committee, with 35 members from 15 different countries, received 22 submissions and decided to accept 14 papers after a rigorous reviewing process. The program moreover included two excellent invited keynote presentations, namely “The Business of Proof” by Byron Cook (Amazon Web Services, UK) and “B+ or how to model system properties in a formal software model” by Thierry Lecomte (Clearsy, France), both of which attracted many participants also from FM and from the other co-located conferences FACS, LOPSTR, PPDP and TAP. ERCIM and Inria generously sponsored the invited speakers (Figure 1). 
  
 Figure 1: FMICS 2024 PC chairs Anne Haxthausen and Wendelin Serwe acknowledged ERCIM sponsoring of the invited speakers during the conference opening presentation. 
 Following a tradition established over the years, Springer sponsored the FMICS best paper awards. This year, the program committee selected the contributions “Safe Linear Encoding of Vehicle Dynamics for the Instantiation of Abstract Scenarios” by Jan Steffen Becker (German Aerospace Center, Oldenburg) as the FMICS 2024 Best Paper (Figure 2) and “Logika: The Sireum Verification Framework” by Robby, John Hatcliff and Jason Belt (Kansas State University, USA) as the FMICS 2024 Best Tool Paper (Figure 3).
