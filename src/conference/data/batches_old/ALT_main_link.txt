 Call for papers 
 Call for papers 
 The Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT) 2025 conference will be held inMilan, ItalyonFebruary 24-27, 2025.The conference is dedicated to all theoretical and algorithmic aspects of machine learning. We invite submissions with contributions to new or existing learning problems including, but not limited to: 
 Design and analysis of learning algorithms. 
 Statistical and computational learning theory. 
 Online learning algorithms and theory. 
 Optimization methods for learning. 
 Unsupervised, semi-supervised, and active learning. 
 Interactive learning, planning and control, and reinforcement learning. 
 Privacy-preserving data analysis. 
 Learning with additional societal and strategic considerations: e.g., fairness, economics. 
 Robustness of learning algorithms to adversarial agents. 
 Artificial neural networks, including deep learning. 
 High-dimensional and non-parametric statistics. 
 Adaptive data analysis and selective inference. 
 Learning with algebraic or combinatorial structure. 
 Bayesian methods in learning. 
 Learning in distributed and streaming settings. 
 Game theory and learning. 
 Learning from complex data: e.g., networks, time series. 
 While the primary focus of the conference is theoretical, authors are welcome to support their analysis by including relevant experimental results. 
 Accepted papers will be published electronically in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR), and will be presented at the conference as a full-length talk. Authors of accepted papers will have the option of opting out of the proceedings in favor of a 1-page extended abstract, which will point to an open access archival version of the full paper reviewed for ALT. 
 Important dates 
 Paper submission deadline: 
 href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=ALT+2025+Deadline&iso=20241001T18&p1=1203" - October 1, 2024, 6 PM ET
Author feedback: 
 November 18-24, 2024 
 Author notification: 
 December 20, 2024 
 Conference format 
 The conference will be in-person and will not be hybrid. At least one author of each accepted paper will be required to present their paper in-person at the conference. When travel is not possible, we encourage authors to find alternative presenters in the community attending the conference. 
 Dual submission policy 
 Conferences: In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings may not be submitted to ALT. 
 Journals: Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that are already published in a journal at the time of submission may not be submitted to ALT. 
 Rebuttal phase 
 This year there will be a rebuttal phase during the review process. Authors will have an opportunity to provide a short response to the initial reviews. 
 Awards 
 Awards may be given to outstanding papers. Primary authors who are full-time students are eligible for student paper awards, and they should indicate if they wish their paper to be considered for such an award. The program committee may decline to make these awards or split them among several papers.
