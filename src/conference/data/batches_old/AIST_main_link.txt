CALL FOR PAPERS 
 Dear colleagues, 
 We are excited to invite you to submit a paper to AIST’2024, a scientific conference on Analysis of Images, Social Networks, and Texts. The conference is intended for researchers and practitioners interested in data science focusing on innovative applications of data analysis and machine learning techniques to image processing, analysis of network data, text processing, and other domains, such as economics or geographic information systems. 
 The conference is designed for computer scientists and practitioners whose research interests are related to data science. The eleven previous editions of the AIST conference held in 2012-2023 attracted a significant number of students, researchers, academics, and engineers working on the analysis of images, texts, and social networks. The broad scope of AIST makes it an event where researchers from different domains, exploiting various data analysis techniques, can meet and exchange ideas. The conference allows specialists from different fields to meet each other, present their work, and discuss both theoretical and practical aspects of their data analysis problems. Another important aim of the conference is to stimulate scientists and people from the industry to benefit from the knowledge exchange and identify possible grounds for fruitful collaboration. 
 Similar to the previous years, the main volume of the conference proceedings will be published in the Springer’s in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. 
 Venue 
 The conference continues travelling to beautiful regions, and following Yerevan, Armenia in 2023 edition this year AIST will be held offline in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. More specifically the event is organized with support ofKyrgyz-Turkish Manas UniversityandThe Cramer Project. Besides the scientific knowledge you will enjoy the nature of Kyrgyzstan and dive into local culture. The conference will feature representatives of the local data analysis community.
