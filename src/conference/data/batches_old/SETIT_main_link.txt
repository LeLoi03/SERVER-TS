Welcome to the 2022 IEEE 9thInternational Conference SETIT. 
 Due to the persistence of the health situation in the world due to SARS-CoV-2 and given that some travelers are forced to submit to self-isolation or quarantine to return to their country, the organizing companies have decided to postpone the IEEE 2022 SETIT on May 28-30, 2022. 
 The conference was moving to an Hybrid EventThe 2022 IEEE 9thInternational Conference on Sciences of Electronics, Technologies of Information and Telecommunications (SETIT) covers all topics in the fields of information and communication technologies and related sciences. It aims to bring together researchers and developers from both academia and industry to report on the latest scientific and theoretical advances in their respective areas, fostering a cross-disciplinary dissemination that would be otherwise made difficult by the extreme specialization of each field. 
 In today's information-centered world, the relevance of hardware, software, telecommunications cannot be overestimated; even fields traditionally involved only marginally, like factory automation and production engineering, are currently discovering the value of data and information, with such trends as the Industry 4.0 or the exponential growth of machine learning and AI, and with all the consequent technological developments that are needed to support them. 
 The Conference encourages submission of both theoretical advances and interesting applications, with special emphasis on (but not limited to) interdisciplinary works at the intersection of two or more of the covered areas. 
 The previous conference (SETIT 2018) received more than 1000 papers and posters among which 350 were accepted. Authors were from more than 43 countries. The 90 Papers presented on oral sessions were published by Springer in 2 volumesVol.1&Vol.2 
 IEEE SETIT 2022, will be technically sponsored byIEEEand co-sponsored by theIEEE Tunisia sectionand theIEEE Tunisia Section Signal processing Chapter.
