 Advancing Information Science and Information Systems Quality in the Era of Complexity 
 Knowledge and technology are constantly evolving as a result of research & development, including in Information Science. However recent fast progress in areas such as AI, quantum computing, and extended reality might lead to a revolution in a short time, not only to an evolution. How we collect and use information might radically change. The impact, challenges, and concerns from the use of advanced AI (e.g., large language models), more powerful computing systems, and new digital worlds are common topics in our discussions nowadays. They also affect other areas, including security, ethics, and education. Is a revolution really about to happen? Or is it only a new evolution? Will this depend on the Information Science areas in which progress is made or those affected? What role will base technologies such as data quality models, machine learning, conceptual models, and ontologies play? What will standards and best-practices need to consider?Domain Knowledge Engineering (DKE) 
 A selection of the best accepted papers of RCIS 2024, chosen by a dedicated committee, will be invited to submit an extended version of the RCIS paper to the Data & Knowledge Engineering (DKE) journal published by Elsevier (https://www.journals.elsevier.com/data-and-knowledge-engineering). The selection of the papers to invite will be based on the review scores and arguments and the potential for extension.Keynote Speakers

 To be announced 
 Commitment to sustainability 
 Throughout human history, we have organised ourselves into larger and larger structures, from the first tribes of our prehistory to today's megacities. 
  
 In recent decades we have become aware that our living space is not limited to the structures we inhabit, but extends to the entire planet and that our actions have a global influence. 
  
 This has led us to consider with increasing interest and necessity the sustainability of everything we do so that the impact on the environment that allows us to exist is as small as possible. 
  
 Therefore, it is our duty and responsibility to seek and implement sustainability measures so that we can all enjoy an environmentally responsible and sustainable congress. 
  
 We have developed the following initiatives to improve sustainability: 
  
 First, we have identified the rooms that have the best lighting and conditioning in order to reduce the need for energy expenditure. 
  
 Second, we have defined a collection of metrics to implement and evaluate different sustainability-related initiatives. These metrics include number of vegan menus consumed, proximity of the food served on the menus, number of public transport trips made by attendees and hours of the day when the electricity is switched off. 
  
 Finally, we have worked on the production and application of sustainable badges made from recycled materials.

 19th Research Challenges in Information Science 
 Advancing Information Science and Information Systems Quality in the Era of Complexity 
 Seville, Spain, 20 - 23 May, 2025 
 Call for Papers 
  
 RCIS aims to bring together scientists, researchers, engineers, and practitioners from information science in a wide sense. First arranged in 2007, the RCIS conference series aims to provide opportunities for knowledge sharing and dissemination in areas such as information systems and their engineering, user-oriented approaches, data and information management, enterprise management and engineering, domain-specific IS engineering, data science, information infrastructures, and reflective research and practice. 
  
 “Advancing Information Science and Information Systems Quality in the Era of Complexity”For the 2025 RCIS conference, the chosen theme underscores the critical importance of quality in the development, implementation, and management of information systems. As technology and data continue to evolve at an unprecedented pace, the complexity of systems increases, making the assurance of high-quality more complex and crucial than ever. The emphasis on quality is essential not only for meeting the increasing expectations of end-users but also for addressing the growing challenges of security threats and compliance requirements. This theme invites participants to reflect on innovative practices, tools, and frameworks that can be adopted to propel the quality of information systems into the next decade, ensuring they are reliable and effective amidst the intricacies of modern technological landscapes.

 Submission Process 
 The proceedings of RCIS 2025 will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing series. Papers shall be formatted according to the Springer LNCS/LNBIP conference proceedings template (for LaTeX and Word):https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines. 
 Papers that have already been accepted or are currently under review for other conferences or journals will not be considered for publication at RCIS 2025. Papers should be in English and must be associated to one of the following categories: 
  
 Technical solution papers(max 16 pages Springer) present solutions that are novel or significantly improve existing approaches. A technical solution paper must include a preliminary validation of the proposed solution, and results must be stated clearly enough so that it is possible to validate them in follow-up research. 
  
 Evaluation papers(max 16 pages Springer) evaluate existing problem situations or validate proposed solutions through scientific means, i.e., by empirical studies, experiments, case studies, simulations mathematical proofs, etc. The research method must be sound and appropriate. 
  
 Industrial practice and experience papers(max 16 pages Springer) thoroughly present problems or challenges encountered in practice elaborate on success or failure with existing approaches, or report on industrial practice (e.g., methods and tools). A paper in this category shall provide a clear context, detail the problem or the industrial practice, and explain the lessons learned. 

Please note that the maximum length of the paper includes references, appendices, etc. In addition to the main research track, RCIS 2025 invites submissions to the following tracks: Forum, Doctoral Consortium, Research Projects, Journal First, Tutorials, and Workshops. 
 Proposals must be submitted using the conference submission sitehref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rcis2025" - EasyChair
, track “RCIS 2025 Main Conference”. 
 By submitting a paper, the authors agree that at least one of them will register to the conference and present the paper (one paper=one registration). 
 We adopt a single-blind review format, meaning that the author names are included in the paper itself under the paper title.
