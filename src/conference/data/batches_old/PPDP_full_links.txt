 Scope 
 The PPDP 2024 symposium brings together researchers from the declarative programming communities, including those working in the functional, logic, answer-set, and constraint handling programming paradigms. The goal is to stimulate research in the use of logical formalisms and methods for analyzing, performing, specifying, and reasoning about computations, including mechanisms for concurrency security, static analysis, and verification. 
 Submissions are invited on all topics related to declarative programming, from principles to practice, from foundations to applications. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Language Design: domain-specific languages; interoperability; concurrency, parallelism and distribution; modules; functional languages; reactive languages; languages with objects; languages for quantum computing; languages inspired by biological and chemical computation; metaprogramming. 
 Declarative languages in artificial intelligence: logic programming; database languages; knowledge representation languages; probabilistic languages; differentiable languages. 
 Implementations: abstract machines; interpreters; compilation; compile-time and run-time optimization; memory management. 
 Foundations: types; logical frameworks; monads and effects; semantics. 
 Analysis and Transformation: partial evaluation; abstract interpretation; control flow; data flow; information flow; termination analysis; resource analysis; type inference and type checking; verification; validation; debugging; testing. 
 Tools and Applications: programming and proof environments; verification tools; case studies in proof assistants or interactive theorem provers; certification; novel applications of declarative programming inside and outside of CS; declarative programming pearls; practical experience reports and industrial application; education.PPDP will take place 10-11 September 2024 at the Politecnico di Milano Italy, co-located with the 34th Int’l Symp. on Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation (LOPSTR 2024) within the umbrella ofFM 2024

 ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidancehref="https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance" - here
.

 Format of a submission 
 For each paper category, you must use the most recent version of theCurrent ACM Master Template, at the time of writing being 2.08. You must use the LaTeX sigconf proceedings template, as the conference organizers are unable to process final submissions in other formats. In case of problems with the templates, contactACM’s TeX support team at Aptara. 
 Authors should notehref="http://authors.acm.org/" - ACM’s statement on author’s
rights
which apply to final papers. Submitted papers should meet the requirements ofACM’s plagiarism policy. 
 Requirements for publication 
 At least one author of each accepted submission will be expected to attend and present the work at the conference. The PC chair may retract a paper that is not presented. The PC chair may also retract a paper if complaints about the paper’s correctness are raised which cannot be resolved by the final paper deadline.

PPDP 
 International Symposium on Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming 
 OVERVIEW 
 PPDP aims to provide a forum that brings together researchers from the declarative programming communities, including those working in the logic, constraint and functional programming paradigms, but also embracing a variety of other paradigms such as visual programming, executable specification languages, database languages, AI languages and knowledge representation languages used, for example, in the semantic web. 
 The goal is to stimulate research in the use of logical formalisms and methods for specifying, performing, and analysing computations, including mechanisms for mobility, modularity, concurrency, object-orientation, security, and static analysis. Papers related to the use of declarative paradigms and tools in industry and education are especially solicited.

 Paper Submission 
 Submissions can be made in three categories: 
 Regular Research Papers, 
 System Descriptions, and 
 Experience Reports. 
 Submissions of Research Papers must present original research which is unpublished and not submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 12 pages ACM style 2-column (including figures, but excluding bibliography). Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be submitted. Research papers will be judged on originality, significance correctness, clarity, and readability. 
 Submission of System Descriptions must describe a working system whose description has not been published or submitted elsewhere. They must not exceed 10 pages and should contain a link to a working system. System Descriptions must be marked as such at the time of submission and will be judged on originality, significance, usefulness, clarity, and readability. 
 Submissions of Experience Reports are meant to help create a body of published refereed, citable evidence where declarative programming such as functional logic, answer-set, constraint programming, etc., is used in practice. They must not exceed 5 pagesincluding references. Experience Reports must be marked as such at the time of submission and need not report original research results. They will be judged on significance, usefulness, clarity, and readability. 
 Possible topics for an Experience Report include, but are not limited to: 
 insights gained from real-world projects using declarative programming 
 comparison of declarative programming with conventional programming in the context of an industrial project or a university curriculum 
 curricular issues encountered when using declarative programming in education 
 real-world constraints that created special challenges for an implementation of a declarative language or for declarative programming in general 
 novel use of declarative programming in the classroom 
 programming pearl that illustrates a nifty new data structure or programming technique. 
 Supplementary material may be provided via a link to an extended version of the submission (recommended), or in a clearly marked appendix beyond the above mentioned page limits. Reviewers are not required to study extended versions or any material beyond the respective page limit. Material beyond the page limit will not be included in the final published version. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 Submissions will be made via EasyChair. The submission webpage for PPDP 25 ishttps://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iclp25(select PPDP track). 
 For each paper category, you must use the most recent version of theCurrent ACM Master Template. You must use the LaTeX sigconf proceedings template as the conference organizers are unable to process final submissions in other formats. 
 Authors should notehref="http://authors.acm.org/" - ACM’s statement on author’s rights
