 About ICPE 
 The International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE) originated 16 years ago from the fusion of an ACM workshop on software and performance prediction and a SPEC workshop focused on benchmarking and performance evaluation. 
 ICPE continues true to its origins with focus both on software performance modeling, prediction, and measurement as well as on benchmark-based performance evaluation. The areas to which such principles are applied have evolved over the years with the technological evolution in academia and industry. 
 ICPE contributions appear at all levels of system and software design, performance modeling, and measurements of performance, from the cloudâ€™s core to edge, from mobile devices to major data centers, from web applications to scientific applications. 
 ICPEâ€™s focus on performance engineering attracts both industrial practitioners and academics, united by their interest in quantifying the performance impact of various aspects of complex system design and implementation. Participants are also intellectually curious about design cycle lengths, lifetime maintenance issues, quality of experience, and the costs of delivering systems and services.

 Scope 
 The ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE) is the leading international forum for presenting and discussing novel ideas, innovations, trends, and experiences in the field of performance engineering. 
 Todayâ€™s systems are complex, rely increasingly on dynamic distributed architectures, and raise continuously important challenges related to end-to-end performance management. This applies equally to emerging domains, such as systems of systems, interconnected and embedded systems, distributed data and intelligence, machine learning environments, human-centered computing, non-von Neumann architectures, cloud/edge/fog infrastructures, data streaming, and social networks, and also to traditional domains, such as web-based, data centers, mobile and wireless systems, and real-time systems. As a result, our systems become more complex and, therefore, more difficult to engineer and understand. We need to manage this complexity so that our systems remain reliable, trustworthy, and performant. 
 ICPE brings together researchers and practitioners to report state-of-the-art and in-progress research on performance engineering of software, networks, and systems, including but not limited to performance modeling, analysis, measurement, benchmark design, and run-time performance management. The focus is both on classical metrics such as response time, throughput, resource utilization, and (energy) efficiency and on the relationship of such metrics to other system properties, including but not limited to scalability, elasticity, availability, reliability, cost, sustainability, security, and privacy.
