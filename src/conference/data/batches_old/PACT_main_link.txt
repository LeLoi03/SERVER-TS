 Call for Papers 
 PACT 2025 will be held in Irvine, California, USA, from November 3-6, 2025. 
 Submissions Due:April 18, 2025 
 Submission Site:href="https://pact25.hotcrp.com" - https://pact25.hotcrp.com
Scope 
 The International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT) is a unique technical conference at the intersection of hardware and software, with a special emphasis on parallelism. PACT brings together researchers from computer architectures, compilers, execution environments, programming languages, and applications to present and discuss their latest research results, tools, and practical experiences. 
 PACT 2025 will be held as an in-person event in Irvine, California, USA. We encourage all authors of accepted papers to participate, and at least one author must attend the conference. 
 PACT seeks submissions in two categories: 
 Research Papers 
 Tools and Practical Experience (TPE) Papers 
 Topics of Interest 
 PACT welcomes submissions on topics including, but not limited to: 
 Parallel architectures, including accelerators for AI and other domains 
 Compilers and tools for parallel architectures 
 Applications and experimental studies of parallel processing 
 Computational models for concurrent execution 
 Multicore, multithreaded, superscalar, and VLIW architectures 
 Compiler and hardware support for reducing memory latencies 
 Support for correctness in hardware and software 
 Reconfigurable parallel computing 
 Dynamic translation and optimization 
 I/O issues in parallel computing and their application impact 
 Parallel programming languages, algorithms, and applications 
 Middleware and runtime system support for parallel computing 
 Application-specific parallel systems 
 Distributed computing architectures and systems 
 Heterogeneous systems leveraging various accelerators 
 In-core and in-chip accelerators and their optimization 
 Applications of machine learning to parallel computing 
 Large-scale data processing, including in-memory computing accelerators 
 Insights from modern parallel applications for architecture and compiler design 
 Research Papers 
 Research papers will be evaluated by the PACT Program Committee based on: 
 Relevance: | The paper should align with PACT’s topics of interest. 
 Novelty/Originality: | The work should present new ideas or offer fresh perspectives. 
 Significance: | The research should address an important problem and have the potential to influence future work. 
 Results: | The claims should be well-supported by clear and validated results. 
 Comparison to Prior Work: | The paper should properly discuss existing literature, highlighting similarities, differences, and improvements. 
 Tools and Practical Experience (TPE) Papers 
 TPE papers focus on practical applications, industry challenges, and experience reports. A TPE paper must clearly explain its functionality, summarize practical experience with realistic case studies, and describe any supporting artifacts. The title of a TPE paper must include the prefix“TPE:”. TPE papers follow the same submission guidelines and are reviewed by the same Program Committee as research papers. 
 TPE papers will be evaluated based on: 
 Originality: | They should present PACT-related technologies applied to real-world problems. 
 Usability: | The tool or software should have broad applicability and aid PACT-related research. 
 Documentation: | The tool/software should be well-documented on a public website. 
 Benchmark Repository: | A benchmark suite should be provided for testing. 
 Availability: | Preference is given to tools/software that are freely available, though industry/commercial tools may be considered with justification. 
 Foundations: | The paper should relate to PACT’s principles, though extensive theoretical discussion is not required.

 Poster submissions must follow the same formatting guidelines but are limited to | 2 pages | . 
 Papers not accepted for full presentation will automatically be considered for posters unless authors opt out in their abstract submission. 
 Two-page poster summaries will be included in the conference proceedings. 
 Conflicts of Interest 
 Authors must declareallconflicts of interest with PC members and external reviewers at submission time. Papers with undeclared or false conflicts may be rejected. Conflicts follow ACM’sConflict of Interest Policy. 
 Artifact Evaluation 
 Authors of accepted papers areencouragedto submit their artifacts for evaluation. The Artifact Evaluation Committee assesses availability, functionality, and reproducibility. Successful artifacts will receive aseal of approvalin the published paper. Authors can include a2-page Artifact Appendixin the final paper. 
 We encourage authors to use open-source frameworks such asDocker,OCCAM,reprozip,CodeOcean, andCollective Knowledgeto improve artifact portability and reproducibility. 
 Camera-Ready Instructions 
 Page Limit: | The final version must not exceed | 11 pages | , with an | optional 2-page Artifact Appendix | . 
 Extra Pages: | Up to | 2 additional pages | may be purchased for | $200 per page | .
