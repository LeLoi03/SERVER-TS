 Welcome to ISVC 
 The purpose of the International Symposium on Visual Computing (ISVC) is to provide a common forum for researchers, scientists, engineers and practitioners throughout the world to present their latest research findings, ideas, developments and applications in visual computing. We seek papers describing contributions to the state of the art and state of the practice in the four central areas of visual computing:computer vision,computer graphics,virtual reality, andvisualization. Papers that span multiple areas are particularly encouraged. 
 ISVC will consist of invited and contributed presentations dealing with all aspects of visual computing. In addition to the main program, the symposium includes six keynote presentations,href="https://www.isvc.net/index.php/tutorials/" - tutorials
,href="https://www.isvc.net/index.php/special-tracks-2/" - special tracks
, and a poster session.The symposium’s proceedings will be published bySpringerin theLecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)series. Information on abstracting andindexing of the LNCS seriescan be foundhere.A “best paper award ($500) will be sponsored by Springer this year. 
 Authors of selected papers presented at ISVC’25 will beinvitedto submit anextendedversion of their work forexpeditedreview and possible publication in aspecial issueonAdvances in Visual Computingin theMachine Vision and Applicationsjournal. The paper submission deadline is tentatively onApril 15, 2026with publication of the special issue expected within 2026.
