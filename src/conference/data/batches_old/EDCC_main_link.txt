 The European Dependable Computing Conference is a leading venue for presenting and discussing the latest research, industrial practice and innovations in dependable and secure computing with a long tradition started in 1994 and reaching the 20thedition. The conference includes workshops on the first day and continues with engaging keynotes and presentations until Friday. The social programs also will enhance the experience for attendees. 
 Lisbon, the vibrant capital of Portugal, is a city that effortlessly blends history, culture and modernity. Situated in coast of Portugal, where the Tagus river meets the Atlantic Ocean, it boasts a rich cultural heritage, from the medieval quarters to the iconic landmarks like the Castle of St. George and the Tower of Belém. 

Lisbon is the home of the University of Lisbon (ULisboa), the largest and most prestigious university in Portugal and is one of Europe’s leading universities. Since its begin, ULisboa had a turbulent beginnings. In the words of A. Moreira Sá: "The Portuguese University was founded by King Dinis on March 1, 1290, and was transferred to Coimbra in 1308; thirty years later it was transferred back to Lisbon and then, in 1354, it was moved once again to Coimbra. However King Fernando ordered, on June 3, 1377, its transferal back to Lisbon, where it stayed for 160 years without interruption - more precisely during the Discoveries, a period which greatly benefitted from the contributions of several of its students and teachers (among many others, the sailor Gil Eanes and two key scientific figures: Pedro Nunes and Garcia de Orta)." 
 With more seven centuries, ULisboa brings together various areas of knowledge and has a privileged position for facilitating the contemporary evolution of science, technology, arts and humanities. The quality of teaching, research innovation and culture of ULisboa is attracting an ever increasing amount of talent from around the world. 
 We will host you in the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon (FCUL), an integral and founding unit of ULisboa, created by Decree in 1911, which takes on the historical, cultural and scientific heritage of its ancestors: Noviciado da Cotovia (1619-1759), Real Colégio dos Nobres (1761-1837), and Escola Politécnica (1837-1911). 
 The FCUL’s motto isWhat we do not know today, we will know tomorrow (Garcia de Orta, 1563).FCUL integrates the Department of Informatics and LASIGE research unit, characterized by the excellence of its research international visibility, and close connection to society. LASIGE performs cutting-edge investigation in seven Research Lines of Excellence related to Computer Science. The Dependable and Secure Decentralised Systems and Cyber-Physical Systems research lines play an essential role in the generation of new knowledge in data privacy security for software systems, network and distributed systems.

 Overview 
 We live in turbulent times where technology is ever-changing, and new paradigms keep arising. Many of them could be game changers from an industrial perspective, like in-memory and quantum computing or novel artificial intelligence techniques. However, their dependable and secure adoption in computer-based systems we rely on for our everyday lives (from edge devices to large-scale systems) is far from simple. 
 The European Dependable Computing Conference (EDCC) is a pivotal event in the domain of dependable and secure computing systems. It serves as a unique forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss their latest research results on theory, techniques, systems, and tools for the design, validation, operation and evaluation of dependable and secure computing systems. 
 In addition to original research papers, EDCC welcomes contributions on dependability and security in practice and their application to industrial domains. The conference also provides a natural meeting place for ongoing dependability and security projects to present their state of advancement and innovative results. 
 The conference program will be enriched by workshops, a student forum, fast abstracts and posters tracks, offering an ideal venue for exchanging ideas and networking. 
 The conference proceedings will be managed by the Conference Publishing Services (CPS) and will be submitted to Xplore and the CSDL. 
 The flyer for the call for papers is now available forhref="./CFP_EDCC_2025_Flyer_v3.pdf" - download

 Practical experience reports | (up to 6 pages) dedicated to dependability and security in practice, applying tools and techniques to new challenging problems or domains. 
 Industry papers | (from 4 up to 6 pages) directly related to industrial use cases applicability and scalability issues of recent techniques, novel technological challenges, and novel applications of practical aspects of dependability. Most of the authors must be affiliated with the industry. Papers will undergo the regular review process but with a high emphasis on their practical aspects and insights into industrial applications. 
 Short papers | (up to 4 pages) describing preliminary research work (position papers) or a description outlining the design or implementation of a tool or the prototyping of an operational system. 
 References are included in the page limit for papers submitted to any category.However, after the paper's acceptance references will not be included in the page limit to enable authors to better address the reviewers' comments.
