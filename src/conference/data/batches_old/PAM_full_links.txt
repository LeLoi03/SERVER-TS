 Passive and Active Measurement PAM 2025 
 ThePassive and Active Measurement (PAM)conference brings together researchers and operators to discuss novel and emerging work in the area of network measurement and analysis. 
 PAM is inclusive of all areas of network measurement, but focuses on systems-based research and real-world data. Indeed, measurement technology is needed at all layers of the network stack, ranging from power profiling of hardware components to virtualization in data centers, to application profiling, and even user experience. 
 Work with operational impact or relevance to the broader network research community is especially welcomed, as are early and promising measurement techniques and replications or reproductions of existing studies.
