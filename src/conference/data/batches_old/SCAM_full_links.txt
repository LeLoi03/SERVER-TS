 The aim of thehref="http://www.ieee-scam.org" - IEEE International Conference on Source Code Analysis & Manipulation
(SCAM) is to bring together researchers and practitioners working on theory, techniques and applications that concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of computer systems. While much attention in the wider software engineering community is properly directed towards other aspects of systems development and evolution, such as specification, design, and requirements engineering, it is the source code that contains the only precise description of the behavior of the system. The analysis and manipulation of source code thus remains a pressing concern. 
 For the purpose of clarity, ‘source code’ is taken to mean any fully executable description of a software system. It is therefore so-construed as to include machine code, very high level languages and executable graphical representations of systems. The term ‘analysis’ is taken to mean any automated or semi automated procedure which takes source code and yields insight into its meaning. The term ‘manipulation’ is taken to mean any automated or semi-automated procedure which takes and returns source code.

 Call for Research Track Papers 
 The 23rd IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2023) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on theory, techniques, and applications that concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of software systems. The term “source code” refers to any fully executable description of a software system, such as machine code, (very) high-level languages, and executable graphical representations of systems. The term “analysis” refers to any (semi-)automated procedure that yields insight into source code, while “manipulation” refers to any automated or semi-automated procedure that takes and returns source code. While much attention in the wider software engineering community is directed towards other aspects of systems development and evolution, such as specification, design, and requirements engineering, it is the source code that contains the only precise description of the behavior of a system. Thus, the analysis and manipulation of source code remains a critical area of research from which SCAM 2023 solicits high-quality submissions. 
 Covered Topics and Paper Formats 
 We welcome submission of papers that describe original and significant work in the field of source code analysis and manipulation. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 abstract interpretation 
 bad smell detection

 Call for Engineering Track Papers 
 The Engineering Track in the 23rd IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2023) looks for papers that discuss innovations and solutions to practical problems that researchers and practitioners face in source code analysis and manipulation of software systems. With the research advancements in source code analysis during the past decades, the industry has adopted many of the research ideas and built tools and techniques to solve real-world problems in daily jobs of software engineers. The Engineering Track provides an opportunity to discuss these important and often overlooked ideas and achievements so that software engineers and researchers can use them to improve their engineering development and produce high-quality software. This track aims at bringing researchers and software engineers to communicate and share their insights and collaborate on tools, libraries, and infrastructure for source code analysis. 
 This track welcomes six-page papers (included references) that report on the design and implementation of tools for source code analysis and manipulation, as well as libraries infrastructure, and real-world studies. The papers are expected to discuss engineering work artifacts that have NOT been published before as the main contribution. We encourage submissions that accompany papers in the Research Track. 
 What artifacts qualify as Engineering Track material? 
 Tools: | Software or hardware that facilitate source code analysis. 
 Libraries: | Reusable APIs and frameworks. 
 Infrastructure: | Projects that provide/facilitate access to data for reproducibility. 
 Data: | Reusable datasets for other researchers to reproduce the results. 
 Real-world Studies: | Studies that focus on how tools, libraries, infrastructure and data enable research. 
 Engineering challenges: | Identifying engineering challenges that remain unresolved and have impact on research in source-code analysis. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:Program transformation, refactoring, analysis, optimization and measurement. 
 Mining repositories, revisions and changes. 
 Bad smell detection, clone management, and program comprehension. 
 Concern, concept and feature localization and mining. 
 Source-level testing, verification, bug detection and prediction, security vulnerability analysis. 
 Natural language analysis of source code artifacts. 
 Submission guidelines 
 All submissions must be in English and should be submitted electronically in PDF format using EasyChair:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scam2023" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scam2023
The submission length has a limit of six pages, with the expectation that authors use the space to discuss artifact motivation, design, and use cases in detail. Papers must conform to the IEEE proceedings paper format guidelines. Templates in Latex and Word are available on IEEE's website. All submissions must be in English and should be submitted electronically in PDF format. Each submission will be reviewed by members of the Engineering Track program committee. Authors of accepted papers will be required to present their contributions at the conference. 
 The key criterion for acceptance is that the paper should (a) follow the above mentioned guidelines and (b) make an original contribution that can benefit practitioners in the field now and/or others designing and building artifacts for source code analysis and manipulation. The artifacts can range from an early research prototype to a polished deployed product. Papers about commercial products are welcome, as long as the guidelines described above are followed. 
 Videos and other demo material may be taken into account by reviewers as they review the paper, but the paper should be self contained. In order to preserve the anonymity of the reviewers, such material should be hosted on an anonymous public source, or made available in such a way that the track chairs can download them once and redistribute them to reviewers. 
 All authors, reviewers, and organizers are expected to uphold the IEEE Code of Conduct. Failure to do so may lead to a (desk) rejection of the paper. 
 Double-blind Review 
 This year, we are following a double-blind reviewing process. Submitted papers must adhere to the following rules: 
 Author names and affiliations must be omitted. (The track co-chairs will check compliance before reviewing begins.) 
 References to authors' own related work must be in the third person. (For example instead of writing “We build on our previous work...” you should write “We build on the work of...”) 
 If the program chairs find that authors did not respect the rules of double-blind review they can decide to (desk) reject the paper.

 Call for Replication and Negative Results Papers 
 The 23rd IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM) will be hosting a Replication and Negative Results (RENE) track once again in 2023. Taking advantages of nowadays open science practices, this track provides a venue for researchers to submit papers reporting (1) replications of previous empirical studies (including controlled experiments, case studies, and surveys) and (2) important and relevant negative or null results (i.e., results that failed to show an effect, but help to eliminate useless hypotheses, therefore reorienting researchers on more promising research paths) related to source code analysis and manipulation (see list of topics in Technical Research Track). 
 Replications studies: Open science is key to fostering progress via transparency and empirical studies should be reproducible. However, papers in this category must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper. Such submissions should apply the approach on at least partially new data sets (open-source or proprietary). This also means that it is possible to use available infrastructures to conduct measurements and experiments but with different/extended datasets and different conditions, scenarios, etc. Replication studies can either strengthen the results of the original study by increasing external validity with additional data or provide new insights into the variables that may impact the results. A replication paper should clearly report on results that the authors were able to reproduce as well as on the aspects of the work that were irreproducible. 
 Negative results papers: Due to open source and open science initiatives, there are vast amounts of data and software artifacts available in repositories and online archival sites, such as GitHub and Zenodo. Not all analyses of such data and software artifacts result in expected positive results. In this category, we seek papers that report on negative results. We seek negative results for all types of software engineering research related to source code and manipulation (qualitative, quantitative, case study, experiment, etc.). Negative results are important contributions to scientific knowledge because they allow us to prune our hypothesis space. As Walter Tichy writes, "Negative results, if trustworthy, are extremely important for narrowing down the search space. They eliminate useless hypotheses and thus reorient and speed up the search for better approaches." 
 Evaluation Criteria 
 Both Reproducibility Studies and Negative Results submissions will be evaluated according to the following standards: 
 Depth and breadth of the empirical studies. 
 Clarity of writing. 
 Appropriateness of conclusions. 
 Amount of useful, actionable insights. 
 Deep discussion regarding the implications of the negative results or new results obtained with reproducibility studies. 
 Availability of artifacts. 
 Underlying methodological rigor and detailed description of procedures. For example, a negative result due primarily to misaligned expectations or due to lack of statistical power (small samples) is not a good submission. The negative result should be a result of a lack of effect, not lack of methodological rigor. 
 Clear descriptions of the differences between the original setup and the one used in the study (for the case of reproducibility studies). 
 Since we have decided to actively support open science, we expect that replication studies clearly point out the artifacts the study is built upon, and to provide the links to all the artifacts in the submission. However, we recognize that the success of the open science initiative depends on the willingness (and possibilities) of authors to disclose their data and artifacts. Note that all submissions will undergo the same review process independent of whether authors disclose their artifacts or data. For more information about our open science policy, please visit thehref="https://conf.researchr.org/track/icsme-2023/icsme-2023-papers" - ICSME 2023 call for papers

 Submission Guidelines 
 Papers must not exceed 12 pages (the last 2 pages can be used for references only) and must conform to the IEEE proceedings paper format guidelines. Templates in Latex and Word are available onIEEE's website. All submissions must be in English and should be submitted electronically in PDF format viahref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scam2023" - EasyChair
. Additionally, submissions must be original, in the sense that the findings and writing have not been previously published or under consideration elsewhere. The paper must be clearly marked as a RENE paper. Submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. If the paper is accepted, at least one author must attend the conference and present the paper. 
 Double-blind review 
 We follow a double-blind reviewing process. Submitted papers must adhere to the following rules: 
 Author names and affiliations must be omitted. The track co-chairs will check compliance before reviewing begins. 
 References to authors' own related work must be in the third person. For example, not "We build on our previous work..." but rather "We build on the work of..."

 Call for New Ideas and Emerging Results papers 
 Following the success of the previous editions of the New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) track at SCAM 2021 and SCAM 2022, the 23rd IEEE International Working Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2023) will again host a NIER track. This track aims to provide a place for researchers and practitioners to present, discuss, and polish early-stage research. This early-stage research should be innovative with the potential to make a strong future impact on the research or practice of software engineering. However, as it concerns early-stage research, the NIER track does not require submissions to have a strong evaluation. Instead, submissions should contain preliminary results that indicate the future potential of the research as well as a discussion of the challenges which must be overcome in the pursuit of the given research goals. These challenges should act as both future research directions as well as topics which the authors feel require discussion within the community. The topics of interest for this track are the same as for the main research track and are listed below. 
 Topics of Interest 
 We welcome the submission of papers that describe original and significant work in the field of source code analysis and manipulation. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 abstract interpretation 
 bad smell detection 
 bug location and prediction 
 clone detection 
 concern, concept, and feature localization and mining 
 decompilation 
 energy efficient source code 
 natural language analysis of source code artifacts 
 program comprehension 
 program slicing 
 program transformation and refactoring 
 repository, revision, and change analysis 
 security vulnerability analysis 
 source level metrics 
 source level optimization 
 source-level testing and verification 
 static and dynamic analysis 
 We explicitly solicit results from any theoretical or technological domain that can be applied to these and similar topics. 
 Submission guidelines 
 All submissions must be in English and should be submitted electronically in PDF format using EasyChair:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scam2023" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=scam2023
Submitted papers should describe original, unpublished, and significant work. These papers must not have been previously accepted for publication, nor be concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop. 
 The submissions must follow the rules of the double-blind reviewing process. Additionally: 
 papers must not exceed 6 pages, including figures, tables, appendices, and references (the 6th page can be used for references only) 
 papers must be marked as a NIER track papers 
 papers must conform to the IEEE proceedings paper format guidelines; templates in LaTeX and Word are available on IEEE’s website 
 all submissions must be in English and should be submitted electronically in PDF format 
 if the paper is accepted, at least one author must register for the conference and present the paper 
 all authors, reviewers, and organizers are expected to uphold the IEEE Code of Conduct; failure to do so may lead to a (desk) rejection of the paper 
 Double-blind review 
 We follow a double-blind reviewing process. Submitted papers must adhere to the following rules: 
 author names and affiliations must be omitted (the track co-chairs will check compliance before reviewing begins) 
 eferences to authors' own related work must be in the third person (for example, instead of writing “We build on our previous work...” you should write “We build on the work of...”) 
 If the program chairs find that authors did not respect the rules of double-blind review they can decide to (desk) reject the paper. 
 Paper evaluation 
 Submissions will be evaluated based on their originality, the importance of their contribution, the challenges highlighted, and their potential future significance. In addition, reviewers are asked to consider the soundness, overall quality, clarity and consistency of presentation, and whether the submission appropriately contextualizes itself with respect to related work. Again, the NIER track does not require a complete evaluation. Preliminary data and a discussion of the challenges and future research directions supported by this preliminary data are encouraged.

 We are proud to announce the following keynotes: 
  
 Title: IDEs as the Bridge: Connecting Humans and Code 
 Abstract:In the ever-evolving world of software development, human factors play a pivotal role in shaping how individuals engage in programming activities and, subsequently, how Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) should cater to human needs. This talk delves into the intricate interplay between human expertise, gender, and the programming process, highlighting their profound impact on tasks such as code creation, foraging (finding information), reuse, and debugging. We will discuss: (1) the influence of gender and expertise-aware approaches on code development and their implications for software engineering practices, emphasizing the significance of diversity and inclusion in technology; and (2) Human-AI interaction with conversational agents, their effects on programmers and coding workflows, and ways to enhance collaboration and productivity. Our focus will center on IDEs as the critical interface between humans and code. 
 Sandeep Kaur Kuttalis an Associate Professor at The North Carolina State University, where she directs the Human-Centric Software Engineering Lab. Her research combines Human-Computer Interaction, Software Engineering, and Artificial Intelligence. She focuses on the human aspects of software engineering by studying and modeling programmer behavior and then designing and developing mixed-initiative programmer-computer systems. Sandeep is a recent recipient of the NSF CAREER and AFOSR YIP awards. She has received a best paper award at ACM CHI, best paper at ACM/IEEE ICGSE, and an honorable mention at ACM CHI. She is on the editorial board of the Journal of Computer Languages, vice-chair of the steering committee for the IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC) and acted as chair or program committee member at CHI, VL/HCC, HCII, ICSE, FSE, ASE, ICST, ICSME, CHASE, ICPC, and IUI. She is passionate about diversity and inclusion. 
 Title: Reducing Hallucinations: Harnessing Contextual Analysis for AI Code Generation 
 Abstract:The evolution of generative AI holds tremendous promise for automating and enhancing various facets of software engineering. However, as with any nascent technology, it comes with its own set of challenges. A notable one is that generative AI can occasionally 'hallucinate', producing code that, while syntactically correct, may be contextually off-mark or even erroneous. These instances underscore the urgent need for refined methodologies and deeper insights. In this keynote, Prof. Mesbah delves into the confluence of program analysis and generative AI, charting a course toward more precise and context-aware code generation. He posits that instead of arbitrarily choosing context for a developer task, the context should encapsulate meaningful and pertinent details relevant to the task. By showcasing key findings from his recent research, he will highlight how a software's contextual grasp can be pivotal in enhancing the accuracy of AI-driven code generation. 
 Journey with us into a session that reveals how the fusion of program analysis with generative AI is setting the stage for a future where technology seamlessly augments human creativity and precision in coding activities. 
 Ali Mesbahis a Professor at the University of British Columbia (UBC). He dedicates his research to addressing critical challenges in software engineering, specifically in the areas of automated software analysis and testing, software evolution, and fault localization and repair. His recent work involves the integration of program analysis with generative AI to devise advanced code generation techniques. Throughout his career, Prof. Mesbah has been honoured with several awards, including the Amazon Research Award, Killam Accelerator Research Fellowship, Killam Research Prize, Canadian Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Accelerator, a Most Influential Paper Award (SCAM 2023), and multiple ACM/IEEE Distinguished Paper Awards. He is a member of the steering committee for the UBC Research Excellence Cluster on Trustworthy ML, has served as an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, and regularly serves on program committees of flagship conferences in software engineering such as ICSE. 
 Most Influential Paper award 
 SCAM 2021 is happy to announce that the most influencial paper award goes to "Lightweight Transformation and Fact Extraction with the srcML Toolkit" by Michael Collard, Michael Decker, and Jonathan Maletic originally published in SCAM 2011. The srcML toolkit is a widely-used fact extraction and source-code transformation toolkit, which continues to have a large impact on the software engineering research community because it is easy to use and continues to be maintained and updated. The first paper on the tool was published at SCAM 2011 and since then it has fostered a wide range of research innovations throughout software engineering and been awarded the Mining Software Repositories 2020 Foundational Contribution Award. Many SCAMers have used the tool in their own research, making this paper well deserving of the MIP award. 
 The Most Influential Paper Co-chairs are Arpad Beszedes and Dawn Lawrie.
