About 
 EKAW (European Knowledge Acquisition Workshop) started in 1987 as the European analogue to the KAW (Knowledge Acquisition Workshop) series of workshops in North America and the PKAW series in the Asian-Pacific area. Together, KAW, EKAW and PKAW defined the key venues for research in Knowledge-Based Systems in the 80s and 90s, in particular for those researchers who were especially interested in the issues associated with the computational representation of knowledge and human expert behavior. 
 While EKAW started as a workshop, as a result of its success and its emergence as the premier forum for research in Knowledge-Based Systems in Europe, it eventually became a conference in 2000, with the formal title of “International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management”, while still maintaining the original EKAW acronym and brand. This change took place at the same time as the KAW series of workshops concluded in North America and gave birth to the International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP), whose first edition was held in 2001 in Banff, Canada. 
 Today, EKAW and K-CAP define the two main fora for research in Knowledge-Based Systems and are held on alternate years. A key aspect of the EKAW/K-CAP community is that, while it is in no way homogenous with respect to paradigms and approaches, as pointed out in [Motta, 2013], “it is also possible to identify “a common mode of thought and a set of shared assumptions”. These can be reconducted to i) a ‘holistic’ approach to knowledge engineering, not merely viewed as yet another computing field, but rather as an activity informed as much by technology as the cognitive and social sciences; and ii) an emphasis on “the pursuit of reusable patterns in problem solving and in domain descriptions” [Musen, 2013]. Hence we can characterize the ultimate goal of research in this area as that of providing “rigorous epistemological and engineering foundations to the area, at a level rather more conceptual than the one normally adopted in knowledge representation research” [Motta, 2013]. 
 Over 30 years after its first edition, EKAW is still going from strength to strength. This demonstrates the vitality and robust state of health of this area of research and also confirms that, while the landscape has changed so much in the past 30 years, the key issues to do with effective knowledge engineering and management are still as relevant today as they were 30 years ago.

 Call for Papers 
 The 24th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (EKAW-24) encompasses the diverse realms of eliciting, acquiring, modeling, and managing knowledge. The conference addresses the pivotal role of knowledge in constructing systems and services for the semantic web knowledge management knowledge discovery, information integration, natural language processing intelligent systems e-business, e-health, humanities, cultural heritage, and beyond. 
 EKAW-24's Special Theme: Knowledge in the Age of Language Models (LMs). In addition to the topics above this year's conference invites research articles focusing on algorithms tools methodologies, and applications that leverage the interplay between knowledge and LMs. The contributions should deepen our understanding of how LMs contribute to the dynamic landscape of knowledge acquisition and engineering and vice versa. 
 All submissions, including those related to LMs, should establish a clear connection to Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management or demonstrate a significant impact on the field. While acknowledging the interdisciplinary nature of knowledge and its interplay with other disciplines and technologies, such as Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision contributions lacking direct relevance to Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management will not be considered pertinent to the EKAW conference. 
 Topics of interest 
 Knowledge and (Small/Large) Language Models (LMs)LM-enhanced ontology and knowledge engineering methodologies and tools 
 Ontology evaluation via LMs 
 (Ontological) knowledge memorization in LMs 
 Knowledge-based techniques for LMs (Retrieval Augmented Generation based approaches fact-checking, and bias mitigation)

 EKAW-24 distinguishes between research, in-use, and position papers. The papers will all have the same status and follow the same formatting guidelines in the proceedings but will receive special treatment during the reviewing phase. In particular, each paper type will be subject to its own evaluation criteria: 
 Research papers: These are standard papers presenting a novel method, technique, or analysis with appropriate empirical or other types of evaluation as a proof-of-concept. The main evaluation criteria here will be originality, technical soundness, and validation. 
 In-use papers: These are papers describing knowledge management and engineering applications in real environments. Applications must address a sufficiently interesting and challenging problem, work with real-world data, and involve real users. The focus is less on the originality of the approach and more on presenting systems that solve a significant problem while addressing the particular challenges that come with the use of real-world data. Evaluations are essential for this type of paper and should involve a representative subset of the actual users of the system. 
 Position papers: These are papers describing novel innovative, and disruptive ideas. Position papers may also comprise an analysis of currently unsolved problems or review these problems from a new perspective to contribute to their better understanding within the research community. We expect that such papers will guide future research by highlighting critical assumptions, motivating the difficulty of a specific problem, or explaining why current techniques are not sufficient, possibly corroborated by quantitative and qualitative arguments. 
 Submissions and Publications 
 Pre-submission of abstracts is a strict requirement. All papers and abstracts have to be submitted electronically via EasyChair:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ekaw2024" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ekaw2024
As inhref="https://link.springer.com/conference/ekaw" - past editions
, accepted papers will be published by Springer in an LNAI volume. Submissions must be in PDF, formatted in the style ofLNCSconference proceedings. For details and available templates (Latex, Microsoft Word), see theSpringer’s conference proceedings guidelines. 
 The following page limits (references excluded) apply: 
 Research and In-use papers: 15 pages; 
 Position papers: 8 pages. 
 Submissions must be in English and must be prepared for single-blind review. Manuscripts that are already uploaded on Arxiv but not published anywhere are allowed for submission. However, dual submissions are not allowed. 
 Neither plagiarism nor self-plagiarism is tolerated. Please be advised that a plagiarism-checking tool may be applied to screen for plagiarism. 
 Large Language Models Policy of EKAW-24: Papers that include text generated from a Large Language Model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, are prohibited unless this generated text is presented as a part of the experimental analysis of the article. AI tools may be used to edit and polish authors' work, such as using LLMs for light editing of their text (e.g., automate grammar checks, word autocorrect, and other editing work), but the text "produced entirely" by AI is not allowed. We rely on the LLM policy as stated inICML 2023. 
 Registration 
 One full registration for the conference at the regular rate is required for each accepted paper.
