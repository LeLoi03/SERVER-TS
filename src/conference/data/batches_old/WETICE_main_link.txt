 Event Venue 
 Catania, Sicily, Italy 
 Catania has a long and eventful history, having been founded about 2750 years ago in a very fertile area at the foot of the biggest volcano in Europe, Mount Etna. The first Sicilian University and one of the oldest in Italy was founded here in 1434. The city hosts many archeological sites, museums, churches and theatres and is close to several UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Besides the rich history, the magnificient Baroque architecture and the black-lava landscape, Catania is also known for its typical street food and active nightlife. 
 University of Catania, at Benedictine Monastery of “San Nicolò 
 The conference venue is one of the most beautiful city historical buildings: the Benedictine Monastery of “San Nicolò”. At 10 minutes walk from the Catania main Cathedral square you find the Monastery of San Nicolò l’Arena, a late baroque monument and one of the biggest Benedictine monastery in Europe. The construction of the building started in 1500 and has continued until today. It is an example of architectonical integration of different styles through different epochs: you can find a roman house, the cloisters and a roof garden. The monastery is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It hosts the Department of Humanities (DISUM) of the University of Catania
