 CALL FOR PAPERS 
 Submit a Paper 
 IEEE LANMAN has an established tradition as a forum for presenting and discussing the latest technical advances in local and metropolitan area networking. Cutting-edge papers spanning both theory and experimentation are solicited in all areas of networking. In keeping with the heritage of the symposium, there will be a central theme, and in 2025 the theme is “Networking and Computing under AI.” 
 The Internet continues to evolve at an extraordinary pace, driven by an explosive growth in devices, users, and data-intensive applications. Today’s landscape demands networks that deliver ultra-low latency and high throughput to support transformative applications like immersive Virtual Reality, cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence, autonomous driving, and advanced IoT systems. This rapid evolution introduces complex challenges for network design and management, particularly in ensuring seamless communication under stringent performance requirements. 
 Recent developments in local and metropolitan area networking present exciting opportunities to address these challenges. Advances in wireless technologies leveraging millimetre-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) frequencies, coupled with innovative paradigms like Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), Massive-MIMO architectures, and Cell-Free networks, are reshaping the wireless and wired connectivity. These technologies enable highly adaptive, energy-efficient, and capacity-rich solutions. Moreover, the integration of AI-driven network orchestration and edge computing further enhances the ability to meet the growing demand for real-time responsiveness and expansive bandwidth, and they ensure that the next generation of applications can operate reliably and efficiently in increasingly dynamic and dense network environments. 
 The intimate single-track format of the symposium encourages stimulating exchanges between researchers. The event is expected to be a forum for discussion of new and interdisciplinary ideas on network access protocols, network management and control, services and applications. 
 Papers are solicited on any topic in networking, including, but not limited to: 
 5G and 6G cellular data networking 
 AI and machine learning for local and metropolitan area networking 
 AI and machine learning for network measurement and traffic analysis 
 Cloud, edge, and fog computing integration 
 Co-existence and heterogeneity support at the edge (HetNets) 
 Datacenter networks 
 Energy efficiency for local and metropolitan area networking 
 Information-centric networking in local and metropolitan areas 
 Information security for local and metropolitan area networking 
 Intelligent routing, forwarding, and scheduling 
 Machine-to-machine communication 
 Networking designs for AI and ML 
 Networking for online education and entertainment 
 Networking protocols and architectures for the IoTs 
 Network and transport mechanisms for latency reduction 
 Network virtualization in local and metropolitan areas 
 Network Digital Twins (NDTs) and AI/ML 
 Network verification using AI/ML 
 NetOps and AI/ML 
 Network security and AI/ML 
 Performance and reliability of local and metropolitan area networks 
 Public safety networks 
 Self-learning network architectures 
 Software-defined networking in local and metropolitan areas 
 Wireless access technologies 
 Satellite networks and their integration with terrestrial network infrastructure 
 Network protocols and architectures 
 IEEE LANMAN 2025 solicits paper submissions of papers up to 6 pages. Short papers up to 2 pages are also solicited on work-in-progress ideas. Some regular paper submissions may be accepted as short papers (2 pages) by the TPC. The page limits include all figures, tables, and references. All papers must be electronically submitted in PDF according to the guidelines in the symposium websitehref="http://www.ieee-lanman.org" - http://www.ieee-lanman.org
. The proceedings will be published in IEEE Xplore and will include both short and regular papers presented at the symposium. A best paper award will be awarded.
