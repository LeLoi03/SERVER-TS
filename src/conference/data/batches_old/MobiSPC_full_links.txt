 to MobiSPC 2025 that will be held in conjunction with 
 The 22nd International Conference on Future Networks and Communications (FNC) 
 Mobile Systems and Pervasive Computing (MobiSPC) have evolved into an active area of research and development. This is due to the tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics, including wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, RFID technology, and the ubiquitous mobile phone. MobiSPC-2025 solicits papers that focus on the theory, systems, practices and challenges of providing users with a successful mobile or wireless experience. This includes how mobile computing changes how people pervasively use their computers, computing resources and applications, as well the systems, services and technology enabling those applications. 
 MobiSPC 2025 will provide a leading edge, scholarly forum for researchers, engineers, and students alike to share their state-of-the art research and developmental work in the broad areas of pervasive computing and communications. The MobiSPC-2025 will be held in conjunction withhref="http://cs-conferences.acadiau.ca/fnc-25/" - The 20th International Conference on Future Networks and Communications (FNC 2025).
Mobispc 2025 will be held in the city of Leuven.Leuvenis the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in Belgium. It is located about 25 kilometres (16 miles) east of Brussels. It is the 10th largest municipality in Belgium and the fourth in Flanders. Leuven is home to the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, the largest and oldest university of the Low Countries and the oldest Catholic university still in existence. The related university hospital of UZ Leuven, is one of the largest hospitals of Europe. The city is also known for being the headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer and one of the five largest consumer-goods companies in the world. 
 Leuven's Town Hall is one of the best-known Gothic town halls worldwide and Leuven's pride and joy. It took three architects and thirty years to build it. Leuven's 'Hall of Fame' features 236 statues, which were only added to the façade after 1850. There are 220 men and 16 women in total. On the bottom floor are famous Leuven scientists, artists and historical figures, dressed in Burgundian garb. The first floor is reserved for the patron saints of the various parishes of Leuven. Above them the façade is adorned by the counts and dukes of Brabant while the towers primarily feature biblical figures.

,August 4-6, 2025, Leuven, BelgiumDescription 
 Medicine is under a constant evolution, but there are different people that needs different treatments. It is included in the subject of personalized medicine, where the treatments are adapted to the patients. Technology offers a wide possibility of a patient empowerment with technological equipments, including sensors, mobile devices, and others. It allows the acquisition of different data and allows the application of different treatments remotely. These developments are mainly included in information and communication technologies (ICT) technologies for wellbeing and heal thcare. 
 Telehealth and telemedicine refer to the use of telecommunications and virtual technology to deliver health care. In the present, technological development transformed healthcare. Systems evolution including data analytics, artificial intelligence, the Internet of things, increased connecting and use of health-related mobile allowed this transformation. Recently, telemedicine developed due to the increasing availability of systems and access but also growing demand of solutions during COVID-19 pandemic. Recent trends change health care monitoring and recovery from the healthcare institutions to a patient-centered care delivered at home. Additionally, patient empowerment is a focal point in healthcare evolution, to allow patients to manage their health and adapt to chronic diseases. Technological advancements play a central role in the promotion of patient empowerment by providing access and remote support that might contribute to overcome challenges of geographic location and promote equal access to healthcare. 
 In the case of medical rehabilitation and assistive technology, research in applications of ICT have contributed greatly to the enhancement of quality of life and full integration of all citizens into society. The use of Cloud computing and network connections, exploits the exchange of the information and improvement of these systems in the different fields, including the healthcare and traffic management. These developments should be closely performed with the participation of healthcare professionals. There are different solutions currently under development related to this field and, as it contributes to improve the quality of life, it can interact in the development of technologies for social help. It is a multidisciplinary and wide subject for the wellbeing. The authors from all fields working in these subjects are encouraged to submit a paper presenting their recent work, or a scientific discussion on the topic.
