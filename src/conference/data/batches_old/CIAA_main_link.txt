 Welcome to CIAA 2025  
   The International Conference on Implementation and Application of Automata  (CIAA) is an annual conference that aims to bring together members of the academic, research, and industrial community who have an interest in the theory, implementation, and application of automata and related structures. The conference concerns research on all aspects of implementation and application of automata and related structures, including theoretical aspects.
