 COCOON 2025 
 The 31st International Computing and Combinatorics Conference 
 August 15 - August 17 2025 
 Chengdu, China 
 The 31st International Computing and Combinatorics Conference (COCOON 2025) will be held in Chengdu, China during 15-17 August, 2025. Original research papers in the areas of algorithms, theory of computation, computational complexity, and combinatorics related to computing are solicited. In addition to theoretical results, we are also interested in submissions that report on experimental and applied research of general algorithmic interest. Special consideration will be given to research that is motivated by real-world problems. Experimental and applied papers are expected to show convincingly the usefulness and efficiency of the algorithms discussed in a practical setting. 
 Paper Submission 
 The submission should contain scholarly exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including the motivation and a clear comparison with related work. The length of the submission should not exceed 12 pages in LNCS style (including references, but excluding the optional appendix). Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are available here. The submitted papers will be reviewed in adouble-blindpeer review manner. Please delete the author information on your manuscript.All submissions must be submitted electronically through Easychair.href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cocoon2025" - This is the submission link

 Paper Submission 
 The submission should contain scholarly exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including the motivation and a clear comparison with related work. The length of the submission should not exceed 12 pages inLNCS style(including references, but excluding the optional appendix). Appendices should be placed at the end of the main body (after references, in the same file). For code and data, authors can provide anonymous download links or refer to an anonymized GitHub repository. The Program Committee (PC) will review the content in the appendices and links at their discretion. The submitted papers will be reviewed in adouble-blindpeer review manner.

 Publication 
 The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, and will be available for distribution at the conference. Selected high quality papers will be invited for submission to some journals. Previous COCOON proceedings were also published by Springer, which can be found from the link:href="https://link.springer.com/conference/cocoon" - https://link.springer.com/conference/cocoon
Awards 
 Awards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper. To be eligible for the best student paper award, all authors must be full-time students at the time of submission. Please indicate in the final line of the abstract that the paper is being considered for the best student paper award. The program committee reserves the right to withhold these awards or to split them between multiple recipients.
