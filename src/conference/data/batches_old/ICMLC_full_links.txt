 Welcome to ICMLC & ICWAPR 2025 
 **Special Annoucement** 
  
 Our organizing committee has become aware of another conference with the identical name, the International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC), which is scheduled to take place in Bali, Indonesia, this July. Please be noticed that our ICMLC conference, established in 2002, will be celebrating its 24th anniversary next year. It is technically sponsored by the IEEE SMC Society, and all accepted papers will be sent to IEEE Xplore for indexing. We deeply regret that the organizers of the other ICMLC have chosen the same name, location, and timing for their event. 
  
 To distinguish our event, potential participants can identify it by the following: 
 1) our official website https://www.icmlc.com/, 
 2) IEEE sponsorship, and 
 3) support from the University of Adelaide.

 The International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC) is entering its 24th year while the International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition (ICWAPR) is marching towards its 22nd anniversary, we are all excited and committed to our vision: organizing good quality international conferences that provide valuable educational services to young researchers, particularly in Asia region. 
 ICMLC and ICWAPR 2025 will also offer a leading platform for participants from academia and industry to exchange and develop research ideas on Machine Learning, Cybernetics, and Wavelet Analysis, with special focus this year on adversarial learning, generative adversarial network, and uncertainty modelling. 
 In addition to keynote speakers, the two conferences offer free tutorials research consultation sessions, Lotfi Zadeh Best Paper Awards, Ph.D. Consultation, special issues of SCI indexed journals, and plenty of opportunities for you to build up your own professional network while you can come and meet with the Editors-In-Chief, IEEE Fellows and the IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society leaders. 
 Authors are invited to submit original papers that contain significant research results, development work, and innovative practices. The conferences will be held in Bali, Indonesia on 12-15 July 2025.

 Over the years, the International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics (ICMLC) has emerged as the leading international gathering of people from academia, professionals and industry in the field of Machine Learning and Cybernetics. In this annual conference, researchers and practitioners from around the world gather together to interact, to inform and to inspire. 
 Leading international researchers, including leaders from IEEE, especially the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society, will serve as Tutorial and Keynote Speakers. ICMLC attendees will have many opportunities to network and discuss their research with these prominent peers. ICMLC also provides a quality platform for the broad dissemination of significant research results and innovative practices through conference presentations and published proceedings. Furthermore, authors have the opportunity of further development of their work via journal and monograph publications too. Additionally, ICMLC has research consultation sessions, well-focused invited sessions on leading technologies, panels on topics of great interest to participants, and conference awards for Lotfi Zadeh Best Paper Awards and Best Student Conference Paper Awards. We invite authors to submit original papers that contain significant research results, development work, and innovative practices to ICMLC 2025. ICMLC 2025 will be held on July 12-15, 2025 in Bali, Indonesia.
