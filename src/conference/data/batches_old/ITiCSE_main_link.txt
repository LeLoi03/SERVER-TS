 ITiCSE 2025 (30 June-2 July, Netherlands) 
 Welcome to the 30th annualACMconference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE). ITiCSE conference is sponsored by theACM Special Interest Group on Computing Education (SIGCSE), in collaboration with theACM Europe Council, andInformatics Europe. ITiCSE 2025 will take place in Radboud University, Netherlands. 
 href="https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/" - Call for Participation
Welcome to Nijmegen 
 Nijmegen is a city in the east of the Netherlands. It is located close to the German border, and at the same time very well-connected with both the Dutch capital Amsterdam and the nearby national airport. 
 Nijmegen is the oldest city in the Netherlands, with a city center full of important historical locations. Nijmegen was founded by the Romans as an important base because of its strategic location. The city of Nijmegen is exciting, interesting, and has a turbulent history. 
 And it’s not just a rich cultural history that Nijmegen has to offer. Nijmegen is a lively city with many cozy restaurants, bars and terraces that give the city a young vibe. Furthermore, you can find examples of modern architecture. For instance, a spectacular water management project ‘Room for the River’ was completed a few years ago, involving a change of the course of the river and the creation of an artificial island. 
 Conference venue 
 The ITICSE 2025 conference will take place at Radboud University. The green campus of the university is located outside the city center of Nijmegen and is easily accessible by bike or public transport. Radboud University is a broad university where research and education go hand in hand. Students and staff members feel connected to each other, to society, and to the world around them. For the conference, we are happy to welcome you at the Faculty of Science, in the modern Huygens Building.

 This page provides detailed information about paper submissions to the ITiCSE 2025 conference. It is part of the generalhref="https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/" - Call for Participation
which you should read first, if you have not yet done so. 
 If you have questions that neither this page nor thehref="https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/" - Call for Participation

 ITiCSE 2025 paper tracks 
 Papers presented at ITiCSE address aspects of computing education, that is, the education of students who are studying computing. 
 Note that anabstract submissionis mandatory for all papers and is due a week before the deadline for full papers. 
 When making a submission, you will be asked to place it in one of three tracks. Please ensure that you submit your paper to the correct track. Authors are advised to look at thehref="https://iticse.acm.org/2025/paper-review-process/" - review guidelines
for their paper track, so as to know what the reviewers will be looking for when reviewing the submission. Papers will be reviewed according to the track to which they were submitted, and it will not be moved between tracks. 
 Computing education research | : papers that define research questions, describe the data gathering and the methods used to address the questions, present the results, and discuss the contribution to knowledge about the teaching and learning of computing; 
 Experience reports and tools | : papers that describe computing education experiences, including tools that have been developed for use in computing education, in sufficient detail for others to see whether their use was beneficial and to be able to adopt them if required; these papers will generally be motivated by the literature, will highlight the novelty of the work, and will be accompanied by a rich description of what worked and what didn’t; 
 Position papers and proposals | : papers articulating original and well-argued positions on aspects of computing education, or proposals for work that is in its early stages; while these papers should be well situated in the literature, they need not report on work that has been completed; however, they must offer something of value to the community – the intention to carry out some work is not necessarily a worthwhile contribution in its own right. 
  
 All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and where there is an intervention contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention. Initial submissions must be anonymous. 
 Submitting the abstract 
 Your abstract can be up to 250 words andmust be submitted by the paper abstract deadline (see the sidebar for thesehref="https://iticse.acm.org/2025/important-dates/" - dates
). The abstract will be plain text — not, for example, a PDF. When you log in to submit the abstract, you may paste the abstract text into the form field. 
 Follow the instructions onhref="https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/#process" - Submission process
at the foot of thehref="https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/" - Call for Participation
page. 
 The abstract helps reviewers bid for papers that they are qualified to review and interested in reviewing. To help the bidding and reviewing process, please submit an abstract that you believe will best describe the finished paper. 
 Anonymous version for review 
 Please read this section carefully to avoid the unfortunate situation of a desk rejection. 
 The paper submitted for reviewmust be a fully anonymous versionso as to allow the authors an unbiased review. The anonymous version should have ALL identifying references to the authors removed: this includes authors’ names; authors’ affiliations; any information in the body or the headers of the paper that might identify the authors or their institutions, such as websites, related publications, or specific geographic locations; and acknowledgements, which often include material that might identify the authors. Self-citations need not be removed if they are worded so that the reviewer doesn’t know that the authors are citing themselves. For example, instead of “We reported on our first experiment in 2018 [13]”, the paper might say “An early experiment in this area was carried out in 2018 [13]”, or “Katchen and Satie [13] carried out an early experiment in this area in 2018”. If a paper is presenting software that is the work of the authors, the name of the software should be anonymised, so that it will not be found with a web search. 
 When writing the review version of the paper,space should be left for the authors’ names, affiliations, and other material that might need to be added, such as the ACM reference format. This can be implemented either by the use of placeholders or simply by ensuring that the paper is sufficiently short of the page limit. Submissions that fully use the page limit, without leaving space for these items, will be rejected on the grounds of exceeding the page limit. 
 Papers are expected to stand alone, and not to require the reading of supplementary information. For this reason,they should not include links to additional material, such as a demonstration of software being introduced. 
 If the paper is accepted for the conference and for publication, authors will be asked to complete a camera-ready copy that will include all appropriate author names, affiliations, citations, acknowledgements, and references, and that may, if appropriate, include links to supplementary information. 
 We are aware that some authors publish their papers prior to submission in places such as arXiv, with full author details. This is permitted according toACM policy. However, this does breach anonymity as such papers can easily be found by a reviewer looking for background on the subject matter. In view of this, we recommend submitting to arXiv or such sites with a different title and abstract than the submitted (review) version to cut down on “accidental” discoveries of papers on arXiv that would compromise anonymity. 
 Ethical status of data collection 
 Any submission that makes use of data from human participants (including student surveys, class results, educator interviews, published data sets, etc) must clearly indicate whether approval has been granted for the use of that data, by what authority (respecting anonymity in the version submitted for review), and what the approval covers. If the work includes any data from human participants that has not been granted approval, that should be clearly explained. 
 Formatting the paper 
 The paper is limited to a maximum of six pages plus one page for references. Note that this is not the same as seven pages: if there is a seventh page, there must be nothing on it but references. 
 If the paper includes figures and tables, the text in them must be readable at 100% magnification and in greyscale. Figures and tables must be readable if the paper is printed. 
 For details regarding the mandatory formatting requirements, seehref="https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/#formatting" - Formatting requirements
on thehref="https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/" - Call for Participation
page. 
 Please ensure that the file to be submitted is no more than 10MB in size. When files are this size and more, it is typically because the authors have pasted in high-resolution images and simply scaled them down, rather than reducing the file size before inserting the image. 
 Important dates 
 Important dates can be found in the sidebar on the right or athref="https://iticse.acm.org/2025/important-dates/" - Important Dates

 Submitting the paper 
 Follow the instructions onhref="https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/#process" - Submission process
at the foot of thehref="https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/" - Call for Participation
page. 
 Please do not wait until the last minute to submit your paper because that is when everyone else will be connecting to our server! 
 When the paper is fully anonymous and ready for review, convert it to Adobe PDF format. Please check the settings of your converter so it does not inadvertently include your name and affiliation in the properties of the PDF file. 
 Return to the online submission system using the link on thehref="https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation" - call for participation
page, select the entry for your paper, and click a link in the upper right of the page to add or update the file. 
 After receiving confirmation, go to the submission site to review your submission for accuracy. 
 Please note:ITiCSE 2025 will be a face-to-face conference. Registration, attendance in person, presentation, and discussion are mandatory for at least one author, otherwise, your publication cannot be included in the proceedings. See ourhref="https://iticse.acm.org/2025/iticse-2025-policies/" - full policy

Welcome to Nijmegen 
 Nijmegen is a city in the east of the Netherlands. It is located close to the German border, and at the same time very well-connected with both the Dutch capital Amsterdam and the nearby national airport. 
 Nijmegen is the oldest city in the Netherlands, with a city center full of important historical locations. Nijmegen was founded by the Romans as an important base because of its strategic location. The city of Nijmegen is exciting, interesting, and has a turbulent history. 
 And it’s not just a rich cultural history that Nijmegen has to offer. Nijmegen is a lively city with many cozy restaurants, bars and terraces that give the city a young vibe. Furthermore, you can find examples of modern architecture. For instance, a spectacular water management project ‘Room for the River’ was completed a few years ago, involving a change of the course of the river and the creation of an artificial island. 
 Conference venue 
 The ITICSE 2025 conference will take place at Radboud University. The green campus of the university is located outside the city center of Nijmegen and is easily accessible by bike or public transport. Radboud University is a broad university where research and education go hand in hand. Students and staff members feel connected to each other, to society, and to the world around them. For the conference, we are happy to welcome you at the Faculty of Science, in the modern Huygens Building.
