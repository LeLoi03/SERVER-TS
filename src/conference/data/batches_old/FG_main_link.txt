 FG 2025 
 The IEEE conference series on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition is the premier international forum for research in image and video-based face, gesture, and body movement recognition. It is co-sponsored byIEEE Biometrics CouncilandIEEE Computer Society. Its broad scope includes advances in fundamental computer vision, pattern recognition, and computer graphics; machine learning techniques relevant to face, gesture, and body motion; interdisciplinary research on behavioral analysis; new algorithms and applications. Topics of interest include but are not limited to: 
 Face recognition & biometrics 
 Face analysis and synthesis 
 Body action and activity recognition 
 Gesture recognition, analysis, and synthesis 
 Affective computing and multi-modal interaction 
 Psychological and behavioral analysis 
 Perceptual and cognitive aspects of non-verbal interaction

 Call For Papers 
 INSTRUCTIONS OF PAPER SUBMISSION FOR REVIEW 
 Submissions to FG 2025 should have no substantial overlap with any other paper already submitted or published, or to be submitted during the FG 2025 review period. All persons who have made any substantial contribution to the work should be listed as authors, and all listed authors should have made some substantial contribution to the work. All authors should be aware that the paper is submitted to FG 2025. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Face recognition, analysis and synthesis, 
 Gesture recognition, analysis and synthesis, 
 Body motion analysis and synthesis, 
 Action recognition, 
 Psychological and behavioral analysis, 
 Technologies and applications 
 The submissions are open, and you can submit your paper through the CMT System:href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FG2025" - https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FG2025
Two-round submission 
 FG 2025 will use a two-round reviewing procedure. New papers can be submitted in either the first or the second round. The primary benefit of submitting in Round 1 is that submissions can be invited for resubmission to Round 2, enabling authors to address reviewer concerns and significantly improve their work. 
 Round 1 
 Notifications to authors: 13 December 2024 
 Paper submission: | 23 September 2024, 11:59 PST | 30 September 2024, 11:59 pm PST (Extended) 
 Round 2 
 Paper submission: | January, 25th, 2025, 11:59pm PSTJanuary, 31st, 2025, 11:59pm PST 
 Notifications to authors: | April 4th, 2025 
 Paper format and submission 
 Format. FG 2025 will consider two different paper types, i.e., Short and Long Papers. Authors should carefully consider the category before submitting a paper. 
 Short paper: | 4 pages + 1 page for references 
 Long paper: | 8 pages (+ any number of references) 
 The main difference between the two is in the size of contributions and not in their importance or technical quality. In other words, a long paper is expected to have a greater contribution than a short paper. More specifically: 
 Long papers(8 pages excluding references) should present original reports of substantive new research techniques, findings, and applications. They should place the work within the field and clearly indicate innovative aspects. Research procedures and technical methods should be presented in sufficient detail to ensure scrutiny and reproducibility. Results should be clearly communicated and implications of the contributions/findings for FG and beyond should be explicitly discussed. 
 Short papers(4 pages + 1 page for references) should present original and highly promising research or applications. Merit will be assessed in terms of originality, importance, and technical quality more so than scope and maturity of the work. 
 Please note that both long and short papers will undergo the same review process. Rejected long papers will NOT be considered for acceptance as short papers, except for rare cases when reviewers unanimously make this recommendation. Both long and short papers can be accepted for oral or poster presentation. 
 Submissions have to be in pdf format and are limited to a 10MB file size for both categories. Supplementary material (images, video, etc.) may optionally be submitted with papers, but be sure to maintain anonymity, including the file properties or other hidden text. The entire submission (paper + supplemental material) has a file size limit of 100MB. The supplemental materials will not be part of the conference proceedings, so they are only there to aid the reviewing process. Reviewers are not required to view the supplemental material (though most reviewers are likely to do so), so any information critical to understanding the work should be in the main paper. All supplementary material must be self-contained and zipped into a single file. Note that reviewers will be encouraged to look at it, but are not obligated to do so. 
 FG 2025 will be using IEEE PDF eXpress for enforcing the requirements for papers to appear in IEEE Xplore. The final versions of all papers accepted for publication must adhere to IEEE Xplore PDF specifications. 
 Paper templates are available here: 
 href="https://fg2025.ieee-biometrics.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/630/FG2025_Latex_template.zip" - Latex Template 
 href="https://fg2025.ieee-biometrics.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/630/FG2025_Word_template_forReview.zip" - Word Template 
 Submissions stepsPrepare your manuscripts as per the IEEE specification using the following templates for both Long Paper and Short Paper: Latex template or Word template 
 Carefully proofread your submission 
 Submit to the FG 2025 CMT system: | href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FG2025" - https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/FG2025 
 NOTE: List all authors during initial submission. Modifying the author list after the review process is not allowed. 
 Papers presented at FG 2025 will be sent for inclusion into the IEEE Xplore digital library, including workshop papers. If a paper is accepted, it is assumed that an author will register and attend the conference to present the paper. Papers that are not presented will not be published in IEEE Xplore. 
 Awards and TBIOM Special Issue 
 Several awards will be given out to the best papers from FG 2025, including (1) the best paper award, (2) the best student paper award, and (3) the test-of-time awards. The awards will consist of a commemorative plaque as well as award money. 
 A selection of best reviewed papers from FG 2025 will be invited to contribute to a special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Biometrics, Behavior and Identity Science (IEEE TBIOM). 
 Resubmission of Revised Papers 
 Authors that received aRevisiondecision in the first reviewing round are invited to resubmit a revised version of their paper together with a point by point response to the main concerns raised by the reviewers. The resubmission should include: 
 A clean version of the revised paper 
 A revised version of the paper with the changes clearly marked with colored text, and 
 A | one-page | rebuttal PDF with responses to the reviewer comments and details on how they were addressed. 
 Please use the paper templates posted above to generate the clean and colored version of the paper as well as the 1-page response to the comments of the reviewers. Note that reviewers are not required to look at the response document if it exceeds the 1-page limit. 
 Submissions steps 
 Login to CMT: (COMING SOON) 
 Find your first round submission paper with the Revision decision 
 Click the “Upload Revision” option on the right 
 Upload: | The clean version of your paper (name it PaperID_clean.pdf, e.g, Paper120_clean.pdf) 
 A ZIP archive with two files: 1) the 1-page PDF rebuttal (name it PaperID_rebuttal.pdf, e.g., Paper120_rebuttal.pdf) and 2) the revised colored version of the paper (name it PaperID_colored.pdf, e.g., Paper120_colored.pdf). Name the ZIP archive PaperID.zip (e.g., Paper120.zip). 
 Validate that you see both of the uploaded files in CMT. 
 Note that both files are required for the revision. The upload size limit is 50MB. For detailed instruction with screenshots, please see theGoogle Docs Revision instructions. 
 ARXIV Policy 
 FG 2025does not consider a paper on arXiv.org as a dual submission. 
 Anonymization policy 
 Authors should remove author and institutional identities from the title and header areas of the paper. There should also be no acknowledgments. Authors can leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account. However, they should cite their own work in the third person (e.g., “[22] found that…”)
