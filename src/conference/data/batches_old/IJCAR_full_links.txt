 Home - CADE 
 CADE is the major international forum at which research on all aspects of automated deduction is presented. The first conference was held in 1975. Previous CADEs were mostly biennial, and annual conferences started in 1996. Since 2001 CADE has participated in the International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR). 
 Next Conference:CADE-30, 28th July - 2nd August 2025, Stuttgart, Germany.

 1 - 6 July 2024, The 12th International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning (IJCAR 2024), Nancy, France 
 Date: 1 - 6 July 2024 
 Location: Nancy, France 
 Deadline: Monday 29 January 2024 
 IJCAR is the premier international joint conference on all topics in automated reasoning. It is the merger conference of leading events in automated reasoning: CADE (Conference on Automated Deduction), FroCoS (Symposium on Frontiers of Combining Systems) and TABLEAUX (Conference on Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods Topics). 
 A two-day workshop and tutorial programme will be co-organized with the conference. In addition, the annual CADE ATP System Competition (CASC) will be held during the conference. 
 IJCAR 2024 invites submissions related to all aspects of automated or interactive logical reasoning, including foundations, implementations, and applications. All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another peer-reviewed journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome: Regular papers describing solid new research results (up to 15 pages), and Short papers describing implemented systems, user experiences, case studies and domain models (up to 7 pages). All submissions will be judged on relevance, originality, significance, correctness, and readability. IJCAR 2024 will recognize the most outstanding submissions with a best paper award and a best student paper award at the conference.
