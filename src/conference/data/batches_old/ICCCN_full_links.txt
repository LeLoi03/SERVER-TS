If the registered/paid author cannot attend/give a presentation onsite then the author can transfer his/her reg to another author of the paper who will present the paper onsite (please see the registration transfer procedures in “Author Information” posted at the ICCCN 2024 website). 
 Workshops: 
 ICCCN 2024 workshops are exciting forums to present, discuss, and formulate specialize topics and emerging hot research topics (new areas, new problems or new methods). The workshops offer a perspective distinct from and complementary to the research themes of the main conference. Workshop manuscripts should be no longer than6 pagesincluding all figures/tables and references. The detailed info can be found in each workshop’s Call for Papers from (href="http://www.icccn.org/icccn24/workshop/list-of-workshops/" - http://www.icccn.org/icccn24/workshop/list-of-workshops/

 Poster Papers: 
 ICCCN 2024 provides an opportunity to present in-progress work in the fields of computer communications and networks. Topics of interest are the same as the research topics in the ICCCN 2024 conference Call for Papers. Early implementations, prototypes, work-in-progress systems/applications as well as commercial products that are related to the topics are welcome. Presenting a poster is an effective way to obtain early and valuable feedback from a knowledgeable crowd at the conference.
