 Welcome Message 
 With the rapid growth in computing and communications technology, the past decade has witnessed a proliferation of powerful parallel and distributed systems and an ever increasing demand for practice of high performance computing and communications (HPCC). HPCC has moved into the mainstream of computing and has become a key technology in determining future research and development activities in many academic and industrial branches, especially when the solution of large and complex problems must cope with very tight timing schedules. 
 Among a series of highly successful International Conferences on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC), the HPCC-2025 conference is the 27th edition of a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to address the resulting profound challenges and to present and discuss their new ideas, research results, applications and experience on all aspects of high performance computing and communications. IEEE HPCC-2025 is sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, and IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC). 
 The 27th IEEE HPCC follows the tradition of previous successful IEEE HPCC conferences in the years from 2005 to 2024 in Asia, Europe, Australia, and America. It will feature sessions of regular presentations, workshops, tutorials and keynote speeches. IEEE HPCC-2025 will be hosted in Exeter, the capital city of Devon and provides the county with a central base for education, medicine, religion, commerce and culture. The city is also home to the magnificent Exeter Cathedral, which dates back to Norman times. Exeter is also ideally placed to base a trip to branch out visiting places such as the famous Dartmoor National Park and the unspoilt beaches of the North and South Devon coastlines. 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to HPCC-2025. Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.

 INTRODUCTION 
 With the rapid growth in computing and communications technology, the past decade has witnessed a proliferation of powerful parallel and distributed systems and an ever increasing demand for practice of high performance computing and communications (HPCC). HPCC has moved into the mainstream of computing and has become a key technology in determining future research and development activities in many academic and industrial branches, especially when the solution of large and complex problems must cope with very tight timing schedules. 
 Among a series of highly successful International Conferences on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC), the HPCC-2025 conference is the 27th edition of a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to address the resulting profound challenges and to present and discuss their new ideas, research results, applications and experience on all aspects of high performance computing and communications. IEEE HPCC-2025 is sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, and IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC). 
 The 27th IEEE HPCC follows the tradition of previous successful IEEE HPCC conferences in the years from 2005 to 2024 in Asia, Europe, Australia, and America. It will feature sessions of regular presentations, workshops, tutorials and keynote speeches. IEEE HPCC-2025 will be hosted in Exeter, the capital city of Devon and provides the county with a central base for education, medicine, religion, commerce and culture. The city is also home to the magnificent Exeter Cathedral, which dates back to Norman times. Exeter is also ideally placed to base a trip to branch out visiting places such as the famous Dartmoor National Park and the unspoilt beaches of the North and South Devon coastlines. 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to HPCC-2025. Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.

 (HPCC-2025)

 Sponsored by 
 IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, and IEEE Technical Committee of Scalable Computing (TCSC) 
  
 INTRODUCTION 
 With the rapid growth in computing and communications technology, the past decade has witnessed a proliferation of powerful parallel and distributed systems and an ever increasing demand for practice of high performance computing and communications (HPCC). HPCC has moved into the mainstream of computing and has become a key technology in determining future research and development activities in many academic and industrial branches, especially when the solution of large and complex problems must cope with very tight timing schedules. 
 Among a series of highly successful International Conferences on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC), the HPCC-2025 conference is the 27th edition of a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to address the resulting profound challenges and to present and discuss their new ideas, research results, applications and experience on all aspects of high performance computing and communications. IEEE HPCC-2025 is sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, and IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC). 
 The 27th IEEE HPCC follows the tradition of previous successful IEEE HPCC conferences in the years from 2005 to 2024 in Asia, Europe, Australia, and America. It will feature sessions of regular presentations, workshops, tutorials and keynote speeches. IEEE HPCC-2025 will be hosted in Exeter, the capital city of Devon and provides the county with a central base for education, medicine, religion, commerce and culture. The city is also home to the magnificent Exeter Cathedral, which dates back to Norman times. Exeter is also ideally placed to base a trip to branch out visiting places such as the famous Dartmoor National Park and the unspoilt beaches of the North and South Devon coastlines. 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to HPCC-2025. Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.
