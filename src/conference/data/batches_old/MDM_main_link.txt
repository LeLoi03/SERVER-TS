 The 26thIEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management 
 June 2nd - June 5th 
 Irvine, USA 
 Welcome to MDM 2025! 
 The MDM series of conferences, since its debut in 1999, has established itself as a prestigious forum for the exchange of innovative and significant research results in mobile data management. The conference provides unique opportunities to bring researchers engineers, and practitioners together to explore new ideas, techniques and tools, and exchange experiences. 
 Comprising both research and industry tracks, it serves as an important bridge between academic researchers and industry researchers. Along with the presentations of research publications, it also serves as a meeting place for technical demonstrations (demos), advanced seminars, panel discussions as well as PhD forum and Industrial forum to cater PhD students and industrial developers. 
 The conference focuses on research contributions in data management in mobile, ubiquitous and pervasive computing.
