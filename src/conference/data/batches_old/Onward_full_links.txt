 Awards 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2024 (1) for 2011 | Recipients: Sean McDirmid 
 Title: Coding at the Speed of Touch 
 Conference: Onward! 2011 
 Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2048237.2048246 
 Citation: This 2011 Onward! paper describes the design and implementation of YinYang, a graphical system providing a proficient programming experience for tablet devices with constrained screen space. YingYang’s tile-based approach sidestepped these devices’ limited text-editing capabilities and enabled an intuitive and effective form of direct manipulation. The work stands out as an emblematic Onward! contribution. It is notable for championing programmability on a class of traditionally “closed” devices, exploring many subtle design points of graphical and visual languages, and as a call to action for moving “beyond typewriters” and inspiring the next generation of programmers. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2024 (2) for 2012 | Recipients: Andrew P. Black, Kim B. Bruce, Michael Homer and James Noble 
 Title: Grace: the Absence of (Inessential) Difficulty 
 Conference: Onward! 2012 
 Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2384592.2384601 
 Citation: In this Onward! 2012 paper, the authors distilled a tremendous effort to accommodate the needs of programming pedagogy in a new language design. The paper is a model of clarity, deftly justifying its choices while also situating Grace within the rich history of programming languages past and present. It has supported and inspired considerable follow-on work, not only on pedagogy but also in programming language research topics such as gradual typing and the semantics of object-orientation. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2023 for 2013 | Recipients: Sean McDirmid 
 Title: Usable Live Programming 
 Conference: Onward! 2013 
 Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2509578.2509585 
 Citation: This paper revitalized the study of live programming, introducing mechanisms that are now standard techniques in the field. The paper epitomizes the spirit of Onward!, asking risky questions outside the current discourse. In its form the paper was a breath of fresh air, enlivened by the use of comic strips. The work marked the beginning of a rich seam of research that has been productively mined at the ongoing LIVE workshop series at SPLASH. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2020 for 2010 | Recipients: Lennart C. L. Kats, Eelco Visser, and Guido Wachsmuth 
 Title: Pure and Declarative Syntax Definition: Paradise Lost and Regained 
 Conference: Onward! 2010 
 Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869459.1869535 
 Citation: In a beautiful and compelling exposition, this essay lays out a research vision for realizing a declarative approach to syntax definition. Considering how we can best capture the syntactic structure of a programming language is a question near to the heart of both language design and implementation. The essay is technically interesting without getting lost in formality. Its argument for the declarative paradigm has been influential, impacting a chain of research on declarative syntax tools and helping to usher in the recent era of polyglot programming. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2019 for 2009 | Recipient: William R. Cook 
 Title: On Understanding Data Abstraction, Revisited 
 Conference: Onward! 2009 
 Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1640133 
 Citation: The 2009 Onward! essay “On Understanding Data Abstraction, Revisited” compares abstract data types and objects as two forms of data abstraction. In particular, the paper describes many points of differences and similarities between them clearly and comprehensively. The paper is not only most notable for summarizing a long history of discussions, but also for letting many programming language designers reflect on this topic again. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2018 for 2008 | Recipient: Richard P. Gabriel 
 Title: Designed as Designer 
 Conference: Onward! 2008 
 Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1449813 
 Citation: The 2008 Onward! essay “Designed as Designer” examines the nature of creativity and design, exploring poetry, architecture and software. In particular, the paper sets out to explore questions about our self-conception as computer scientists and programmers. This paper is notable for paving the way for a new track that became Essays at Onward!. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2017 for 2007 | Recipient: Sean McDirmid 
 Title: Living it up with a Live Programming Language 
 Conference: Onward! 2007 
 Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1297073 
 Citation: The 2007 Onward! paper “Living it up with a Live Programming Language” brought the idea of Live Programming into focus by examining the necessary mechanisms, developing a good running example, displaying a contrarian attitude, and explaining it all with admirably clear writing. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2016 for 2006 | Recipient: Friedrich Steimann 
 Title: The Paradoxical Success of Aspect-Oriented Programming 
 Conference: Onward! 2006 
 Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1167514 
 Citation: The 2006 Onward! Essay “The Paradoxical Success of Aspect-Oriented Programming” presents a considered and articulated exploration of the nature of aspect-oriented programming (AOP). In particular, the paper takes a hard look at the value proposed for AOP, together with an examination of what is achieved and what sacrifices appear to be necessary. The paper does not attack AOP, but rather takes a sober look at the hopes and the fears. In doing so, the paper provides a careful review that might also form the basis for progress, even if the form of progress might differ from the original promise. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2015 for 2005 | Recipient: Jonathan Edwards 
 Title: Subtext—Uncovering the Simplicity of Programming 
 Conference: Onward! 2005 
 Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1094811.1094851 
 Citation: The 2005 Onward! paper “Subtext—Uncovering the Simplicity of Programming” presented a new kind of programming, unifying programs and their execution, and which helped establish Onward! as a forum for high-end, lateral thinking about programming. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2014 for 2004 | Recipient: Tim Sheard 
 Title: Languages of the Future 
 Conference: Onward! 2004 
 Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1052883.1052897 
 Citation: The 2004 Onward! paper “Languages of the Future” pioneered the idea of lightweight dependently-typed programming, and idea that has since found its way into several languages, and continues to progress today. This paper is notable for bringing together complex ideas in a compelling way; pointing to how they could be incorporated into “ordinary” languages; and influencing the practical world of software development with this pearl of a design. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2013 for 2003 | Recipient: Martin Rinard 
 Title: Acceptability-oriented Computing 
 Conference: Onward! 2003 
 Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=949344.949402 
 Citation: The 2003 Onward! paper “Acceptability-Oriented Computing” introduced the approach of defining the boundaries of acceptable program behavior for a software system, and then augmenting the original system by layering components to enforce those boundaries—this instead of attempting to construct a completely error-free system. This paper led to a still-expanding series of papers exploring this approach, its capabilities and its benefits. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2012 for 2002 | Recipients: James Noble and Robert Biddle 
 Title: Notes on Postmodern Programming 
 Conference: Onward! 2002 
 Paper: | href="http://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/Onward!Proceedings-2002.pdf" - http://www.sigplan.org/sites/default/files/Onward!Proceedings-2002.pdf 
 Citation: The 2002 Onward! paper “Notes on Postmodern Programming” uses postmodern concepts to understand contemporary programming, especially as software grows in scale and design is dispersed to a diversity of stakeholders. This paper is notable because it triggered a storm of immediate responses and ongoing discussion on the Web; it introduced the essay genre to the programming community and cut the path that led to a new technical track at Onward! (Essays); and it stated for the first time the philosophical model of at-scale software development that dominates today.

 About 
 href="#Call-for-Papers" - Call for Papers 
 - 
 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research. 
 href="#the-character-of-onward-papers" - The Character of Onward! Papers
Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 href="#the-character-of-onward-papers" - The Character of Onward! Papers
Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged. 
 Selection Process 
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation. 
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection. 
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback. 
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision. 
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard. Now submissions are not allowed for the second phase deadline. 
 href="#instructions-for-authors" - Instructions for Authors
For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair. 
 Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided. 
 href="#submission-site" - Submission Site
href="https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/" - https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/
href="#concurrent-submissions" - Concurrent Submissions
Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. 
 Policy on Double Blind Review 
 Onward! 2025 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing: 
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
 To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
 To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
 After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded. 
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions. 
 href="#policy-on-authorship-changes" - Policy on Authorship Changes
Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change. 
 Format 
 Submissions should usehref="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/" - ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format
and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format. 
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible. 
 Page Limit 
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.) 
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning) 
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

 About 
 href="#Call-for-Papers" - Call for Papers 
 - 
 Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research. 
 href="#the-character-of-onward-papers" - The Character of Onward! Papers
Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

 href="#the-character-of-onward-papers" - The Character of Onward! Papers
Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged. 
 Selection Process 
 Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation. 
 Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection. 
 We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback. 
 The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision. 
 The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard. Now submissions are not allowed for the second phase deadline. 
 href="#instructions-for-authors" - Instructions for Authors
For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair. 
 Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided. 
 href="#submission-site" - Submission Site
href="https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/" - https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/
href="#concurrent-submissions" - Concurrent Submissions
Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. 
 Policy on Double Blind Review 
 Onward! 2025 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing: 
 Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper. 
 To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person. 
 To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements. 
 After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded. 
 See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions. 
 href="#policy-on-authorship-changes" - Policy on Authorship Changes
Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change. 
 Format 
 Submissions should usehref="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/" - ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format
and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format. 
 If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible. 
 Page Limit 
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.) 
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning) 
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.
