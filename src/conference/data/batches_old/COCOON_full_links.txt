 COCOON 2025 
 The 31st International Computing and Combinatorics Conference 
 August 15 - August 17 2025 
 Chengdu, China 
 The 31st International Computing and Combinatorics Conference (COCOON 2025) will be held in Chengdu, China during 15-17 August, 2025. Original research papers in the areas of algorithms, theory of computation, computational complexity, and combinatorics related to computing are solicited. In addition to theoretical results, we are also interested in submissions that report on experimental and applied research of general algorithmic interest. Special consideration will be given to research that is motivated by real-world problems. Experimental and applied papers are expected to show convincingly the usefulness and efficiency of the algorithms discussed in a practical setting. 
 Paper Submission 
 The submission should contain scholarly exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including the motivation and a clear comparison with related work. The length of the submission should not exceed 12 pages in LNCS style (including references, but excluding the optional appendix). Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are available here. The submitted papers will be reviewed in adouble-blindpeer review manner. Please delete the author information on your manuscript.All submissions must be submitted electronically through Easychair.href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cocoon2025" - This is the submission link

 Call for Papers 
 The 29th International Computing and Combinatorics Conference (COCOON 2023) will be held in Honolulu, Hawaii, USA during December 15-17, 2023.Normally, COCOON is held in summer. For 2023, we hope to have a face-to-face conference and hence give enough time for oversea participants to apply for a visa.Original research papers in the areas of algorithms, theory of computation, computational complexity, and combinatorics related to computing are solicited. In addition to theoretical results, we are particularly interested in submissions that report on experimental and applied research of general algorithmic interest. Special consideration will be given to research that is motivated by real-world problems. Experimental and applied papers are expected to show convincingly the usefulness and efficiency of the algorithms discussed in a practical setting. 
 The conference proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in theLecture Notes in Computer Scienceseries. The topics include, but are not limited to: 
 Algorithms and Data Structures 
 Algorithmic Game Theory and Online Algorithms 
 Automata, Languages, Logic, and Computability 
 Combinatorics Related to Algorithms and Complexity 
 Complexity Theory 
 Computational Learning Theory and Knowledge Discovery 
 Cryptography, Reliability and Security, and Database Theory 
 Computational Biology and Bioinformatics 
 Computational Algebra, Geometry, and Number Theory 
 Graph Drawing and Information Visualization 
 Graph Theory, Communication Networks, and Optimization 
 Parallel and Distributed Computing
