 Elizabethtown College Data Science Student Yusuke Satani’s Paper Accepted at International Conference

,Campus & Community 
 Elizabethtown College Data Science major Yusuke Satani ’25 recently had his research paper, “RydeeNLP: Optimizing Japanese Learning with Lexical Simplification and Adaptive Translation,” accepted to thehref="https://sites.google.com/view/paclic38" - 38
href="https://sites.google.com/view/paclic38" - th
href="https://sites.google.com/view/paclic38" - Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information, and Computation (PACLIC)
, hosted by the Tokyo University of Foreign Studies in Tokyo, Japan. 
 Satani will attend the conference in person from Dec. 7 to 9. 
 “Etown was crucial in preparing me for this project through the College’s well-equipped academic programs,” Satani said. “I had no prior experience in coding or professional research, but I acquired all of the necessary professional skills through class projects to conduct this study effectively.” 
 The paper introduces a difficulty scale to expand Japanese translation resources and enhance the translation experience. Satani was motivated to begin the project after observing a scarcity of translation resources in Japanese compared to other languages such as English and Spanish. 
 Satani began his research in February 2024, meeting weekly with Elizabethtown College Associate Professor of Computer Science, Peilong Li for guidance and feedback on his work. 
 “My experience with Yusuke shows how important it is for faculty to understand a student’s individual academic and career goals,” Li said. “By tailoring their research experiences to these goals, we can help them develop the skills they need for their next steps, whether it’s graduate school or entering the professional world. Yusuke’s growth as a researcher during this process has been impressive, and I have no doubt that he will excel in his future endeavors.” 
 The PACLIC conference is held annually to provide a forum for researchers from multiple different academic disciplines to share their work on the study of languages. This year’s three-day conference will feature several keynote lectures from leaders in the study of languages as well as presentations from invited papers.
