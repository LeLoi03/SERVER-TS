 Welcome to DS-RT 2025 ! 
 The 2025 29th International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications (DS-RT 2025) is set to be a splendid event, scheduled to be held in Prague, Czech Republic. This symposium offers a unique forum for academics, industry professionals, and researchers to showcase their latest findings in the fields of Distributed Simulation and Real-Time Applications. DS-RT 2025 stands as a pivotal gathering for exchanging knowledge and advancing the frontiers of simulation technology. 
 DS-RT 2025 focuses on the increasingly intersecting domains of extensive distributed simulations and real-time applications. This encompasses areas like the metaverse, collaborative virtual environments, as well as pervasive and ubiquitous application scenarios. Additionally, the symposium will delve into actuator systems and explore the integration of artificial intelligence techniques within both simulation and real-time applications. 
 This year's motto is: "Simulation-Powered Innovation: Driving the Future of Digital Ecosystems," emphasizing how cutting-edge simulation technologies are revolutionizing industries, fostering innovation, and enabling seamless interactions within complex digital environments. 
 The conference features prominent invited speakers and papers by top researchers in the field. DS-RT 2025 will include contributed technical papers, invited papers, and tutorials. The proceedings will be published by IEEE-CS press.
