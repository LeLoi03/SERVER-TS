 Welcome to the 2024 Picture Coding Symposium 
 The Picture Coding Symposium (PCS) is an international forum devoted to advances in visual data coding. Established in 1969, it has the longest history of any conference in this area. The 37th event in the series, PCS 2024, will convene in Taichung, Taiwan. Taichung is centrally located in the western half of Taiwan. It is known as an art and cultural hub of Taiwan, being home to many national museums, historic attractions, art installations, and design boutiques.
