Conference Interspeech:

Welcome to Interspeech 2025​​​​​​​​​​​​​!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ 
 It is with great pleasure that we invite you to the26th edition of the Interspeech Conference, to be heldAugust 17-21, 2025, inRotterdam, The Netherlands. 
 The themeof Interspeech 2025 is"Fair and Inclusive Speech Science and Technology", and aims to celebrate and incorporate the vast speech diversity both within and between individuals, as well as within and between languages. This theme emphasizes diversity as a source of richness and information, contributing to the development of fairer, more robust, and personalized speech technology applications and more accurate theories of human speech processing. By embracing this diversity, we can create theories and technologies that are inclusive of everyone, ensuring that speech science and technology benefit all individuals and communities. 
 We look forward to welcoming you to Rotterdam for a conference filled with insightful discussions, innovative research, and opportunities to advance the fields of speech science and technology and make it fairer, more inclusive, and more equitable. 
 Interspeech 2025will delve intofour specific strands, each addressing critical aspects of speech scienceand technology that foster inclusivity and fairness. These strands are: 
 Factors Arising from the Individual in Human Speech Processing | Exploration of individual differences in speech processing. 
 Understanding how personal factors influence speech perception and production. 
 Development of personalized speech technology applications. 
 Under-Researched Languages, Dialects, and Accents | Focus on linguistic diversity and the inclusion of under-researched languages and dialects. 
 Efforts to develop speech technologies that accommodate a wide range of accents. 
 Promotion of research that highlights the richness of global linguistic diversity. 
 Inclusive Technology for Atypical Speech Communication | Development of multi-modal and adaptive systems for atypical speech communication. 
 Creation of technologies that assist individuals with speech impairments. 
 Emphasis on inclusivity in speech technology to support all communication needs. 
 Ethical Considerations about Fairness, Inclusion, and Democratization of Speech Technologies | Examination of ethical issues related to speech technology development and deployment. 
 Discussion on ensuring fairness and inclusion in speech technology. 
 Strategies for democratizing access to speech technology to benefit all societal segments. 
 By addressing these strands, Interspeech 2025 aims to advance speech science and technology in a manner that is equitable, inclusive, and respectful of individual and linguistic diversity.

 Interspeech is the world’s largest and most comprehensive conference on the science and technology of spoken language processing. Interspeech conferences emphasize interdisciplinary approaches addressing all aspects of speech science and technology, ranging from psycholinguistic theories of human speech processing to advanced applications of speech technology. 
 The theme of Interspeech 2025 is“Fair and Inclusive Speech Science and Technology”and aims to celebrate and incorporate the vast speech diversity both within and between individuals, as well as within and between languages. This theme emphasizes diversity as a source of richness and information, contributing to the development of fairer, more robust, and personalized speech technology applications and more accurate theories of human speech processing. By embracing this diversity, we can create theories and technologies that are inclusive of everyone, ensuring that speech science and technology benefit all individuals and communities. 
 Interspeech 2025 will feature the usual oral and poster sessions, plenary talks by internationally renowned experts, tutorials, special sessions and challenges, show & tell, exhibits, and satellite events. Following Interspeech 2024 we will feature aBlue Sky track. New this year is aSpeech Science Festival for the general publicon the Sunday prior to Interspeech. Watch our website for more information in the coming months on how you can participate! 
 Paper Submission 
 Please note that the paper submission deadline is earlier than previous years because the conference is held in August. The paper submission deadline is February 12 2025. 
 Interspeech 2025 seeks original and innovative papers covering all aspects of human and machine speech science and technology. The language of the conference is English, so papers must be written in English. The paper length is up to four pages in two columns with an additional page for references and acknowledgments only. Submitted papers must conform to the format defined in the paper kit provided on the conference website (and as an overleaf template) and may optionally be accompanied by multimedia files. Interspeech 2025 will follow a double-blind review process so papers submitted for review should not reveal the identity or affiliation of the authors. Authors must declare that their contributions are original and that they have not submitted their papers elsewhere for publication. Papers must be submitted electronically and will be evaluated through rigorous peer review on the basis of novelty and originality, technical correctness, clarity of presentation, key strengths, and quality of references. The Technical Programme Committee will decide which papers to include in the conference programme using peer review as the primary criterion, with secondary criteria of addressing the conference theme, and diversity across the programme as a whole. If accepted, each paper needs to be presented by one of the authors during the in-person conference. 
 Blue Sky Track 
 Interspeech 2024 introduced the newBLUE SKYtrack of highly innovative papers in fields or directions that have not yet been explored. Large-scale experimental evaluation will not be required for papers in this track. If you think your work satisfies these requirements, please consider submitting a paper to thischallenging and competitivetrack. Please note that to achieve the objectives of this BLUE SKY track, we will ask the most experienced reviewers to assess the proposals.
