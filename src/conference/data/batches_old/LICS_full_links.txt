 Instructions to Authors 
 Authors are required to submit a paper title and a short abstract of about 100 words in advance of submitting the full paper. The exact deadline time on these dates is given byanywhere on earth(AoE). 
  
 Titles and Short Abstracts Due | 16 January 2025 
 Full Papers Due | 23 January 2025 
 Author Response Period | 17–20 March 2025 
 Author Notification | 8 April 2025 
 Conference | 23 – 26 June 2025 
 Workshops | 27 – 28 June 2025 
 Submission deadlines are firm; late submissions will not be considered. All submissions will be electronic viahref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lics25" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lics25
. 
 Formatting instructions:Every full paper must be submitted in the IEEE Proceedings 2-column 10pt format and may be at most 12 pages, excluding references. Please use IEEEtran.cls version V1.8b, updated 2024, LaTeX style files are available atieee.org. 
 The paper must be in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper. It should begin with a succinct statement of the issues a summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their significance and relevance to the conference and to computer science, all phrased for the non-specialist. Technical development directed to the specialist should follow. References and comparisons with related work must be included. (If necessary detailed proofs of technical results may be included in a clearly-labeled appendix, to be consulted at the discretion of program committee members.) Submissions not conforming to the above requirements will be rejected without further consideration. Papers authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed, with at most one submission per PC member. 
 Results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere, including the proceedings of other symposia or workshops. The program chair must be informed, in advance of submission, of any closely related work submitted or about to be submitted to a conference or journal. Authors of accepted papers are expected to sign copyright release forms. One author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference. Remote presentations can be organized for authors who are not to be able to attend the meeting. 
 LICS 2025 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Following this process means that reviewers will not see the authors' names or affiliations as they initially review a paper. The authors' names will then be revealed to the reviewers only once their reviews have been submitted. 
 To facilitate this process, submitted papers must adhere to the following: 
 Author names and institutions must be omitted and 
 References to the authors' own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the work of ..."). 
 The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission, makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult, or interferes with the process of disseminating new ideas. For example, important background references (to papers or tools) should not be omitted or anonymized, even if they are written by the same authors and share common ideas, techniques, or infrastructure. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. 
 Kleene Award, Distinguished Papers and Special Issues 
 An award in honor of the late Stephen C. Kleene will be given for the best student paper(s), as judged by the program committee. 
 Around 10% of accepted papers will be selected as distinguished papers. These are papers that, in the view of the LICS program committee, make exceptionally strong contribution to the field and should be read by a broad audience due their relevance, originality, significance and clarity. 
 Full versions of up to three accepted papers, to be selected by the program committee, will be invited for submission to the Journal of the ACM. Additional selected papers will be invited to a special issue of Logical Methods in Computer Science. 
 Publication 
 The official publication date may differ from the first day of the conference. The official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. We will clarify the official publication date in due course.

Programme chairs: Lars Birkedal and Barbara König. -- LICS CALL FOR WORKSHOPS IMPORTANT DATES FOR WORKSHOPS: Submission of workshop proposals: November 30, 2024 Notification of the accepted workshops: December, 2024 Program of the workshops ready: May 26, 2025 LICS conference: June 23-26, 2025 Workshops: June 27-28, 2025 We invite proposals for workshops on topics of interest to the LICS conference. Typically, LICS workshops feature a number of invited speakers and a number of contributed presentations. LICS workshops do not usually produce formal proceedings. However, in the past there have been special issues of journals based in part on certain LICS workshops. The conference will provide a room, internet connection and help with some local organization. The workshops selection committee consists of the LICS Workshops Chair (Valentin Blot), the LICS General Chair, the LICS PC Chairs and the LICS Conference Chairs. Proposals must be limited to three pages, should be submitted to lics25-workshops at valentinblot.org and should include: - Workshop's name and URL if already available or from previous years - A short scientific summary and justification of the proposed topic; this should include a discussion of the particular benefits of the topic to the LICS community - A list of workshop organizers with contact information - Potential invited speakers (how many you would expect and, if possible, tentative names) - Procedures for selecting presentations (if you plan a call for contributed talks or papers followed by a selection procedure, the submission date should be scheduled after the conference's notification date - Apr 8, 2025 - and the notification should take place before the early registration deadline - late April / early May) - Plans for dissemination, if any (e.g. proceeding, journal special issue, etc.) - Proposed format and agenda (e.g. paper presentations, tutorials, demo sessions) - The proposed duration (e.g. 1/2, 1, 2 day(s)) - Expected number of participants, providing some data on previous years, if the workshop has already been organised in the past.Previous message (by thread): | href="011614.html" - [TYPES/announce] OOPSLA 2025 R1 Call For Papers
