Present occupation:Associate professor atKyoto University, Japan. 
 Affiliated withMinato Laboratory. 
  
 Research field:Computer Science. 
 I am developing new mathematical theories and computational techniques for solving graph theoretical problems, with a focus on computational complexity. My goal is to design conceptually simple, efficient, and flexible algorithms that may be useful in many different situations. I am especially interested in combinatorial problems from the biological sciences that can be expressed elegantly using graphs and tree structures. Some keywords:Graph algorithms 
 Bioinformatics 
 Phylogenetic trees & phylogenetic networks 
 Computational complexity 
 Data structures
