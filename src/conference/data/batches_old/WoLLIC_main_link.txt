 SCOPE 
 Contributions are invited on all pertinent subjects, with particular interest in cross-disciplinary topics. Typical but not exclusive areas of interest are: 
 non-classical logics; 
 foundations of computing, programming and Artificial Intelligence (AI); 
 novel computation models and paradigms; 
 broad notions of proof and belief; 
 proof mining, type theory, effective learnability and explainable AI; 
 formal methods in software and hardware development; 
 logical approach to natural language and reasoning; 
 logics of programs, actions and resources; 
 foundational aspects of information organization, search, flow, sharing and protection; 
 foundations of mathematics; 
 philosophical logic; 
 and philosophy of language. 
 PROCEEDINGS 
 The proceedings of WoLLIC 2025, including both invited and contributed papers, will be published in advance of the meeting as a volume inSpringer’s LNCS series. In addition, abstracts will be published in the Conference Report section of theLogic Journal of the IGPL, and selected contributions will be published (after a new round of reviewing) as special post-conference WoLLIC 2025 issue of ascientific journal(TBC).
