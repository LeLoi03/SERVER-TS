will be held on August 24-27, 2025 in Aerzen, Germany. Submissions are dueApril 11, 2025April 25, 2025. 
 The New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW) is an annual, small invitation-only workshop for researchers in information security and related disciplines. NSPW's focus is on work that challenges the dominant approaches and perspectives in computer security. In the past, such challenges have taken the form of critiques of existing practice as well as novel, sometimes controversial, and often immature approaches to defending computer systems. By providing a forum for important security research that isn't suitable for mainstream security venues, NSPW aims to fosterparadigm shiftsin information security. 
 In order to preserve the small, focused nature of the workshop, participation is limited to authors of accepted papers and conference organizers. As a computer security venue, NSPW is unique in format and highly interactive in nature. Each paper is typically the focus of 45 to 60 minutes of presentation and discussion. Authors are encouraged to present ideas that might be considered risky in some other forum, and all participants are charged with providing feedback in a constructive manner. The resulting intensive brainstorming has proven to be an excellent medium for furthering the development of these ideas. The final proceedings are published after the workshop, giving authors an opportunity to incorporate feedback from the workshop. 
 NSPW is anACSAconference. The proceedings of NSPW are published by theACM. Full proceedingsare available.

Skip to main contentNew Security Paradigms WorkshopNSPW 2025 CFPNSPW 2025 invites three types of submissions: 
 Regular submissions present a new approach (paradigm) to a security problem or critique existing approaches. While regular submissions may present research results (mathematical or experimental), unlike papers submitted to most computer security venues, these results should not be the focus of the submission; instead, the change in approach should be the focus. 
 Theme Submissions are focused on “Trusting” and should explain the connection with the theme in the justification statement (see below). They follow the format of a regular submission. 
 Implementation Submissions explore implementing previous NSPW submissions. Historic NSPW submissions often propose new paradigms but do not extend to implementation. These submissions should clearly cite which previous work(s) is being referenced and how the current submission extends beyond the original scope. Original authors may be involved or not; if not, they will be offered the chance to comment on the submission. 
 NSPW has an optional theme each year to encourage submissions in specific areas of interest or importance. The theme for NSPW 2025 isTrusting. 
 Relevant topics for this theme include: 
 Novel paradigms for conceptualising trust and trusting in computer security 
 Trust decisions in a world of deepfakes and misinformation 
 Detection of breach of trust, intrusion and misinformation 
 Trust boundaries and threat modeling 
 Trust in changing threat landscapes and technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence 
 Trust evaluation 
 Social configuration of trust and mistrust in organisations 
 Trust and mistrust as methodological problems in studies of computer security 
 The consequences of not trusting 
 Audits and certifications 
 Authentication and authorization 
 Reputation systems and reviewer/recommender systems 
 Anomaly detection 
 Formal verification and testing 
 Privacy 
 Decentralized trust 
 Zero trust architectures 
 Human, social and organisational understandings of trust in technologies 
 Other interpretations of trusting are welcome. 
 Submission Instructions 
 All submissions are treated as confidential as a matter of policy. NSPW does not accept previously published or concurrently submitted papers. 
 Due Date: April 25, 2025 
 Response Date: May 30, 2025 
 Format : PDF format, 6-15 pages, ACM “sigconf” formatting 
 Submit through EasyChairhref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025
Special Submission Instructions. Each paper requires two separate EasyChair submissions: 
 Cover page with authors’ names, affiliation, and the participation statement 
 Anonymous PDF paper with a justification statement 
 The participation statement (on the cover page) must specify which author(s) will attend upon acceptance/invitation, that all authors will engage in good faith with the feedback given in the review and revision periods, and that all authors will abide by the NSPW code of conduct. 
 The justification statement (clearly marked as part of the PDF submission) briefly explains why the submission is appropriate for NSPW and the chosen submission category. The justification statement will not appear in the final publication. 
 To support double-blind reviewing, the cover page should not be part of the PDF submission but will be submitted separately on EasyChair. Submissions that do not include both statements risk rejection without review. In addition, submissions should blind author identity where possible. The LaTeX document option anonymous=true provides a minimum level of protection; however, authors should also avoid referencing their own work in the first person or other obvious de-anonymization in the submission. 
 Organizers and Program Committee members are allowed to submit papers, but will not be involved in evaluating their papers. 
 Publication 
 Depending on publication venue, there may be open access publication fees, and we encourage authors to ensure their institution can cover these fees before submitting. Further details regarding publication will be forthcoming. 
 Social contract and code of conduct 
 Given the focus on the development and exploration of new ideas, the process for paper submission, revision, presentation, and publication at NSPW is different from many other security conferences. Accepted papers are shepherded and revised before the workshop; this revised version is then presented and discussed in an hour-long session. After the workshop, the final version is produced, incorporating the discussions and feedback. Acceptance to the workshop is conditional on engagement with this process. 
 All participants must commit to a “social contract”: no one arrives late, no one leaves early, no electronic distractions (including laptops, tablets, and mobile devices), attend all sessions of the 2.5-day program, share meals in a group setting, and comply with the code of conduct. The workshop is preceded by an evening reception allowing attendees to meet each other beforehand. 
 NSPW is making arrangements for (some) child care during the event. If any potential attendee wants to take advantage of this or has questions, please emailhref="mailto:general-chairs@nspw.org" - general-chairs@nspw.org
now. We would like to get a general understanding of interest and capacity to assist with planning for the event. 
 The submission, review, and workshop phases of NSPW are all governed by the NSPW code of conduct,href="https://www.nspw.org/conduct" - https://www.nspw.org/conduct
