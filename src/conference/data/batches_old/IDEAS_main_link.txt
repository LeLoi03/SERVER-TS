 The 29th International Database Engineered Application Symposium 
 Newcastle Upon Tyne, 14th-16thof July 2025 
 IDEAS 2025 aims to explore and advance all data engineering and application aspects regardless of the underlying database models. 
 The symposium provides an international forum for discussing the problems of engineering data-driven systems involving not only database technology but also related areas of artificial intelligence, communication, information retrieval, human-machine interaction, multimedia, natural language processing, privacy, security, and others. IDEAS fosters closer interaction among the industrial, research and user communities and provides an excellent opportunity for them to meet, discuss ideas, examine the current ones and develop new solutions and research directions. Along with the technical sessions, the symposium also features prominent invited speakers. 
 The IDEAS series of symposiums, held annually in North America, Europe, and Asia since 1997, attracts participants from governmental and non-governmental agencies, industries, and academia to exchange ideas and share experiences. 
 Springer will publish the conference proceedings.

 The annual IDEAS conference is a top international forum for data engineering researchers, practitioners, developers, and application users to explore revolutionary ideas and results and exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. We invite the participation of all interested in this meeting, which provides insight into original research contributions relating to all aspects of database engineering defined broadly, particularly topics of emerging interest describing work on integrating new technologies into products and applications, experiences with existing and novel techniques, and the identification of unsolved challenges. 
 Important Dates for Papers: 
 Paper Submission Deadline | : 15th of May 2025, AoE 
 Notification of Acceptance | : 13 | th | of June 2025, AoE 
 Conference | : 14 | th | – 16 | th | July 2025 
 Organization: Sponsor Opportunities 
 The conference welcomes industrial collaboration by allowing them to present their product with stands, participate in the Industry Forum, or also give a demo/keynote session live. These donations will also help to partially support the following activities: (i) corroborate social events associated to IDEAS'25, and (ii) support the travel costs of invited speakers (where necessary). IDEAS will support the following level of sponsorships: 
 Gold Sponsorship | : Stand with demo opportunity also at the Industry Forum (if held), advertisement in the conference and gadgets, keynote session or demo, major involvement in the Industry Forum (to be held if we can attract sufficient companies, >5). 
 Silver sponsorship | : Conference stand, advertisement in the conference website, participate in the Industry Forum (to be held if we can attract sufficient companies, >5). 
 Bronze Sponsorship | : Conference stand, advertisement on the conference website. 
 Please consider contactinggiacomo.bergami@newcastle.ac.ukfor further information. 
 This is an in-person conference! 
 We are glad to announce that IDEAS will be back for an in-person conference! We look forward to welcoming the participants to Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK. However, we will keep monitoring the pandemic situation to decide later if remote participation would be possible for those with travel restrictions.
