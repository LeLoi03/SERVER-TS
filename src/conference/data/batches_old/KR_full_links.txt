Learn MoreThe International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning 
 Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) is a well-established and vibrant field of research within Artificial Intelligence. KR builds on the fundamental thesis that knowledge can often be represented in an explicit declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated symbolic reasoning engines. This enables the exploitation of knowledge that would otherwise be implicit through semantically grounded inference mechanisms. KR has contributed to the theory and practice of various areas of AI, including agents, automated planning, robotics and natural language processing, and to fields beyond AI, including data management, semantic web, verification, software engineering, computational biology, and cybersecurity. 
 The KR conference series is the leading forum for timely, in-depth presentation of progress in the theory and practice of the representation and computational management of knowledge. 
 KR 2025 will include special thematic tracks and a Recently Published Research Track, tutorials, workshops, and a Doctoral Consortium. Details about all these events and the corresponding calls will be on the website in due time.

 KR News 
 Pavlos Peppas († 2025) 
 The KR community is mourning the loss of Pavlos Peppas. Pavlos had been a well-known and firmly established member of the community for many years. He advanced the field of knowledge representation and reasoning in many ways, in particular, with respect to novel concepts and techniques in belief revision. Moreover, Pavlos served the community by maintaining KR Inc's web pages and mailing lists during 2020–2024. Most prominently, Pavlos was the local organizer of KR 2020 (online, under Covid conditions) and KR 2023 on the beautiful Greek island of Rodos. 
 Pavlos passed away on Feb 4, 2025, after a short and severe illness, in Greece where he held the position of professor at the University of Patras. We pass on our sincere condolences to his family and friends, in particular, his wife and his two daughters.

 TheInternational Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling(ICAPS) is the premier forum for exchanging news and research results on the theory and applications of intelligent and automated planning and scheduling technology. 
 Planning and Scheduling are optimisation problems which require finding a set of actions to complete a task, to achieve a goal, or to optimise one or more objectives. Effective solutions to planning and scheduling problems are critical for a variety of important application areas, including Industry 4.0, aerospace systems, supply chain management, software engineering, robotics, education, digital entertainment and more. 
 ICAPS 2025is the 35th edition of the ICAPS conference series and will take place in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in November 2025. The conference will be co-located with the following events: 
 href="https://kr.org//KR2025/" - KR-2025 | : The 22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. 
 href="https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2025" - CPAIOR-2025 | : The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research. 
 Planning and Optimisation Summer School 2025 | , the details of which will be announced here at a future date.
