 Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conference (IAAI) 
 January 29, 2023 
 Sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence 
 Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence Conferences (IAAI) traditionally consist of case studies of deployed applications with measurable benefits whose value depends on the use of AI technology. In addition, many IAAI conferences augment these case studies with papers and invited talks that address emerging areas of AI technology or applications. IAAI is organized as an independent program within the AAAI National Conference, with schedules coordinated to allow attendees to move freely between IAAI and AAAI Conference sessions. IAAI and the National Conference often jointly sponsor invited talks that fit the theme of both programs 
 Future Conferences

 IAAI -25 
 The Thirty-Seventh Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-25) 
 Collocated with AAAI-25 
 href="https://openreview.net/group?id=AAAI.org/2025/Innovative_Applications_of_AI#tab-recent-activity" - Submission Site
The Thirty-Seventh Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-25) is a venue for papers describing highly innovative realizations of AI technology. The objective of the conference is to showcase successful applications and novel uses of AI. The conference will use technical papers, best practice papers, invited talks, and panel discussions to explore issues, methods, and lessons learned in the development and deployment of AI applications; and to promote an interchange of ideas between basic and applied AI and the discourse on the actual deployment of AI in practice. The general goal of the conference is to teach people the challenges and solutions to accomplishing something useful in the real world, as opposed to describing a new algorithm. Papers focusing on algorithmic descriptions, rather than applications, are more appropriate for AAAI-25. All submissions must be original. 
 IAAI-25 will consider: (1) papers that showcase novel, deployed applications of AI; (2) applications on a trajectory to deployment; (3) papers that present deployed tools for faster AI solutions development and deployment; (4) papers that showcase original ways of integrating methodologies from different areas of AI for practical realization and future deployment; and (5) papers that analyze the factors related to AI incidents and the best practices for preventing or mitigating their recurrence. 
 Tracks and Topics 
 1. Deployed Highly Innovative Applications of AI​ 
 Papers submitted to this track must describe *deployed* applications with measurable benefits that include an innovative use of AI technology. Applications are defined as deployed once they are in production use by their final end-users and the in-use experience can be meaningfully collected and reported. The study may evaluate either a stand-alone application or a component of a complex system. 
 Papers will be judged by the quality of: the task or problem description; the application description; the innovative use of AI technology; the measurable application use and payoff; and the lessons learned during application development, deployment and maintenance. In-depth descriptions of the algorithm are generally more appropriate for AAAI than for IAAI. Each accepted deployed application paper will receive the IAAI ‘Innovative Application’ Award. 
 Papers in this track may have up to 8 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references. 
 2. Emerging Applications of AI 
 Emerging applications papers ‘bridge the gap’ between basic AI research and case studies of deployed AI applications, by discussing efforts to apply AI tools, techniques, or methods to real-world problems in novel ways. Emerging applications focus on aspects of AI applications that are not yet sufficiently deployed to be submitted as case studies in the Deployed track. 
 This track is distinguished from reports of purely scientific AI research appropriate for AAAI in that the objective of the efforts reported at IAAI should be the potential application of AI technologies, including engineering considerations. A key requirement for papers is to discuss the path forward for achieving deployment of the technology. 
 Papers will be judged primarily by the following criteria: significance (of the problem, and the tool or methodology); relevance of AI technology to the problem; innovation; path to deployment; content; evaluation; technical quality; and clarity. Authors are advised to bear these questions in mind while writing their papers. Authors are also advised to consider the novelty of applying AI to the particular problem domain. 
 Papers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references. 
 3. Deployed Innovative Tools for Enabling AI Applications 
 Within this track, we solicit papers describing *deployed* tools for improving applied AI innovation and deployment of AI systems. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Process organization: Tools that help manage and assure the development, evaluation or deployment of AI systems. 
 Data cleaning: Tools to ease the pain point of processing raw data for its use in AI systems. 
 Modelling: Tools that facilitate AI modelling, for example approaches to facilitate deriving models from examples or demonstrations. 
 Meta-algorithmics: Tools to improve AI systems, algorithm configurators, algorithm portfolios, and hyper-parameter tuners. 
 Platforms: Tools in the form of platforms designed for AI research, especially those with connections to real world systems and domains. 
 Novel computational models: Tools to exploit new computational hardware, for example neuromorphic co-processors, quantum computers, and chips approximating quantum computation. 
 Interaction: Tools that facilitate the interaction design of or user experience with AI systems, or improve user evaluations. 
 Trusted AI: Tools that generate explanations, justifications, and persuasions for data-driven models. 
 Papers will be judged primarily by the following criteria: the extent to which the tool presented yields solutions with demonstrated improved quality; lower development, deployment and maintenance costs; better productivity; fewer errors; and higher ability to scale. Reviewers will pay attention to how well designed is the tool, how easy is it to use and how well is it documented, and how many users it has. Note the focus is on the tool, not on foundational research. 
 Papers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references. 
 4. Innovative Inter-disciplinary AI Integration 
 This track is devoted to the integration of AI components with the focus on how the orchestration of methods from different AI silos requires the adaptation of existing technologies to allow them to work together well for application of AI in practice. Papers must pay attention to engineering considerations and, where relevant, to human–computer interaction. 
 Examples for such orchestrated new capabilities and applications include but are not limited to: 
 Learning search algorithms: Implementations of systematic and heuristic search algorithms that are capable to improve their performance by learning from experience or during search. 
 Decision support under uncertainty: Implementations that combine statistical and deterministic reasoning to provide scalable decision support under uncertainty for applications that are inherently stochastic. 
 Knowledge representation: Representations that work effectively for downstream analytics, e.g., the innovative use of a knowledge graph for feature generation of a downstream machine learning model. 
 Auto-configuration: The adaptation of search methods from combinatorial optimization to optimize knowledge bases or to design superior forecasting algorithms. 
 Other research prototypes that integrate algorithms and methods from traditionally different AI sub-communities. 
 A clear, transparent, and reproducible case must be presented that allows the community to judge objectively the value of the innovation of the integration when compared to existing or ad-hoc approaches. Computational experiments on benchmarks (that either already are or will be made public) and in comparison with existing state-of-the-art baseline methods are expected. At least a portion of the experiments is expected to consider real-world (not synthetic generated) benchmarks to demonstrate the practical importance of the problem studied. 
 Papers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references. 
 5. AI Incidents and Best Practices 
 In this final short paper track, we encourage papers analyzing the factors related to AI incidents and the best practices for preventing or mitigating their recurrence. These papers will be reviewed based on different criteria than the longer papers of the main IAAI tracks. The papers must (a) analyze the development and deployment processes and artifacts in relation to harms realized in the real world for one or more AI incidents, (b) analyze AI incident trends to understand where there are open problems in the deployment of AI systems, and/or (c) detail best practices in producing and deploying systems to prevent or mitigate AI incidents. 
 Papers will be reviewed by a program committee of AI, human factors, safety, and ethics researchers with a particular focus on whether the paper informs the safe practice of deploying intelligent systems in the world. All papers will be added to the AI Incident Database for the referenced AI incidents. 
 Papers in this track may be up to (6) pages long in the prescribed AAAI style. Papers of at most two (2) pages may also be submitted and considered exclusively for presentation as a poster. At most one additional page beyond the limits may contain only references. 
 Submission Instructions 
 Electronic submissions are required. Papers must be in trouble-free, high resolution PDF format and formatted for United States letter (8.5” x 11”) paper. Submissions need to be in AAAI two-column format (use the CameraReady templates in thehref="https://aaai.org/authorkit25/" - AAAI 2025 Author Kit
). Deployed papers can be up to eight (8) pages plus one more page containing only references. Emerging, Tools and Integration papers can be up to six (6) pages plus one more page containing only references. Best practice, Challenge, and Training papers may be up to (6) pages long, plus one more page containing only references. Papers of at most two (2) pages, plus one more page containing only references, may also be submitted and considered exclusively for presentation as a poster. 
 Supplementary material in the form of (1) technical appendix, (2) multimedia, (3) code and data may be submitted alongside all papers. The main submission may reference the supplementary material but should be self-contained. Reviewers will be instructed to make their acceptance evaluations based on the main submission and will not be obliged to consult the supplementary material. 
 Submissions to IAAI-25 should contain identifying information of the authors and their affiliations: reviewing is single-blind. It is also recommended to add authors from the deploying institutions as co-authors to show the real-world impact of the submission. 
 Authors should register on the IAAI-25 OpenReview paper submission site. The IAAI-25 OpenReview site will be open for paper submission on July 15, 2024. Authors must then submit a formatted electronic version of their full paper through OpenReview no later thanSeptember 2, 2024. We cannot accept papers submitted by email or fax. Submissions received after the deadline, or that do not meet the length or formatting requirements detailed above, will not be accepted for review. Notification of receipt of the electronic paper will be emailed to the first author (or designated contact author) soon after receipt. By submitting a paper to IAAI, the authors agree that the Program Chairs have the final decision on the acceptance of publication at the conference. Papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee and notification of acceptance or rejection will be emailed to the contact author onOctober 31, 2024. The author feedback window will beNovember 18-22, 2024. The notification of the final acceptance or rejection will beDecember 2, 2024. PDFs of accepted papers will be due onDecember 19, 2024. Authors will be required to transfer copyright at that time. 
 All submissions must be original. IAAI-25 will not consider any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Once submitted to IAAI-25, authors may not submit the paper elsewhere during IAAI’s review period. These restrictions apply only to refereed journals and conferences, not to preliminary versions that are posted as preprints to arXiv.org or other unrefereed forums, or to workshops with a limited audience and without archival proceedings. Authors must confirm that their submissions to IAAI conform to these requirements at the time of submission. 
 Paper Awards 
 This year, we are excited to announce two IAAI paper awards:

 The Thirty-Eighth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence was held on February 20–27, 2024 in VANCOUVER, CANADA. The program chairs were Jennifer Dy (Northeastern University, USA) and Sriraam Natarajan (University of Texas at Dallas, USA). 
 AAAI-24 welcomed submissions on research that advances artificial intelligence, broadly conceived. The conference featured technical paper presentations, special tracks, invited speakers, workshops, tutorials, poster sessions, senior member presentations, competitions, and exhibit programs. Many of these activities were tailored to the theme of bridges and were selected according to the highest standards, with additional programs for students and young researchers. The purpose of this year’s Bridge Program was to tap into new sources of innovation by cultivating collaboration between two or more communities directed towards a common goal including distinct subfields of AI, such as planning and learning, or different disciplines that contribute to and benefit from AI, such as AI and the humanities. 
 The conference scope included machine learning (deep learning, statistical learning, etc), natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, multiagent systems, knowledge representation, human-in-the-loop AI, search, planning, reasoning, robotics and perception, and ethics. In addition to fundamental work that focused on any one of these areas, AAAI-24 encouraged work across technical areas of AI, (e.g., machine learning and computer vision; computer vision and natural language processing; or machine learning and planning), bridges between AI and a related research area (e.g., neuroscience; cognitive science) or developing AI techniques in the context of important application domains, such as healthcare, sustainability, transportation, and commerce. 
 The conference also continued its tradition of colocating with the long-running Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence conference (IAAI-24). IAAI-24 was cochaired by Alex Wong (University of Waterloo, Canada), YuHao Chen (University of Waterloo, Canada) and Jan R. Seyler (Festo, Germany). The IAAI-24 papers are included in this proceedings. Also included are the papers from the Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence (EAAI-24). EAAI-24 was cochaired by Marion Neumann (Washington University, USA) and Stephanie Rosenthal (Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA) 
 The proceedings have been published in 21 consecutive issues. This issue (volume 38 no. 1) consists of 670 pages and 2 tracks:
