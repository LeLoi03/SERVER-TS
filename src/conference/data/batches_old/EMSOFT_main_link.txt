 EMSOFT: CALL FOR FULL-LENGTH PAPERS 
 EMSOFT(ACM SIGBED International Conference on Embedded Software)aims at advancing the science and engineering ofembedded software. Since 2001, EMSOFT has been at the forefront of embedded software innovation, connecting academia, industry, and government. At EMSOFT, cutting-edge research meets practical application in designing and analyzing software that brings the digital and physical worlds together. EMSOFT’s tradition is at the heart ofcyber-physical systems, where computation, networking, and physical dynamics converge. 
 We invite submissionson all aspects of embedded software systems, including but not limited to: 
 Embedded distributed, networked systems | Time-critical embedded systems 
 Multi-/many-core processors, hardware accelerators 
 Embedded operating systems and middleware 
 Scheduling, resource allocation, and execution time analysis 
 QoS management and performance analysis 
 Hardware and software co-design 
 Embedded software design and analysis | Energy-efficient embedded software 
 Safety/Mixed-critical embedded software 
 Software design and analysis for cyber-physical systems 
 Embedded software architectures for data-intensive applications and signal processing 
 Cyber-security, safety, resilience 
 and fault-tolerance | Embedded software security and privacy 
 Embedded software safety 
 Robust implementation of control systems 
 Processes and methods | Formal modeling and verification 
 Testing, validation, and certification 
 Model- and component-based approaches 
 Empirical studies and their reproduction 
 Sustainability and energy optimization 
 Application areas including automotive, avionics, energy, health care, mobile devices, multimedia, machine learning, and autonomous systems 
 Submitted manuscripts must bedouble blind. Authors should not reveal their identity directly or indirectly (e.g., through references). The submitted work must beoriginal, not formerly published or under review elsewhere. 
 The EMSOFT 2025 journal track will follow atwo-stage reviewprocess. Authors of papers that pass the first review stage will revise their work based on the received comments, within a short time frame (around two weeks). Papers accepted at the second stage will appear in ACM TECS (see below). 
 Journal-Integrated Publication Model:All full papers accepted in EMSOFT’25 will be published inACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS). All late-breaking papers accepted in one of the three conferences will be published inIEEE Embedded Systems Letters (ESL).
