 General Information 
 The annual DIMVA conference serves as a premier forum for advancing the state of the art in the broader areas of intrusion detection, malware analysis, and vulnerability assessment. Each year, DIMVA brings together international experts from academia, industry, and government to present and discuss novel research in these areas. DIMVA is organized by the special interest group Security - Intrusion Detection and Response (SIDAR) of the German Informatics Society (GI). The conference proceedings will appear in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. 
 Topics of Interest 
 DIMVA solicits submissions of high-quality, original scientific papers presenting novel research on malware analysis, intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, and related systems security topics. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Intrusions 
 Novel approaches and domains 
 Insider detection 
 Prevention and response 
 Data leakage, exfiltration, and poisoning 
 Result correlation and cooperation 
 Evasion and other attacks 
 Potentials and limitation 
 Operational experiences 
 Privacy, legal, and social aspects 
 Targeted attacks 
 Analysis or detection of cryptocurrency heists 
 Malware 
 Automated analyses 
 Behavioral models 
 Prevention and containment 
 Classification 
 Lineage 
 Forensics and recovery 
 Underground economy 
 Vulnerabilities in malware 
 Financially targeted malware (e.g., ransomware, DeFi) 
 Vulnerability detection 
 Vulnerability prevention 
 Vulnerability analysis 
 Exploitation and defenses 
 Hardware vulnerabilities 
 Situational awareness 
 Active probing 
 Vulnerabilities in decentralized systems 
 Papers will be judged on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity. We expect all papers to provide enough details to enable reproducibility of the experimental results. We encourage papers that bridge research in different communities. We also welcome experience papers that clearly articulate lessons learnt. 
 Types of Submissions Solicited 
 We invitefull papersfor submission that present novel and mature research results. Full papers are limited to 20 pages in Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and appendices. 
 Papers that do not follow these formatting guidelines may be rejected without review. 
 While we do not accept short papers, we encourage authors to submit a poster instead, presenting original, still ongoing work that has not yet reached the maturity required for a full paper. For more information, please refer to the Call for Posters. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 DIMVA 2025 will adopt a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations must be excluded from the paper. Furthermore, authors should avoid obvious self-references, and should cite their own previous work in third person, whenever necessary. Papers that are not properly anonymized risk being rejected without review. 
 Submissions must be original work and may not be under submission to another venue at the time of review. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to physically present the submitted work at the conference, for the paper to be included in the proceedings. 
 Authors are encouraged to submit code appropriately anonymized, using, e.g.,https://anonymous.4open.science/. 
 Ethical considerations 
 Submissions that report experiments with data gathered from human subjects should disclose whether the research received approval from an institutional ethics review board (IRB), if applicable, and what measures were adopted to minimize risks to privacy. 
 Submissions that describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties (e.g., in case of probing of network devices), and how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software or system vendors or owners before publication. 
 If you have any questions, please contact the program chairs athref="mailto:pc-chairs@dimva.org:" - pc-chairs@dimva.org

 Call for Posters 
 Important Dates (AoE) 
 Submission: up to April 11th, 2025 
 Notification: April 21st, 2025 
 Camera-ready: April 30th, 2025 
 High-quality posters facilitate discussions about recent research findings, encourage meaningful interactions with interested attendees, showcase ongoing projects, and present innovative ideas. DIMVA invites submissions of posters that highlight preliminary results, ongoing work, or recently published research. Posters will be displayed in a forum setting, allowing attendees to mingle and engage with the presenters. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 Poster submissions must include two components: the poster draft and an accompanying poster paper. The poster paper should be at least 4 pages, but no more than 6 pages long, formatted according to the Springer LNCS guidelines, and this page count includes the bibliography and any appendices. Proposals are not anonymized and must clearly state the authors' names, affiliations, and contact information. The poster papers will be published in the proceedings. Please ensure that the title of the poster paper begins with the word "Poster". 
 The poster submission system is available athref="https://dimva25posters.hotcrp.com/" - https://dimva25posters.hotcrp.com/
. 
 Note: Poster sessions will be held in-person. At least one author of each accepted poster will be required to attend the conference. During the conference, we will provide poster stands. Attendees may bring printed posters up to size A0.

 Sponsors 

Sponsorship Opportunities 
 We are looking for a few industry sponsors, primarily to provide them with an opportunity to engage with the participants. This way, we hope to make the local security community more visible to an international audience and create networking opportunities. 
 We offer three sponsorship levels, each of which includes a ticket for a researcher from the sponsoring company to mingle with attendees or place goodies/swag in the welcome bag that we hand out at check-in. 
 Sponsorship Benefits 
 All sponsors will have their logos displayed on the conference website. 
 Sponsors will be acknowledged in the opening remarks. 
 Sponsors will be mentioned in the acknowledgments of the conference proceedings. 
 An early confirmation (or decline) of sponsorship would help us with planning, but we need to know by June at the latest whether sponsorship is possible. 
 Sponsorship Levels 
 Gold: €4000 | (includes up to 4 free registrations, the option to have a table in the break area, the option to display a roll-up/poster, and the ability to place swag/goodies in the attendee bags) 
 Silver: €3000 | (includes up to 3 free registrations, the option to display a roll-up/poster, and the ability to place swag/goodies in the attendee bags) 
 Bronze: €2000 | (includes up to 2 free registrations, the ability to place swag/goodies in the attendee bags) 
 Other individual levels can be arranged. 
 We are happy to discuss other sponsorship options as well. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. We look forward to this big and international event in Graz!

 General Information 
 The annual DIMVA conference serves as a premier forum for advancing the state of the art in the broader areas of intrusion detection, malware analysis, and vulnerability assessment. Each year, DIMVA brings together international experts from academia, industry, and government to present and discuss novel research in these areas. DIMVA is organized by the special interest group Security - Intrusion Detection and Response (SIDAR) of the German Informatics Society (GI). The conference proceedings will appear in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. 
 Topics of Interest 
 DIMVA solicits submissions of high-quality, original scientific papers presenting novel research on malware analysis, intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, and related systems security topics. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Intrusions 
 Novel approaches and domains 
 Insider detection 
 Prevention and response 
 Data leakage, exfiltration, and poisoning 
 Result correlation and cooperation 
 Evasion and other attacks 
 Potentials and limitation 
 Operational experiences 
 Privacy, legal, and social aspects 
 Targeted attacks 
 Analysis or detection of cryptocurrency heists 
 Malware 
 Automated analyses 
 Behavioral models 
 Prevention and containment 
 Classification 
 Lineage 
 Forensics and recovery 
 Underground economy 
 Vulnerabilities in malware 
 Financially targeted malware (e.g., ransomware, DeFi) 
 Vulnerability detection 
 Vulnerability prevention 
 Vulnerability analysis 
 Exploitation and defenses 
 Hardware vulnerabilities 
 Situational awareness 
 Active probing 
 Vulnerabilities in decentralized systems 
 Papers will be judged on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity. We expect all papers to provide enough details to enable reproducibility of the experimental results. We encourage papers that bridge research in different communities. We also welcome experience papers that clearly articulate lessons learnt. 
 Types of Submissions Solicited 
 We invitefull papersfor submission that present novel and mature research results. Full papers are limited to 20 pages in Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and appendices. 
 Papers that do not follow these formatting guidelines may be rejected without review. 
 While we do not accept short papers, we encourage authors to submit a poster instead, presenting original, still ongoing work that has not yet reached the maturity required for a full paper. For more information, please refer to the Call for Posters. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 DIMVA 2025 will adopt a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations must be excluded from the paper. Furthermore, authors should avoid obvious self-references, and should cite their own previous work in third person, whenever necessary. Papers that are not properly anonymized risk being rejected without review. 
 Submissions must be original work and may not be under submission to another venue at the time of review. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to physically present the submitted work at the conference, for the paper to be included in the proceedings. 
 Authors are encouraged to submit code appropriately anonymized, using, e.g.,https://anonymous.4open.science/. 
 Ethical considerations 
 Submissions that report experiments with data gathered from human subjects should disclose whether the research received approval from an institutional ethics review board (IRB), if applicable, and what measures were adopted to minimize risks to privacy. 
 Submissions that describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties (e.g., in case of probing of network devices), and how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software or system vendors or owners before publication. 
 If you have any questions, please contact the program chairs athref="mailto:pc-chairs@dimva.org:" - pc-chairs@dimva.org

Posters will be displayed in a forum setting, allowing attendees to mingle and engage with the presenters. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 Poster submissions must include two components: the poster draft and an accompanying poster paper. The poster paper should be at least 4 pages, but no more than 6 pages long, formatted according to the Springer LNCS guidelines, and this page count includes the bibliography and any appendices. Proposals are not anonymized and must clearly state the authors' names, affiliations, and contact information. The poster papers will be published in the proceedings. Please ensure that the title of the poster paper begins with the word "Poster". 
 The poster submission system is available athref="https://dimva25posters.hotcrp.com/" - https://dimva25posters.hotcrp.com/

 Sponsors 

Sponsorship Opportunities 
 We are looking for a few industry sponsors, primarily to provide them with an opportunity to engage with the participants. This way, we hope to make the local security community more visible to an international audience and create networking opportunities. 
 We offer three sponsorship levels, each of which includes a ticket for a researcher from the sponsoring company to mingle with attendees or place goodies/swag in the welcome bag that we hand out at check-in. 
 Sponsorship Benefits 
 All sponsors will have their logos displayed on the conference website. 
 Sponsors will be acknowledged in the opening remarks. 
 Sponsors will be mentioned in the acknowledgments of the conference proceedings. 
 An early confirmation (or decline) of sponsorship would help us with planning, but we need to know by June at the latest whether sponsorship is possible. 
 Sponsorship Levels 
 Gold: €4000 | (includes up to 4 free registrations, the option to have a table in the break area, the option to display a roll-up/poster, and the ability to place swag/goodies in the attendee bags) 
 Silver: €3000 | (includes up to 3 free registrations, the option to display a roll-up/poster, and the ability to place swag/goodies in the attendee bags) 
 Bronze: €2000 | (includes up to 2 free registrations, the ability to place swag/goodies in the attendee bags) 
 Other individual levels can be arranged. 
 We are happy to discuss other sponsorship options as well. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out. We look forward to this big and international event in Graz!
