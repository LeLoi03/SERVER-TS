 Webinars 
 href="https://www.dublincore.org/webinars/2024/lgbtq-voices-catalog/" - Centering LGBTQ+ Voices in Catalog Research

Libraries are addressing barriers faced by marginalized communities through improved catalog metadata. The Inclusive Catalog Use Lab (ICUL) focuses on user-based research to understand LGBTQ+ needs. Dr. Karen Snow and Dr. Brian Dobreski will share ICUL’s findings, highlighting user studies, focus groups, and solutions to support inclusive access for diverse communities.

 Blog posts 
 Announcing OpenWEMI 
 In 1998, the International Federation of Library Associations introduced a new model for library catalog data, focusing on the bibliographic relationships within metadata. This model, known as the Library Reference Model (LRM), includes four main elements: Work, Expression, Manifestation, and Item (WEMI), each representing different aspects of created resources. To support the broader use of these WEMI concepts, OpenWEMI was developed by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, providing a general vocabulary with minimal constraints. OpenWEMI’s RDF vocabulary includes classes and properties designed to facilitate the creation of context-specific metadata vocabularies, allowing for the flexible integration of WEMI concepts in diverse applications.

 Themes 
 The activities of DCMI, its members and its communities are broadly characterised under four themes. 
 StewardshipDCMI develops and curates open-standard metadata vocabularies such as the Dublin Core; hosts the Learning Resource Metadata Initiative (LRMI); and provides good-neighbor support for other related metadata activities.CommunityDCMI's international community of metadata practitioners and experts meet in working groups and at an annual conference to share implementation experience and reports on research and new developments.LearningTeachers and experts of metadata technologies from around the world hold tutorials, online meetings, and webinars to discuss and disseminate innovative metadata solutions.DevelopmentSince pioneering the Application Profile in the 1990s, DCMI continues to develop profiles and related vocabularies spanning practical techniques such as spreadsheets and modern technologies such as data shapes.Regional Members

NKOS is devoted to the discussion of the functional and data model for enabling knowledge organization systems/services (KOS), such as classification systems, thesauri, gazetteers, and ontologies, as networked interactive information services to support the description and retrieval of diverse information resources through the Internet. 
 Knowledge Organization Systems/Services (KOS) model the underlying semantic structure of a domain. Embodied as Web-based services, they can facilitate resource discovery and retrieval. They act as semantic road maps and make possible a common orientation by indexers and future users (whether human or machine). -- Douglas Tudhope, Traugott Koch (2004).New Applications of Knowledge Organization Systems: introduction to a special issue.URL: https://nkos.dublincore.org/ [Previous URL: https://nkos.slis.kent.edu]

In 2022, the twentieth International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications (DCMI 2022) is expanding its scope to the whole spectrum of innovation in metadata design implementation and best practices, with a special focus on challenges and opportunities in a diverse and data-intensive world. 
 Two years into the pandemic, the changes and rising needs for information justice and equity prompted the metadata community to reexamine how the metadata community address the biases and prejudice existed in the metadata tools and practices. Creating just, equitable representation of data and information resources and entities plays a significant role in promoting diversity and inclusion. These social and cultural changes coupled with the data-intensive, data-dependent, and data-driven environment demand metadata to be innovative, intelligent, interoperable, sharable, and reusable. Metadata as one of the underpinning dimensions for the digital data era has never been more critical than today. Fashionable fields such as linked (open) data, research data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, digital humanities and open science are dependent upon quality metadata to operate and perform effectively. Besides supporting information and data management, discovery, sharing, conservation, and reuse, metadata has become an invaluable source for analytics and knowledge discovery and make information more accessible for diverse communities. The parallel growth of data and metadata offers new challenges and opportunities for the metadata community to rethink and reposition metadata research and practice in order to stay ahead of the next wave of developments in data-driven environments and diverse cultures.
