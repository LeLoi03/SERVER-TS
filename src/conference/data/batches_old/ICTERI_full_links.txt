 20th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE 
 Dear Colleague, 
 ICTERI supports and respects all the aspects that help promote diversity in our conference community, which aspires to facilitate a truly international and multicultural gathering. Therefore, we prefer physical assembly for the conference as the most effective mode for scientific exchange and community building. We fully understand, however, that some participants might be under higher risk or stricter constraints, like international travellers. This is why we allow virtual participation for the attendees, as an exclusion which must be negotiated with the Program Chairs. 
 The speakers, who present accepted contributed papers, must be physically present at the conference. 
 The information about thearrangements and requirementsfor thevirtual attendeesare provided and updated athref="https://icteri.org/icteri-2025/hybrid/" - https://icteri.org/icteri-2025/hybrid/
