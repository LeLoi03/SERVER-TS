 Welcometo the Web site of the EDBT Association (edbt.org) 
 The Association 
 The EDBT Association is a non-political and non-profit organization for promoting and supporting research and progress in the fields of databases and information systems technology and applications. It was formed in 1990 to provide a stable structure to support the continuity of the EDBT Conference series; it changed its legal status in 1995, assuming the current legal form of an association according to Italian laws. 
 Our major activity is the promotion of the International Conference on Extending Database Technology (EDBT), which has been held every two years since 1988. From 2008 on, the Conference is being held annually. 
 The EDBT Association has close relationships with other organizations in the database field, includingACM SIGMOD,IEEE TC on Data Engineering,VLDB Endowment, and theICDT Council. 
 Conference Proceedings 
 In the beginning, the Conference Proceedings have been published bySpringer-Verlagas part of theLNCSSeries. We have also promoted a series of Summer Schools, started in 1991. 
 From 2008 to 2013, the Conference Proceedings have been published in the ACM Digital Library (part of the ACM International Conference Proceedings Series, AICPS); Open Access copies are located on this EDBT.org server in Germany. 
 In the year 2014, EDBT Proceedings moved to a new, fully Open Access publication platform they started in cooperation with the University of Konstanz Library:OpenProceedings.org. From this publication site, copies of all papers can be freely (re-)distributed under a Creative Commons License. 
 All EDBT Proceedings are listed in the Computer Science Bibliography athref="https://dblp.org/db/conf/edbt/index.html" - dblp.org

 In Memoriam 
 2022 
 Joachim W. Schmidtwas a founding member of the EDBT Association and long term member of the Executive Board. He has always given valuable advice for further developping the format, the scientific quality, and the attractiveness of our Conferences and Summer Schools. For many of us, he has been a true friend. Joachim passed away in May 2022. We are missing him. 
 2019 
 Christine Colletwas a senior member of the EDBT community, a long term member of the Executive Board and past President of the EDBT Association. Christine carried out these roles with good humour and enthusiasm, while still making sure that things were done. Christine passed away in early 2019. We are missing her.

 New Publication Scheduleof EDBT Conferences 2022ff. 
 3 Submit/Review Cycles 
 Starting with the 2022 edition of the EDBT Conference, we switched to a model of multiple review cycles like many other major conferences in our field: there are 3 cycles each year. Accepted papers of early cycles will be published in early numbers of the Proceedings volume. 
 The following picture explains the annual scheme for submission/review cycles and the publication of 3 numbers per volume of the EDBT Proceedings. 
 Submission deadlines and review schedules are always published on the Web site of the coming Conference. The exact publication dates in July, November and March as shown in this picture might slightly vary depending on the year. 
 12 Month Resubmission Ban 
 EDBT, like other conferences in our field with multiple submit/review cycles, follows a "12 month resubmission ban" model for rejected and withdrawn papers in each of its track formats: 
 EDBT conferences typically have tracks with short and long paper formats. Resubmission of work is not allowed to any track of EDBT if the work - or any work with substantial overlap with the submitted paper and with the same or overlapping sets of authors - was previously rejected from a track of EDBT in the same paper format, within 12 months. A paper withdrawn by the authors after a revision decision will be considered as rejected and the 12-month resubmission ban applies to such papers as well.

 Test of Time AwardsIn 2014, EDBT began to give a Test-of-time Award for the paper (or a small number of papers) that has had the most impact in terms of research, methodology, conceptual contribution, or transfer to practice since it appeared in the proceedings of EDBT.

 xStatutes 
 STATUTES -- with changes as of 26 March 2006 included -- TITLE I - GENERAL DISPOSITIONS Article 1 An association is founded, which is denominated "ASSOCIATION EDBT". The association has its seat in ... [Text removed from original to preserve privacy. Webmaster edbt.org]. Article 2 The association is non-political and does not have any intended use of profit. It makes as its object to promote and favour in Europe the progress and study of the technology and applications concerning the databases. To this end the association will be able to: 1. contribute to the advanced vocational training by promoting training courses and advanced continuity studies of problems, innovations and/or developments in the databases; 2. favour the exchange of experiences, information and data between the specialists of the branch . no matter how they are linked to the databases; 3. promote and coordinate studies and research in the field of the databases either directly in co-operation with the associates or with similar European or international corporations and institutes; 4. spread the knowledge of modern technologies concerning the databases and known problems with their introduction and their application, also by granting scholarships to young researchers, students and scientists; 5. unfold other useful activities with attaining indicated purposes under the condition that they do not represent a commercial activity. Article 3 Always to reach the proper objective the association can promote the institution of a meeting having an international character that is called .International Convention Extending Data Base Technology.. But the association cannot charge itself with organising the convention, what must thus be carried out by natural persons or corporations, in comparison to whom/which the association will maintain the fullest independence. The association will instead occupy itself . also by means of the right own associates . with the obliged scientific aspects at the to-be-provided, to-be-required convention, also at the scientific directorate. Article 4 In order to carry out the appropriate purpose the association will take care of the initial assets made available by the founding members, and also of the voluntary contributions meanwhile effected by the other associates or other corporations interested in the activities of the association. Article 5 The organs of the association are: a) assembly of the associates; b) the Managing Board. TITLE II . THE ASSOCIATES Article 6 The natural persons of the association and the juridical persons, who due to their work activity or study are interested in the activities of the association itself, can participate. The admission to the association at the proposal of the Managing Board will be decided at the discretional procedure of the assembly of the associates. In particular those, who will have covered the positions of General Chairperson, Program Committee Chairperson, Organisation Committee Chairperson in the international convention EDBT, will be invited by the Managing Board to make available their experiences at the end of the meeting by becoming members of the association, if they should not yet have been such associates. Article 7 Associates can resign from the Association by written notice. The Managing Board can exclude associates upon repeated failure to attend the annual meeting or otherwise participate in the association's activities. Exclusion by such a decision needs to be brought to the associate's attention with appropriate notice in advance. Associates are responsible for keeping their contact information up-to-date. Associates who are not reachable due to failure of doing so are not counted on voting quotas and may be excluded from the association TITLE III . MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATES Article 8 The statutory/ordinary meeting of the associates convoked upon deliberate resolution of the Managing Board not less than twenty days before the date fixed for the session reconvenes in the locality to be indicated in the memorandum of convocation, at least once a year, to provide and to deliberate about the financial reporting, about the state of assets and all other arguments of general character entered to the order of the day by initiative of the Managing Board, otherwise upon request of at least five associates. The meeting will stipulate the criteria, to which the executive committee must adhere in promoting the scientific activity of the association and moreover the convention EDBT concerning art. 3. The date and agenda of the meeting are communicated to the associates by registered letter or whatever other means, which the Managing Board will deem to consider appropriate. Article 9 All associates are authorised to intervene in the meeting; each one of the associates will be able to represent one or more other associates provided he is furnished with regular instruction in writing. For the legal convocation of the meeting and for the validity of the resolutions the support operation of at least 50% of the registered associates is required. In lack of the legal number in the second convocation the meeting is valid with any number of associates being present or represented. The date of this session will be fixed in the same notification of convocation as of the first one. The Managing Board can admit the vote for concurrence on determined arguments to the order of the day and on the election of the corporate charges/positions. Two associates nominated by the chairman when opening the assembly will execute the recount of the cast ballots. Article 10 The meeting makes resolutions by a majority of votes of the associates present or represented by means of regular delegation in writing issued to the other associate. The vote for concurrence must arrive at least on the day before the meeting and will be contained in the count of the associates who are present at the end of the legal establishment of the meeting. Article 11 The assembly/meeting elects from the associates who are present a chairman and a secretary at the beginning of each session. The secretary provides to draw up the minutes of the resolutions of the assembly. The minutes must be signed by the chairman of the assembly, by the secretary and by the polling clerks, if here the voting is done. Article 12 Extraordinary and ordinary meetings can be convoked by deliberation of the Managing Board or upon demand of such associates who do represent not less than the tenth part of the inscribed ones. Article 13 The members assembled in the meeting can modify the present statute, but cannot modify the purposes of the association as fixed by the preceding articles 2 and 3. For the validity of the resolutions, as of the preceding passage . no matter whether in the first or second convocation . the presence of at least half of the associates and favourable vote of three fifths of the present, cast or represented votes is required. TITLE IV . THE MANAGING BOARD Article 14 The Managing Board is nominated by the meeting and is composed of not less than three members, the number of the members of the Managing Board will be determined by the assembly itself. For the first time the determination of the number of the members and their assignment will be effected in the constituting act. The Managing Board endures in office for four years. In case of dismissal of councillors before expiry of the mandate the Managing Board will provide for their substitution by co-option. The councillors so nominated remain in office until the successive orderly meeting. If for some reason the number of councillors is reduced to less than two thirds, the whole Managing Board must be renewed. The office of councillor is gratuitous. Article 15 The Managing Board is endowed with every power to decide on initiatives to be assumed and the criteria to be followed for the pursuit and attention of the purposes of the association and for its management and ordinary and extraordinary administration. In particular the board: a) fixes the directives for the execution of the statutory tasks, hence stabilises the terms and responsibilities of execution and verifies the execution itself; b) decides concerning the questions of assets; c) can stabilise the founding of the technical committees and commissions for the studying of various problems that are pertinent to the purposes of the association; d) decides on the activities and initiatives of the association and its collaboration with third persons at the norm of art. 2 and determines the amount of eventual contributions on deficit account to the organisers of the EDBT convention; e) approves the projects of the budget, financial plan and status of assets to be presented to the meeting of the associates. Article 16 The Managing Board nominates from among their members a chairman who stays in office for the whole period of the council. This meeting takes place whenever this is necessary, by initiative of the chairman or at least a quarter of the board members. Article 17 The resolutions of the Managing Board are taken by the majority of votes of the councillors who are present. In case of a parity of votes that of the chairman has prevalence. The decisions of the meeting are valid, if at least half of the councillors take part at the meeting. Article 18 The signature and legal representation of the association as against any judicial and administrative authority and as against third persons are conferred to the chairman of the Managing Board. By statute all powers necessary for the bank activities and financial activities of the association - as there exist at exemplified and not exhaustive title . are attributed to the chairman, the opening and closing of current bank accounts, stock deposit, the faculty of operating also through cheques on same accounts, effecting payments and drawings within the limits of the conceded entrusted documents, collection of sums of any title, issuance of receipts and actuating in general all that would be necessary for the economic and financial management of the association, nothing excluded nor excepted.

 xTest of Time Award 2014 
 Starting in 2014, EDBT gives a Test-of-time Award for the paper (or a small number of papers) that has had the most impact in terms of research, methodology, conceptual contribution, or transfer to practice since it appeared in the proceedings of EDBT. 
 The EDBT ToT award for 2014 will be presented during the EDBT/ICDT 2014 Joint Conference, March 24-27, 2014 in Athens, Greece (href="http://www.edbticdt2014.gr/" - http://www.edbticdt2014.gr/
). 
 The EDBT 2014 Test of Time Award committee was formed by Gustavo Alonso, Torsten Grust and Walid Aref, all members of the EDBT 2014 PC and chaired by Sihem Amer-Yahia, the EDBT 2014 PC chair. The committee was charged with selecting a paper or a small number of papers from the EDBT 2004 proceedings that has had the most impact in terms of research, methodology, conceptual contribution, or transfer to practice over the past decade. After careful consideration, the committee has decided to select the following paper as the EDBT ToT Award winner for 2014:

 A Condensation Approach to Privacy Preserving Data Mining 
 EDBT 2004, pp. 183-199 (electronic edition) 
 The paper addresses the topic of privacy-preserving data mining and proposes a framework for anonymization in contrast to perturbation approaches that introduce noise. The approach advocated in this paper takes into consideration the correlated nature of multi-dimensional data and also that is not problem-specific, i.e., the framework is generic and many mining operations can be formulated and solved given the same framework. 
 The paper is seminal and covers a topic which has not lost relevance today. It constitutes a prime example of how far a simple idea (in this case condensation: reduce a group of records to a number of carefully selected statistical properties of that group) can carry a whole line of original research. Condensation comes with a naturally built-in "privacy dial" (namely the group size) and is practical (easily implemented, maintainable under updates). It established general techniques that have been taken up by many people in the area and outside the area. The results in this paper can be (and have been) generalized in many ways as they tackled a more general problem of grouping, aggregation, and sampling. 
 According to Google Scholar, the paper has been constantly cited in the period from 2005 until today (2013) with a remarkable peak in 2008 when privacy-preserving data mining and database security in general became research topics of core interest. Since 2009 until today, the number of citations has only gone up. Papers citing this paper are also highly cited, indicating the relevance of the contribution. 
 A number offollow-up papersby the same authors, quite clearly demonstrate that the proposed condensation approach has interesting aspects: 
  
 2005 | Proc. of the 5th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining,"On variable constraints in privacy preserving data mining" 
 2008 | Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 16 (3),"A framework for condensation-based anonymization of string data"

 2008 | Handbook of Database Security,"Privacy-Preserving Data Mining: A Survey". Springer book "Privacy-Preserving Data Mining", edited by Aggarwal and Yu. 
 Work on condensation-based privacy in data mining also had animpact on industry and industrial practice. At least the following US patents (or patent applications) are based on the idea of condensation:

 Geo-Relational Algebra: A Model and Query Language for Geometric Database Systems 
 EDBT 1988, pp. 506-527 (electronic edition) 
 The paper addresses the user’s conceptual model of a database system for geometric data. It proposes to extend relational database management systems by integrating geometry at all levels: At the conceptual level, relational algebra is extended to include geometric data types and operators. At the implementation level, the wealth of algorithms and data structures for geometric problems developed in the past decade in the field of Computational Geometry is exploited. The paper starts from a view of relational algebra as a many-sorted algebra which allows to easily embed geometric data types and operators. A concrete algebra for two-dimensional applications is developed. It can be used as a highly expressive retrieval and data manipulation language for geometric as well as standard data. Also, geo-relational database systems and their implementation strategy are discussed. 
 The committee members unanimously agreed that this paper clearly stands out in terms of relevance, impact, and influence in databases. Of all the papers considered, this is the one that had had the most and longest lasting impact with results that are still relevant today and whose influence can be traced to many real systems and a significant amount of follow up work. 
 The paper pioneered an important application area well before it became mainstream and did it in a systematic and clean way that has been very influential in both research and practice. Modern commercial systems all support geographic data types that are nowadays used in a wide range of applications and use cases (maps locations based services, geographic information systems, mobility etc.). 
 The selection committee also appreciated very much the cleanliness completeness, insights, formalism, and systematic treatment of the problem as well as the approach followed by the author in selecting and solving a research problem.

 Bridging Physical and Virtual Worlds: Complex Event Processing for RFID Data Streams 
 EDBT 2006, pp. 588-607 (electronic edition) 
 The paper proposes an event-oriented approach to the processing of RFID data which makes it possible to automate the translation of RFID based application semantics through complex event detection. In particular, it demonstrates the ability to process complex events by capturing temporal constraints in an algebra. The resulting declarative event-based approach is shown to simplify RFID data processing and is shown to be scalable. The paper pioneers declarative event-based RFID processing. The simplicity and expressiveness of the proposed framework are admirable. For example, the framework makes it possible to express object tracking on historical data as well as to formulate real-time monitoring. 
 The committee and the EDBT executive board find that this paper stands out in terms of relevance, impact, and influence in databases. It has had substantial impact. In particular, it has impacted real systems, and the engine it proposes has been integrated into Siemens RFID Middleware. It is also the most cited EDBT 2006 paper, has spurred a significant amount of follow-up work, and remains relevant today.

 Mining Sequential Patterns: Generalizations and Performance Improvements 
 EDBT 1996, pp. 3-17 (electronic edition) 
 This paper has made substantial contributions to data mining, and has had great influence on the work of others, as reflected by over 2900 citations on Google Scholar. 
 The paper formalizes a new variant of the problem of miningsequentialpatterns and develops and implements GSP, an algorithm to solve this problem. This paper extends the definition of sequence mining that was introduced by the same authors in a previous publication: Mining Sequential Patterns. ICDE 1995. The goal is to discover all sequential patterns with a user-specified minimum support from a database of sequences, where each sequence is a list of transactions ordered by transaction-time, and each transaction is a set of items. The proposed extensions are: 
 Time constraints: the authors generalised their previous definition of sequential patterns to admit max-gap and min-gap time constraints between adjacent elements of a sequential pattern. 
 Sliding windows: the authors relaxed the restriction that all the items in an element of a sequential pattern must come from the same transaction, and allowed a user-specified window-size within which the items can be present. 
 Taxonomies: the sequential patterns may include items across different levels of a taxonomy. 
 GSP guarantees that all rules that have a user-specified minimum support. It is shown to be much faster than the AprioriAll algorithm in the previous publication (on both synthetic and real data). GSP has been implemented as part of the Quest data mining prototype at IBM Research, and is incorporated in the IBM data mining product.

 Social ties and their relevance to churn in mobile telecom networks 
 EDBT 2008, pp. 668-677 (electronic edition) 
 This industry track paper reports on an analysis of mobile telecoms data, with a view to predicting which customers will leave. The analysis involves commercial mobile telephony data, in which nodes are customers and edges represent calls. The hypothesis tested is that it is possible to predict who will leave a network based on earlier departures among their connections. The main technique investigated is the use of spreading activation, to predict the heat of nodes based on the heat of connected notes. It is shown how the approach based on connections is more effective than classification techniques based on other properties of the nodes. As a result, the paper provides early and compelling experience on the combination an important real problem (churn in mobile telecom networks) with a powerful technique (social ties) and applies it on large real data (telecom operator network over 4 months). The approach has influenced many subsequent studies, for the same problem, but also for analyses involving different types of network and different hypotheses. Social network analysis continues as an important and active area ten years later, and this paper continues to be widely cited.

 Shore-MT: a scalable storage manager for the multicore era 
 EDBT 2009, pp. 24–35 (electronic edition) 
 The committee members agreed that this paper clearly stands out in terms of methodology, impact, and influ- ence. It has catalyzed and enabled substantial follow-up research and has demonstrated its high relevance to industry. 
 Abstract: 
 Historically, database engines focused on the ability to efficiently overlap many requests over a small number processor cores, with I/O latencies and scalability as the main design driver. However, the advent of increas- ingly multicore hardware circa 2000 brought new challenges because concurrent transactions begin to stress the limits of the storage manager’s thread scalability by accessing its internal structures simultaneously and in large numbers. This EDBT 2009 paper shows the results of experiments running benchmarks on four (then and still) popular open-source storage managers (Shore, BerkeleyDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL) on a multi- core machine. The results show that all systems suffer from scalability bottlenecks at the storage engine level. From that research emerged Shore-MT, an open-source multithreaded and highly scalable storage manager, built with Shore as a base. We learned that designers should favor scalability over single-thread performance, and we identified several other key principles for architecting scalable storage engines. 
 Ten years later, Shore-MT work has concluded, although the system still serves as a research platform in the space. Meanwhile, research on transaction processing scalability continues to mature, the move to main- memory transaction processing and their higher TPS increased the need for scalable storage managers, while the popular open-source systems, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, significantly improved their scalability. In particular, a significant amount of research and industrial developments in the ten years since the Shore-MT paper focused on improving the scalability of individual components of a storage manager, such as latches, the logging subsystem and access methods. This research was partly carried out by our research group as follow- on work, but other research groups and database vendors have made important contributions as well. Another significant amount of effort has focused on scalable concurrency control protocols, again both within and outside our research group. The knowledge that we have gained from building Shore-MT has been invaluable in maintaining scalability in this new, multi-dimensional ecosystem.

 Optimizing joins in a map-reduce environment 
 EDBT 2010, pp. 99-110 (electronic edition) 
 Abstract: 
 Implementations of map-reduce are being used to perform many operations on very large data. We examine strategies for joining several relations in the map-reduce environment. Our new approach begins by identifying the "map-key," the set of attributes that identify the Reduce process to which a Map process must send a particular tuple. Each attribute of the map-key gets a "share," which is the number of buckets into which its values are hashed, to form a component of the identifier of a Reduce process. Relations have their tuples replicated in limited fashion, the degree of replication depending on the shares for those map-key attributes that are missing from their schema. We study the problem of optimizing the shares, given a fixed number of Reduce processes. An algorithm for detecting and fixing problems where an attribute is "mistakenly" included in the map-key is given. Then, we consider two important special cases: chain joins and star joins. In each case we are able to determine the map-key and determine the shares that yield the least replication. While the method we propose is not always superior to the conventional way of using map-reduce to implement joins, there are some important cases involving large-scale data where our method wins, including: (1) analytic queries in which a very large fact table is joined with smaller dimension tables, and (2) queries involving paths through graphs with high out-degree, such as the Web or a social network. 
 This paper presented optimization strategies for executing multi-way joins in a map-reduce environment. It focused on large-scale data and provided algorithms to choose the number of map-keys and shares in order to minimize the communication cost among the map and reduce processes. The committee members agreed that this paper clearly pioneered the field of join processing in map-reduce environments. It has triggered substantial follow-up research and impact on big data processing in parallel and distributed architectures.

 SeMiTri: a framework for semantic annotation of heterogeneous trajectories 
 EDBT 2011, pp. 259-270 (electronic edition) 
 because it is one of the earliest papers to propose a general method for enriching moving object trajectories with semantics useful for supporting location-based services, which have been and still are in high demand across several application sectors. Since its publication, SeMiTri has generated significant interest, and follow-up work on semantic processing of mobile data and trajectories. 
 Abstract: 
 GPS devices allow recording the movement track of the moving object they are attached to. This data typically consists of a stream of spatio-temporal (x,y,t) points. For application purposes the stream is transformed into finite subsequences called trajectories. Existing knowledge extraction algorithms defined for trajectories mainly assume a specific context (e.g. vehicle movements) or analyze specific parts of a trajectory (e.g. stops), in association with data from chosen geographic sources (e.g. points-of-interest, road networks). We investigate a more comprehensive semantic annotation framework that allows enriching trajectories with any kind of semantic data provided by multiple 3rd party sources. 
 This paper presents SeMiTri - the framework that enables annotating trajectories for any kind of moving objects. Doing so, the application can benefit from a "semantic trajectory" representation of the physical movement. The framework and its algorithms have been designed to work on trajectories with varying data quality and different structures, with the objective of covering abstraction requirements of a wide range of applications. Performance of SeMiTri has been evaluated using many GPS datasets from multiple sources - including both fast moving objects (e.g. cars, trucks) and people's trajectories (e.g. with smartphones). These two kinds of experiments are reported in this paper.

 Efficient parallel kNN joins for large data in MapReduce 
 EDBT 2012, pp. 38-49 (href="https://openproceedings.org/2012/conf/edbt/ZhangLJ12.pdf" - electronic edition

 The EDBT 2022 Test of Time Award committee was formed by Bill Howe, University of Washington, USA Julia Stoyanovich, New York University, USA Jens Teubner, TU Dortmund, Germany Xiaofang Zhou, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong.Abstract: 
 In data mining applications and spatial and multimedia databases, a useful tool is the kNN join, which is to produce the k nearest neighbors (NN), from a dataset S, of every point in a dataset R. Since it involves both the join and the NN search, performing kNN joins efficiently is a challenging task. Meanwhile, applications continue to witness a quick (exponential in some cases) increase in the amount of data to be processed. A popular model nowadays for large-scale data processing is the shared-nothing cluster on a number of commodity machines using MapReduce [6]. Hence, how to execute kNN joins efficiently on large data that are stored in a MapReduce cluster is an intriguing problem that meets many practical needs. This work proposes novel (exact and approximate) algorithms in MapReduce to perform efficient parallel kNN joins on large data. We demonstrate our ideas using Hadoop. Extensive experiments in large real and syn- thetic datasets, with tens or hundreds of millions of records in both R and S and up to 30 dimensions, have demonstrated the efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability of our methods.

 HIL: A High-Level Scripting Language for Entity Integration 
 EDBT 2013, pp. 549-560 (href="https://openproceedings.org/2013/conf/edbt/HernandezKKPW13.pdf" - electronic edition
) 
 The EDBT 2023 Test of Time Award committee was formed by Sihem Amer-Yahia Alon Halevy Divesh Srivastava.Abstract: 
 We introduce HIL, a high-level scripting language for entity resolution and integration. HIL aims at providing the core logic for complex data processing flows that aggregate facts from large collections of structured or unstructured data into clean, unified entities. Such flows typically include many stages of processing that start from the outcome of information extraction and continue with entity resolution, mapping and fusion. A HIL program captures the overall integration flow through a combination of SQL-like rules that link, map, fuse and aggregate entities. A salient feature of HIL is the use of logical indexes in its data model to facilitate the modular construction and aggregation of complex entities. Another feature is the presence of a flexible, open type system that allows HIL to handle input data that is irregular, sparse or partially known. As a result, HIL can accurately express complex integration tasks while still being high-level and focused on the logical entities (rather than the physical operations). Compilation algorithms translate the HIL specification into efficient run-time queries that can execute in parallel on Hadoop. We show how our framework is applied to real-world integration of entities in the financial domain, based on public filings archived by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Furthermore, we apply HIL on a larger-scale scenario that performs fusion of data from hundreds of millions of Twitter messages into tens of millions of structured entities

 The EDBT 2024 Test of Time Award committee was formed by Minos Garofalakis Davide Martinenghi Baihua Zheng.Abstract: 
 A key problem in many graph-based applications is the need to know, given a directed graph G and two vertices u, v ∈ G whether there is a path between u and v, i. e., if u reaches v. This problem is particularly challenging in the case of very large real-world graphs. A common approach is the pre- processing of the graphs, in order to produce an efficient index structure, which allows fast access to the reachability information of the vertices. However, the majority of existing methods can not handle very large graphs. We propose in this paper, a novel indexing method called FELINE (Fast rEfined onLINE search), which is inspired by Dominance Graph Drawing. FELINE creates an index from the graph representation in a two-dimensional plane, which provides reachability information in constant time for a significant portion of queries. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency of FELINE compared to state-of-the-art approaches 
 The EDBT Test-of-Time award for 2024 will be presented during the EDBT/ICDT 2024 Conference (href="https://dastlab.github.io/edbticdt2024/" - https://dastlab.github.io/edbticdt2024/
) in Paestum, Italy, as part of the Awards session on March 27, 2024.
