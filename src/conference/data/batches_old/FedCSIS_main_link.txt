FedCSIS 2025Invited speakers and Keynotes 
 Themissionof the FedCSIS Conference Series is to provide a presentation, discussion and a reputable publication forum in computer science and intelligence systems. The forum invites researchers and practitioners from around the world to contribute their research results focused on their scientific and professional interests in a chosen area. 
 The FedCSIS conference consists of theMain TrackandThematic Session. Papers submitted to the Main Track can be assigned, by their authors, toTopical Areas,which are managed byTopical Area Curators. Based on the scope of the contribution, Topical Area Curators select its reviewers from theMain TrackProgram Committee. Besides the Main Track, the authors may prefer to submit their papers to Thematic Session, which announce their ownCalls for Thematic Session Papersand are assisted by the FedCSIS Chairs in reaching out to the FedCSIS Community. 
 For all five Topical Areas, situated within a general domain of Computer Science, the continually emerging topic of Intelligence Systems stands as the common denominator. All Thematic Sessions also refer to the Intelligence Systems from different perspectives. They are regarded as a path toward introducing more Intelligence into Computer Science and IT.
