 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLOUD COMPUTING 
 CLOUD 2025 
 IEEE CLOUD is the flagship conference focusing on innovative cloud computing across all “Everything as a Service” (XaaS) paradigms. This includes modeling, designing, developing, publishing, monitoring, managing, operating, delivering, and scaling XaaS offerings from the cloud to the edge. The conference is a prime international forum for researchers, academics, businesses, industry, and standard bodies to exchange the latest advances in the state of the art and practice of cloud computing, identify emerging research topics, and define the future of cloud computing. 
 CLOUD 2025 is part of IEEE World Congress on SERVICES 2025, solely sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society under the auspice of the Technical Community on Services Computing (TCSVC). The scope of SERVICES 2025 covers all aspects of services computing and applications, current or emerging. Centered around services computing, SERVICES 2025 covers various systems and networking research pertaining to cloud, edge and Internet-of Things (IoT), as well as technologies for intelligent computing, learning, Big Data and blockchain applications, addressing critical issues such as knowledge network, high performance, security, privacy, dependability, trustworthiness, and cost-effectiveness. In addition to co-located theme-topic conferences, the Congress will also include symposia and workshops supporting deep-dive discussions on emerging important topics, and complement the SERVICES 2025 program with industry and application presentations and panels. Authors are invited to prepare early and submit original papers to any of these conferences at www.easychair.org. All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. Accepted and presented papers will appear in the conference proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. SERVICES 2025 is the only premier professional event for the services computing field offered by IEEE.
