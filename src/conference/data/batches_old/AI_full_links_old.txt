 Welcome to IJCAI 2025 
 Montreal, 16th – 22nd August, 2025 
 Welcome to IJCAI 2025, the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, the premier international gathering of researchers in AI! 
 Call for Papers 
 We invite submissions for the 34th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), scheduled to take place in Montreal, Canada, from August 16 to August 22, 2025. To support authors who may experience difficulties obtaining Canadian visas, a satellite event will be hosted in Guangzhou, China, from August 28 to August 31, 2025. Since its founding in 1969, IJCAI has been the premier conference for the global AI community, fostering the exchange of groundbreaking advancements and achievements in artificial intelligence research. 
 In addition to the main track, authors will be able to submit papers to four special tracks (AI for Social Good, AI and Arts, Human-Centred AI, and AI Enabling Critical Technologies), as well as the survey track; these tracks will post their calls for papers later this year, and their deadlines, procedures and policies may differ from what is described below. 
 Submissions to IJCAI 2025 should report significant, original, and previously unpublished results on any aspect of artificial intelligence. Papers on novel AI research problems, AI techniques for novel application domains, and papers that cross discipline boundaries within AI are especially encouraged. 
 A selection of distinguished papers submitted to IJCAI 2025 will be invited for expedited reviewing and publication in the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ) or the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR).
