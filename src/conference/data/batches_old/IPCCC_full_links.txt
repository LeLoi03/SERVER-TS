The International Performance, Computing, and Communications Conference is a premier IEEE conference presenting research in the performance of computer and communication systems. For over four decades, IPCCC has been a research forum for academic, industrial, and government researchers. We encourage submission of high-quality papers reporting original work in both theoretical and experimental research areas. This year, IPCCC will be utilizingIEEE Open Previewto allow the conference proceedings to be available in theIEEEXplore® Digital Libraryand conference mobile app (if applicable), free of charge to all IEEEXplore® customers, prior to the conference start date. 
 All papers should be submitted athttps://edas.info/N32297. The following types of papers are accepted for submission:
