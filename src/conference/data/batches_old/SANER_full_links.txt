 Description 
 Nuit Blanche à Montréal 
 Polytechnique Montréal 
 Conference Venue 
 SANER 2025 
 The IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER) is the premier event on the theory and practice of recovering information from existing software and systems. The event explores innovative methods to extract the many kinds of information that can be recovered from software, software engineering documents, and systems artifacts, and examines innovative ways of using this information in system renewal and program understanding. 
 SANER promotes discussion and interaction among researchers and practitioners about the development of maintainable systems, and the improvement, evolution, migration, and reengineering of existing systems. The venue also explores innovative methods of extraction for the many kinds of information of interest to software developers and examines innovative ways of using this information in system renewal and program understanding. 
 SANER will feature technical research paper sessions, workshops, an early research achievements track, an industry paper track, a tool demonstration track, and a dedicated track on negative results in software analysis, evolution and reengineering. 
 Why you should come to Montreal 
 Montreal is Canada’s cultural capital, a bilingual metropolis where the charm of Europe melds with the innovation of North America. It is the country’s second-largest urban centre, with a population of 4.1 million. Forbes named it the world’s tenth-cleanest city in 2007. Montreal is a melting pot of over 200 cultures, as reflected in its diverse culinary landscape. It is an academic hub and home to six major universities and their affiliated schools. Montreal’s reputation for blending a safe and vibrant environment with rich cultural experiences earned it the title of the best student city in the world by QS in 2017, attracting approximately 50,000 international students each year and positioning itself at the forefront of innovation and education. 
 Winter in Montreal transforms the city into a snowy playground, offering a multitude of vibrant activities. The season is perfect for gliding across the picturesque Bonsecours Basin ice skating rink or taking a festive stroll through theMontreal en Lumière festival, where light installations, live performances, and culinary delights dazzle the senses. For the adventurous, the nearby Mont Royal has become a haven for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing, offering panoramic views of the city blanketed in white. Not to be missed is the city’s renowned underground city, a warm respite from the chill, lined with shops and art displays. In March of every year, the city comes alive duringNuit Blanche, an all-night celebration of culture and arts, where galleries, theatres, and public spaces host an array of activities, performances, and interactive experiences that captivate residents and visitors alike. 
 For those attending the SANER 2025 conference, Montreal offers more than academic fulfillment; it provides a tapestry of experiences that intertwine with the city’s lifestyle. With a plethora of festivals, a vibrant underground city, world-class museums, bustling markets, exquisite culinary delights, colourful street art, diverse architecture, a rich tapestry of languages, and a thriving craft beer culture, it’s a place that fully engages all your senses.
