 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Security and Defense Applications (IEEE CISDA) 
 Given the current global security environment, there has been increased interest within the security and defense communities in novel techniques for solving challenging problems. The genesis of this interest lies in the fact that repeated attempts of using traditional techniques have left many important problems unsolved, and in some cases, not addressed. New problems have emerged within the broad areas of security and defense that are difficult to tackle with conventional methods, thus requiring new techniques for detecting and adapting to emerging threats. The purpose of the symposium is to present current and ongoing efforts in computational intelligence (e.g., neural networks, fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence, and other emerging learning or optimization techniques) as applied to security and defense problems. 
 This symposium aims at publishing high-quality research efforts rooted in Computational Intelligence as applied to defense and security problems. First-class contributions addressing research challenges in these areas and their CI-based solutions (i.e., neural networks, fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence, rough sets, granular computing, and other emerging learning or optimization techniques) are solicited.

) 
 Call for Workshops/Tutorials 
 The organizing committee for SSCI 2023 is inviting proposals for workshops/tutorials from computational intelligence experts to be presented as part of the conference program. The workshops/tutorials should focus on a specific theme, and both theoretical and methodological aspects are welcome. The workshops/tutorials typically last 2-6 hours, with an average of 30 participants. To submit a proposal, please include the title, abstract, an overview of the topic, a schedule with topic, time allocation, and a short biography of each presenter. The proposals should be sent directly to the Workshop Chair via email:
