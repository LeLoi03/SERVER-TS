 Abstract 
 Rhotic approximants in English are produced with considerable articulatory variability across speakers and contexts. Although this variability has been examined in North American, British 
 and New Zealand varieties, it has not been documented using instrumental methods in Australian English (AusE). We therefore examined rhotic approximants produced by six speakers of AusE in nine vowel contexts using ultrasound tongue imaging. Three broad patterns of tongue shaping were observed, and speakers differed in the type and degree of vocalic influence on rhotic posture. Implications for phonological characterization of AusE /ô/ are discussed, along with methodological considerations for ultrasound studies.

 University of MelbourneThe Australasian Speech Science and Technology Association (ASSTA) is a scientific association which aims to advance the understanding of speech science and its application to speech technology in a way that is appropriate for Australia and New Zealand. 
 In order to fulfil these aims the Association seeks to provide significant exchange between those actively involved in speech science and technology research and practice, between this multidisciplinary body of professionals and the community in general as well as other national and international bodies having related aims.
