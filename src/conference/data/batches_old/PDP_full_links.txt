The PDP conference 
 PDP stands as a premier European and international conference that comprehensively addresses all facets ofparallelanddistributedprocessing. Encompassing a spectrum from foundational theory to practical implementation, it spans systems of all scales—from small configurations to the largest infrastructures. PDP addresses fundamental computational challenges alongside robust applications and delves into architecture, compiler, language, interface design and deployment, tools, support infrastructures, and performance optimization. 
 Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing fields have evolved significantly, marked by the emergence of novel architectures and groundbreaking applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a major application area, leveraging parallel and distributed technologies to enhance computational efficiency and enable sophisticated AI models. This progress emphasizes the dynamic fusion of parallel and distributed technologies with other rapidly advancing domains. In evaluating these cutting-edge developments, it is imperative to highlight the latest research achievements in established areas of parallel and distributed computing, drawing insights from 
 both industrial and academic perspectives. 
 The 2025 PDP Conference will offer a high-quality program featuring research papers, special sessions, and stimulating keynote speakers. 
  
 Proceedings of the conference will be published byConference Publishing Servicesand submitted for indexing in Scopus.

 PDP 2025: Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing 
 24 January 2025 
 The 33°International Conference on Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing(href="https://pdp2025.org/" - PDP25
) is organized and will be held at the University of Turin from March 12-14. The event is actively supported by E4 Computer Engineering, which will also be a Gold Sponsor, where attendees will be able to visit the company’s booth and talk with the team about high-tech solutions for HPC clusters, cloud services, data analytics, artificial intelligence and hyper-converged infrastructure. 
 PDP is the first European and international conference to comprehensively address all aspects of parallel and distributed computing. Encompassing a spectrum from fundamental theory to practical implementation, it embraces systems of all scales, from small configurations to the largest infrastructures. The PDP addresses fundamental computational challenges along with robust applications and addresses architecture, compiler, language, interface design and implementation, tools, supporting infrastructure, and performance optimization. 
 The fields of parallel, distributed, and network-based computing have evolved significantly, with the emergence of new architectures and innovative applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a major application area, leveraging parallel and distributed technologies to improve computational efficiency and enable sophisticated AI models. This progress underscores the dynamic fusion of parallel and distributed technologies with other rapidly evolving fields. In evaluating these cutting-edge developments, it is imperative to highlight the latest research results in the established areas of parallel and distributed computing, drawing insights from 
 industrial and academic perspectives.
