This conference stands as a premier platform for the exchange of innovative ideas in-depth discussions on solutions, and the sharing of invaluable experiences among esteemed researchers and professionals hailing from both academia and industry, all deeply invested in the realms of wireless networks and mobile communications. WINCOM, as the flagship conference of the MobiTic Association will be thematically anchored in "Global smart connectivity" for its upcoming edition. The scholarly contributions presented at WINCOM 2025 will undergo rigorous scrutiny for submission to IEEExplore, with the aim of securing indexation within the esteemed digital library. Furthermore, these submissions will be presented to renowned indexing services such as SCOPUS, ISI, DBLP, and other leading platforms. Papers demonstrating outstanding merit may be singled out for recommendation towards inclusion in a special issue of select international journals. Ongoing discussions are actively pursued with various international journals for the prospective publication of the selected papers. 
 Demo-Hackathon: 
 WINCOM 2025 will consider this year proposals for demonstrations of research prototypes and novel applications. The conference will provide forum for PhD students and early career researchers to showcase their prototypes. We will also encourage submission of ideas for running hackathons collocated with event. Best demo and hackathon winner will also be presented in the WINCOM'2025 in closing ceremony.

 Hyperledger Fabric Platform for Secure and Efficient Data Sharing in Autonomous Vehicles 
 Alhabib, ReemandYadav, Poonamorcid.org/0000-0003-0169-0704(2024)Hyperledger Fabric Platform for Secure and Efficient Data Sharing in Autonomous Vehicles.In:Zaidi, Syed Ali Raza,Ibrahimi, Khalil,El Kamili, Mohamed,Kobbane, AbdellatifandAslam, Nauman, (eds.) Proceedings - 11th International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications, WINCOM 2024.11th International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications, WINCOM 2024, 23-25 Jul 2024 Proceedings - 11th International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications, WINCOM 2024 . IEEE Communications Society , GBRAbstract 
 Advancements in wireless communication, encompassing cellular and non-terrestrial networks, are empowering Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to revolutionize transportation. The achievement of real-time data exchange and seamless communication with infrastructure promises a future of safer and more efficient travel. However, the significant challenge of efficiently managing the extensive data generated by AVs persists. This data includes sensor readings, information about the surrounding environment, and potentially user data. Consequently, addressing concerns related to data processing, sharing among various stakeholders, privacy, integrity, and security is of utmost importance. This paper tackles the data sharing challenge by proposing and evaluating a platform built on Hyperledger Fabric, a blockchain technology. This platform aims to facilitate secure and efficient data sharing between all parties involved with AVs. Our initial testing reveals that the number of simulated users (virtual user count) and the amount of data processed (data load) can negatively impact the system’s performance. This highlights the need for further optimization to ensure the platform can handle large-scale data sharing effectively.

 HIFFR:Hybrid Intelligent Fast Failure Recovery Framework for Enhanced Resilience in Software Defined Networks

Proceedings - 11th International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications, WINCOM 2024.11th International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications, WINCOM 2024, 23-25 Jul 2024 Proceedings - 11th International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications, WINCOM 2024 . Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc. , GBRAbstract 
 Deploying new optimised routing policies on routers in the event of link failure is difficult due to the strong coupling between the data and control planes and the absence of topology information about the network. Because of the distributed architecture of traditional Internet protocol networks, policies and routing rules are spread in a decentralised way, resulting in looping and congestion problems. Software-defined networking (SDN) enables centralised network programmability. As a result, data plane devices just focus on packet forwarding, leaving the control plane's complexities to be managed by the controller. Thus, the controller centrally installs the policies and rules. Considering the controller's knowledge of the global network architecture, central control enhances the flexibility of link failure identification and restoration. Therefore, this paper uses SDN architecture to enhance network resilience against link failures by introducing the Hybrid Intelligent Fast Failure Recovery (HIFFR) framework, which aims to improve the speed and effectiveness of network failure recovery.

 Abstract 
 In this work, a simultaneous wireless information and power transmission (SWIPT) assisted full-duplex (FD) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) mobile edge computing (MEC) transmission scheme is proposed for next-generation wireless networks. SWIPT, FD, NOMA, and MEC are used to help computational and energy-constrained IoT devices in next-generation wireless networks efficiently cope with their computational requirements. The computation energy efficiency (CEE) maximization of the SWIPT-assisted IoT devices performing par-tial offloading with the existence of a downlink user is considered in the proposed scheme. Accordingly, an optimization problem, optimizing power, time and frequency coefficients to maximize the CEE, is formulated, and an effective algorithm is proposed to optimize the coefficients jointly. The provided numerical studies demonstrate the significantly better performance of the proposed scheme over the benchmark schemes.
