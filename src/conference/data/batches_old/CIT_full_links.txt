 The 23rd International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (CIT-2024) 
 https://smartconf24.org/cit2024/ 
  
 Chengdu, China, 20-22 December 2024 
 INTRODUCTION 
 ============= 
 CIT-2024 is the 23rd edition of the highly successful International Conference on Computer and Information Technology. The goal of the conference is to provide a forum for scientists, engineers and researchers to discuss and exchange novel ideas, results, experiences and work-in-process on all aspects of computer and information technology. CIT has become a major platform for researchers and industry practitioners from different fields of computer and information technology. Each year, CIT attendees appreciate and benefit from multidisciplinary exchanges in computer and information technology. In previous years, CIT has attracted many high quality research papers spanning over the various aspects of information technology, computing science and computer engineering. These papers highlight foundational work that strives to push beyond limits of existing computer technologies, including experimental efforts, innovative systems, and investigations that identify weaknesses in existing IT services. 
 CIT-2024 is planned to be hosted in Chengdu, China, the capital of southwestern China's Sichuan province. The city is also home to the famous Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, a conservation center where visitors can view endangered giant pandas in a natural habitat. All accepted papers are expected to be included in IEEE Xplore and will be indexed by Engineering Index (EI). The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.
