 WAOA 2024 
 Scope 
 Approximation and online algorithms are fundamental tools to deal with computationally hard problems and problems in which the input is gradually disclosed over time. Both kinds of problems arise from a large number of applications in a variety of fields. TheWorkshop on Approximation and Online Algorithms (WAOA)focuses on the design and analysis of approximation and online algorithms. It also covers experimental methods used to design and analyze efficient approximation and online algorithms. 
 WAOA 2024 is co-located withALGO 2024, which also hostsESA,ALGOCLOUD,ALGOWIN,ATMOS,IPEC, andWABI. ALGO 2024 will take place atRoyal Holloway, University of Londonin Egham, United Kingdom.

 Title: | Advances in Approximation Algorithms for Tree and Connectivity Augmentation 
 Abstract: | Augmentation problems are a fundamental class of Network Design problems. The goal is to find a cheapest way to increase a graph’s (edge-)connectivity by adding edges from a given set of options. The Minimum Spanning Tree Problem is one of its most elementary examples, which can be interpreted as determining a cheapest way to increase the edge-connectivity of a graph from 0 to 1. The next step, to increase from 1 to 2, leads to the heavily studied Tree Augmentation Problem, and the more general problem of increasing the edge-connectivity by 1 of an arbitrary graph is known as Connectivity Augmentation. While these problems admit simple 2-approximations, obtaining approximation factors below 2 has proven challenging. This talk has several goals, namely: | Providing a brief introduction to Tree and Connectivity Augmentation. 
 Discussing relevant algorithmic techniques that have recently led to better-than-2 approximations for these problems, including the Relative Greedy method and an interesting connection of it to local search procedures. 
 Demonstrating how these techniques can be leveraged to obtain better-than-2 approximations for (weighted) augmentation problems.

 Submission guidelines 
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper of at most 10 pages excluding the title page, references, and an optional appendix. The submission should be typeset using a 10-point or larger font in a single-column format with ample spacing throughout and 2cm margins all around on A4-size paper. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be placed in an appendix. This appendix can even comprise an entire full version of the paper. The appendix will be read by the program committee members at their discretion. In particular, appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. 
 Results previously published (or scheduled for publication) in another conference proceedings or journal will not be accepted at WAOA. Simultaneous submission to journals or other conferences with published proceedings is not permitted. By submitting a paper the authors acknowledge that in case of acceptance at least one of the authors must register at ALGO 2024, attend the conference onsite and present the paper. The program committee may award a Best Paper Award to one of the accepted papers. 
 Double-blind reviewing 
 The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. 
 COI with PC members 
 When submitting a paper, authors will be asked to indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members. A CoI is limited to the following categories: 
 Family member or close friend. 
 Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years. 
 Person with the same affiliation. 
 Involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
 PC member owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
 Frequent or recent collaborator (within last 5 years) who you believe cannot objectively review your work. 
 PC Submissions 
 Submissions authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed, but will be subject to a stricter review process.
