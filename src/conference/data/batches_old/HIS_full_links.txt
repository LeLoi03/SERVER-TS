 Present CFP : 2023 
 Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS) deal with real-world complexity with a multidisciplinary approach and a plurality of artificial intelligence techniques. Complex systems, including biology, medicine, logistics, management, engineering, humanities, industrial environments, and technological applications, have significant difficulty modeling and interacting with their processes by classical methods. This workshop aims to discuss research on progress working with hybrid intelligent systems applied and artificial intelligence techniques in this framework. 
  
 The HIS2023 is a workshop conference held by the Mexican Society of Artificial Intelligence (SMIA) in its central Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (MICAI). 
  
 HIS2023 covers and gathers research topics associated with Hybrid Intelligent Systems and their capabilities for modeling, negotiating a specific topic, demonstrating reputation using diverse models, and managing all these complex processes.

 Introduction 
 The 20th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2025) combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness, high-dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both, our knowledge and row data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way. 
 HAIS Series of Conferences provides an interesting opportunity to present and discuss the latest theoretical advances and real-world applications in this multidisciplinary research field.

 Hybrid Intelligent Models based on Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic 
 ABSTRACT: 
 Hybrid intelligent systems are formed by prudent combinations of intelligent models, such as neural networks, fuzzy models and others, to achieve efficient solutions to real-world problems. The main idea is to take advantage of the main characteristics of the individual models. For example, neural networks are good for learning from training data, while fuzzy logic is good for representing expert knowledge and uncertainty management. In our work the proposed approach is to build powerful hybrid intelligent systems for achieving accurate results for different applications. The proposed hybrid architecture is based on modular neural networks for learning from large datasets. Then for combining the outputs of the modules an integration based on type-1 or type-2 fuzzy rules is performed for modeling the involved decision-making process, as well as the inherent uncertainty in making the decisions. In addition, some applications will be used to illustrate the good performance of general type-2 fuzzy logic, as well as a comparison with interval type-2 and type-1 fuzzy systems to verify the significant advantage obtained in using general type-2 fuzzy logic. We believe that the proposed hybrid intelligent approach can be used for solving many real problems.

 12th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Systems 
 IEEE IS’24 Memories 
 View all 
 Uniting experts in the world of Intelligent Systems 
 IEEE Conference Number 61756 
 Continuing the legacy of successful conferences such as IS’02, IS’04, IS’08, IS‘12, IS’16, IS’20 (held in Sofia and Varna, Bulgaria), IS’06, IS’10 (held in London, UK), IS’14, IS’22 (held in Warsaw, Poland), IS’18 (held in Funchal, Madeira Island, Portugal), the 12th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Systems, IS’24, aims to bring together leading specialists in the expansive field of intelligent systems. This forum presents a unique opportunity for scientists from around the globe to share their ideas and achievements in the theory and practice of intelligent control, artificial intelligence, decision support systems, neural networks, soft computing, data mining and knowledge discovery, ontologies, machine learning, intelligent measurement, and other related topics. The conference aims to highlight contemporary intelligent systems as a concept that unifies theoretical research and applications in automation, information technologies, and measurement. All aspects of intelligent systems are of interest, including theory, algorithms, tools, applications, and more. 
 In addition to the main sessions, the conference timetable will include several other symposiums, workshops, poster sessions, tutorial courses, and a student session, all covering similar scopes. These events will take place before, during, and after the conclusion of the IEEE IS’24. 
 The IS’02 up to IS’22 conferences have established themselves as scientific forums known for gathering only high-quality papers and presentations that meet rigorous scientific standards. Following this tradition, all submitted original papers for IS’24 will undergo careful review for possible inclusion in the Conference Proceedings. Additionally, after the Conference, a selected number of the best papers will be further expanded and revised for potential inclusion in the Journal of Intelligent Systems and other reputable journals or Springer books.
