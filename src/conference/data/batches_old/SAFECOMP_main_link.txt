Welcome to SafeComp 2025! 
 The 44thInternational Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability and Security 
 Let’s explore new frontiers of safety critical computing systems! 
 The 44th edition of SafeComp provides a unique occasion to explore and debate challenges of safety critical computing systems. Safety is more relevant than ever, with expanding capabilities of (semi-) autonomous cyber-physical system (CPS), interacting with humans in various roles and acting in more open environments. The 2025 theme is that of “Managing safety in an era of a software defined computing continuum.” 
 SafeComp is an annual international conference covering the state-of-the-art, industrial experiences and new trends in the areas of safety, security and reliability of critical computer applications. SafeComp provides ample opportunity to exchange insights and experience on emerging methods, approaches and practical solutions. It is a single-track conference without parallel sessions, allowing easy networking. 
 Since it was established in 1979 by the European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems, Technical Committee 7 on Reliability, Safety and Security (EWICS TC7), SafeComp has contributed to the progress of the state-of-the-art in dependable application of computers in safety-related and safety-critical systems. 
 Safety engineering has to carefully investigate the implications of the increasing complexity of software defined computing systems, as they are increasingly connected, interacting with supporting digital infrastructures, filled with AI and provided with more advanced perception systems. 
 Welcome to SafeComp 2025 in Stockholm, hosted by KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

Theme 
 Managing safety in an era of a software defined computing continuumFuture societal and industrial systems will be increasingly relying on a digitalized infrastructure, from embedded systems, fog/edge-computing systems, to cloud and communications. Entire systems will also increasingly be software defined and upgradeable. Societal and industrial systems consequently be increasingly relying on such digitalized infrastructures, requiring an even stronger and proactive emphasis on key dependability properties, as emphasized by the SafeComp conferences. The theme for SafeComp 2025 has been chosen to highlight some of the following topics and challenges: 
 Predictability and reliability of cloud and edge computing, and AI components: The corresponding systems yet have to offer dependability properties suitable for critical systems 
 Architectures ensuring safety while enhancing performance 
 Co-design of applications and digital infrastructure to achieve cost-efficient dependability 
 Trustworthy DevOps – reconciling software and safety practices 
 Paper Submission Guidelines 
 The tradition of SAFECOMP is to act as a platform for bringing academic research and industrial needs together. Therefore, industrial contributions and real-world experience reports are explicitly invited. We solicit two types of paper submission (in both cases, up to 14 pages incl. bibliography): 
 Research papers address a research gap and illustrate how the contribution submitted can help improve the state-of-the-art by advancing current knowledge; 
 Practical experience reports / tool descriptions provide new insights and valuable support to practitioners. 
 Papers exceeding the page limit will be excluded from the review process. All papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the International Programme Committee. Papers must not have been previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere. 
 All paper submissions must be formatted according to theLNCS templatesprovided by Springer. Abstracts and papers should be submitted in pdf through Easychair.
