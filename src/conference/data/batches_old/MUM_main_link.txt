 Preparing the submission 
 Novelty 
 The submission must be original work. It cannot have been published elsewhere nor be under concurrent review for publication by another conference or journal. Papers should be grounded in existing literature and knowledge and written for an interdisciplinary audience. 
 Length and contribution 
 Submissions can be of variable length. The paper length must match the contribution. Using the single-column format, the maximum length for a full paper is 16 pages (excluding references) and the maximum length for a short paper is 7 pages (excluding references). 
 Successful full-paper submissions typically represent significant empirical, theoretical, or methodological advances in the field. Successful short-paper submissions offer more focused contributions with a smaller scope; they are not intended to be work-in-progress reports. Instead, they should offer complete, rigorously developed work with a solid contribution to the field. 
 Formatting 
 Templates: | LaTeX template | , | href="https://authors.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx" - Word template 
 Submissions must be inPDFformat. Papers must be inEnglish. All references must be complete, accurate, accessible, and conform to the ACM Publication Format. Authors are required to use the single-column ACM Manuscript template. Submission preparation is described on theACM Primary Template website. 
 For LaTeX, the correct templates (Overleaf or LaTeX templates) can be found on ACM's "href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-latex" - Preparing your article for LaTeX
" page, using\documentclass[manuscript, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart}style for the document. 
 For Word, the correct submission template can be found on ACM's "href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word" - Preparing your article for Word
" page, i.e., "submission template". 
 The TAPS workflow we use is described on "href="https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow" - ACM's TAPS workflow page
". 
 Anonymity 
 All submissions need to befully anonymised. This includes any appendices or supplemental material as well as a potential acknowledgements section. Citations to the authors’ own previous work are NOT allowed to be anonymised. This allows reviewers to ensure all previous research has been taken into account. However, authors should refer to their own prior work in the third person. For example, "Smith et al. [1] did ... " instead of "We did ... [1]". Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials or external links to datasets, code repositories, etc., will be desk rejected. 
 Supplementary Material 
 All videos and supplementary material must be anonymized. Other supplementary material may include, for example, survey text, experimental protocols, source code, and data, all of which can help others replicate the work. Authors should submit any non-video supplementary material as a single .zip file, including a README file with a description of the materials. 
 Authors are encouraged to submit an optional video of a maximum of 6 minutes to support their submission. Authors are encouraged to follow the Accessible Presentation Guide. To ensure reviewers can view the supplementary video, authors should use the H.264 encoding and the MP4 file format. The bit rate of videos can be lowered to accommodate the upload limits of EasyChair (max. 50 MB per file). 
 Reviewers should be able to access the contribution of the paper solely based on the main PDF submission. That is,the paper submission must stand independently without the supplementary material. 
 Accessibility 
 Authors are required to followhref="https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/" - SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission
. If authors have questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs viahref="mailto:accessibilitydiversity2025@mum-conf.org" - accessibilitydiversity2025@mum-conf.org
early in the writing process (the closer to the deadline, the less time the team will have to respond to individual requests). Papers flagged as inaccessible by a reviewer will be reassigned. Note that while we strive to match the best reviewer to each paper – the best reviewers for the work may not be able to review an inaccessible submission.

 All authors are required to have anORCID. 
 Submitting 
 Submission Platform 
 Submissions are facilitated via the Easychair platform. Authors may submit and edit their materials until the submission deadline. Should authors encounter any difficulties, technical problems, or questions about this process, please contact the Paper chairs viahref="mailto:papers2025@mum-conf.org" - papers2025@mum-conf.org
Metadata Integrity 
 Changes inauthor namesarenot allowedafter the submission deadline; there areno exceptions. Changes to the order of authors are allowed only before the camera-ready deadline. The metadata is crucial to the integrity of the review process andhref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship" - author representation
.If any of the authors need to be added or removed after the submission deadline, authors would need to withdraw their submissions/papers. Minor changes to the title and abstract are permitted during the revision period. 
 Selection Process 
 Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous double-blind review process managed by the Program Chairs. Each submitted paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers, chosen from the pool of members of the Program Committee listed below. This pool of reviewers features experts from the previous edition and new researchers to address new emerging research areas and underrepresented communities. Papers will be assigned through a bidding process. 
 There will be a single round of reviews with three potential outcomes: desk rejects (papers that are significantly out of scope, not written in English, etc.), rejection, and conditional acceptance. No rebuttal phase is planned. Authors of conditionally accepted papers will find in the reviews a list of revisions and requested changes they need to satisfy to have their paper officially accepted into the program. 
 Upon Acceptance 
 Publication 
 Accepted papers will appear in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library, where they will remain accessible to thousands of researchers and practitioners worldwide. 
 Accepted papers will follow theACM TAPS workflow instructions. ACM will send authors a copyright form, which they have to complete. Once completed, authors will be provided with the ACM copyright information, which authors of accepted papers are required to sign and put on their papers. Authors are required to submit their camera-ready version through the submission system and process it according to the publication instructions. 
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in theACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of the conference. 
 The conference will follow the open access policy set by ACM at the time of the camera-ready version of accepted publications. 
 Presentation Format 
 Accepted papersmustbe presented at the conference. Authors with accepted publications will be informed closer to the conference about the duration of their assigned slot and the timing of their presentation. To assist authors in preparing their talk and ensure its accessibility:
