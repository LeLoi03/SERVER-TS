 Global Insurance Market Report 2024Welcome to the website of the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) 
 Established in 1994, the IAIS is a voluntary membership organisation of insurance supervisors and regulators from more than 200 jurisdictions, constituting 97% of the world’s insurance premiums. It is the global standard-setting body responsible for developing and assisting in the implementation of principles, standards and guidance as well as supporting material for the supervision of the insurance sector. The IAIS mission is to promote effective and globally consistent supervision of the insurance industry in order to develop and maintain fair, safe and stable insurance markets for the benefit and protection of policyholders; and to contribute to global financial stability. 
 Highlights 
 href="https://www.iais.org/activities-topics/standard-setting/icps-and-comframe/" - ICPs and ComFrame
href="https://www.iais.org/activities-topics/standard-setting/icps-and-comframe/" - The Insurance Core Principles form the globally accepted framework for insurance supervision. ComFrame builds on the ICPs and focuses on the group-wide supervision of internationally active insurance groups. Together these support the protection of policyholders and promote the stability of the global financial system.
href="https://www.iais.org/activities-topics/standard-setting/insurance-capital-standard/" - ICS
href="https://www.iais.org/activities-topics/standard-setting/insurance-capital-standard/" - The Insurance Capital Standard (ICS) has been developed as a consolidated group-wide capital standard for  internationally active insurance groups and forms the quantitative element of ComFrame. It consists of three components: valuation, qualifying capital resources, and a standard method for the ICS capital requirement.
href="https://www.iais.org/activities-topics/climate-risk/" - Climate risk
href="https://www.iais.org/activities-topics/climate-risk/" - Climate risk is a key theme within the IAIS Strategic Plan. IAIS’ work on addressing the risks from climate change spans across many of our activities, ranging from financial stability risk assessment, developing supervisory and supporting material and capacity building.
href="https://www.iais.org/activities-topics/financial-stability/holistic-framework/" - Holistic Framework
href="https://www.iais.org/activities-topics/financial-stability/holistic-framework/" - The Holistic Framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector was adopted in November 2019 and is an integrated set of supervisory policy measures, a global monitoring exercise and implementation assessment activities.
IAIS Annual Conference 2024 
 The IAIS welcomed over 500 participants from more than 105 jurisdictions to the Annual Conference 2024 on 5-6 December in Cape Town, South Africa.

Welcome

 IAS 2023 Theme:Large Language Models and Generative AI for Information Security 
 IAS 2023 is co-organized by Machine Intelligence Research Labs (MIR Labs) and KLE Technological University, India during December 13-15, 2023. 
 Conference Theme: Innovative Cyber Security: Protecting Nations Beyond Borders' 
  
 Information assurance and security has become an important research issue in the networked and distributed information sharing environments. Finding effective ways to protect information systems networks and sensitive data within the critical information infrastructure is challenging even with the most advanced technology and trained professionals. The 18th International Conference on Information Assurance and Security (IAS) aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, developers, and policy makers involved in multiple disciplines of information security and assurance to exchange ideas and to learn the latest development in this important field. 
 IAS 2023 is organized by Machine Intelligence Research Labs (MIR Labs) and will take place from December 13-15, 2023. 
 The conference is expected to provide an opportunity for the researchers to meet and discuss the latest solutions, scientific results and methods in solving intriguing problems in the fields of IAS. The conference programme will include workshops, special sessions and tutorials, along with prominent keynote speakers and regular paper presentations in parallel tracks. Like previous years, we expect the IAS 2022 proceedings to be published by Springer subject to fulfilling of all quality requirements of Springer. 
 IAS 2023 will be a hybrid conference that will run fully in-person and fully virtually to take advantage of the best that the two modalities can offer. Besides regular paper presentations, the technical programme will include 8-10 plenary lectures and poster sessions. IAS 2023 Organising Committee also recognises the benefits of virtual conferences allowing participation at a cheaper rate. This allows a higher number of research scholars and students to attend. Selected authors will have the option to attend and present the papers virtually or present in one of the three venues in Europe and Asia.
