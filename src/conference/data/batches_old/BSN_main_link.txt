IEEE-EMBS International Conference on Body Sensor Networks (BSN) is the premier conference on sensing systems for digital health. Celebrating 22 years of IEEE-EMBS BSN, BSN’25’s theme will be“Computational Medicine: Expanding Health through Sensing and AI.” 
 IEEE-EMBS BSN 2025 will accept regular 4-page technical papers, 1-page demo or poster abstracts, and 1-page clinical abstracts. Excellent papers (e.g., Best Paper Award candidates) will be invited to extend their works for rapid review and publication in partnering journalIEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology. SeeContributorsfor more details. 
 IEEE-EMBS BSN 2025 will bring together leaders and experts in academia, industry, healthcare, and non-profit organizations and provide a cross-disciplinary, highly selective, and single-track forum for cutting-edge research related to devices and sensors, hardware and software systems, predictive models, and data analytics in the healthcare/medical domains. Topics of Interest included but are not limited to: 
 Novel digital health solutions (i.e., sensors and algorithms) for diagnosis, disease progress tracking, and self-management. 
 Sensors and systems for digital health, wellness, and athletics. 
 Conformable decoders: unintrusive, comfortable, self-powered sensors and systems. 
 Flexible, stretchable, and imperceptible electronics for sensors and systems. 
 Contact-less solutions for human sensing. 
 Power-optimization for implantable and wearable sensors and systems. 
 Wearable robotics system for digital healthcare. 
 Signal processing, machine learning, deep learning, and decision-support algorithms.
