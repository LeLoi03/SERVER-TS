 Welcome to ISVC 
 The purpose of the International Symposium on Visual Computing (ISVC) is to provide a common forum for researchers, scientists, engineers and practitioners throughout the world to present their latest research findings, ideas, developments and applications in visual computing. We seek papers describing contributions to the state of the art and state of the practice in the four central areas of visual computing:computer vision,computer graphics,virtual reality, andvisualization. Papers that span multiple areas are particularly encouraged. 
 ISVC will consist of invited and contributed presentations dealing with all aspects of visual computing. In addition to the main program, the symposium includes six keynote presentations,href="https://www.isvc.net/index.php/tutorials/" - tutorials
,href="https://www.isvc.net/index.php/special-tracks-2/" - special tracks
, and a poster session.The symposium’s proceedings will be published bySpringerin theLecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)series. Information on abstracting andindexing of the LNCS seriescan be foundhere.A “best paper award ($500) will be sponsored by Springer this year. 
 Authors of selected papers presented at ISVC’25 will beinvitedto submit anextendedversion of their work forexpeditedreview and possible publication in aspecial issueonAdvances in Visual Computingin theMachine Vision and Applicationsjournal. The paper submission deadline is tentatively onApril 15, 2026with publication of the special issue expected within 2026.

 Call for Papers 
 ISVC seeks papers describing contributions to the state of the art and practice in the broad field of visual computing. The symposium is structured around the four central areas of visual computing: 
 Computer Vision 
 Computer Graphics 
 Virtual Reality 
 Visualization 
 Papers that span multiple areas are particularly encouraged. In addition to the main symposium, we are soliciting papers for several special tracks related to ISVC. In submitting your paper, you should also check whether it might be a good fit for any of thehref="https://www.isvc.net/index.php/special-tracks-2/" - special tracks
being organized this year. 
 Area 1: Computer Vision 
 Computer vision, the study of enabling computers to understand and interpret visual information from static images and video sequences, is expanding rapidly throughout the world. During the past ten years, computer vision has grown from a research area to a widely accepted technology, capable of providing dramatic increase in productivity and improving living standard. We are seeking papers covering both the theory and applications of computer vision. Topics of interest include all aspects of computer vision including, but not limited, to the following areas: 
 Early and Biologically-Inspired Vision 
 Color and Texture 
 Illumination and Reflectance Modeling 
 Segmentation and Grouping 
 Object Recognition/Detection/Categorization 
 Motion and Tracking

 The field of visualization seeks to determine and present underlying correlated structures and relationships in both scientific (computational and medical sciences) and more abstract datasets. The prime objective of the presentation should be to communicate the information in a dataset so as to enhance understanding. Topics of interest include all aspects of visualization including, but not limited, to the following areas: 
 Visualization Taxonomies and Models 
 Information Visualization 
 Scalar, Vector, and Tensor Visualization 
 Multi-dimensional and Multi-Resolution Data Visualization
