 FeedbackSurvey 
 The mathematical theory and practice of both cryptography and coding underpins the provision of effective security and reliability for data communication, processing and storage. This nineteenth International Conference in an established and successful IMA series on the theme of “Cryptography and Coding” solicits original research papers on all technical aspects of cryptography and coding. 
 Submissions are welcome on any cryptographic or coding-theoretic topic including, but not limited to: 
 • Foundational theory and mathematics; 
 • The design, proposal, and analysis of cryptographic or coding primitives and protocols 
 • Secure implementation and optimisation in hardware or software; and 
 • Applied aspects of cryptography and coding. 
 Invited Speakers 
 Carla Ràfols (Pompeu Fabra University) 
 Amortization in zkSNARKs 
 Prover complexity is one of the main bottlenecks in some of the best-known succinct, non-interactive arguments. Thus, many works “delay” or amortize parts of these proofs. In this talk, I will overview these techniques and the most recent constructions, and present new applications of these ideas. 
 Dario Fiore (IMDEA Software Institute) 
 Succinct and Functional Vector Commitments 
 Vector commitments are a special class of commitment schemes in which one can commit to a long vector and open single positions of the vector with the crucial property that commitments and openings are short. Functional commitments generalize vector commitments so that one can open, in a succinct way, to functions of the committed vector. 
 In this talk, I will present the notion of functional commitments and the recent constructions of this primitive that support the evaluation of arbitrary circuits, and I will discuss some of their applications.

The notion of coset leader has applications in coding theory and cryptography. It has been studied in several papers. In this paper, we extend a recent study, made on the coset leaders of the first order Reed-Muller codes, to two classes of Boolean functions which have played an important role in diverse domains of Boolean functions, and whose study was missing in this context. We characterize the coset leaders that belong to the classes of Niho functions and threshold functions (this second class being a generalization of the class of majority functions).Funding
