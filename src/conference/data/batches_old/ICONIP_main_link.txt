 ICONIP employs a | single-blind | paper reviewing process. 
 The conference will | be in person | . You must be available to present at the conference. 
 The 32nd International Conference on Neural Information Processing (ICONIP 2025) is set to be held in Okinawa, Japan, from November 20th to November 24th, 2025. ICONIP serves as the annual flagship conference of the Asia Pacific Neural Network Society (APNNS). ICONIP 2025 also serves as the 35th Annual Meeting of the Japanese Neural Network Society (JNNS). 
 Over the past three decades, ICONIP has emerged as a premier venue for showcasing cutting-edge research, technology, and innovations in computational modelling, data analytics, and artificial intelligence. 
 ICONIP 2025 aims to provide a high-level international forum for scientists, researchers, educators, industrial professionals, and students worldwide to present the state of research and development, address new challenges, and discuss trends in neural information processing theory and applications. These include computational neuroscience, machine learning, bioinformatics, health informatics, computer vision, automation and control, finance, manufacturing, transportation, cybersecurity, and more. 
 In addition to technical sessions with oral and poster presentations, the conference program will include special sessions, workshops, and tutorials on topics of current interest. It also features keynote sessions led by the world’s leading researchers and professionals, as well as awards to outstanding papers presented at the conference.
