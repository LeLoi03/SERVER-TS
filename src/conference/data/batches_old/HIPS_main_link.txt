30th International Workshop on High-Level Parallel Programming Models and Supportive Environments 
 Overview 
 The 30th HIPS workshop, to be held as a full-day meeting at the IPDPS 2025 conference in Milan, Lombardy, Italy, focuses on high-level programming of multiprocessors, compute clusters, and massively parallel machines. Like previous workshops in this series - established in 1996 - this event serves as a forum for research in the areas of parallel applications, language design, compilers, runtime systems, and programming tools. It provides a timely forum for scientists and engineers to present the latest ideas and findings in these rapidly changing fields. In our call for papers, we especially invite papers demonstrating innovative approaches in the areas of emerging programming models for large-scale parallel systems and many-core architectures. This year we will add to the list topics programming models and environments for the Edge-Cloud-HPC Continuum as well as the application of recent AI technologies in high-level programming models.
