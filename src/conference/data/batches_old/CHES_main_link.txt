General Information 
 Having been established in 1999, the Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES) conference is the premier venue for research on both design and analysis of cryptographic hardware and software implementations. As an area conference of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), CHES bridges the cryptographic research and engineering communities, and attracts participants from academia, industry, government and beyond. CHES 2025 will take place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in September 14-18, 2025. The conference website is accessible at 
 href="https://ches.iacr.org/2025" - https://ches.iacr.org/2025

 TCHES Publication Model 
 CHES has transitioned to an open-access journal/conference hybrid model. A comprehensive list of FAQs relating to the model can be found via the TCHES website at 
 href="https://tches.iacr.org" - https://tches.iacr.org
In summary: 
 Submitted papers will undergo a journal-style review process with accepted papers published by Ruhr University Bochum in an issue of the journal IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (TCHES). Since it has a Gold Open Access status, all papers published in TCHES are immediately and freely available. 
 The annual CHES conference consists of presentations for each paper published in the associated issues of TCHES, plus invited talks and a range of additional and social activities. All papers accepted for publication in TCHES between 15 July of year | n | − 1 and 15 July of year n will be presented at CHES of year | n | .

 Paper Submission 
 Unfortunately the deadline to submit a paper to Volume 2025 Issue 3 has passed. 
 You can still access thehref="https://submit.iacr.org/tches2025_3/" - Submission Server of Volume 2025 Issue 3
, should you need to make changes or upload a final paper version. 
 Instructions for Authors 
 Format 
 A paper submitted to TCHES must be written in English and be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or any identifying citations. It should begin with a title, a short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Submissions should be typeset in the LaTeX style available athref="https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/submission" - https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/submission
, noting that TCHES only accepts electronic submission in PDF format. Please use the submission mode (href="" - \documentclass[submission]{iacrtrans}
) that displays line numbers to ease the review process. 
 TCHES accepts two forms of paper, termed regular and long; the page limit (excluding bibliography) is 20 and 40 pages respectively. Authors are encouraged to include additional supplementary material needed to validate the content (e.g., test vectors or source code) as separate files.In order to ensure that appendices are also reviewed, they need to be includedbeforethe bibliography within the 20 or 40-page limit during submission.In allowing long papers, the goal is to support cases where extra detail (e.g., proofs, or experimental results) is deemed essential. Long papers need to be marked as such by checking the respective box in the submission system and by annotating the title with "Long Paper:".Authors need to justify the need to submit the content as long paper in a justification letter included in the supplementary materials.Long papers submitted without proper justification will be returned without review. Authors of long papers should be aware that the review process may take longer: a decision may, at the discretion of the editor(s)-in-chief, be deferred to the subsequent volume. 
 TCHES solicits submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, i.e., papers whose goal is to review and contextualize existing literature in a particular area in order to systematize existing knowledge. To be considered for publication, SoK papers must provide significant added value beyond prior work, such as novel insights or reasonably questioning previous assumptions. Authors should highlight SoK papers by annotating the title with "SoK:". 
 Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

 Regulations 
 The review process for TCHES, Volume 2025, Issues 1–4, will be governed by the following regulations: 
 TCHES follows IACR policy, i.e., | https://www.iacr.org/docs/irregular.pdf | with respect to irregular submissions: any submission deemed to be irregular (e.g., which has been submitted in parallel, to another conference with proceedings), will be instantly rejected. IACR reserves the right to share information about submissions with other program committees and editorial boards to ensure strict enforcement of the policy. 
 TCHES follows IACR policy with respect to conflicts of interest that could prevent impartial review. A conflict of interest is considered to occur automatically whenever one (co-)author of a submitted paper and a TCHES editorial board member | were advisee/advisor at any time, 
 have been affiliated to the same institution in the past 2 years, 
 have published 2 or more jointly authored papers in the past 3 years, or 
 are immediate family members. | For an interpretation of the above reasons, please refer to the IACR policy on CoIs ( | https://www.iacr.org/docs/conflicts.pdf | ). Note that conflicts may also arise for reasons other than those just listed. Examples include closely related technical work, cooperation in the form of joint projects or grant applications, business relationships, close personal friendships, instances of personal enmity. 
 Full transparency is of utmost importance, authors and reviewers must disclose to the chairs or editor any circumstances that they think may create bias, even if it does not raise to the level of a CoI. At the time of submission, authors are | required | to | make a declaration regarding any conflicts of interest (including reasons for the conflict), and 
 guarantee they will deliver a presentation at the associated CHES conference if their submission is accepted for publication in TCHES. 
 Each paper will be double-blind reviewed by at least four members of the TCHES editorial board. 
 In order to improve the quality of the review process, authors are given the opportunity to submit a rebuttal (between the indicated dates) after receiving the associated reviews. 
 The review process outcome is either an outright accept or reject decision, or one of two deferred decision types. Specifically, " | minor revision | " means the paper is conditionally accepted, and assigned a shepherd to verify the revision is adequate, " | major revision | " means the authors are invited to submit a revision of their article to one of the following two submission deadlines; a later re-submission will be treated as a new paper. 
 When submitting a major revision, follow the instructions in the submission system to indicate that the paper is a major revision and to provide the ID of the earlier submission. 
 To ensure consistency, the reviewers assigned for a revised paper are ideally the same as for the original submis- sion. 
 Resubmission of papers that have previously been rejected from TCHES is only allowed after major modifications and approval by the Editors-in-Chief prior to submission. 
 Authors of submitted papers are also highly encouraged to check the TCHES FAQ | href="https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/faq" - https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/faq | for answers to questions related to policy and procedures governing CHES.
