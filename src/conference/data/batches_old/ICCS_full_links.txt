 ICCS 2025 – Singapore 
 New in ICCS 
 Notifications | will be sent out gradually | from Monday, 7 April | . There may be a minor delay in a few cases, as we are currently processing hundreds of reviews. 
 Registration | deadline (for payments and camera-ready versions) | extended to 23 April | . 
 Keynote lineup | is now final. 
 23 Workshops | confirmed. 
 “Making Complex Systems tractable through Computational Science” 
 TheInternational Conference on Computational Scienceis an annual conference that brings together researchers and scientists from mathematics and computer science as basic computing disciplines, as well as from other various application areas, who are pioneering computational methods in sciences such as physics, chemistry, life sciences, and engineering, as well as in arts and humanitarian fields, to discuss problems and solutions in the area, identify new issues, and shape future directions for research. 
 ICCS 2025 in Singapore, will be the twenty-fifth edition in this series of highly successful conferences. 
 Since its inception in 2001, ICCS has attracted increasingly higher quality and numbers of attendees and papers. The average attendance each year is about 350 participants. The proceedings series have become a major intellectual resource for computational science researchers and serve to define and advance the state of the art of the field. An archive of the previous meetings is available through thehref="previous-iccs/" - Previous ICCS conferences page
. 
 Out of the submitted full papers to the main conference and workshops, we will select some 30% high-quality papers for presentation at the conference and publication in the proceedings. These are published by Springer in theLecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) seriesand indexed by Scopus, EI Engineering Index, Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in ISI Web of Science), and severalother indexing services. The papers will contain linked references, XML versions and citable DOI numbers. 
 As the conference theme this year is“Making Complex Systems tractable through Computational Science”, papers highlighting the role of Computational Science in tackling the complex problems of today and tomorrow are particularly welcome. 
 This conference will be a unique event focusing on recent developments in: scalable scientific algorithms; advanced software tools; computational grids; advanced numerical methods; and novel application areas. These innovative novel models, algorithms and tools drive new science through efficient application in areas such as physical systems, computational and systems biology, environmental systems, finance, and others. 
 ICCS is co-organised with the Workshops on Computational Science, a set of thematic satellite events that focus on particular aspects of computational science. These workshops provide a way to explore novel areas of computational science and bring communities together around particular sub-topics of the field. For more information please see the call for workshops. 
 ICCS is committed to enhancing diversity and inclusion in the conference, without regard to race, age, religion, ethnicity, nationality, ability, gender identity, sexual orientation, or gender expression. 
 We look forward to welcoming you to ICCS 2025 in Singapore!
