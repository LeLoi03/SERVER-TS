 Regular paper track 
 The Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA) 2025 will take place May 7-9, 2025, in Konstanz, Germany. 
 Advancing Intelligent Data Analysis requires novel, potentially game-changing ideas. IDA’s mission is to promote ideas over performance: a solid motivation can be as convincing as an exhaustive empirical evaluation. Therefore, IDA accepts inspiring papers for both presentation and publication. The IDA symposium is intentionally small-scale and single-track to create an open atmosphere that encourages discussion. In addition, IDA awards the Frontier Prize every year, recognizing the most visionary contributions. 
 Submissions will undergo a single-blind review process; author identities are known to reviewers. The conventional reviewing process favors incremental advances on established work and can discourage the kinds of papers that IDA 2025 aims to publish. The reviewing process will address this issue explicitly: referees will evaluate papers based on novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity. Furthermore, each submission will be reviewed by one of the senior program committee (SPC) members. Any paper for which an SPC makes a convincing argument about how it addresses the symposium’s goals will be accepted independent of the overall review score. 
 All accepted paper contributions will be published in theLecture Notes in Computer Science seriesby Springer-Verlag. 
 Formatting instructions 
 Contributions written in English must be formatted according to the guidelines of the Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer-Verlag. These guidelines, along with templates, are available here:https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines. 
 We strongly recommend using the LNCS template for LaTeX. The page limit for any contribution, including figures, title pages, references, and appendices, is 10 to 12 pages in LNCS format.

FAQ 
 Does IDA have a ‘double-blind’ peer-reviewing policy? 
 No, IDA uses standard single-blind peer-reviewing, meaning that reviewers are unknown to the authors, but authors are known to the reviewers. This implies that authors should not hide their identity in the paper. 
 What should I do if my paper is longer than the page limit? 
 Shorten it; submissions that deviate from the guidelines may be rejected without consideration. The length of the contribution, including figures, title pages, references and appendices, must be between 10-12 pages for the Proceedings Track. 
 Will there be a separate call for the PhD forum? 
 Yes, you will find the Call for PhD forumhref="https://ida2025.org/phd-forum/" - here
. 
 I am PhD student and would like to submit a full paper. To which track should I submit? 
 You should submit your paper to the regular paper track. The PhD forum offers PhD student to give a short presentation about their work and collect feedback, but it does not provide full-paper publications. 
 Can I post my submitted paper on ArXiv.org? 
 Yes, posting your submitted paper on a self-archiving website is allowed.
