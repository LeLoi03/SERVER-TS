Selected Areas in Cryptography (SAC) is Canada’s research conference on cryptography, held annually since 1994. 
 The 32nd edition of SAC will take place atToronto Metropolitan Universityin Toronto, Ontario, Canada fromAugust 13–15, 2025, and will be preceded by theSAC Summer SchoolonAugust 11–12, 2025. 
 Topics 
 There are four areas covered at each SAC conference. Three of the areas are permanent. 
 Design and analysis of symmetric key primitives and cryptosystems, including block and stream ciphers, hash functions, MAC algorithms, cryptographic permutations, and authenticated encryption schemes; 
 Efficient implementations of symmetric and public key algorithms; and 
 Mathematical and algorithmic aspects of applied cryptology including post-quantum cryptology. 
 The special selected topic for SAC 2025 is: 
 Machine learning and cryptography: applications of machine learning to cryptography and cryptanalysis, and application of cryptanalytic techniques against machine learning algorithms. 
 SAC 2025 also welcomes papers in any of the areas above with a focus on post-quantum cryptography.
