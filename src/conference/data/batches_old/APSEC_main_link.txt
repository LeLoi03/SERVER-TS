 32nd Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC 2025)  
   
 The Asia-Pacific Software Engineering Conference (APSEC) has long been established as a leading regional conference that gathers researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to exchange knowledge and best practices in software engineering, and to address emerging challenges and solutions in software engineering innovation. This year’s APSEC will be held on December 2-5, 2025 in Macao SAR, China. APSEC 2025 will continue in the tradition of previous editions of this regional conference. As in past APSEC series, the main research track features the most recent and significant innovations in the field of software engineering and all its sub-disciplines. APSEC 2025 also invites submissions of high-quality research papers that describe original and unpublished results on theoretical and empirical software engineering research topics.  
 APSEC 2025 will offer an extensive program of interest to academia, government, and industry. It will include several distinguished keynote speakers and conference days of paper presentations and demos. A series of exciting tutorials to develop skills in various aspects of software engineering practices is of particular interest to the industry. Co-located workshops offer forums for participants to present novel techniques and methods in specific sub-disciplines of software engineering. This year’s APSEC program also contains the New Faculty Forum and Student Research Competition, which welcome new faculties and students to participate in this exciting event.
