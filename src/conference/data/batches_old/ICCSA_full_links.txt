 We have noticed the existence of organisations such as WASET that run fake “conferences” in order to make profit with the registration fees, often spoofing the names of real conferences. WASET claims to be organising a conference called ICCSA next year, which is a FAKE ICCSA conference. 
 The Real ICCSA conference has been organised by the ICCSA Society since 2003. We do not have any involvement with WASET. Please spread this news to your contacts and communities so that nobody mistakenly participates to such fake conferences. 
 WASET is predator publisher. Go to this Wiki Link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Academy_of_Science,_Engineering_and_TechnologyThe conference is organized in cooperation with: 
 Galatasaray University, Türkiye

In the 16th century, significant renovations transformed it into a “villa di delizia”, adding gardens and elaborate decorative features to the interior and exterior, many of which are still preserved today. This article focuses on a precise geometric analysis of the building’s wooden ceilings, based on laser scanning and photogrammetric data surveying. The ongoing research particularly examines the wooden coffered ceilings on the first floor and thecamorcannawooden fake vault of the Grand Staircase of Honor. By analyzing the geometric data and comparing it with historical, archival, and recent manuals, the study has provided valuable morphological, construction, and conservation insights, forming the basis for the diagnostic and restoration project.Full article(This article belongs to the Special Issuehref="

Focus is primarily given to the needs of cultural consumers, frequently overlooking the challenges faced by regular nighttime communities, including night workers. Through a GIS-based analysis, the aim of this research is to shed light on differences in accessibility to core urban services between day and night in the city of Milan. The spatiotemporal analysis was performed using a customized version of the 15-min City Score Toolkit, an open-source, Python-based proprietary tool developed to automate the 15 min access metric estimation. Proprietary Point-Of-Interest (POI) data that were retrieved, sorted and filtered from the Google Places API are used to simulate time-variant walkability maps based on opening hour information contained in the dataset. The research reveals significant differences in walkability potential, both in spatial and temporal terms, and highlights gaps in nighttime service availability. The work presents an innovation on the 15 min city approach that highlights the impact of 24-h urban rhythms on real walkability outcomes. The quality limitations of the Google data are extensively explored in the article, providing further insight into the replicability and scalability of the methodology for future research.Full article(This article belongs to the Special Issuehref="

As cultural boundaries blur, the demand for seamless multilingual communication has become a critical technological challenge. This paper addresses the lack of robust solutions for real-time face-to-face translation, particularly for low-resource languages, by introducing a comprehensive framework that not only translates language but also replicates voice nuances and synchronized facial expressions. Our research tackles the primary challenge of achieving accurate lip synchronization across culturally diverse languages, filling a significant gap in the literature by evaluating the generalizability of lip sync models beyond English. Specifically, we develop a novel evaluation framework combining quantitative lip sync error metrics and qualitative assessments by human observers. This framework is applied to assess two state-of-the-art lip sync models with different architectures for Turkish, Persian, and Arabic languages, using a newly collected dataset. Based on these findings, we propose and implement a modular system that integrates language-agnostic lip sync models with neural networks to deliver a fully functional face-to-face translation experience. Inference Time Analysis shows this system achieves highly realistic, face-translated talking heads in real time, with a throughput as low as 0.381 s. This transformative framework is primed for deployment in immersive environments such as VR/AR, Metaverse ecosystems, and advanced video conferencing platforms. It offers substantial benefits to developers and businesses aiming to build next-generation multilingual communication systems for diverse applications. While this work focuses on three languages, its modular design allows scalability to additional languages. However, further testing in broader linguistic and cultural contexts is required to confirm its universal applicability, paving the way for a more interconnected and inclusive world where language ceases to hinder human connection.Full article(This article belongs to the Special Issuehref="

This research introduces an innovative approach for ongoing user authentication via behavioral biometrics obtained from wearable sensors. We present a hybrid deep learning network called SE-DeepConvNet, which integrates a squeeze-and-excitation (SE) method to proficiently simulate and authenticate user behavior characteristics. Our methodology utilizes data collected by wearable sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers, to obtain a thorough behavioral appearance. The suggested network design integrates convolutional neural networks for spatial feature extraction, while the SE blocks improve feature identification by flexibly recalibrating channel-wise feature responses. Experiments performed on two datasets, HMOG and USC-HAD, indicate the efficacy of our technique across different tasks. In the HMOG dataset, SE-DeepConvNet attains a minimal equal error rate (EER) of 0.38% and a maximum accuracy of 99.78% for the Read_Walk activity. Our model presents outstanding authentication (0% EER, 100% accuracy) for various walking activities in the USC-HAD dataset, encompassing intricate situations such as ascending and descending stairs. These findings markedly exceed existing deep learning techniques, demonstrating the promise of our technology for secure and inconspicuous continuous authentication in wearable devices. The suggested approach demonstrates the potential for use in individual device security, access management, and ongoing uniqueness verification in sensitive settings.Full article(This article belongs to the Special Issuehref="

To tackle this issue, we propose a provenance system based on the PROV-O schema, designed to enhance explainability, accountability, and transparency in predictive maintenance processes. Our framework facilitates the collection, processing, recording, and visualization of provenance data, integrating them seamlessly into these systems. We developed a prototype to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach and conducted comprehensive user studies to assess the system’s usability. Participants found the extended PROV-O structure valuable, with improved task completion times. Furthermore, performance tests demonstrated that our system manages high workloads efficiently, with minimal overhead. The contributions of this study include the design of a provenance system tailored for predictive maintenance and a specification that ensures scalability and efficiency.Full article(This article belongs to the Special Issuehref="

However, inadequate public transportation in outer Melbourne is a significant issue limiting urban development. While existing research primarily focuses on walking distance to define service catchments, commuters in transit-disadvantaged or outlying urban areas often drive to transit, noted as the park-and-ride mode. This research uniquely examines drive-distance catchments for park-and-ride transit accessibility in outer Melbourne, using spatial SQL and GIS techniques to provide a detailed, multi-dimensional analysis of population coverage, parking capacity, and accessibility gaps. This approach fills a gap in the existing literature by offering adaptable insights and approaches to other outer urban areas with transit disadvantages. The findings underscore the necessity for targeted enhancements in public transportation in outer Melbourne: Most of the outer residents concentrate near the train stations, though significant spatial gaps exist; The general accessibility status of residential mesh blocks is found; Parking capacity varies with high tension found at certain stations. This study contributes insights to create more equitable and sustainable transportation systems by providing a detailed spatial analysis of current transit coverage and identifying critical gaps.Full article(This article belongs to the Special Issuehref="
