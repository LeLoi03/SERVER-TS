 IEEE ISIT2025 
 Please join us for the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT 2025) that will be held in person from June 22 to June 27 in Ann Arbor (Michigan), USA. 
 ISIT 2025 will feature contributed papers, tutorial sessions, social, mentoring and outreach events, and much more. It will alsofeature outstanding plenary speakers. 
 Ann Arbor is a quintessential, U.S. university town with friendly Midwestern hospitality and big city sophistication. Ann Arbor, referred to as “A2” by residents, houses the University of Michigan, as well as a range of high-tech research centers and business incubators. The town is nestled in a peaceful green setting with a close-knit community of charming neighborhoods and a mix of cultures. 
 The A2 area is well renowned for its cultural offerings. From exclusive art exhibits to performances by jazz legends, there are abundant opportunities to enjoy arts and culture.

 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory 
 IEEE International Symposium on Information TheoryThe IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory, or ISIT, is the flagship conference of the IEEE Information Theory Society. The symposium centers around the presentation of previously unpublished contributions in all of the areas of information theory, including source and channel coding, communication theory and systems, cryptography and security, detection and estimation, networks, pattern recognition and learning, statistics, stochastic processes and complexity, and signal processing. Furthermore, it provides an open forum to discuss and exchange with other researchers on any of these topics. 
 The highlight of ISIT the Shannon Lecture, given by that year's holder of the Shannon Award. The following year's Shannon Award winner is also announced at ISIT. 
 Some people pronounce ISIT as eye-es-eye-tee. Others pronounce it eye-sit. Both pronunciations are acceptable. 
 The list below includes ISITs since 2001. The list of previous event has ISITshref="/conferences/past-conferences/copy_of_past-isits" - since 1950
