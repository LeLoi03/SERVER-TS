 ALIFE 2024: The 2024 Conference on Artificial Life 
 IT University of Copenhagen 
 Copenhagen, Denmark, July 22-26, 2024 
  
 Conference website | href="https://2024.alife.org/" - https://2024.alife.org/ 
 Submission link | href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alife2024" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=alife2024 
 Submission deadline | April 3, 2024 
 Topics:href="/cfp/topic.cgi?tid=8983" - artificial life
The International Conference for Artificial Life (ALife) will be held at IT University of Copenhagen, July 22-26, 2024. 
 The theme of this year isExploring new frontiers: Building on the ancient traditions of the Vikings to travel to new and strange lands and discover new cultures and traditions, we want to dedicate ALIFE 2024 to the weird and wacky of ALIFE. In particular in a time where academic research is under pressure to be more applied, we will instead dedicate ALIFE 2024 to celebrate the fundamental science of artificial life. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 There are two options for submission:full paperorextended abstract. The format is exactly the same for both options. The difference resides in the number of pages and type of contents: 
 full papers have an 8-page maximum length (not including references) and should report on new, unpublished work; 
 extended abstracts are limited to a 2-page length (not including references) and can report on previously published work or preliminary results. 
 Please see the author guidelines on the conference website for detailed instructions and manuscript templates. 
 All submissions will undergo a detailed peer review process. Full papers will be reviewed for timeliness, novelty, scientific quality, sound methodology, and use of appropriate analysis techniques. Extended abstracts will be reviewed for timeliness, novelty, and quality. 
 Accepted submissions will be considered for oral or poster presentation, without distinction between full papers and extended abstracts. 
 Accepted submissions (both full papers and extended abstracts) will be published by MIT Press as open-access electronic proceedings. 
 List of Topics 
 ALIFE 2024 will showcase a wide range of topics in Artificial Life, bringing together world-leading researchers to discuss the latest advances in the synthesis and simulation of living systems. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following aspects of Artificial Life: 
 Complex dynamical systems and networks 
 Artificial chemistry, origins of life, computational biology 
 Synthetic biology, protocells, and wet artificial life 
 Ecology and evolution 
 Bio-inspired, cognitive and evolutionary robotics, swarms 
 Artificial intelligence and machine learning 
 Perception, cognition, behavior 
 Social systems, artificial and alternative societies 
 Evolution of language, computational linguistics 
 Artificial Life-based art 
 Artificial Life in education

 This year’s theme is Ciphers of Life, encouraging participants to explore the many ways that life encodes information, creates internal languages, and interacts in encrypted ways with its environment. Artificial life research focuses on understanding, replicating, and extending the fundamental principles of life. Much of this research involves creating artificial systems that exhibit life-like behaviors. 
 Classically, these endeavors are divided into three categories: Hardware research, wetware research, and software research. At ALIFE 2025 conference, the newest research in all three categories will be featured alongside artistic expressions, industry vendors, public events, and more. 
 About 
 Manuel is an interdisciplinary researcher at Araya Inc. working on mathematical approaches to agency and cognition.
