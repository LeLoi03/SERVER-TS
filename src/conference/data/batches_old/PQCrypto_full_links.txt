 Introduction 
 The aim ofhref="https://www.pqcrypto.org/conferences.html" - PQCrypto
is to serve as a forum for researchers to present results and exchange ideas on the topic of cryptography in an era with large-scale quantum computers. 
 After fourteen successful PQCrypto conferences (2006in Leuven,href="https://math.uc.edu/~aac/pqcrypto2008/" - 2008
in Cincinnati,2010in Darmstadt,2011in Taipei,href="http://pqcrypto2013.xlim.fr/" - 2013

), we are looking forward to PQCrypto 2024. 
 The conference will take place at the University of Oxford, Mathematical Institute. The dates are June 12–14, 2024. 
 We are on twitter ashref="https://twitter.com/PQCryptoConf" - @PQCryptoConf
for updates. 
  
 Affiliated Event - newtpqc 
 PQCrypto 2024 will be preceded by a 2-day workshop, The New Trends in Post-Quantum Cryptography workshop, or newtpqc. It will take place at the Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford (UK) on Monday 10 June and Tuesday 11 June 2024. 
 The goal of the workshop is to discuss the most recent and exciting trends of post-quantum cryptography. Ten world-class researchers will give keynote talks on cutting-edge topics that will play an important part in post-quantum cryptography in the years to come. 
 Further information can be found in thenewtpqc website.

 Call for Papers 
 Call for papers inhref="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/system/files/inline-files/pqc24cfp%20%282%29.pdf" - pdf format
. 
 Original research papers on all technical aspects of cryptographic research related to post-quantum cryptography are solicited. Topics of interest include (but are not restricted to): 
 Cryptanalysis of post-quantum systems, and quantum cryptanalysis. 
 Cryptosystems that have the potential to be safe against quantum computers such as: code-based, hash-based, isogeny-based, lattice-based, and multivariate constructions. 
 Implementations of, and side-channel attacks on post-quantum cryptosystems. 
 Security models for the post-quantum era. 
 Instructions to authors 
 Accepted papers will be published in Springer's LNCS series. Submissions must be anonymous. Submissions must not exceed 30 pages, including appendices and excluding references, and must be in a single-column format in 10pt fonts using the default llncs class without adjustments.
