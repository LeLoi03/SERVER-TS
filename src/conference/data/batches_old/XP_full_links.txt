 26th International Conference on Agile Software Development 
 href="#we-welcome-the-xp-community-for-the-first-time-in-switzerland" - We welcome the XP community for the first time in Switzerland!
XP is the premier agile software development conference, that combines, both, research and practice. It is a unique forum where agile researchers, practitioners, thought leaders, coaches, and trainers gather to present and discuss their most recent innovations and research results. At its inception, 26 years ago, the XP conference focused solely on eXtreme Programming. It quickly widened its scope to include all modern agile approaches and all the developing aspects of agility. XP draws people from around the globe, providing a diverse and inclusive environment for learning and inspiring conversations.

This year's XP 
 What matters to you? 
 In just a few years, AI tools have been widely adopted by industry and their capabilities have improved enormously. Together with other trends such as platform engineering, conversational applications, sustainable development, and many more, the way we develop, operate, and evolve software may change drastically. At the same time, with the digital revolution, software has become part of the critical infrastructure of the entire economy; software is a core asset of many companies and is responsible for their success. 
 How can these trends and new research support and enhance agile software development and its operation in the future? Are the agile values and principles described in the manifesto still valid and/or sufficient? 
 What other trends, innovations, and research do you see emerging in the development and operation of valuable software products? Do you want to help shape the future of software development? Do you have ideas, and solutions or have you done experiments and research to solve a specific problem? 
 The overarching theme of XP 2025 is thus:“Adapt - Uncovering better ways to deliver valuable software products”.

The theme of XP 2024 was “Reflect, Adapt, Envision” 
 This year’s theme encapsulates our journey through the last 25 years and our vision for the future. It’s an invitation to engage, learn, and shape the future of Agile together. 
 At its inception 25 years ago, the XP conference focused solely on eXtreme Programming. It quickly widened its scope to include all modern Agile approaches and Agility’s developing aspects. XP draws people from around the globe, providing a diverse and inclusive environment for learning and inspiring conversations.

for the latest updates. 
 Hosted in the picturesque town of Bolzano, Italy 
 For the first time in its long history, XP 2024 was held inhref="https://events.agilealliance.org/xp2024/getting-to-bolzano" - Bolzano, Italy
, a city in the South Tyrol province of north Italy, set in a valley amid hilly vineyards. It’s a gateway to the Dolomites mountain range in the Italian Alps. In the medieval city center, the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology features the Neolithic mummy called Ötzi the Iceman. Nearby is the imposing 13th-century Mareccio Castle, and the Duomo di Bolzano Cathedral with its Romanesque and Gothic architecture. 
 XP 2024 Program Components 
 Research Workshops 
 A forum for small group discussions to present and discuss results of scientific research and practice, and to explore innovative and cutting-edge topics. Full- and half-day research workshops will take place on Tuesday. 
 Experience Reports 
 Authors of Experience Report share their first-hand experience of challenges faced, approaches taken, and observations and insights gained. These personal stories are are a resource to those who want perspectives on what others are doing and the lessons they have learned along the way in practicing Agile and Lean software development. Experience Reports will be published on the Agile Alliance website. 
 Research Papers 
 Presentation of research papers on topics across the full spectrum of Agile software development and broader Agile issues of interest to both researchers and practitioners. 
 Interactive Track 
 Next to our planned content programming, XP 2024 will have a full, guided, interactive track aimed at bringing participants together, facilitating networking and shared learning, and making room for everyone to be fully engaged. We will also have a unique Engineering Interactive Track, where we can practice what we preach and build software together throughout the conference in a continuous, ensemble programming, session. 
 Industry & Practice 
 Workshops, demonstrations, and presentations based on the speaker’s experience and practice working in the industry. The theme for these session reflects that of the conference: “Whole Team Sustainability” with main topics around Leadership and Culture, Engineering, Product and Design, Process Innovation, Agile in Education and Training, and Sustainability 
 Open Access Publication 
 All peer-reviewed academic research presented at the conference will be available on the website as an open access Springer publication. We believe that research is useful to practitioners and should be shared widely, not hidden behind a paywall. There will be two publications, one before and one after the conference, containing research papers and workshop papers.
