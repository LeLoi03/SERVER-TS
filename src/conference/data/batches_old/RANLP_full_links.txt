 RECENT ADVANCES IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING 
 Varna, Bulgaria 
 href="http://ranlp.org/ranlp2025/" - http://ranlp.org/ranlp2025/
Summer School on Deep Learning and LLMs for NLP: 3-5 September 2025 (Wednesday-Friday) 
 Tutorials: 6-7 September 2025 (Saturday-Sunday) 
 Main Conference: 8-10 September 2025 (Monday-Wednesday) 
 Workshops and shared tasks: 11-13 September 2025 (Thursday-Saturday) 
 The biennial RANLP (Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing) conference is one of the most competitive and influential NLP conferences. The event grew out of the International Summer schools "Contemporary topics in Computational Linguistics" which were organised for many years as international training events. Previous RANLP conferences (1995, 1997, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2023) featured keynote talks by leading experts in NLP as well as presentations/papers of high quality, rigorously reviewed by Programme Committee experts. Since 2009, the papers accepted at RANLP and the associated workshops are included in the ACL Anthology. The RANLP proceedings are indexed by SCOPUS and DBLP. The Proceedings has its own Scopus SJR, in 2023 it is 0,299. The conference will be preceded by a Summer School on Deep Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) for Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well as tutorials on current topics of particular interest and cutting edge technologies. RANLP-2025 will be followed by specialised workshops as well as shared tasks covering timely NLP topics. A Student Research Workshop will be held in parallel with the main conference. The Student Research Workshops (now the 9th edition) have become active discussion fora for young researchers. 
 TOPICS 
 We invite papers reporting recent advances in all aspects of Natural Language Processing and particularly encourage submissions related to (and the employment of) the latest NLP methods including Large Language Models/Generative AI.

 VENUE 
 RANLP 2025 will be held at the conference facilities of Hotel “Cherno More” (http://www.chernomorebg.com) in Varna, the largest city on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. The event venue is centrally located at the entrance of the Sea Garden and offers excellent conference facilities. The city is a major tourist destination with flights to/from the Varna International Airport. It is also known for its Archaeological Museum, which features the oldest gold treasure in the world (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_Necropolis). The conference organisers plan to arrange a visit to Provadia-Solnitsata, the oldest salt-production and urban centre in Europe (5600 - 4350 BC,https://provadia-solnitsata.com/en/) which is located 50 km from Varna.
