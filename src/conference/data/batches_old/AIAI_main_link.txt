 Update to the AIAI Community from the Organisers 
 Dear Colleagues, 
 On behalf of the 21stAIAI (Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations) 2025 Organizing and Scientific Committee, it is a real honor and pleasure to welcome all Artificial Intelligence scholars who are looking for a well-established and prestigious forum to communicate and disseminate the innovative advances of their research. It is a fact that AI is continuously digging its way in a vast number of diverse scientific domains. AIAI aims to provide a forum for delegates from both academia and industry, who wish to share pioneer ideas, to get to know each other better and to present their research. Moreover, it aims to offer a deep glimpse into the future and to examine important AI ethical aspects. 
 TheArtificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations(AIAI) Conference has been held continuously since 2005, under the auspices of the IFIP WG12.5. Through the years, it has evolved to a well-respected and mature event, under the technical and scientific co-sponsorship of the AIAI community. This community comprises of an extended Group of leading scientists, not only from Europe but from all over the globe. 
 The h-index of the AIAI event is as high as39. This proves the novelty and quality of the presented-published research and its important contribution to the promotion of scientific ideas, algorithms and methods, globally. The fact that the conference Springer Proceedings, have been downloadedmore than 2,800,000times so far, supports the robust impact of the event among the scholars of AI internationally..href="https://ifipaiai.org/2025/message-of-the-organizers/" - …[read more]
