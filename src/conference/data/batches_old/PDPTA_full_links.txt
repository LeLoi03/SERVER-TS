 CSCE 2025 
 The 2025 World Congress in 
 Computer Science, Computer Engineering, & Applied Computing (CSCE) 
 July 21-24, 2025, Las Vegas, USA 
 PDPTA'25- The 31st Int'l Conf on Parallel and Distributed Processing Techniques and Applications 
 PDPTA is an international conference that serves researchers, scholars, professionals, students, and academicians who are looking to both foster working relationships and gain access to the latest research results. It is being held jointly (same location and dates) with a number of other research conferences; namely, The 2025 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing (CSCE'25). 
  
 We anticipate having between 1,000 and 1,500 participants in the Congress. The congress includes 21 major tracks composed of: 112 technical, research, and panel sessions as well as a number of keynote lectures and tutorials; all will be held simultaneously, same location and dates: July 21-24, 2025. Last year, the Congress had attracted speakers/authors and participants affiliated with over 148 different universities (including many from the top 50 ranked institutions), major IT corporations (including: Microsoft, Google, Apple, SAP, Facebook, Oracle, Amazon, Yahoo, Samsung, IBM, Ebay, GE, Siemens, Philips, Ericsson, BAE Systems, Hitachi, NTT, Twitter, Uber Technologies, ...), major corporations (including: Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, PetroChina, GlaxoSmithKline, HSBC, Airbus, Boeing, Hyundai, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, ...), government research agencies (NSF, NIH, DoE, US Air Force, NSA National Security Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, ...), US national laboratories (including, NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration, ANL Argonne National Lab, Sandia National Lab, ORNL Oak Ridge National Lab, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Lawrence Livermore National Lab, Los Alamos National Lab, Pacific Northwest National Lab, ...), and a number of Venture Capitalists as well as distinguished speakers discussing Intellectual Property issues. Last year, 54% of attendees were from academia, 25% from industry; 20% from government and funding agencies; and 1% unknown. About half of the attendees were from outside USA; from 69 nations. 
  
 The primary goal of this conference is to provide a platform for researchers, scientists, industry experts and scholars to share their novel ideas and research results on the application of human cognition models in various practical computing applications. Through this conference, the organizers would like to develop an interdisciplinary venue to contribute and discuss the ongoing innovations, applications and solutions to challenging problems of engineering human brain processes, learning mechanisms and decision making processes. 
  
 You are invited to submit a paper for consideration.All accepted papers will be published by Springer Nature (https://www.springernature.com/) in the proceedings (Research Books) and indexed in major Science Citation Indexation databases (including: Scopus; DBLP; EI Engineering Index; Compendex; Inspec databases; Springer Links; Google Scholar; CP Citation Index, CPCI; part of Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science; ACM Digital Library; IO-Port; MathSciNet; Zentralblatt MATH, and others.)
