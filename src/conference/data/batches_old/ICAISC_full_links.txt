 The 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing 
 June 22-26, 2025 
 About ICAISC 2025 
 The 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing ICAISC 2025 will be held in Zakopane (situated in the High Tatra mountains), Poland in June 22-26, 2025 inBachleda Kasprowy Zakopane Hotel. The conference will provide an excellent opportunity for scientists and engineers to present and discuss the latest scientific results and methods. The conference will include keynote addresses, contributed papers, and numerous lectures and tutorials on a wide range of topics. The Conference will be held inthe hybrid mode: online and on-site in Zakopane. The authors of accepted papers will have a choice to present their papers on-line, or on site in Zakopane, Mercury Kasprowy Hotel, Poland.

 Beware of the fake ICAISC Conference from WASET 
 We would like to bring to your attention the issue of fake conferences organized by WASET (World Academy of Science, Engineering, and Technology). It has come to our notice that WASET has a history of hosting dubious conferences that lack academic rigor and credibility. We advise you to thoroughly research any conference before committing to it and to consult with trusted colleagues or academic advisors if you have doubts. Please read more at:
