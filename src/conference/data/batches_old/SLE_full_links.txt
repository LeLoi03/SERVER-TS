 Welcome 
 The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE) is devoted to the principles of software languages: their design, their implementation, and their evolution. 
 With the ubiquity of computers, software has become the dominating intellectual asset of our time. In turn, this software depends on software languages, namely the languages it is written in, the languages used to describe its environment, and the languages driving its development process. Given that everything depends on software and that software depends on software languages, it seems fair to say that for many years to come, everything will depend on software languages. 
 Software language engineering(SLE) is the discipline of engineering languages and their tools required for the creation of software. It abstracts from the differences between programming languages, modelling languages, and other software languages, and emphasises the engineering facet of the creation of such languages, that is, the establishment of the scientific methods and practices that enable the best results. While SLE is certainly driven by its metacircular character (software languages are engineered using software languages), SLE is not self-satisfying: its scope extends to the engineering of languages for all and everything. 
 Like its predecessors, the 18th edition of the SLE conference, SLE 2025, will bring together researchers from different areas united by their common interest in the creation, capture, and tooling of software languages. It overlaps with traditional conferences on the design and implementation of programming languages, model-driven engineering, and compiler construction, and emphasises the fusion of their communities. To foster the latter, SLE traditionally fills a two-day program with a single track, with the only temporal overlap occurring between co-located events. 
 SLE 2025 will be co-located with STAF 2025 and take place in Koblenz, Germany.

 Socio-technical systems and language engineering (e.g., language evolution to adapt to social requirements) 
 Etc. 
 href="#types-of-submissions" - Types of Submissions
SLE accepts the following types of papers: 
 Research papers: These are “traditional” papers detailing research contributions to SLE. Papers may range from 6 to 12 pages in length and may optionally include 2 further pages of bibliography/appendices. Papers will be reviewed with an understanding that some results do not need 12 full pages and may be fully described in fewer pages. 
 New ideas/vision papers: These papers may describe new, unconventional software language engineering research positions or approaches that depart from standard practice. They can describe well-defined research ideas that are at an early stage of investigation. They could also provide new evidence to challenge common wisdom, present new unifying theories about existing SLE research that provides novel insight or that can lead to the development of new technologies or approaches, or apply SLE technology to radically new application areas. New ideas/vision papers must not exceed 5 pages and may optionally include 1 further page of bibliography/appendices. 
 SLE Body of Knowledge: The SLE Body of Knowledge (SLEBoK) is a community-wide effort to provide a unique and comprehensive description of the concepts, best practices, tools, and methods developed by the SLE community. These papers can focus on, but are not limited to, methods, techniques, best practices, and teaching approaches. Papers in this category can have up to 20 pages, including bibliography/appendices. 
 Tool papers: These papers focus on the tooling aspects often forgotten or neglected in research papers. A good tool paper focuses on practical insights that will likely be useful to other implementers or users in the future. Any of the SLE topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Submissions must not exceed 5 pages and may optionally include 1 further page of bibliography/appendices. They may optionally include an appendix with a demo outline/screenshots and/or a short video/screencast illustrating the tool. 
 Workshops: Workshops will be organized by SPLASH. Please inform us and contact the SPLASH organizers if you would like to organize a workshop of interest to the SLE audience. Information on how to submit workshops can be found on the SPLASH 2024 Website. 
 href="#submission" - Submission
SLE 2024 has a single submission round for papers, including a rebuttal phase, where all authors of research papers will have the possibility of responding to the reviews on their submissions. 
 Authors of accepted research papers will be invited to submit artifacts.

 Ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes in figures and tables are legible. 
 To increase fairness in reviewing, a double-blind review process has become standard across SIGPLAN conferences. Accordingly, SLE will follow the double-blind process. Author names and institutions must be omitted from submitted papers, and references to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person. No other changes are necessary, and authors will not be penalized if reviewers are able to infer their identities in implicit ways. 
 All submissions must be in PDF format. The submission website is:href="https://sle24.hotcrp.com" - https://sle24.hotcrp.com
href="#concurrent-submissions" - Concurrent Submissions
Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described bySIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware ofACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. Submissions that violate these policies will be desk-rejected. 
 href="#policy-on-human-participant-and-subject-research" - Policy on Human Participant and Subject Research
Authors conducting research involving human participants and subjects must ensure that their research complies with their local governing laws and regulations and the ACM’s general principles, as stated in thehref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" - ACM’s Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects
. If submissions are found to be violating this policy, they will be rejected. 
 Reviewing Process 
 All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Research papers and tool papers will be evaluated concerning soundness, relevance, novelty, presentation, and replicability. New ideas/vision papers will be evaluated primarily concerning soundness, relevance, novelty, and presentation. SLEBoK papers will be reviewed on their soundness, relevance, originality, and presentation. Tool papers will be evaluated concerning relevance, presentation, and replicability. 
 For fairness reasons, all submitted papers must conform to the above instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review at the discretion of the PC chairs. 
 For research papers, authors will get a chance to respond to the reviews before a final decision is made. 
 Artifact Evaluation 
 SLE will use an evaluation process to assess the quality of artifacts on which papers are based to foster the culture of experimental reproducibility. Authors of accepted research papers are invited to submit artifacts. For more information, please see thehref="https://2024.splashcon.org/track/sle-2024#Artifact-Evaluation" - Artifact Evaluation
page. 
 Awards 
 Distinguished paper | : Award for the most notable paper, as determined by the PC chairs based on the recommendations of the program committee. 
 Distinguished artifact | : Award for the artifact most significantly exceeding expectations, as determined by the AEC chairs based on the recommendations of the artifact evaluation committee. 
 Publication 
 All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library. 
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. 
 href="#sle-and-doctoral-students" - SLE and Doctoral Students
SLE encourages students to submit to the SPLASH doctoral symposium. Authors of accepted doctoral symposium papers on SLE topics will also have the chance to present their work to the SLE audience. 
 Contact 
 For additional information, clarification, or answers to questions, please get in touch with the program co-chairs (P.D.Mosses at tudelft.nl and Juliana at inf.puc-rio.br). 
 Artifact Evaluation 
 SLE’24 implements a two-rounds review process that also evaluates the quality of the artifacts supporting accepted research papers. This is the Artifact Evaluation track. 
 Authors of research papers accepted for SLE 2024 will be invited (by mail) to submit artifacts. Any kind of artifact that is presented in the paper can be submitted (tools, grammars, metamodels, models, programs, algorithms, scripts, proofs, datasets, statistical tests, checklists, surveys, interview protocols, visualizations, annotated bibliographies, and tutorials). 
 The submitted artifacts will be reviewed by a dedicated Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC). The approved artifacts will then be made first-class bibliographic objects, easy to find and cite. Depending on the quality of the artifact, the artifact might be awarded with different kinds of “badges” that are visible on the final paper. 
 The submission is additional to your already accepted paper at SLE24. It will not have a negative impact. 
 The artifact evaluation process of SLE borrows heavily from processes described atwww.artifact-eval.org. 
 href="#submission-and-reviewing-process" - Submission and Reviewing Process
Authors of Artifacts need an accepted paper at SLE24. 
 Authors use this submission page: | href="https://sle24ae.hotcrp.com/paper/new" - https://sle24ae.hotcrp.com/paper/new 
 Authors need to submit a PDF version of the accepted paper for evaluating the artifact-paper consistency. 
 The artifact can be associated with a | different | set of authors (different from the accepted paper). 
 Authors must submit a single artifact for a paper (1-to-1 mapping, paper-to-artifact). 
 Artifacts can be provided as zip or DOI. 
 The artifact evaluated by the AEC and linked in the paper must be precisely the same. Chairs will assure that DOIs point to the specific version evaluated, or that the SHA is the same. 
 PDF and artifact should NOT be anonymized anymore. 
 The process includes a Kicking-the-tires stages (close to a rebuttal): Reviewers report on possible problems that may prevent artifacts from being properly evaluated. Authors will be given three days to read and respond to the kick-the-tires reports of their artifacts and solve the issues (potentially resubmitting artifacts). Thereafter, the actually reviewing takes place. 
 Quality Criteria 
 Submitted artifacts will be evaluated by the AEC concerning the following criteria. Depending on the criteria, different Badges are assigned (we limit us the ‘evaluated’ and ‘available’ badge). 
 Artifacts ‘Evaluated’ (Badge) 
 Documented: At minimum, an inventory of artifacts is included, and sufficient description provided to enable the artifacts to be exercised. 
 Consistent: The artifacts are relevant to the associated paper, and contribute in some inherent way to the generation of its main results. 
 Complete: To the extent possible, all components relevant to the paper in question are included. (Proprietary artifacts need not be included. If they are required to exercise the package, then this should be documented, along with instructions on how to obtain them. Proxies for proprietary data should be included to demonstrate the analysis.) 
 Exercisable: Included scripts and/or software used to generate the results in the associated paper can be successfully executed, and included data can be accessed and appropriately manipulated. 
 (These points are evaluated by the AEC.) 
 There are two quality levels of the ‘Evaluated’ badge: 
 ‘Evaluated | Functional | ’ assures the minimal functionality. 
 ‘Evaluated | Reusable | ’ award artifact that exceeds the minimal functionality. 
 (This distinction is decided on by the Chairs, based on the comments of the AEC.) 
 Artifacts ‘Available’ (Badge) 
 Identification: Using DOIs to identify published objects is standard. It is important to use a DOI that points to the specific version with which the results of the paper can be reproduced (for Zenodo: do not use the “always latest” DOI; for FigShare: use a DOI with a version suffix, e.g., “.v1”). 
 Long-Term Availability: It is necessary that the artifacts are archived in an archive that hosts the artifacts on a long-term basis, such as in digital libraries of the ACM, Zenodo, etc. (version repositories do not fulfill this requirement, as the hosting company could decide at any time to discontinue the service, as done by Google, for example: Google Code). 
 Immutability: It is necessary that the artifact cannot be changed after publication because the reader needs to use the material exactly as the authors did to obtain their result. 
 Detailed definitions of these badges and the respective evaluation criteria may be found at theACM Artifact Review Badging site. 
 (These points are assured by the Chairs.)

 Additional Hints 
 If you are not certain how to submit your artifacts, these are some commonly known hints: 
 Use an archive file (gz, xz, or zip) containing everything needed for supporting a full evaluation of the artifact. The archive file has to include at least the artifact itself and a text file named README.txt that contains the following information: ** An overview of the archive file, documenting the content of the archive. ** A setup/installation guide giving detailed instructions on how to setup or install the submitted artifact. ** Detailed step-by-step instructions on how to reproduce any experiments or other activities that support the conclusions given in the paper. 
 When preparing your artifact, consider that your artifact should be as accessible to the AEC as possible. In particular, it should be possible for the AEC to quickly make progress in the investigation of your artifact. Please provide some simple scenarios describing concretely how the artifact is intended to be used. For a tool, this would include specific inputs to provide or actions to take, and expected output or behavior in response to this input. 
 For artifacts that are tools, it is recommended to provide the tool installed and ready to use on a virtual machine for VirtualBox, VMware, SHARE, a Docker image, or a similar widely available platform. 
 Please use widely supported open formats for documents (e.g., PDF, HTML) and data (e.g., CSV, JSON).

 « We have been devastated to hear that our friend and colleague Eelco Visser (https://eelcovisser.org/) suddenly passed away. Eelco was highly influential in the SLE community, being both a role model and a leader in our community. His many scientific contributions about meta-languages and DSLs has been of high importance in both the scientific and industrial communities, and led to the well known and cutting-edge language workbench Spoofax. He will be deeply missed by the whole SLE community at large. All our heartfelt condolences go out to the family and friends. RIP Eelco. »
