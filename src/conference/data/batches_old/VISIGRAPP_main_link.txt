. 
 Registration to VISIGRAPP allows free access to the MODELSWARD and ROBOVIS conferences (as a non-speaker). 
  
 The purpose of VISIGRAPP is to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in both theoretical advances and applications of computer vision, computer graphics, human-computer interaction and information visualization. 

New registrations are now only available at the conference welcome desk 
  
 Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).Download the Conference App from Play Store or App Store now, to have mobile access to the technical program and also to get notifications and reminders concerning your favorite sessions.

 SCOPE 
 The International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications aims at becoming a major point of contact between researchers, engineers and practitioners on the area of computer vision methodology and systems, and their application. Five simultaneous tracks will be held, covering all different aspects related to computer vision: Image and Video Processing and Analysis; Image and Video Understanding; Motion, Tracking and Stereo Vision; Mobile and Egocentric Vision for Humans and Robots; and Applications and Services. We welcome papers describing original work in any of the areas listed below. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques as well as general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Paper acceptance will be based on quality, relevance to the conference themes and originality. The conference program will include both oral and poster presentations. Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as technical tutorials, dedicated to technical/scientific topics, are also envisaged.CONFERENCE AREAS
