IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) 
  
 href="FOCScover.gif" - larger cover image | The IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) is the flagship conference sponsored by the IEEE Computer SocietyTechnical Committee on the Mathematical Foundations of Computing (TCMF)and covers a broad range of theoretical computer science. It is held annually in the autumn and is paired with its sister conference, the annual Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) held each spring and sponsored by ACM SIGACT.History 
 FOCS was founded in 1960 as the Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design. The 1960 conference did not have a separate published proceedings but most of the papers were published in the second half of the proceedings of the 1961 conference. For the 7th instantiation of the conference in 1966, the name was changed to the Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory (SWAT). The greatly increased breadth of the conference led to a name change to its present one in 1975. At that timeAlvy Ray Smithproduced the distinctivecover artthat was a notable feature of FOCS proceedings until FOCS ended the production of printed proceedings in 2010. The stylized FOCS fox logo was created for the 26th FOCS. FOCS celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009.

 IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) 
 The IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) is the flagship conference of the TCMF and covers a broad range of theoretical computer science. It is held annually in the autumn and is paired with its sister conference, the annual Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC) held each spring and sponsored by ACM SIGACT. 
 FOCS was founded in 1960 as the Symposium on Switching Circuit Theory and Logical Design. The 1960 conference did not have a separate published proceedings but most of the papers were published in the second half of the proceedings of the 1961 conference. For the 7th instantiation of the conference in 1966, the name was changed to the Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory (SWAT). The greatly increased breadth of the conference led to a name change to its present one in 1975. At that timeAlvy Ray Smithproduced the distinctive cover art that is a notable feature of FOCS hardcopy proceedings. FOCS celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2019. 
 FOCS 2024 was held in Chicago, Illinois from October 27-30, 2024; the conference webpage is located at:href="https://focs.computer.org/2024/" - https://focs.computer.org/2024/
.FOCS 2025 will be held in Sydney, Australia.

IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS) 
 The IEEE Symposium on Logic in computer Science is an annual international forum on theoretical and practical topics in computer science that relate to logic broadly construed. It was founded in 1986 and is celebrating its 33rd anniversary. A sampling of the many subjects covered by the LICS conference includes automated deduction, concurrency and distributed computation, constructive mathematics, database theory, finite model theory, formal aspects of program analysis, formal methods, logical aspects of computational complexity, logic in artificial intelligence, logics of programs, model checking, programming language semantics, proof theory, reasoning about security, type systems and type theory, and formal verification. 
 LICS 2024 was held in Tallinn, Estonia from July 8-11, 2024; the conference webpage is located at:href="https://lics.siglog.org/lics24/" - https://focs.computer.org/2024/
