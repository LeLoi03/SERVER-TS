 Welcome to SSDBM 2025 
  
 The International Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Management 2025 is aimed to bring together domain experts, data management researchers, practitioners, and developers for the presentation and exchange of the latest research results on concepts, tools, and techniques for scalable and scientific data management. Previous editions of SSDBM focused on scientific statistical databases. In 2025, the scope of the 37th edition of SSDBM will be expanded to all scalable and scientific data management fields. The name of the conference is changed toInternational Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Managementfrom the International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management, while keeping the acronym SSDBM. 
 The new SSDBM conference will provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation and evaluation of latest advances in scalable and scientific data management. The conference program typically consists of a single track to facilitate discussion, and contains presentations of invited talks, panel sessions, and demonstrations of research prototypes and industrial systems. 
 SSDBM 2025 will be hosted by The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The conference will be held on June 23 - 25, 2025, in the Ideation Zone of the Translational Data Analytics Institute. SSDBM 2025 will continue the tradition of past SSDBM meetings in providing a stimulating environment to encourage discussion, fellowship and exchange of ideas in all aspects of research related to scientific and statistical data management, and high-performance data analysis tools and techniques for distributed datasets.

Scientific and Statistical Database Management Conference 
 About SSDBM 
 This international conference brings together scientific domain experts, databases researchers, practitioners and developers for the presentation and exchange of current research on concepts, tools and techniques for scientific and statistical database applications. SSDBM provides a forum for original research contributions in system design, implementation evaluation, and application. Individual themes differ year to year with the main focus remaining on databases theory and application in the scientific and statistical fields. Past themes included bioinformatics (genomics, biodiversity informatics including biological databases), geospatial and sensor databases, geological databases, data mining, metadata management, conceptual models, data integration visualization, and system architectures. The priority areas are supplemented with invited talks and panel sessions, and illustrated with demonstrations of research prototypes and industrial systems. The conference takes place in a single plenary session to facilitate the viewing of all presentations by all attendees. The conferences are hosted by institutions around the world currently about half of them occuring in North America.
