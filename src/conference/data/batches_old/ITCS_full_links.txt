 The16th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS)conference will take place at Columbia University. It will be heldin personfrom January 7 - January 10 2025. 
  
 ITCS seeks to promote research with innovative or bold agendas, which could be conceptual, technical, or methodological, and whose message will advance and inspire the greater theory community. The program committee welcomes papers introducing a new concept, model or understanding; opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas; introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies, or new applications of known techniques; putting forth a bold, even if preliminary, vision or line of attack; or unearthing novel or surprising connections between different topics.Important dates

 Submission Instructions 
 Authors should register and submit their paper viahref="https://itcs2025.hotcrp.com/" - hotcrp submission site
, by the abovestrictdeadlines. The font size should be at least 11 point and the paper should be single column. Beyond these, there are no formatting requirements. Authors are required to submit a COI declaration upon submission. 
 The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way.In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. (Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.) The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without unconscious bias, and is not intended to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may (and are in fact encouraged to) post their papers to arXiv/ECCC/IACR etc. 
 Authors should strive to make their paper accessible not only to experts in their subarea, but also to the theory community at large. The submission should include clear proofs of all central claims. In addition, it is strongly recommended that the paper contain, within the first 10 pages, a concise and clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its significance, innovations and place within (or outside) of our field's scope and literature. The committee will put a premium on writing that conveys clearly, in as simple and straightforward a manner as possible, what the paper accomplishes. 
 Submissions authored by program committee members (with the exception of the PC chair) are allowed. Utmost care will be taken to avoid COIs with PC submissions, ensuring that such submissions receive no unfair advantage, and that the reviews and the discussion remain confidential from the authors. 
 All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. In addition the program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions. 
 Prior, simultaneous, and subsequent submissions 
 Results published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS. Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed. Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences. 
 Online posting 
 Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the arxiv, the ECCC, or the Cryptology ePrint archive. It is generally expected that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers, with proofs, available before the conference begins. 
 Accepted papers 
 All the talks are expected to be in person. The talks in the conference will not be recorded, and instead the authors of each paper will be asked to upload a 20-25 minute talk, which will be posted online. 
 Graduating bits 
 Participants near to graduation (on either side) will be given an opportunity to present (in 2-3 minutes) their results, research, plans, personality, and so on during the "Graduating bits" session. This is one of the important traditions of ITCS, and not to be missed! Details on how to participate will be provided closer to the conference date.Awards 
 The committee may award a "best student paper" award. 
 Code of Conduct 
 ITCS is committed to an inclusive conference experience, respectful of all participants, and free from any discrimination or harassment, including unwelcome advances or propositions of an intimate nature, particularly when coming from a more senior researcher to a less senior one. All ITCS attendees are expected to behave accordingly. If you experience or witness discrimination, harassment or other unethical behavior at the conference, we encourage you to seek advice by contacting SafeToC advocates (http://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/)

To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask the PC chair to have only a one page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the PDF of the full paper on an online archive.

Registration is open until December 31, and we ask that you register as soon as possible. If you don't register by this deadline, you may not be given access to campus in time for the conference. 
 The registration fee is $250 for students and postdocs, and $350 otherwise. Students and postdocs who need assistance can write to the local organizers (email at the bottom of this page) to request a waiver. If you'd like to apply for a waiver, please do so before December 15th. 
 When you register, the first time you are asked to give your name, please give the name as it appears on your government ID. You may need to show this ID to access Columbia campus. After the payment step of registration, there is a final page where you will be asked for the name you want to appear on your badge, which may be different. 
 Hotels 
 We generally recommend staying at a hotel in the Upper West Side neighrbood of Manhattan, from which one can easily get to Columbia campus using the 1 train subway line. The station at 116 St is right next to the campus entrance gate. 
 We have reserved a block of rooms at a discounted rate at the Hotel Belleclaire which can be bookedhref="https://be.synxis.com/?Hotel=60633&Chain=16087&group=0106COL&arrive=01-05-2025&depart=01-10-2025" - here
. There is a limited number of rooms available, so please be sure to book soon. 
 Conference Venue 
 The talks and all other events will be held in the Columbia Computer Science Building, which can be accessed from the 4th floor of the Mudd Building.

 To get to the Mudd building, first enter campus at the main gate at the intersection of Broadway and West 116 street. It is right next to the 116 st subway station of the 1 train. From there, walk north through campus, up the big staircase, and walk to the Mudd Building.

 Getting to Columbia and around New York 
 Columbia and the Upper West Side are accessible by public transportation from all the NY-NJ airports (LGA, JFK & EWR). The best way to get around the city is to use New York subways and buses, although taxis, Ubers and Lyfts are also easily available from all three airports. LGA airport is the closest of the three airports to Columbia, and the M60 bus goes directly from all the terminals at LGA airport to Columbia campus. We recommend using the Google Maps app to determine how to use public transit to get to around the city, as the system is quite large and often complicated.
