 ABZ 2025 – 11th International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods 
 Call for papers 
 The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods. 
 The name ABZ goes back to the first conference in London in 2008, where the ASM, B and Z conference series were merged into a joint event. In the following years other formal methods were added, e.g. Alloy in 2010 (Orford, Canada), VDM in 2012 (Pisa, Italy), and TLA+ in 2014 (Toulouse, France). After the also successful 2016 conferences in Linz, Austria, and 2018 in Southampton, UK, it was decided to name the conference “ABZ: International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods”, to stress the openness for further state-based formal methods. We hope to continue many fruitful discussions between representatives of the individual methods in the past, which will bring us closer to the common goal of this research community: the creation of reliable and safe software and systems. 
 ABZ 2025 will have a main conference track, a case study track, a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops.

 The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods.

 Choosing a Formal Method 
 Choosing a formal method for a given purpose requires a good overview of the available methods, their underlying techniques, tool support and applications. We list here a collection of surveys and evaluation reports that may help in making this decision. Please, note that the opinions and conclusions drawn in these surveys do not necessarily reflect the opinion of FME and its members. 
 Two new survey papers offer complementary perspectives on the state of formal methods in 2020. 
 Formal methods in dependable systems engineering: a survey of professionals from Europe and North America | Mario Gleirscher, Diego Marmsoler. Empirical Software Engineering 25, pages 4473–4546. Springer 2020. 
 The 2020 Expert Survey on Formal Methods | . Hubert Garavel, Maurice H. ter Beek, Jaco van de Pol. Proc. Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems (FMICS 2020). LNCS 12327, Springer 2020 ( | pdf | ) 
 For future reference, we have collected and combined the bibliographies of the two papers into a single bibtex-file, which is availablehere.
