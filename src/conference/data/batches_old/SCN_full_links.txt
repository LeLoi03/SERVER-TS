 About 
 CryptoBib 
 CryptoBib is a BibTeX database containing papers related to Cryptography, with manually checked entries and uniform BibTeX data. CryptoBib can be used as a classical BibTeX database. BibTeX keys are short and easy to remember. 
 URL fieldNew2017-04-06:URLs are now indicated in theurlfield instead of in the fieldnote. If you were usingsplncs.bstorbiblatex / biber, you should not need to change anything. But if you are still using oldbibtexstyles, such asalpha.bstorplain.bst, you may want to move toalphaurl.bstorplainurl.bst, otherwise URLs will not be displayed anymore.

 GitHub 
 The code is now open source, and you can now add cryptobib files as an SVN external project or a Git submodule to always stay up to date: 
 Add the submodule to your paper's project: | git submodule add https://github.com/cryptobib/export cryptobib 
 Update cryptobib: | ( cd cryptobib && git pull origin master ) 
 Retrieve cryptobib after | git clone | or | git pull | : | git submodule update --init
