 Workshop Goals 
 This workshop is a forum of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and physicists performing research on finite field arithmetic, interested in communicating the advances in the theory, applications, and implementations of finite fields. The workshop will help to bridge the gap between the mathematical theory of finite fields and their hardware/software implementations and technical applications, specially in cryptography and coding theory. 
 WAIFI 2026 will be held in Santander, Spain 
  
 Main Workshop Themes 
 The topics of WAIFI 2026 include but are not limited to: 
 Theory of finite field arithmetic: | Bases (canonical; normal; dual; etc.) 
 Polynomials (irreducible; primitive; permutation) 
 Boolean functions and special functions over finite fields 
 Algebraic curves over finite fields 
 Dynamical systems over finite fields 
 Hardware & Software implementations: | Design & implementation of finite field processors 
 Design & implementation of arithmetic algorithms 
 Pseudorandom number generators 
 Hardware/software co-design 
 Applications of finite fields in: | Cryptography (ciphers; PQC; etc) 
 Coding theory (AG codes; LDPC codes; etc) 
 Combinatorics (designs; arrays; etc) 
 Finite geometry
