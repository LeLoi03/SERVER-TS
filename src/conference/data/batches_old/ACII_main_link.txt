 ACII 2025 
 The ACII 2025 organising committee is delighted to bring the ACII conference series to Australia for the first time.ACII 2025 will be anin-person eventheld at the Hotel Realm conference venue in Canberra, Australia. 
 The ACII conference series – organized by the Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC, formerly known as Humaine) – is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognise, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena. 
 The theme for ACII 2025 isSocially Responsible Affective Computing. 
 The main conference days will be on 8-10 Oct 2025, while workshops and tutorials will be held on Saturday, 11 Oct 2025. This ‘reverse’ conference schedule forACII 2025 will allow for maximum flexibility for attendees who also want to attend the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (href="https://icmi.acm.org/2025/" - ICMI 2025
, 13-17 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling to combine two excellent conferences in one trip. While the organising committees of ACII 2025 and ICMI 2025 are separate, the teams work closely together and investigate registration options that will allow for different combinations of attending the two conferences for those who cannot attend both conferences in full. Further details will be provided in due time. (Sunday, 12 Oct 2025 will be a rest and recovery day for those attending both conferences.)

 The Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC) invites you to submit your original research for presentation at the 13th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII), which will be held as anin-person eventin Canberra, Australia, 8-11 October 2025.Accepted papers must be presented by one of the paper’s authors. 
 ACII 2025 will be held just before the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (href="https://icmi.acm.org/2025/" - ICMI 2025
, 13-17 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling the attendees to combine two excellent conferences in one trip. 
 The ACII conference series is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognise, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena. All accepted papers will be included in IEEE Xplore (subject to approval by the IEEE Computer Society) and indexed by EI. A selection of the best articles at ACII 2025 will be invited to submit extended versions to theIEEETransactions on Affective Computing. 
 The theme for ACII 2025 isSocially Responsible Affective Computing. Affective computing, with its ability to recognise and respond to human emotions, holds great potential for enhancing user experiences and fostering more natural interactions between humans and machines. It also has promising applications in fields such as mental health, where this technology can assist psychologists and other clinicians in making more accurate diagnoses by detecting mental states. However, this powerful technology also raises significant ethical concerns that must be addressed to ensure its responsible and transparent use. 
 One of the primary challenges is the potential misuse or exploitation of sensitive emotional data, including for manipulative or discriminatory purposes. Ensuring robust data privacy, clear ethical guidelines, and regulations around the use of emotional data is crucial. Additionally, the lack of transparency of many affective computing algorithms, systems build on limited data, and the potential for biases in emotion inference systems pose risks of perpetuating harmful stereotypes or inaccurate assessments based on factors such as gender, race, or cultural background. Transparency, accountability, and mitigating biases in these systems are essential to build trust with users. 
 Recognising these concerns, regulatory efforts such as the EU AI Act aim to establish legal frameworks and stringent requirements for high-risk AI applications, including those related to emotional state detection, ultimately safeguarding individual rights and upholding ethical principles in the development and deployment of affective computing technologies. A stronger focus needs to be placed on these matters by the affective computing research community. 
 The ACII 2025 (8-11 Oct 2025) and ICMI 2025 (13-17 Oct 2025) conferences will be held in back-to-back mode at the same venue in Canberra, Australia – one trip, two great conferences!
