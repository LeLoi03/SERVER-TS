 General Information 
 The Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) is a systems-oriented conference complementary in its mission to the mainstream database conferences like SIGMOD and VLDB, emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR was run every two years starting 2003, becoming the premier conference for practical data systems work. From 2020 on, the conference is organized every year, alternating between Amsterdam and the USA. CIDR 2025 will be held in Amsterdam.The CIDR program consists of single-track keynote, paper and demo presentations. There are also evening sessions, including a lively gong show, and plenty of time for interaction among the delegates, who are researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry. CIDR encourages papers about innovative and risky data management system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insight resourceful experimental studies, and provocative position statements. Papers are encouraged to present novel approaches to data systems architecture and usage, to inspire discussions on the latest innovative and visionary ideas in the field. Authors are encouraged to submit their best systems work, and are limited to submit at most two papers.

The Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) was started in 2002 by Michael Stonebraker, Jim Gray, and David DeWitt to provide the database community with a venue for presenting innovative data systems architectures, as well as a prestigious publication opportunity. CIDR is complementary in its mission to the mainstream database conferences like SIGMOD and VLDB, emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR gathers researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss the latest innovative and visionary ideas in the field. CIDR mainly encourages papers about innovative and risky data management system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insight, resourceful experimental studies, provocative position statements. CIDR especially values innovation, experience-based insight, and vision. 
 The first CIDR conference was first held at Asilomar in January 2003, and has been held every other January for the first 18 years. Since 2020, the conference has a yearly cadence alternating between California and Amsterdam.The conference will be held for a fifteenth time between January 19-22, 2025 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

 Data systems take centre stage at CIDR 2025 
 The Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) brought 170 international visitors to Amsterdam this year. Organized locally by our Database Architectures (DA) group, CIDR is renowned for showcasing bold ideas, novel approaches, and forward-thinking perspectives in data systems research.

Today (22 January) marks the final day of this systems-focused conference, which emphasizes a systems architecture perspective and attracts practitioners from both academia and industry. Among the authors presenting their best systems research were Peter Boncz (leader of the DA group and general co-chair of CIDR) and Hannes Mühleisen (CWI & DuckDB Labs)*. 
 Peter BonczWorking with vast amounts of data 
 href="https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2025/keynotes.html" - Keynote speaker Thea Klaeboe Aarrestad
(ETH) discussed the immense challenges of managing the vast amounts of data produced by the CERN Large Hadron Collider, where researchers study high-energy proton collisions to uncover fundamental particles and forces in physics. These collisions generate 10,000 exabytes of raw data annually. To handle this enormous data flow, real-time event filtering systems process millions of collisions per second, equivalent to 5% of global internet traffic, combined with unprecedented complexity. 
 Maintaining data integrity for meaningful physics analyses requires highly optimized machine learning (ML) algorithms. Klaeboe Aarrestad explained how real-time ML techniques enhance data filtering and improve the acceptance of physics signals. 
 Thea Klaeboe AarrestadEnergy trade-offs 
 href="https://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2025/keynotes.html" - Keynote speaker Christos Kozyrakis
(Stanford University) explored the limits of semiconductor technology and emerging trends in AI training and inference that are reshaping hardware architecture. He highlighted the energy trade-offs in compute and memory, offering insights into how AI systems and chips can also accelerate other data-intensive workloads and influence the development of future hardware technology. 
 Pushing boundaries 
 In addition to keynotes, the program included an evening programme, paper and demo presentations. CIDR values bold and innovative approaches to data management system architecture, real-world systems-building experience, insightful experimental studies, and provocative position papers. The conference fosters discussions around visionary ideas that push the boundaries of what is possible in data systems.

 Junfeng Yang 
 Junfeng Yang is Professor of Computer Science, Member of the Data Science Institute, and co-Director of the Software Systems Lab at Columbia University. 
 Yang’s research centers on building reliable, secure, and fast software systems. Today’s software systems are large, complex, and plagued with errors, some of which have caused critical system failures, breaches, and performance degradation. Yang has invented techniques, algorithms, and tools to analyze, test, debug, monitor, and optimize real-world software, including Android, Linux, production systems at Microsoft, machine learning systems, and self-driving platforms, benefiting hundreds of millions of users. His research has resulted in numerous vulnerability patches to real-world systems, practical adoption at the largest technology companies, and press coverage at Scientific American, The Atlantic, The Register, Communications of ACM, and other news outlets. 
 Yang received BS in Computer Science from Tsinghua University and MS and PhD in Computer Science from Stanford University. He won the Sloan Research Fellowship and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research Young Investigator Program Award, both in 2012; the National Science Foundation CAREER award in 2011; the inaugural Rock Star Award of the Association of Chinese Scholars in Computing in 2019; and Best Paper Awards at the USENIX Symposium on Operating System Design and Implementation in 2004 and 2022, the ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in 2017, the USENIX Annual Technical Conference in 2021, and the annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) in 2024.
