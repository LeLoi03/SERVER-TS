International Computer Science Symposium in Russia 
 Temporary Suspension 
 The Steering Committee has decided to temporarily suspend the CSR series.Purpose and Scope 
 This is an annual conference that intends to reflect the broad scope of international cooperation in computer science. In 2006-2009 the symposium consisted of two tracks:Theory TrackandApplications and Technology Track, and since 2010 it has a single track. The topics covered vary from year to year, but in general try to cover as much of the contemporary computer science as possible.The proceedings are published in | Springer | 's | Lecture Notes in Computer Science | . 
 Selected papers are usually published in a special issue of | Springer | 's | Theory of Computing Systems | journal. 
 Best Paper Awards and Best Student Paper Awards | . 
 The conference also features a | distinguished opening lecture | .
