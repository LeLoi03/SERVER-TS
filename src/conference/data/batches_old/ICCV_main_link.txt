 Paper Submission 
 All submissions will be handled electronically via the OpenReview conference submission websitehref="https://openreview.net/group?id=thecvf.com/ICCV/2025/Conference" - https://openreview.net/group?id=thecvf.com/ICCV/2025/Conference
. All authors must agree to the policies stipulated below. The paper and supplementary materials submission deadline is March 7th, 2025 11:59pm HST and will not be changed. 
 Policies 
 In submitting a manuscript to ICCV, authors acknowledge that no paper substantially similar in content has been or will be submitted to another conference or workshop during the review period (March 7, 2025 – June 20, 2025). Please refer to the Author Guidelines on the conference website for additional details on dual submissions and guidelines concerning prior work. 
 By submitting a paper to ICCV, the authors agree to the review process and understand that papers are processed by OpenReview to match each manuscript to the best possible area chairs and reviewers. 
 All accepted papers will be made publicly available by the Computer Vision Foundation (CVF) two weeks before the conference. Authors wishing to submit a patent understand that the paper's official public disclosure is two weeks before the conference or whenever the authors make it publicly available, whichever is first. More information about CVF is available athttp://www.cv-foundation.org/.
