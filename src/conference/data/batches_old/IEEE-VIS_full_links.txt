IEEE VIS: Visualization & Visual Analytics 
 November 2 to 7inVienna, AustriaWelcome to IEEE VIS 2025 
 IEEE VIS 2025 will be the year’s premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics. The conference will convene an international community of researchers and practitioners from universities, government, and industry to exchange recent findings on the design and use of visualization tools. 
 In 2025, the conference is again moving to the old continent, and we cannot wait to welcome you to the heart of Europe in the beautiful city of Vienna! Vienna is awelcoming hostthat excels at traditional hospitality, and a highly efficient modern city. It is a major urban center but still has the largest proportion of green space of any large European city. In addition to the well-known cultural highlights, the capital’s outstanding infrastructure sets Vienna apart as a remarkably clean and safe city. The public transportation network and short walking distances between attractions mean it takes no time to get around, with some of Europe’s most beautiful sights and the finest culinary delicacies around every corner. Sustainability is a key factor - from renewable energy forms and the outstanding drinking water fresh from the city’s taps. Like many other events in Vienna, VIS 2025 will be certified as agreen meeting. 
 We will do our best to plan an extraordinary experience for you and will cheer together for IEEE VIS’ past and future!

 IEEE VIS Workshop on Visualization Education, Literacy, and Activities 2024 
 This is the second IEEE VIS EduVis Workshop on Visualization Education, Literacy, and Activities. This workshop happens with thehref="https://ieeevis.org/year/2024/welcome" - IEEE VIS 2024
conference. This workshop aims to become a forum to share and discuss advances, challenges, and methods at the intersection of visualization and education. The workshop addresses an interdisciplinary audience from and beyond visualization, education, learning analytics, science communication, psychology, or people from adjacent fields such as data science, AI, and HCI. It will include presentations of research papers and working group discussions. 
 The full workshop proposal is availablehere. 
 IEEE Xplore Proceeding 
 Thehref="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=10747654" - 2024 IEEE VIS Workshop on Visualization Education, Literacy, and Activities (EduVIS)
has been posted to the IEEE Xplore digital library. 
 Program 
 The workshop is scheduled for Sunday, October 13th (8:30 - 15:00 ET/UTC-4). 
 Block 1: 8:30 am to 9:45 am ET (UTC-4) 
 8:30 - 8:40:Workshop Opening & Outline (Fateme Rajabiyazdi) 
 8:40 - 9:10:Keynote:Playful data visualisations: data literacy across the school curriculum-Kate Farrell, Director of Curriculum Development and Professional Learning, Data Education in Schools (Chair: Benjamin Bach) 
  
 Bio:Kate Farrell works on the Data Education in Schools project developing and delivering professional learning workshops for teachers and creating data literacy and data science activities for Primary and Secondary learners. Kate led the team creating the national Secondary school qualifications in Data Science in Scotland. She advised on the Computing Science outcomes in the Scottish Curriculum, co-wrote a guide for Primary and Early Years (K-6) on teaching data literacy and developed new badge activities in computational thinking with Girl Guiding. Kate is constantly amazed she gets to have fun creating data literacy escape rooms, puzzles, games and unplugged activities. Recently, she has been also finding her degree in AI gained in the ‘dark ages of AI’ is becoming useful as the team work on AI literacy activities and resources. 
  
 Talk: Investigate ways to get creative with data literacy with children and young people through hands-on data visualisation activities that have been developed and used with thousands of learners across Scotland and worldwide. Activities will include a zero-waste data physicalisation activity (“Fizzy Data”), a large-scale participatory data weaving activity, a set of mindful drawing activities and an interactive online activity encoding your personal data into digital art. We will finish by looking at further possibilities for representing data through non-traditional creative media, such as embroidery, 3-D printing, and playdough, with an emphasis on sustainability.

 Workshop goals and scope of topics 
 With this workshop, we want to achieve the following goals: 
 build a forum and interdisciplinary community around teaching data visualization, open to researchers, students, and practitioners outside the traditional VIS community 
 share research on visualization literacy, education and teaching, and practices 
 collect, test, and systematize learning activities 
 discuss best practices and challenges concerning visualization education and literacy 
 Tracks 
 New this year, are submissions to focus on topics relevant to the EduVIS community. Three general submission tracks for this year’s workshop: 
 Visualization for Education[Vis4Ed]: use of visualization in educational settings of any discipline or topic 
 AI for Visualization Education[AI]: integrate or limit tools like ChatGPT and generative AI into visualization education 
 Generic Topics in Visualization and Education[General]: includes any other submission relevant to the workshop 
 Theworkshop topicsinclude, but are not limited to: 
 Generative AI and visualization (in learning and assessment) 
 Evaluation methods and learning analytics using AI 
 Visualization literacy and pedagogy in visualization 
 Learning goals and learning methods 
 Educational tools 
 Visualization activities 
 Pedagogy in visualization 
 Hybrid and online teaching 
 Reflective and research practices 
 Understanding audiences 
 Guidelines, strategies, and guidance for education 
 Debate and discussions on visualization guidelines and well-established knowledge 
 Knowledge dissemination 
 Challenges and personal experiences 
 Informal learning 
 Experiential learning (hands-on learning and physicalization) 
 Visualizations for public education (e.g., health education, science communication) 
 Engagement with visualizations 
 Teaching approaches to encourage creativity and design critique 
 Accessibility of visualization learning resources 
 Submission Guidelines and Reviewing Process 
 The workshop will accept two types of submissions, peer-reviewed by at least two PC members and one workshop organizer. 
 Paper submissions:full papers (4-8 pages excluding references, must follow the formatting guidelines for VGTC Conference Style Template); submissions will be published at the IEEE Xplore with authors’ permission. Note: Similar to the VIS paper stream, we accept both double-blind (anonymized) and single-blind (not anonymized) submission 
 Educator reports:short reports (1-2 pages, template agnostic) to discuss opinions or reflections on teaching experiences or describe the results of a datavis activity conducted and how it could be reused by others and in other contexts; they will be published in the Nightingale magazine (pre-arranged with the Data Visualization Society). This is not intended to be assessed as scientific writing; we recommend framing these reports similar to blog posts. The goal of these reports is to disseminate knowledge to non-academic audiences. 
 At least one author for each paper or educator report must register and attend the conference in person or virtually.

 Submission Guidelines and Reviewing Criteria 
 As the leading academic event on visualization research, IEEE VIS expects important, impactful, and potentially transformative contributions. Submissions will be judged on their scientific quality and novelty, potential impact, degree to which the evidence supports the findings, appropriateness of methodology, and the research process followed. After the initial notification of review results, selected papers are only conditionally accepted and will undergo a full revision and review cycle: only papers that improve according to the required changes will be accepted after the second round review. 
 IEEE VIS 2025 also features a separate short papers track. You can find more information in thehref="shortpapers" - call for participation for short papers
. 
 When preparing your submission, please make sure that you carefully read and adhere to thehref="paper-submission-guidelines" - paper submission guidelines
. 
 Reviewers should be familiar with thehref="review-instructions" - guidelines for reviewing papers for VIS
. 
 Accessibility 
 We highly recommend screen reader accessible final submissions. Please see thehref="/year/2025/info/call-participation/make-pdf-accessible" - VIS Accessibility Guide
to learn how you can make your contribution accessible. 
 Open Access Policy 
 Visualization research is best communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, all paper authors are encouraged to share their accepted paper in an open-access repository in accordance with IEEE copyright regulations. We also recommend that authors include sufficient supplemental materials with their submission so that their work can be easily scrutinized and used or extended by future researchers and practitioners. For instructions on how to post an accepted paper to an open-access repository and recommendations on sharing supplemental materials, please see thehref="https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/info/open-practices/open-practices" - VIS Open Practices Guidelines
. Additionally, funding agencies and research organizations may have specific rules concerning Plan S compliance: impacted authors should check and comply with their respective organizational rules.Email:opc@ieeevis.org
