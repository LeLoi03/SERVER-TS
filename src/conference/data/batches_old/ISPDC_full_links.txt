 The 24th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC 2025) 
 July 08-11, 2025 
 Rennes, France 
 Nowadays applications generate enormous datasets that are continuously increasing exponentially in both complexity and volume, making their analysis, archival, and sharing one of the grand challenges of modern big data analytics. Supported by the rise of artificial intelligence and deep learning, such enormous datasets are becoming valuable resources even beyond their original scope, opening new opportunities to learn patterns and extract new knowledge at large scale, potentially without human intervention. However, this leads to an increasing complexity of the workflows that combine traditional HPC simulations with big data analytics and AI applications. Thus, modern scientific applications need to be integrated into an entire Compute Continuum from the edge all the way to supercomputers and large data-centers using flexible infrastructures and middlewares. In this context, the rise of new opportunities in AI, networking, edge computing, and IoT opens up new avenues for scientific exploration while simultaneously challenging our understanding of infrastructure’s role and structure. ISPDC welcomes contributions focused on the efficient support for processing across such a Computing Continuum, with a focus on approaches enabling the community to share repeatable digital artifacts, facilitating the replication of experiments, trustworthiness and explainability of AI models and driving further innovation. 
 Following very successful previous editions held in different venues since 2002, the 24th ISPDC conference will be hosted by Inria in the city of Rennes, France. The ISPDC 2025 conference aims at presenting original and unpublished research that will target state-of-the-art as well as emerging topics pertaining to the field of Parallel and Distributed Computing paradigms and applications. Parallel and Distributed Computing is an important research area today and has a strong contribution to the advancements in science, engineering, and society at large. Its evolution is characterised by the continuous development of new approaches in the modeling, design, analysis, evaluation, and programming of parallel and distributed computing applications and systems. 
 The goal of the 24th International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC 2025) is to bring together researchers, engineers, and practitioners for the purpose of sharing their experiences in the development of new algorithms, applications, architectures for parallel and distributed computing, as well as modeling and simulation, visualisation, and data analytics. 
 We cordially invite you to submit your contribution to the 24th ISPDC conference, considering (but not limited to) the following area of interests: 
 Efficient Support for the Computing Continuum (combining HPC, Cloud and Edge Computing) 
 Complex Workflows at the Intersection of HPC, Big Data, AI and Quantum Computing 
 Reproducibility, Explainability, Trustworthiness of Complex Workflows 
 Machine Learning (ML) for Systems and Systems for ML 
 Efficient Support for Federated Learning 
 Algorithms and Models for Large Scale Applications 
 Architectures and Environments for Parallel and Distributed Computing 
 Performance Modeling, Analysis and Evaluation for Parallel and Distributed Systems 
 Security and Privacy in Parallel and Distributed Systems 
 Blockchain and Distributed Ledgers 
 Mobile and Embedded Computing 
 Applications and Use-Cases in HPC, Big Data, AI and Quantum Computing
