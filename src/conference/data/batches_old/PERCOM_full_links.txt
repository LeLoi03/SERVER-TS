 PerCom 2025 
 The 23rd International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom 2025) 
 March 17 – 21, 2025, Washington DC, USA(Walter E. Washington Convention Center) 
 Conference Overview 
 IEEE PerCom, now in its 23rd year, will be held atWalter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington DC, USA, from March 17 – 21, 2025, as a physical in-person conference. PerCom is the premier annual scholarly venue in pervasive computing and communications. Pervasive computing is constantly at the forefront of mobile systems research and has found its way into many commercial systems due to tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics such as wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, ambient intelligence, and smart devices. 
 IEEE Percom 2025 will be held in person. Remote presentations and pre-recorded videos are not allowed unless all authors of an accepted paper are under special circumstances that prevent them from attending the conference in person. Requests for such exceptions will be considered carefully by the organizing committees. We are sympathetic to concerns and sentiments about our in-person focus. We will accommodate remote authors/speakers if they have Visa-related travel or COVID/health-related travel issues on case-by-case basis.

 IEEE PerCom, now in its 23rdyear, will be held in Washington DC, USA, from March 17 to 21, 2025, as a physical event. 
 PerCom is the premier annual scholarly venue in pervasive computing and communications. Pervasive computing is constantly at the forefront of mobile and ubiquitous systems research and has found its way into many commercial applications due to tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics such as wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, ambient intelligence, and smart devices. 
 Scope 
 PerCom 2025 solicits research contributions in all areas pertinent to pervasive computing and communications. In particular, PerCom targets contributions in: 
 Advances in pervasive systems and infrastructures: | middleware systems and services; data engineering for pervasive computing; cloud, fog and edge computing; integrations of smartphones and wearables in pervasive experiences; applications of device-to-device coordination. 
 Theories, models, and algorithms: | context modeling & reasoning; adaptive computing; activity & emotion recognition; programming paradigms; applied deep/federated/decentralized machine learning; causal learning; cognitive computing; resource-efficient AI; complex networks; spatio-temporal modeling. 
 Domain-specific challenges and novel applications: | urban/mobile crowdsensing & intelligence; PerCom for healthcare and well-being; cyber-physical PerCom; smart homes and virtual assistants; mixed reality; sports analytics; crime prevention; pervasive nowcasting; assistive and collaborative robotics; pervasive AR/VR; smart vehicles; disaster sensing and management; interactive agents; education and reskilling. 
 Intersections of PerCom with: | IoT and sensor systems; RFID; opportunistic networks; pervasive data science; human-machine interaction and interfaces, cyber-physical systems; 3D networks, embedded and edge AI. 
 New techniques for user-level concerns: | participatory and social sensing; trust, security, privacy, fairness, and ethics; user interface, interaction, and persuasion; online and offline social networking; human-machine collaboration. 
 Technological innovations: | architectures, protocols, and technologies for pervasive communications; energy-harvesting, self-powered, or battery-less systems; mobile and wearable systems; smart devices, natural multimodal interfaces and environments; positioning, navigation, timing, and tracking technologies; and device-free human and environmental sensing. 
 Contributions can be analytical, empirical, technological, methodological, or a combination. Papers reporting strong systems engineering contributions backed by solid and appropriate evaluations are strongly encouraged.The impact of the contributions should be demonstrated in the context of pervasive computing and communications applications. 
 Read Before Submitting 
 Note: accepted papers must be presented in person by one of the authors, in addition to having an associated full registration. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the exclusion of the paper from the final proceedings, the conference program and from the IEEE Digital Library, and the paper will not be eligible for the Best Paper Award. 
 We also strongly advise authors of submitted papers to be prepared to apply for their US visa as soon as their paper is accepted. 
 Important Dates(Revised)

 Best Paper Award and Editorial Follow-Ups 
 The best paper will receive the prestigious Mark Weiser Best Paper Award. 
 Selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions for aspecial issue of thePervasive and Mobile Computing Journal. 
 Submission Details 
 Paper submission must be done for the main conference and all associated events viaEasyChair. If you do not have an EasyChair account, please, register first and create an account (it’s free) via the following link:register. The direct submission link for PerCom 2025 ishref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=percom2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=percom2025
; paper submission will be active from September 5. Select “Research Track” from the list of tracks to submit papers to the main conference. 
 PerCom 2025 will follow adouble-blind review process. As a result, authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions. In particular, as in previous PerCom editions, publishing pre-prints of your submitted papers in online archives (e.g., arXiv) prior to submission does NOT disqualify the paper from consideration at PerCom. Moreover, we instruct reviewers NOT to go searching for pre-prints of submitted papers.However, papers that are judged not to have created a suitable double-blind version may be summarily rejected from further consideration. 
 Submitted papers must be unpublished and may not be under consideration elsewhere for publicationat any point in the review process. Also, they must show a significant relevance to pervasive computing and communications. Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous review process handled by the Technical Program Committee. Only electronic submissions inPDFformat will be considered. 
 The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as formatting instructions, can be foundhere. Papers must be at most9 pages of technical content(10pt font, 2-column format), including text, figures, tables and appendices, and up to1 additional page for referencesonly.Papers that violate the formatting instructions may be summarily rejected from further consideration. 
 Accepted papers will be published in IEEE Xplore.
