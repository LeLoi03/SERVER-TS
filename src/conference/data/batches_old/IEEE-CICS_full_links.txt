 Welcome to Trondheim, Norway, IEEE SSCI 2025, 17th - 20th March 
 IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations. 
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia. 
 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants from fast food to Michelin star and sport activities. 
 We, the Organising Committee, are thrilled to extend a heartfelt invitation to academia, industry, and government agencies alike, to actively participate in presentations and discussions in Trondheim., that will play a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of Computational Intelligence. The conference program is set to showcase a vibrant lineup, including plenary and keynote addresses, oral and poster presentations, engaging panels, insightful workshops, instructive tutorials, and stimulating competitions. 
 Your participation is invaluable, and we look forward to welcoming a diverse and dynamic community to contribute to the success of both the relaunch of SSCI and the 2025 event.

 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Cyber Security (IEEE CICS) 
 Computational Intelligence constitutes an umbrella of techniques, has proven to be flexible in solving dynamic and complex real-world problems. These techniques typically include Machine Learning, Fuzzy Logic, Evolutionary Computation, Intelligent Agent Systems, Neural Networks, Cellular Automata, Artificial Immune Systems, Game Theory and other similar computational models. These techniques are widely used in different cyber security applications such as online behavior monitoring, e-fraud detection, robust decision support modules to enhance the protection of computing devices and information infrastructure at different levels. 
 Cyber defense is a continuously changing attack landscape as the software/hardware components are added and/or updated more frequently at different layers of cyber systems for additional functionalities and/or improved usability while these may not be security-enabled. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities and find attack paths to compromise the target systems. The multi-faceted Computational Intelligent (CI) techniques appear to provide an efficient security paradigm to deal with influx of new threats in next generation high-performance network infrastructures and large-scale smart applications. These approaches can also be used to augment defense-in-depth architectures and to add necessary security enhancements to the design, implementation and operation of legacy and future cyber-enabled systems. 
 Topics 
 The symposium will cover all the issues, research and development of the state-of-the-art CI-based technologies in solving various computer and information security problems. CI application areas include, but are not limited to: 
 Intrusion/malware detection, prediction, classification, and response 
 Models for survivable, resilient, and self-healing systems 
 Sensor network security, web security, wireless and 4G, 5G media security 
 Digital forensics, security information visualization 
 New sensor fusion and decision support for mobile device security 
 Self-awareness, auto-defensiveness, self-reconfiguration, and self-healing networking paradigm 
 Modeling adversarial behavior for insider and outsider threat detection 
 Cloud and virtualization security 
 Internet of Things (IoT) and end-point device security 
 Identity science, authentication, and access control 
 Social network security and privacy 
 Electronic healthcare security, privacy, and compliance 
 Big-Data and application security 
 Block-chain security
