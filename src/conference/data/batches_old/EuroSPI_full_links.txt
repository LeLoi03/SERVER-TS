 Vision 
 32nd EuroSPI Conference 
 EuroSPI² 2025 (17 - 19 September 2025) will have 10 international thematic workshop streams supported by thematic topic communities and the ICSSP (International System and Software Process Association) conference will take place as a co-located partner event. Each thematic stream integrates both, research sessions and industry / applied science sessions. The thematic streams will be a mix of pitch talks provoking discussions, full presentations and panel discussions which will focus on specific questions of interest. 
 Thematic Workshop Sessions 
 EuroSPI² 2025, (17 - 19 September 2025), hosted by Riga Technical University, Riga, Latvia, will have international key notes as plenary sessions and thematic workshops integrating research and industry experience. Researchers present case studies and new research which can in future be considered by industry and in the workshops. Industry presents best practices from industry and discusses the approaches and methods with experts. The goal is to fertilize the cooperation between research and industry. Additionally we involve strategic EU projects to empower new directions and co-operations. 
 Social Events 
 We believe that networking and creating research and business relationships is important to create a sustainable community for improvement and innovation. While the conference offers ideas, presentations, discussions, knowledge during the day, the social talks after the conference are equally important to establish trust and partnerships. We also believe that Europe integrates many regions with different cultures and to build European trust based partnerships we need to learn about the culture of regions. So please join the networking space and social events. This year we plan to visit a hall in the Latvian society building and with classical music by price winning musicians and a buffet. 
 Key Notes 
 Key notes are plenary sessions by key experts from industry or research. Key notes (if accepted) are used to create key statements in the EuroSPI Youtube channel. We have every year 5 key notes from leading industry and research. Please visit our key notes page and the EuroSPI Youtube channel. We also invite key industry at the EuroSPI technology day, please visit our technology day page and download the free available presentations. 
 Workshop Communities 
 The thematic workshops allow leading industry and research to attend EuroAsiaSPI not only for a conference but also for a dedicated topic based workshop/training event. These workshop are dealing with hot topics and contain key papers and interactive sessions with open discussions. Participants work with the speakers to elaborate key statements to follow up in the next years workshops. The thematic workshops will be published as separate chapters in the annual SPRINGER book in the CCIS series. 
 EuroSPI as a Hybrid Event 
 We will continue to use the advanced technology equipment and organise an onsite and online hybrid event using integrated sound, cameras and video streaming combined with technical and content moderator roles in each workshop. Since EuroSPI² 2020 we have organised this hybrid event very successfully and feedback from attendees encourage us to continue with this new approach. 
 Social Events 
 Europe has many different regional cultures and customs, and still we need to work together in the EU frameworks. Already at the start of EuroAsiaSPI² in 1994 it was decided to place the conference in a different region every year and that the local host organises social events that help us to learn about the hosting culture, the traditions, history and the local food. This has a large influence on what social events EuroAsiaSPI² offers.This year we will plan to explore a famous medieval barbecue restaurant in the Rozena street on 17.9.2025.

 ›‹Conference Programme 
 The 2025 conference program will be published by end of May 2025. See the structure below! 
 EuroSPI² 2025 (17 - 19 September 2025) has 9 international thematic workshop streams supported by thematic topic communities. Each thematic stream integrates both, research sessions and industry / applied science sessions. The thematic streams are a mix of talks provoking discussions, full presentations and panel discussions which focus on specific questions of interest. In addition there is a half day about new research and industry project and funding proposal ideas. Some streams run longer than one day depending on the size of the community and contributions. 
 Eachthematic workshopcovers specific thematic topics andmixes research and industry presentations/discussions on that specific topic. 
 Note: ICSSP 2024 was held together with EuroSPI 2024. According to their feedback this cooperation went well. However, the ISSPA decided to re-focus their interest in more social and societal impact topics from 2025 on-wards so that they discontinue with the cooperation in conferences. Those who attended from ICSSP community in2024 are welcome to submit papers, and we hope for a continuing good relationship with ISSPA in the years to come. 
 Associated Technology Day - Pre-Conference Event (8 September 2025) 
 The associated technology day is a half day online event on 8 September 2025, with key note speakers presenting most recent developments. It can be attended free of cost. A link to the online conference will be published and the access to the presentations and discussions will be free. There arekey note presentationsand content basedwebinar sessions. Key note sessions are from leading industry or experts, and webinar sessions are presenting first and then using tools to which attendees can access in a gamified scenario.This pre-conference event on 15 September 2025 is free of cost. 
 See thetechnology day page. 
 The EuroSPI 2025 Program 
 The conference has 5 parallel streams. Each stream contains a mix of research and industry/applied science papers/presentations. Also each stream contains a mix of pitch talks (show key message and discuss) and full presentations. Also there will be one special session for discussing new funding proposals and finding partners for ideas. The future conference strategy of EuroSPI² is to gather core topics and build communities around the core thematic topics. Leading industry and research lead the thematic topic streams. 
 Also EuroSPI² continuously builds the SPI strategy and understanding in Europe and the world and continues to promote and develop theSPI Manifesto.

 About 
 The EuroSPI conference series (and book series) has been formed 1994 as a leading conference in the area of System, Software, Services Process and Product Improvement and innovation with contributions from leading industry and leading research. SOQRATES as working group of leading German and Austrian industry started in 2003 and is moderated by the chair of EuroSPI since 2003 and the working group contributes to the thematic workshops organized at EuroSPI, to define state of the art in system design, safety and cybersecurity, assessments, quality management, agile processes standards, etc. The EuroSPI academy started in 2020 (based on the EU Blueprint project DRIVES concept of a learning compass for European automotive industry) and within a year has many hundred trained, and on DRIVES learning portal we have more than 2000 MOOC trainees. By end of 2024 we already achieved about 3000 certifications by the EuroSPI academy. Certificates are valid 2 years and you find the definedhref="./ressources/EuroSPI-Academy-Re-Certification-Strategy-v3.pdf" - re-certification procedure here
. A re-certification costs 75 EUR per year and is paid in 2 years cycles (150 EUR). There are different options to re-certify by experience evidences. Please read the re-certification procedure to find out the options. The exam systems originally developed to support ECQA are now adapted and integrated to support Europe wide certification and exams systems under the European System, Software, Services Process Improvement EuroSPI Certificates & Services GesmbH. We now bundle this to a European initiative under one umbrella and move all teams and services behind this aggregated bundled European strategy.

 Working Groups 
 SOQRATES was launched in 2003 by the Bavarian SW Initiative and the ASQF to launch SPICE in German industry. In the first year, 16 companies were supported. After the first year (end of the financial support from the Bavarian SW Initiative), the partners set up a task force with various working groups that deal with practical experience in implementation. Knowledge acquired together is shared in the form of knowledge releases. Today around 24 leading German and Austrian companies are partners and ISCN as one of the moderators from 2003 has acted as moderator of the task force since 2004, and Methodpark (also a moderator from 2003) operates the knowledge portals with the Stages system. Special work schemes such as requirements management, functional safety and automotive SPICE, standard comparisons, system design, agile development, test, traceability, etc. are exchanged and coordinated by leading companies. 
 Together with IICM of TU Graz we estabished a Net Interactive Document (NID) server with the abstracts and presentations of the EuroSPI conference.
