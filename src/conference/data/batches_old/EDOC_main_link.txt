 EDOC 2025 Call 
 EDOC 2025 – 29th International Conference on Enterprise Design, Operations, and Computing 
 Thehref="https://edocconference.org/" - EDOC conference series
brings together leading computer science researchers, IT decision makers, enterprise architects, solution designers and practitioners to discuss enterprise computing challenges, models and solutions from the perspectives of academia, industry and government. 
 The conference emphasizes a holistic view of enterprise applications engineering and management, fostering integrated approaches that can address and relate processes, people and technology. 
 The conference welcomes high-quality scientific submissions as well as experience papers from industry. 
 Topics 
 We solicit submissions of scientific papers that describe original results not having been accepted or submitted for publication elsewhere. These papers will be peer-reviewed based on their scientific and technical contribution, originality, and relevance. These also include case studies following a formal case study research method (e.g., involving elaborate and well-structured gathering and processing of data from the case). 
 EDOC is offering two submission rounds: 
 First Round: Papers submitted by the first deadline may be accepted or rejected directly in a first review round. Alternatively, authors may be invited to submit a revised version of the paper to a second round for re-examination (with feedback similar to journal submissions). 
 Second Round: Papers submitted by the second deadline are reviewed in the traditional way in one review round. 
 Examples of topics of interest are: 
 Enterprise Architecture & Engineering | Methods, Frameworks, Reference Models, and Tools, for Enterprise Architecture 
 Enterprise architecture for networked organisations 
 Architecture level concerns, such as interoperability, security, sustainability, etc. 
 Architectural impact of new technologies, including AI, cloud computing, edge computing, blockchain, etc. 
 Service-Oriented Software System Architectures | Service composition, orchestration and choreography 
 Service policies, contract definition and enforcement 
 Software & services modeling languages and approaches 
 Architectures for cyber-physical systems 
 Software architecture level concerns, such as interoperability, security, sustainability, etc. 
 Model-Based Software Engineering | Software engineering methods for enterprise computing 
 Model-driven architectures and software development 
 Domain specific modeling languages (DSML) 
 Engineering of digital twins 
 Low code platforms 
 Enterprise Security | Information Security 
 Cybersecurity 
 Sensing and Awareness 
 Threat modeling, attack simulation, intrusion detection and prevention
