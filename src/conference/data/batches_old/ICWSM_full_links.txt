The International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) is a forum for researchers from multiple disciplines to come together to share knowledge, discuss ideas, exchange information, and learn about cutting-edge research in diverse fields with the common theme of investigating the interplay of web and society. This overall theme includes research on new perspectives in social theories, as well as computational algorithms for analyzing digital traces of human activities or behaviors in social settings. ICWSM is a singularly fitting venue for research that blends social science and computational approaches to answer important and challenging questions about human social behavior through online traces while advancing computational tools for vast and unstructured data. 
  
 ICWSM, now in its nineteenth year, has become one of the premier venues for computational social science and social computing.Previous yearsof ICWSM have featured papers, posters, and demos that draw upon a wide spectrum of disciplines from computational sciences (e.g., network science, artificial intelligence, machine learning, test/data mining natural language processing, image/multimedia processing, human computer interaction) to social sciences (e.g., sociology, communication, political science, anthropology, psychology, economics, digital humanities). Note that papers focusing solely on the advancement of algorithmic components or which use Web data only as an artifact (for instance, in method evaluation) are out of scope. Ideal submissions should speak to research questions of societal relevance. 
  
 We invite original work that utilizes diverse digitally mediated data sources such as web navigation traces, traces from apps, social media traces, data from online platforms such as microblogs (e.g., X/ formerly Twitter), wiki-based knowledge sharing sites (e.g., Wikipedia), online news media (e.g., Huffington Post), forums, mailing lists, newsgroups community media sites (e.g., YouTube, Instagram), Q&A sites (e.g., Quora Stack Overflow), user review sites (e.g., Yelp, Amazon.com), search platforms and social curation sites (e.g., Reddit, Pinterest). Adapting to our continuously evolving field, we are open to new forms of technologically mediated human or society-related data sources (e.g., mobility traces, satellite data) and methods that advance our understanding of society and the influence of the web on it. 
  
 The uniqueness of the venue and the quality of submissions have contributed to a rapidly growing conference, and a competitive acceptance rate of approximately 20 to 30% for full-length research papers published in the proceedings by the Association for thehref="http://www.aaai.org/conference/icwsm/" - Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)
.

 The International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM) 
 January 29, 2023 
 The rapid creation and consumption of social media content continues to drive the evolution of the Internet and the Web. Social media content now accounts for the majority of content published daily on the web. As the space evolves, researcher and industrial practitioners find themselves at a key point for collaborating on research, implementation and deployment of a wide range of analyses and applications. The International Conference on Weblogs and Social Media is intended to bring together researchers in the broad field of social media analysis (including fields such as computer science, linguistics, psychology, statistics, sociology, multimedia and semantic web technologies) and foster discussions about ongoing research on weblogs and social media. We invite participation from academe and industry. The conference is sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

 ICWSM-2024 KeynotesCan Large Language Models Transform Computational Social Science?Adamic-Glance Plenary Talk 
 by Diyi Yang, Stanford University 
  
 Abstract:Large language model (LLM) provides great opportunities for analyzing text data at scale and has transformed the way humans interact with AI systems in a wide range of fields and disciplines. This talk shares two distinct approaches to how LLM can influence and potentially transform computational social science research. This first part analyzes the zero-shot performance of 13 LLMs on 24 representative computational social science benchmarks in order to provide a road map for using LLMs as computational social science tools. The second part explores social skill training with LLMs by presenting how we use LLMs to teach conflict resolution skills through simulated practice. We conclude by discussing concerns about using LLMs in the social sciences and offering recommendations on how to deal with them. 
 Bio:Diyi Yang is an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at Stanford University, also affiliated with the Stanford NLP Group, Stanford HCI Group and Stanford Human Centered AI Institute. Her research focuses on human-centered natural language processing and computational social science. She is a recipient of IEEE “AI 10 to Watch” (2020), Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship (2021), NSF CAREER Award (2022), an ONR Young Investigator Award (2023), and a Sloan Research Fellowship (2024).

Diyi has previously served as the General Co-Chair of ICWSM 2022, Ethics Co-Chair of NAACL 2022, Board Member of NAACL (2022-2023), as well as Senior Area Chair and Area Chair of major NLP conferences. 
 Facts, Frames, and (Mis)Interpretations: Understanding Online Rumors as Collective Sensemaking 
 by Kate Starbird, University of Washington 
  
 Abstract:Facts, Frames, and (Mis)interpretations: Reflections on a Decade of “Misinformation” Research At the University of Washington, my colleagues and I have been studying online rumoring for more than a decade and have had a front row seat as misinformation—and its more nefarious cousin, disinformation—have grown and metastasized within social media platforms and the broader information ecosystem. In this talk, first, I’ll draw from that body of work to demonstrate some of the salient dimensions of online rumoring, misinformation, and disinformation, how they have evolved over time, and where they intersect with the design of sociotechnical systems, human psychology, and intentional manipulation. Next, I’ll present an emerging framework for applying theories of “collective sensemaking” to the study of rumors, conspiracy theories, and disinformation, which we hope will lead to more accurate (and nuanced) understandings and more productive ways of operationalizating these phenomena. Finally, I’ll discuss some of the challenges that researchers in our field are facing—from data access issues to harassment and legal threats—as our work documenting the manipulation of online systems draws attention from the people and organizations that perpetrate and/or benefit from that manipulation. 
 Bio:Dr. Kate Starbird is an Associate Professor in the Department of Human Centered Design & Engineering (HCDE) and Director of the Emerging Capacities of Mass Participation (emCOMP) Laboratory. She is also adjunct faculty in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering and the Information School, and a data science fellow at the eScience Institute. Kate is a co-founder of the University of Washington's Center for an Informed Public, which formed in 2019 around a shared mission of resisting strategic misinformation, promoting an informed society, and strengthening democratic discourse. Kate's research is situated within human-computer interaction (HCI) and the emerging field of crisis informatics — the study of how information-communication technologies (ICTs) are used during crisis events. Her research examines how people use social media to seek, share, and make sense of information after natural disasters (such as earthquakes and hurricanes) and man-made crisis events (such as acts of terrorism and mass shooting events). More recently, her work has shifted to focus on the spread of disinformation in this context. Kate's research touches on broader questions about the intersection of technology and society—including the vast potential for online social platforms to empower people to work together to solve problems, as well as salient concerns related to abuse and manipulation of and through these platforms and the consequent erosion of trust in information.

 ICWSM Awards 
  
 ICWSM Adamic-Glance Distinguished Young Researcher Award 
 This annual award is presented to a young researcher who has distinguished themself through innovative research in the area of social computing/computational social science in the early stage of their independent research career. The award is named afterLada AdamicandNatalie Glance, two outstanding researchers who have made significant contributions to the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) in particular and social computing/computational social science in general. The ICWSM research community at large has greatly impacted this field, through identifying the connections between online digital behaviors and critical societal questions and issues. From misinformation and fake news to how we can use social media and social networks to gain insight into political polarization, mental health, and social movements, the range of topics addressed by the community is continuously expanding. We want to recognize and celebrate the young researchers who are making these contributions today. 
  
 The award was established in 2021, at the 15th anniversary mark of thehref="https://icwsm.org/2021/index.html" - AAAI ICWSM conference
. Prior winners of the award areDr. Tanu Mitra(2021),Dr. Robert West(2022), andDr. Diyi Yang(2023). 
  
 Nomination Process and Eligibility 
 Self-nominations, nominations, and letters of support are elicited. ICWSM strongly encourages individuals from underrepresented groups in research (based on gender identity, race, ethnicity, geographical location, etc.) to self-nominate, and urges the wide community to nominate young researchers who have distinguished themselves for their creativity and rigor in identifying and addressing important research topics of societal impact. Nominations are open from February 7th to March 7th 2024. Use thisGoogle Formfor submission. 
  
 Eligibility Criteria 
 The award is open to individuals who: 
  
 Have received their PhD within the past 7 years. Career interruptions and other special circumstances will be considered and should be mentioned in the nomination justification document. 
 Perform research that is recognizably within the broad field of social computing/computational social science in terms of their thematic and methodological approaches. 
 Have published their research in the top venues for social computing or computational social science including active participation in ICWSM. 
 As long as a candidate is eligible based on the three criteria above, they will be considered even if they were nominated or self-nominated in prior years. 
  
 Selection Process 
 The selection committee consists of three to five members and is appointed by the AAAI ICWSM Steering Committee Chair. The committee solicits self-nominations, nominations, and letters of support from the social computing/computational social science community. The selection is based on the impact of the candidate's work in the field: in identifying significant new problems, creating promising new ideas paradigms, and tools related to data-driven understanding of human behavior, which may be quantitative or qualitative in nature. Depth and impact are valued over breadth of contribution for this award. A strong regard for considering the ethical aspects of the data/methods used in social computing/computational social science is expected of the research record of the nominees. 
  
 Thenomination formasks the following questions: 
  
 Nominator’s information (name, affiliation, email, a link to their webpage). 
 Nominee’s information (name, affiliation, email, year of PhD, a link to their webpage that contains additional information, for example their CV/resume). 
 A one-page statement explaining why the nominee deserves the award in question, especially highlighting the novelty and strength of their contributions in the area of computational social science / social computing, and providing evidence of their academic and societal impact. A second page can be included to contain information about career interruption or any special considerations. 
 Citations for up to three representative publications and/or links to other artefacts documenting the contribution or impact. 
 Note for letters of support:The form makes it easy to submit letters of support from people other than the nominators or self-nominators. Such individuals will not need to complete the details of the nomination, they will simply upload their letter. 
  
 Form accessibility:The nomination form requires Google authentication. If for any reason this is a problem for the nominator, please send the nomination materials via email to:href="mailto:mailto:adamic-glance-award@icwsm.org" - adamic-glance-award@icwsm.org
. 
  
 Conflict of interest:The awards committee takes conflict of interest seriously. If an nominated individual is a former or current collaborator of one or more of the committee members, such member(s) recuse themselves from evaluating and voting on these nominations.

 The Eighteenth International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM 2024) was held from June 3-6 in Buffalo, New York. The conference general chair was Kenny Joseph. The conference program co-chairs were Ancsa Hannak, Agnes Horvat, Daniel Romero, and Kokil Jaidka. 
 The International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) is a forum for researchers from multiple disciplines to come together to share knowledge, discuss ideas, exchange information, and learn about cutting-edge research in diverse fields with the common theme of online social media. This overall theme includes research in new perspectives in social theories, as well as computational algorithms for analyzing social media. ICWSM is a singularly fitting venue for research that blends social science and computational approaches to answer important and challenging questions about human social behavior through social media while advancing computational tools for vast and unstructured data. 
 ICWSM, now in its eighteenth year, has become one of the premier venues for computational social science, and previous years of ICWSM have featured papers, posters, and demos that draw upon network science, machine learning, computational linguistics, sociology, communication, and political science. The uniqueness of the venue and the quality of submissions have contributed to a rapidly growing conference, and a competitive acceptance rate of approximately 20% for full-length research papers published in the proceedings by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).

 The social and community driven aspects of our digital lives continue to rapidly increase, resulting in transformative behaviors and, significantly, publishing and distributing huge amounts of fascinating data. The International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media met in Ann Arbor, Michigan (USA) to discuss the latest research analyzing and leveraging this resource. There were 64 papers accepted. Some of these were presented in full-length oral format, others as lightning talks with a poster session following. There were also 18 poster submissions appearing in the proceedings as four-page papers. The posters and five demonstrations were presented at the poster session. This conference continues to provide evidence that ICWSM is maturing in its role as a premier venue for social media research.

 The social and community driven aspects of our digital lives continue to rapidly increase, resulting in transformative behaviors and, significantly, publishing and distributing huge amounts of fascinating data. The International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media met in Cambridge, Massachusetts (USA) to discuss the latest research analyzing and leveraging this resource. Thanks to the enthusiastic participation of our community, we received a record number of submissions, with a growth of 50 percent over the previous year. More than the quantity, however, the high quality of the submitted papers is the truest evidence that ICWSM is maturing in its role as a premier venue for social media research.

 The Sixth International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM-11) was held June 4-8, 2012 in at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland. The conference general chair was John G. Breslin.

 The social and community driven aspects of our digital lives continue to rapidly increase, resulting in transformative behaviors and, significantly, publishing and distributing huge amounts of fascinating data. The International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media met in Dublin, Ireland to discuss the latest research analyzing and leveraging this resource. As you read through this proceedings, you will see that the interdisciplinary flavor of ICWSM is reflected not just in a balance in papers from several fields, but also within the contributions themselves, since many of the papers and posters demonstrate excellence in multiple areas. We believe this increasing integration reflects a new level of maturity in the field: investigators have moved beyond simply applying their trusted methods to social media topics, and have started to implement the ideas and approaches that are best suited to their research questions.
