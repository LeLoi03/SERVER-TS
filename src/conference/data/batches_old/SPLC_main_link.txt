 A Forum For Researchers, Practitioners And Educators 
 Date:September 1st to 5th, 2025 
 Venue:Facultade de Informática, Universidade da Coruña (A Coruña, Spain) 
 The Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC) is a premier forum where researchers, practitioners, and educators can present and discuss the most recent ideas, trends, experiences, and challenges in the area of software and system product lines engineering. Conference events include opportunities to hear industry leaders’ real-world experiences and researchers’ latest ideas and to learn from both. 
 The 29th ACM International Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC 2025) will be held atFacultade de Informática, Universidade da Coruña (A Coruña, Spain), from September 1st to 5th 2025. 
 The conference will include a highly selective program of research papers and industry papers, accompanied by keynote speeches, workshops, demonstrations, tutorials, panels, and doctoral symposium. Besides, SPLC 2025 advocates the discussion of challenges in the area of software and system product line engineering by adding a challenge track and encourage research discussion by a journal first track. We warmly welcome high quality papers, which describe original and unpublished research advancing the state of the art in software and system product line. We hope that SPLC 2025 can successfully bring an opportunity to hear and learn from both leaders’ real-world experiences and researchers’ latest ideas.

 Call for papers 
 href="https://2025.splc.net/call-for-research-papers/" - Call for Research Papers
: We invite original, theoretically or empirically validated submissions addressing all areas of software product lines research (see thehref="https://2025.splc.net/call-for-research-papers/" - call
for a list of topics). 
 href="https://2025.splc.net/call-for-papers/call-for-research-papers/#callforartifacts" - Call for Research Paper Artifacts
: Authors of accepted and conditionally accepted research papers are invited to submit the artifacts associated with the paper for evaluation. 
 href="https://2025.splc.net/call-for-industry-papers-industrial-systems-and-software-product-lines-in-practice/" - Call for Industrial Systems and Software Product Lines Papers
: We invite submission of papers presenting challenges, innovations and solutions to concrete industrial applications of software and product line engineering methodologies and tools. 
 href="https://2025.splc.net/call-for-challenges-and-solutions/" - Call for Challenges and Solutions Papers
: We highly encourage community members to provide concrete sets of case studies and problems that showcase SPL-related challenges. First, there will be a call for cases where researchers or practitioners are encouraged to contribute a concrete case study. Then, after the accepted case studies are published, there will be a call for solutions. Both accepted case descriptions and solutions will be included in the conference proceedings.href="https://2025.splc.net/call-for-journal-first-track/" - Call for Journal First Papers
: Authors of journal-first papers are invited to submit their publications to present their work at SPLC. This is an opportunity to speak directly to the community and offer SPLC attendees a richer set of presentations.
