 Introduction 
 Ubiquitous sensors, devices, networks and information are paving the way towards a smart world in which computational intelligence is distributed throughout the physical environment to provide reliable and relevant services to people. This ubiquitous intelligence will change the computing landscape because it will enable new breeds of applications and systems to be developed and the realm of computing possibilities will be significantly extended. By enhancing everyday objects with intelligence many tasks and processes could be simplified, more efficient and more enjoyable. Ubiquitous computing is to create such intelligent/smart environments, services and applications. 
  
 Research on ubiquitous intelligence is an exciting field covering many disciplines. A series of grand challenges exist to move from the current computing services to the ubiquitous intelligent/smart things. UIC 2024 is the next edition of the successful series, previously held as UIC 2023 in Portsmouth UK, UIC 2022 in Haikou China, UIC 2021 in Atlanta USA, UIC 2020 Melbourne AU, UIC 2019 Leicester UK, UIC 2018 Guangzhou China, UIC 2017 San Jose USA, UIC 2016 Toulouse France, UIC 2015 Beijing China, UIC 2014 Bali Indonesia, UIC 2013 Vietri sul Mare Italy, UIC 2012 Fukuoka Japan, UIC 2011 Banff Canada, UIC 2010 Xi'an China, UIC 2009 Brisbane Australia, UIC 2008 Oslo Norway, UIC 2007 Hong Kong, UIC 2006 Wuhan China, UIC 2005 Nagasaki Japan, and UIC 2004 Taipei.
