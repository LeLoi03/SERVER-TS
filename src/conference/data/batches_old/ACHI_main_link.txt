 ACHI 2025: Call for Papers 
 Onsite and Online Options: In order to accommodate various situations, we are offering the option for either physical presence or virtual participation (pdf slides or pre-recorded videos). 
 The Eighteenth International Conference on Advances in Computer-Human Interaction,ACHI 2025, was proposed as a result of a paradigm shift in the most recent achievements and future trends in human interactions with increasingly complex systems. Adaptive and knowledge-based user interfaces, universal accessibility, human-robot interaction, agent-driven human computer interaction, and sharable mobile devices are a few of these trends.ACHI 2025also brings a suite of specific domain applications, such as gaming, e-learning, social, medicine, teleconferencing and engineering. 
 ACHI 2025 continuesa series of events targeting traditional and advanced paradigms for computer-human interaction in multi-technology environments. The conference covers also fundamentals on interfaces and models, and highlights new challenging industrial applications and research topics. 
 We solicit both academic, research, and industrial contributions. We welcome technical papers presenting research and practical results, position papers addressing the pros and cons of specific proposals, such as those being discussed in the standard fora or in industry consortia, survey papers addressing the key problems and solutions on any of the above topics short papers on work in progress, and panel proposals. 
 Industrial presentations are not subject to the format and content constraints of regular submissions. We expect short and long presentations that express industrial position and status. 
 Tutorials on specific related topics and panels on challenging areas are encouraged. 
 The topics suggested by the conference can be discussed in term of concepts, state of the art, research, standards, implementations, running experiments, applications, and industrial case studies. Authors are invited to submit complete unpublished papers, which are not under review in any other conference or journal in the following, but not limited to, topic areas. 
 All topics and submission formats are open to both research and industry contributions.
