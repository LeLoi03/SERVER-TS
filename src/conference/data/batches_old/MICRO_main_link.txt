 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture® 
 TheIEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture®is the premier forum for presenting, discussing, and debating innovative microarchitecture ideas and techniques for advanced computing and communication systems. This symposium brings together researchers in fields related to microarchitecture, compilers, chips, and systems for technical exchange on traditional microarchitecture topics and emerging research areas. The MICRO community has enjoyed a close interaction between academic researchers and industrial designers. 
 MICRO-58: October 18–22 in Seoul, South Korea

 The MICRO Steering Committee has unanimously agreed to allow general chairs (and the rest of the organizing commitee) to submit papers to the conference they are organizing. The rationale for explicitly allowing general chair(s) to submit is that they do not participate in the paper selection process, nor are they involved in the program chair and program committee selection process.

 Important Dates 
 Abstract Deadline: | April 4, 2025 at 11:59 PMEDT 
 Full Paper Deadline: | April 11, 2025 at 11:59 PMEDT 
 Rebuttal/Revision: | June 9-21, 2025 
 Author Notification: | July 14, 2025 
 We invite original paper submissions related to (but not limited to) the following topics: 
 Microarchitectural, architectural, compiler, and hybrid techniques for improving system performance, power, energy-efficiency, security, cost, complexity, programmer productivity, predictability, quality of service, reliability, dependability, scalability, sustainability 
 Processor, memory, and storage architectures 
 Multicore and multiprocessor systems 
 Instruction-, thread-, and data-level parallelism 
 Prediction and Speculation 
 Memory Hierarchy 
 Cloud and datacenter-scale computing 
 IoT, mobile, and embedded architecture 
 Interconnection network, router, and network interface architecture 
 Accelerator-based, application-specific, and reconfigurable architectures 
 Architectural support for programming languages, compilation, software development, security and privacy, virtualization 
 Architectures for emerging technologies and applications 
 Architectural support for non-volatile/persistent memory 
 Quantum computing 
 In-/near-memory or in-/near-storage processing 
 Approximate computing and architectural support for approximation 
 Effects of circuits and technology on architecture 
 Architecture modeling and simulation methodologies

 Submissions should follow the guidelines and formatting rules specified on the conference website. Papers that violate these guidelines and rules may be returned to author(s) without review. Papers will go through a rigorous peer-review process. All accepted papers will be presented at the conference. 
 The Program Chair(s) are responsible for the paper selection process and do not submit papers to avoid potential bias. Program Committee members and the Organizing Committee including the General Chair(s), are allowed to submit papers because of double-blind reviewing and conflict-of-interest declaration and enforcement. The rationale for explicitly allowing General Chair(s) to submit is that they do not participate in the paper selection process, nor are they involved in the Program Chair and Program Committee selection process.
