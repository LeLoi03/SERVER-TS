 The International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks (EWSN) is a highly selective single-track international conference focusing on the latest research in embedded systems and wireless networking and their role as key enablers for visionary scenarios such as the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. 
  
 The TPC encourages new platforms and software systems that enable sensing, communication, computation, and other embedded applications. Building on the past 21 years of success, EWSN 2025 will be held in Leuven, Belgium, hosted by KU Leuven, one of Europe's oldest and most esteemed universities. 
 While the conference welcomes all papers within the scope described above, this year’s edition of EWSN will also highlight afeature topicin Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). AIoT represents the convergence of two cutting-edge fields, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT), leading to groundbreaking innovations across various sectors. The conference will seek contributions in this general area and feature keynote speakers with this focus. 
 Important dates 
 EWSN 2025 will have two submission deadlines, one in the winter and one in the spring.

 EWSN targets new platforms and software systems that enable sensing, communication, computation, and other embedded applications. While the conference welcomes all papers within this scope, this year’s edition will also highlight afeature topicin Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). AIoT represents the convergence of two cutting-edge fields, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things (IoT), leading to groundbreaking innovations across various sectors. The conference will seek contributions in this general area and feature keynote speakers with this focus. 
  
 Specific topics for the conference include (but are not exclusively limited to): 
 AI-operated wireless sensing, actuation, and control systems 
 Applications and opportunities for networked embedded systems in developing countries 
 Applications of wireless embedded networks in various domains: health, automation, manufacturing, transportation, etc. 
 Architectures and infrastructures for edge-cloud solutions that integrate networked embedded systems 
 Communication and networking for wireless and embedded systems 
 Computing architectures for networked embedded systems 
 Dependability in wireless systems, including reliability, availability, safety, and real-time guarantees 
 Edge/embedded intelligence paradigms, models, and techniques for networked embedded systems 
 Foundation models and generative AI for networked embedded systems 
 TinyML and on-device AI for networked embedded systems 
 Empirical studies, measurement, validation, deployment, and experience reports 
 Human-centric interaction with wireless and embedded systems 
 Localization and context-awareness for embedded wireless systems and networks 
 Modeling, simulation, and measurement tools for wireless systems and applications 
 Neuromorphic computing 
 Next-generation wireless networks, including 6G 
 New communication techniques for embedded systems (Wi-Fi HaLow, NearLink, etc.) 
 Operating systems, middleware, and services for networked embedded systems 
 Privacy and security in networked embedded systems and applications 
 Processing, storage, and management of data in embedded wireless networks 
 Sustainable applications of networked embedded systems (low-power operation, energy harvesting, etc.) 
 Embedded systems for joint sensing and communication with mmwave, Terahertz, Wi-Fi, visible light, etc. 
 Important dates 
 EWSN 2025 will have two submission deadlines, one in the winter and one in the spring. 
 Submission Details 
 Any paper submitted to EWSN2025must be original (i.e., not previously published) and should not have been published, accepted for publication, or be under review by any other venue (including other conferences, workshops, or journals). All submissions within the scope of EWSN are equally welcome, and all submissions will be evaluated based on the same criteria. 
  
 The conference will accept two types of papers – Full Papers (max 12 pages) and Short Papers (max 6 pages). Short papers are intended to present preliminary research results or advocate for new research directions; their titlesshouldbe prepended with “Vision paper: / Position paper: / WiP paper”when they are submitted for review as well as in the final proceedings. Authors should carefully consider the distinction between Full Papers and Short Papers; papers submitted in one category will not be considered in the other category. 
  
 EWSN 2025will use a double-anonymous review policy during the paper review process. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper. 
  
 Only PC chairs will know the identity of the authors and be able to interact with them during the review process, should the need arise. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed. To promote early dissemination, submission to arXiv (or similar) is allowed, provided cross-citations are not made. I.e., 
  
 You MAY post a version of your paper on arxiv that lists the names of authors. 
 You MAY NOT reference the arxiv version of your paper from the paper submitted for review at EWSN (this is one half of the cross-citation restriction). 
 You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN paper in the arxiv paper (this is the other half of the cross-citation restriction). 
 You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN paper in any other papers you submit for review at other conferences. 
 Once your paper is accepted, you MAY reference your EWSN paper (you can use "accepted, to appear" until the conference actually happens). 
  
 Submissionsarevia HotCRP:href="https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/" - https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/
 
 Decisions will be: accept, reject, or one-shot revision; papers receiving a “one-shot revision” for the winter deadline will be invited to submit a revised paper by the summer deadline. 
  
 Authors of papers rejected in the winter cycle may submit a revised paper in the summer cycle along with a cover letter explaining how/why the new revision addresses all the concerns raised by the reviewers. Should the program chairs deem this revision to be sufficient, the paper will be considered as a new submission for the summer cycle. Papers submitted to the summer deadline that are deemed by the program chairs to be too similar to a paper rejected from the winter review cycle will be returned without review. 
  
 Pages must use 8.5″ x 11″ (letter) two-column format, using 10-point type on 11-point leading, with a maximum text block of 7″ wide x 9″ deep with an inter-column spacing of .25″. Submissions with a page size of 11.7 x 8.3 ” (297 x 210 mm / A4) will not be accepted. The page limits include figures, tables, and references. Authors may use theEWSN 2025templateadapted from theACM templates for convenience(on Overleaf here). 
  
 All accepted papers will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library, SCOPUS, and other prominent digital libraries.
