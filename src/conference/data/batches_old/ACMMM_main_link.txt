 Call for Regular Papers 
 ACM Multimedia is the premier conference in multimedia, a research field that discusses emerging computing methods from a perspective in which each medium — e.g. images, text, audio — is a strong component of the complete, integrated exchange of information. The multimedia community has a tradition of being able to handle big data, has been a pioneer in large-scale evaluations and dataset creations, and is uniquely angled towards novel applications and cutting-edge industrial challenges. As such the conference openly embraces new intellectual angles from both industry as well as academia and welcomes submissions from related fields, such as data science, HCI, and signal processing. 
 ACM Multimedia 2025 calls for research papers presenting novel theoretical and algorithmic solutions to address problems across multimedia and related application fields. The conference also calls for papers presenting novel, thought-provoking ideas, and promising (preliminary) results in realising these ideas, especially surrounding multimodal AI, such as multi-agent, real-time human and machine intelligence working collaboratively. The conference invites papers in five major themes of multimedia: Generative AI, Engagement, Experience, Systems and Understanding, as describedhref="https://acmmm2025.org/research-topics/" - here
. 
 The conference invites research papers of varying lengths from 6 to 8 pages, plus additional pages for the reference pages; i.e., the reference page(s) are not counted towards the page limit of 6 to 8 pages. Please note that there is no longer a distinction between long and short papers, but the authors may themselves decide on the appropriate length of the paper. All papers will undergo the same review process and review period. 
 Submission Deadlines 
 Abstract submission: 04.04.2025 
 Regular paper submission: 11.04.2025(including supplementary materials, if applicable) 
 Please note: The submission deadline is at 23:59 of the stated deadline date Anywhere on Earth. See the full list ofhref="https://acmmm2025.org/important-dates/" - Important Dates
. 
 Submission Instructions 
 Submit yourhref="https://openreview.net/group?id=acmmm.org/ACMMM/2025/Conference" - Regular Paper via OpenReview
. 
 Submission system: 
 ACM MM’25 uses OpenReview for paper submission and peer review. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period. 
 All listed authors must have an up-to-dateOpenReview profile. The following page contains information onhow to createan OpenReview profile. Note OpenReview’s moderation policy for newly created profiles: 
 New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks. 
 New profiles created with an institutional email will (normally) be activated automatically. 
 The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflicts of interest and paper matching. An incomplete OpenReview profile of any co-author is sufficient ground for desk rejection. 
 To be considered complete, each author profile must be properly attributed with the following mandatory fields: current and past institutional affiliation (going back at least 5 years), homepage, DBLP (if there is prior publication), ORCID, Advisors and Recent Publications (if any). In addition, other fields such as Google Scholar, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar, Advisees and Other Relations should be entered wherever applicable. 
 Please note that we may ask any author to also serve as a reviewer. Authors who are also serving as reviewers will not be able to see the reviews on their own paper until they complete the reviews assigned to them in a proper and timely manner. 
 For any question or inquiry, please contact <href="mailto:tpc@acmmm2025.org" - tpc@acmmm2025.org

 Multimedia/multimodality Policy for Paper Submissions 
 As the volume of submissions to the MM conference continues to grow annually, the SIGMM community seeks to distinguish itself from other communities such as NeurIPS, CVPR, and ECCV. Our focus lies in promoting research that is inherently multimedia or multimodal in nature. While papers that involve unimedia/unimodal processing will not necessarily be rejected, papers that make multimedia/multimodal research contributions will be preferred for publication in the conference proceedings.Out-of-scope submissions may be desk-rejected. 
 Paper Format 
 Submitted papers (.pdf format) must use the ACM Article Template (https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Please remember to add Concepts and Keywords. Please use the template in traditional double-column format to prepare your submissions. For example, word users should use Word Interim Template, and LaTeX users should use sample-sigconf-authordraft template. When using sample-sigconf-authordraft template, for submission and review of manuscript you could use the following documentclass command instead of the example provided in the template:\documentclass[sigconf, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart} 
 Please ensure that you submit your papers subscribing to this format for full consideration during the review process. 
 Policy on Authorship and Generative AI Tools 
 Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. If generative AI language tools generate inappropriate language, plagiarized content, errors, mistakes, incorrect references, or misleading content, and that output is included in scientific works, author(s) will take full responsibility for the same. For details and more polices, please see here. 
 Length 
 Submitted papers may consist of up to 8 pages. Up to two additional pages may be added for references. The reference pages must only contain references. Overlength papers will be rejected without review. Optionally, you may upload supplementary material that complements your submission (50Mb limit). 
 All the content other than that in the main paper should be written in the separate supplementary material. We do not allow appendix that follow right after the main paper in the main submission file. 
 Blinding 
 Paper submissions must conform with the “double-blind” review policy. This means that the authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the names of the authors. Please prepare your paper in a way that preserves anonymity of the authors. For reviewer assignment, the technical program chairs may employ local LLM instances or similar technologies to process your submissions. No information will be shared with third parties. 
 Do not put the authors’ names under the title. 
 Avoid using phrases such as “our previous work” when referring to earlier publications by the authors. 
 Remove information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs). 
 Check supplemental material (e.g., titles in the video clips, or supplementary documents) for information that may identify the authors’ identities. 
 Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors. 
 Papers without appropriate blinding will be rejected without review. 
 Originality 
 Papers submitted to ACM Multimedia must be the original work of the authors. The may not be simultaneously under review elsewhere. Publications that have been peer-reviewed and have appeared at other conferences or workshops may not be submitted to ACM Multimedia (see also the arXiv/Archive policy below). Authors should be aware that ACM has a strict policy with regard to plagiarism and self-plagiarism (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism). The authors’ prior work must be cited appropriately. 
 Author List 
 Please ensure that you submit your papers with the full and final list of authors in the correct order.The author list registered for each submission is not allowed to change in any way after the abstract submission deadline, 04 April, 2025(Note that this rule regards the identity of authors, e.g., typos are correctable).-Update 04 Apr- 
 Following internal discussions, authors are permitted to modify the author list associated with their submission until the full paper deadline on 11 April 2025. However, such changes should be minimal and are strongly discouraged unless absolutely necessary, in order to maintain consistency and avoid confusion during the review process. 
 Paper Title 
 As per MM Policy, paper titles should remain the same between the camera-ready version and submission. Changing the title and abstract of a submission is possible until the final regular paper deadline, 11 April, 2025, although it is advised against making substantial changes. 
 Proofreading 
 Please proofread your submission carefully. It is essential that the language used in the paper is clear and correct so that it is easily understandable. (Either US English or UK English spelling conventions are acceptable.) 
 ArXiv/Archive Policy 
 In accordance with ACM guidelines, all SIGMM-sponsored conferences adhere to the following policy regarding arXiv papers: 
 We define a publication as a written piece documenting scientific work that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, has been accepted.Documentation of scientific work that is published in a not-for-profit archive without any form of peer-review (departmental Technical Report, arXiv.org, etc.) is not considered a publication.However, this definition of publication does include peer-reviewed workshop papers, even if they do not appear in formal proceedings. Any submission to ACM Multimedia must not have substantial overlap with prior publications or other work currently undergoing peer review anywhere.Note that documents published on website archives are subject to change. Citing such documents is discouraged. Furthermore, ACM Multimedia will review the documents formally submitted and any additional information in a web archive version will not affect the review. 
 Rebuttal Policies 
 After receiving the reviews, the authors may optionally submit a rebuttal to address the reviewers’ comments. The rebuttal is limited to a One page PDF file using the rebuttal template. Responses longer than one page will simply not be reviewed. This includes responses where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those specified by the style guide (deleting the title to get some space is acceptable). 
 The rebuttal must maintain anonymity. It cannot include links to external material such as code, videos, etc. 
 Authors may optionally contact the Author’s Advocate, whose role is to listen to the authors, and to help them if reviews are clearly below average quality. The Author’s Advocate operates independently from the Technical Program Committee.
