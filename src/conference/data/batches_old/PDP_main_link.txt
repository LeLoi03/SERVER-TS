The PDP conference 
 PDP stands as a premier European and international conference that comprehensively addresses all facets ofparallelanddistributedprocessing. Encompassing a spectrum from foundational theory to practical implementation, it spans systems of all scales—from small configurations to the largest infrastructures. PDP addresses fundamental computational challenges alongside robust applications and delves into architecture, compiler, language, interface design and deployment, tools, support infrastructures, and performance optimization. 
 Parallel, Distributed, and Network-Based Processing fields have evolved significantly, marked by the emergence of novel architectures and groundbreaking applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a major application area, leveraging parallel and distributed technologies to enhance computational efficiency and enable sophisticated AI models. This progress emphasizes the dynamic fusion of parallel and distributed technologies with other rapidly advancing domains. In evaluating these cutting-edge developments, it is imperative to highlight the latest research achievements in established areas of parallel and distributed computing, drawing insights from 
 both industrial and academic perspectives. 
 The 2025 PDP Conference will offer a high-quality program featuring research papers, special sessions, and stimulating keynote speakers. 
  
 Proceedings of the conference will be published byConference Publishing Servicesand submitted for indexing in Scopus.
