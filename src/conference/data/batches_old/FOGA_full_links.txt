 18th ACM/SIGEVO Conference on Foundations of Genetic Algorithms 
 FOGA XVIII, Aug 27 – 29, 2025, Leiden, The Netherlands 
 FOGA 2025 is a conference organized by ACM/SIGEVO and hosted by the Leiden Institute of Computer Science (LIACS) in Leiden, The Netherlands. The conference will this year take place on three days (Wed – Fri) 
 Call for Papers 
 The FOGA series aims at advancing our understanding of the working principles behind evolutionary algorithms and related randomized search heuristics, such as local search algorithms, differential evolution, ant colony optimization, particle swarm optimization, artificial immune systems, simulated annealing, and other Monte Carlo methods for search and optimization. Connections to related areas, such as Bayesian optimization and direct search, are of interest as well. FOGA is the premier event to discuss advances on the theoretical foundations of these algorithms, tools needed to analyze them, and different aspects of comparing algorithms’ performance. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Run time analysis 
 Mathematical tools suitable for the analysis of search heuristics 
 Fitness landscapes and problem difficulty 
 (On- and offline) configuration and selection of algorithms, heuristics, operators, and parameters 
 Stochastic and dynamic environments, noisy evaluations 
 Constrained optimization 
 Problem representation 
 Complexity theory for search heuristics 
 Multi-objective optimization 
 Benchmarking aspects, including performance measures, the selection of meaningful benchmark problems, and statistical aspects 
 Connection between black-box optimization and machine learning 
 Submissions covering the entire spectrum of work, ranging from rigorously derived mathematical results to carefully crafted empirical studies, are invited.

 The front matter of each GECCO proceeding 
 Note 
 This table provides statistics of two-page poster papers, not full papers. Unlike other conferences in the field of evolutionary computation (e.g., CEC, EMO, and Evo*), poster papers and full papers are published individually in GECCO. While full papers are published in the main volume, poster papers are published in the companion volume (dblp). 
 It is not obvious how to calculate the acceptance rates of GECCO poster papers. I calculated the acceptance rate for each year as follows: (x + y) / z, where x is the number of full paper acceptances, y is the number of poster paper acceptances, and z is the number of submissions. I believe that the acceptance rate obtained in this way is inexact, but a good approximation.
