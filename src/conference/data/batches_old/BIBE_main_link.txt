Participation GuidelinesWelcome to BIBE 2025! 
 With the advancement of science and technology, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics have been increasingly significant and exhibiting broad application prospects. The integration and synergistic development of the two fields not only provide new opportunities for medical research and clinical applications, but also open new possibilities in the fields of personalized medicine, disease prediction and treatment, while promoting the wide application of genomics, proteomics, medical image processing, and biosensors. 
 BIBE conference series focuses on the fields of bioinformatics and biomedical engineering, aiming to provide a platform for exchanging and sharing the latest research, technological innovations, and theoretical developments, and to promote the development of the fields. The BIBE conference has attracted more than 500 delegates from China, the United States, Japan, Russia, and other countries and regions since 2016. All accepted articles of the previous conferences have gone through rigorous peer review and completed EI, Scopus inclusion. 
 The 8th International Conference on Biological Information and Biomedical Engineering (BIBE 2025),will be held duringAugust 11-13, 2025inGuiyang, China. It is organized by the Tianjin University of Science and Technology, and co-organized by School of Life Science and Technology, Xidian University. On behalf of the organizing committee of BIBE, we would like to invite experts, scholars, and researchers in related fields to contribute and participate in the conference.
