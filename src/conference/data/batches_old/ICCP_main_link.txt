 WELCOME TO 2025 IEEE ICCP 
 You are cordially invited to participate to the 2025 IEEE 21th International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing (ICCP 2025), to be held October 16-18, 2025 in Cluj-Napoca, Romania. 
 At 2024 IEEE ICCP the acceptance rate of papers was of 59%. The accepted papers are available in IEEE Xplore digital library and will be submitted to be indexed in Web Of Science and Scopus. 
 The goal of the 2025 IEEE 21st International Conference on Intelligent Computer Communication and Processing is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners working towards improving the power of both communication and processing software using the most advanced intelligent methods available today. 
  
 The growing toolkit of AI - computer vision, natural conversation, and machines that learn over time—has the potential to enhance almost the entire economic and social life. The driving forces of this development are the increased volumes of data, the continuously growing of communication, processing, storage capabilities and the new machine learning techniques especially deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms. 
  
 The fast development of artificial intelligence and its applications implies more advanced but also more secure artifacts, which require the intelligent computer communication and processing technologies to improve at a high pace. 
 Technical tracks include, but are not limited to: 
 Intelligent Systems: 
 Agent and Multi-agent based Systems; Knowledge Representation; Reasoning and Engineering; Ontology Modeling and Mediation; Natural Language Processing and Understanding; Web and Knowledge-based Information Systems; Multidisciplinary Topics and Applications. 
  
 Deep Learning: 
 CNN; GNN, Transformers; Theoretical contributions to Supervised Learning, Semi-supervised Learning, Self-supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning; Neuro-symbolic Processing; Continual Learning; Synthetic Data based Learning; Domain Adaptation; Explainable AI. 
  
 Deep Learning Based Computer Vision: 
 Image Processing; Image Enhancement; Feature extraction; Semantic, Instance and Panoptic Segmentation; Optical Flow; Stereovision and 3D Reconstruction; Monocular Depth Estimation; Motion; 2D and 3D Object Detection, 3D Point Cloud Processing, Tracking and Recognition; Multi-sensor and temporal fusion; Environment Representation; Risk Assessment. 
 Perception Applications: 
 Video-based Question Answering, Driving Assistance Applications; Autonomous Vehicles; Autonomous Drones; Robotic Applications; Biomedical Image Analysis. 
  
 Intelligent Distributed Computing and Networking: 
 Cloud Computing, Context Aware; Autonomic Computing; Resource Coordination and Management; Quality of Service; Queuing Network Models; Pervasive Computing; Grid Computing; Fault Tolerance; Cooperative Applications.
