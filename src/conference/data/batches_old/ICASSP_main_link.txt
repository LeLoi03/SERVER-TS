 Welcome Message 
 Namaste! 
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee, our partners and volunteers, it is our pleasure to invite you to the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025), which will take place in Hyderabad, India from April 06 to April 11, 2025. The 2025 edition of the flagship conference of the IEEE Signal Processing Society will be an in-person event held at the Hyderabad International Convention Centre. 
 This will be the first time an ICASSP is held in India and also marks the 50thanniversary of ICASSP. We are preparing a memorable event of high technical quality, many novel scientific activities, excellent networking opportunities, enjoyable social events, and unforgettable touristic possibilities. ICASSP’s main theme this year will be “Celebrating Signal Processing.” 
 Hyderabad is the capital of the Telangana state in southern India and has a unique legacy of rich multicultural history. Hyderabad’s historic sites include the Golconda Fort, a former diamond-trading centre that was once the capital of the Qutb Shahi dynasty. The Charminar, a 16th-century monument whose 4 arches support towering minarets, is an old city landmark. A major centre for the technology industry, it is home to most of the global technology giants. The city is also known for its unique delightful cuisine with the most famous Hyderabad biryani! 
 We look forward to welcoming you to this Celebration of Signal Processing and its immense contributions to and possibilities for enhancing human lives through technological advances at ICASSP 2025 in Hyderabad, India.

 SP Society Journal Paper Presentations: 
 Authors of papers published or accepted in IEEE SPS journals may present their work at ICASSP 2025 in appropriate tracks. These papers will not be re- reviewed or included in the proceedings. In addition, the IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing (OJSP) will provide a special track for longer submissions with the same processing timeline as ICASSP. Accepted papers will bepublished in OJSP and presented at the conference but will not be included in the conference proceedings. 
 Present an accepted SPS journal paper: 
 Authors who have published a paper in a Signal Processing Society Journal within the last year may submit an SPS Journal Paper Presentation Request to present the paper at the conference. Authors of papers that fit within the scope of the conference will receive an acceptance letter, and upon registration will receive an invoice and invitation letter to apply for internal funding and/or travel visa to attend and present the paper. Where possible, journal papers presented at the conference will be included in the conference proceedings provided to conference attendees, by downloading the original paper from IEEE Xplore® to include on conference proceedings for attendees. Journal papers will not be included in the conference proceedings published in IEEE Xplore. Eligibility requirements are outlined below: 
 Paper must have been published or accepted for publication in an SPS journal within the 12- month period preceding the conference paper notification of acceptance date (i.e. the SPS Journal Presentation Request submission deadline); 
 Paper topic should be aligned with the conference’s technical program, and authors should select relevant EDICS from the conference’s list; 
 Authors of accepted journal papers must meet the same registration requirements as all authors, including the total number of papers that can be covered by a single registration.
