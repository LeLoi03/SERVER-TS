 Modal Logic, originally conceived as the logic of necessity and possibility, has developed into a powerful mathematical discipline that deals with (restricted) description languages for talking about various kinds of relational structures. 
 Advances in Modal Logicis a bi-annual internationalhref="conferences/" - conference
andbook seriesin Modal Logic. The aim of the conference series is to report on important new developments in pure and applied modal logic, and to do so at varying locations throughout the world. The book series is based on the conferences. Please consult thebackgroundpages for further details.
