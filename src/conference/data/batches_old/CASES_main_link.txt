 CASES: International Conference on Compilers, Architectures, and Synthesis for Embedded Systems 
 CASES is a premier forum where researchers, developers and practitioners exchange information on the latest advances in compilers and architectures for high-performance, low-power embedded systems. The conference has a long tradition of showcasing leading edge research in embedded processor, memory, interconnect, storage architectures and related compiler techniques targeting performance, power, predictability, security, reliability issues for both traditional and emerging application domains. In addition, we invite innovative papers that address design, synthesis, and optimization challenges in heterogeneous and accelerator-rich architectures.

CASES is a premier forum, where researchers, developers, and practitioners exchange information on the latest advances in design, optimization, validation, and applications of embedded systems, Internet of Things (IoT), and the emergent trend of integrating Artificial Intelligence into IoT (AIoT). The conference has a long tradition of showcasing cutting-edge research in these broad areas, covering topics including, but not limited to, hardware-software co-design and co-validation, edge AI, embedded architecture, compilers for heterogeneous systems, memory/storage technology, security/reliability, energy-efficiency of embedded systems, and domain-specific hardware accelerators. 
 CASES 2025 solicits the submission of original research articles for full-length research papers that will be published in the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems. CASES solicits submissions on the following topics divided into five technical tracks. Page length and formatting details are available on thehref="https://esweek.org/author-information/" - author information page
