 High-Level Parallel Programming 
 and Applications 
 17th International Symposium, Pisa, Italy 
 4-5 July 2024 
 The 17th HLPP Symposium proposes a two-day meeting at theComputer Science Department of the University of Pisain Italy. It focuses on high-level parallel programming of multi-/many-core platforms, heterogeneous compute clusters, highly parallel and distributed infrastructures. 
 As for previous editions, HLPP serves as a forum for researchers and engineers in parallel computing, proposing an excellent opportunity for scientists to present their latest ideas and findings in this challenging and ever-changing research field. We especially encouraged innovative approaches in parallel programming models and applications, high-level parallel languages, compilers, runtime systems, and programming tools for all classes of parallel machines.
