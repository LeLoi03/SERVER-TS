About the Conference 
 Motivation 
 Information modelling is becoming increasingly important for researchers, designers, and users of information systems with artificial intelligence. The amount and complexity of information, the number of abstraction levels, and the size of databases and knowledge bases are continuously growing. Conceptual modelling is one of the sub-areas of information modelling and AI modelling. The aim of this conference is to bring together experts from different areas of computer science, AI and other disciplines who have a common interest in understanding and solving problems on information modelling and knowledge bases, as well as applying the results of research to practice. We also aim to recognize and study new areas of Information modelling, knowledge bases and AI to which more attention should be paid. Philosophy and logic, cognitive science, knowledge management, linguistics and cyber-physical modelling are relevant areas, too. The conference will have three categories of presentations, i.e. full papers, short papers and position papers. 
 Background 
 The series of European – Japanese Conferences on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases (EJC) originally started as a cooperation initiative between Japan and Finland in 1988 as a continuum to the series of Scandinavian conferences since 1982. The practical operations were then organized by professor Ohsuga in Japan and professors Hannu and Hannu Jaakkola in Finland. The geographical scope was expanded to cover first Europe and further other countries. 
 Working principles 
 Facilitates discussion, allows enough presentation time, and limits the number of participants (50) and papers (30). 
 Suggested topics include, but are not limited to: 
 1. Conceptual modelling:Modelling and specification languages; Domain-specific conceptual modelling; Concepts, concept theories and ontologies; Conceptual modelling of large and heterogeneous systems; Conceptual modelling of spatial, temporal and semantic data; Methods for developing, validating and communicating conceptual models. 
 2. Knowledge and information modelling and discovery:Knowledge discovery, knowledge representation and knowledge management; Advanced data mining and analysis methods; Conceptions of knowledge and information; Modelling information requirements; Intelligent information systems; Information recognition and information modelling. 
 3. Linguistic modelling:Models of HCI; Information delivery to users; Intelligent informal querying; Linguistic foundation of information and knowledge; Fuzzy linguistic models; Philosophical and linguistic foundations of conceptual models. 
 4. Cross-cultural communication and social computing:Cross-cultural support systems; Integration, evolution and migration of systems; Collaborative societies; Multicultural web-based software systems; Intercultural collaboration and support systems; Social computing, behavioral modelling and prediction. 
 5. Environmental modelling and engineering:Environmental information systems (architecture); Spatial, temporal and observational information systems; Large-scale environmental systems; Collaborative knowledge base systems; Agent concepts and conceptualization; Hazard prediction, prevention and steering systems. 
 6. Multimedia data modelling and systems:Modelling multimedia information and knowledge; Content-based multimedia data management; Content-based multimedia retrieval; Privacy and context enhancing technologies; Semantics and pragmatics of multimedia data; Metadata for multimedia information systems. 
 7. AI System Modelling:Cyber and Physical System Modelling; Image Processing; Natural Language Processing; Computer Vision; Biological Analysis; Responsible AI. 
 The total number of participants is limited to 50 (30 papers). We want to provide enough time for the presentations and discussions. The conference is an excellent forum for networking with the active research community on this important topic. The authors must present their paper at the conference. 
 All papers (full/short/position) accepted and presented in the conference are published in the conference preprint (e-book having ISSN / ISBN) by the local organizers (distributed in the conference) and after the conference in the final journal-paper publication. 
 After the conference, authors have the opportunity to improve their papers based on the feedback at the conference. The final publication is published in the Series “Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence” byIOS Press (Amsterdam). The books “Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases Vol. n” are edited by the Editing Committee. It has the right to propose obligatory improvements as a precondition to the publication. It has the right to withdraw papers that do not follow the given guidelines and technical style. In addition to IOS press publication, we have invitation to publish some papers inECTI-Transactions on Computer and Information Technology (ECTI-CIT). The papers are selected by the Editorial Board of the Journal. 
 In all editorial issues, please contact the editing committee.

 The 33rd European – Japanese Conference on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases was held at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science 
 The 33rd International European – Japanese Conference on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases - EJC 2023 was held in Maribor from Monday, 5 June, to Friday, 9 June 2023. 
 It was organised by the members of the Data Technologies Laboratory, Institute of Informatics from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The event was attended by 23 experts from Japan, Lithuania, Finland, Germany and the Czech Republic. 
 href="https://ejc2023.um.si/" - The conference
brought together experts from different areas of computer science and other disciplines who share a common understanding and problem-solving of information modelling and knowledge bases and the application of research results in practice. The conference programme was complemented by two invited speakers, József Györkös from the University of Maribor, who gave a lecture onOpen Science – a reality check within ATHENA European University, and Bernhard Thalheim from the Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, who gave a lecture onModelology – A New Scientific and Engineering Discipline: The Science and Practice of Models and Modelling. 
 The conference started with the 4thAsian-European Summer School of AI-5D Consortium, which focused on covering Global & Environmental AI in Nature and Society. The speakers from Japan, Indonesia, Thailand and Slovenia presented topics such as “AI System for Ocean Nature”, “AI System for Earthquake Density Measurement”, “AI-based Plastic Garbage Collection project” and “Fairness of AI”. The summer school was held in a hybrid style. 
 Participants also enjoyed a varied social programme with a visit to the Old Vine Museum, wine tasting, folklore performance, the Rogatec Open Air Museum, Olimje Monastery and Deer Ridge, and a guided tour of Maribor.
