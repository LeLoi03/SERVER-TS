About Embedded Systems Week (ESWEEK) 
Embedded Systems Week (ESWEEK) is the premier event covering all aspects of 
hardware and soŌware design for smart, intelligent, and connected compuƟng 
systems. By bringing together three leading conferences (ACM/IEEE CASES, 
CODES+ISSS, EMSOFT), one symposium (MEMOCODE), and several workshops 
and tutorials, ESWEEK allows aƩendees to benefit from a wide range of topics 
covering the state of the art in embedded systems research and development. 
One RegistraƟon, Three Conferences! 
Registered aƩendees can aƩend sessions in any of the ESWEEK conferences 
(ACM/IEEE  CASES,  CODES+ISSS,  EMSOFT).  Please  note  that  tutorials, 
symposium (MEMOCODE), and workshops may use separate registraƟon. 
 
 
 
ACM/IEEE CASES is a premier forum where researchers, 
developers and pracƟƟoners exchange informaƟon on the 
latest advances in compilers and architectures for high-
performance,  low-power  embedded  systems.  The 
conference has a long tradiƟon of showcasing leading 
edge  research  in  embedded  processor,  memory, 
interconnect, storage architectures and related compiler 
techniques targeƟng performance, power, predictability, 
security,  reliability  issues  for  both  tradiƟonal  and 
emerging applicaƟon domains. In addiƟon, we invite 
innovaƟve  papers  that  address  design,  synthesis,  and 
opƟmizaƟon  challenges  in  heterogeneous  and 
accelerator-rich 
architectures. 
 
 
 
International Conference 
on Embedded Software 
The ACM/IEEE InternaƟonal Conference on Embedded 
SoŌware  (EMSOFT)  brings  together  researchers  and 
developers from academia, industry, and government to 
advance  the  science,  engineering,  and  technology  of 
embedded soŌware development. Since 2001, EMSOFT 
has been the premier venue for cuƫng-edge research in 
the design and analysis of soŌware that interacts with 
physical  processes,  with  a  long-standing  tradiƟon  for 
results  on  cyber-physical  systems,  which  compose 
computaƟon, networking, and physical dynamics
. 
The   ACM/IEEE   InternaƟonal   Conference   on 
Hardware/SoŌware  Codesign  and  System  Synthesis 
(CODES+ISSS) is the premier event in system-level design, 
modeling,  analysis,  and  implementaƟon  of  modern 
embedded and cyber-physical systems, from system-level 
specificaƟon and opƟmizaƟon down to system synthesis 
of mulƟ-processor hardware/soŌware implementaƟons. 
The conference is a forum bringing together academic 
research and industrial pracƟce for all aspects related to 
system-level and hardware/soŌware co-design
. 
 
 
 
International Symposium on 
Formal Methods and Models 
for System Design 
 
MEMOCODE focuses on formal methods and models for 
developing  computer  systems  and  their  components. 
MEMOCODE’s objecƟve is to emphasize the importance of 
models and methodologies in correct system design and 
development. 
 
Journal-integrated Publication Model: All full papers accepted for the three conferences will be 
published in the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS)

Paper Process 
ESWEEK 2025 has two publicaƟon venues: Journal track and Late 
Breaking (LB) Result track. (1) Journal track papers, which are full-
length papers describing mature work, will be published in the 
ACM TransacƟons on Embedded CompuƟng Systems (TECS). (2) 
The LB Result track papers disseminate complete and mature 
works wriƩen in a condensed form (limited to 4 pages) and will 
be published in IEEE Embedded Systems LeƩers (ESL). These two 
venues  (full-length,  LB),  are  mutually  exclusive.  For  more 
informaƟon on the publishing process, please   refer   to 
http://www.esweek.org/author-information. 
Workshops, Tutorials, Special Sessions 
Call for Workshop Proposals 
ESWEEK 2025 will host several workshops on October 2-3 and is 
soliciƟng proposals for new and recurring workshops. Workshops 
can be half-day to two-day long. We invite you to submit workshop 
proposals on any topic related to the broad set of research and 
educaƟon. 
Call for Tutorial Proposals 
ESWEEK 2025 is looking for high-quality tutorials that will take 
place on Sunday, September 28, 2025. Tutorials on all topics 
related to embedded system design, analysis, and development 
are welcome. Tutorials can be either half/full-day, lecture-style 
or hands-on. 
Call for EducaƟon Proposals 
ESWEEK 2025 will host several educaƟon lectures virtually, and is 
soliciting proposals for such lectures. We invite you to submit 
educaƟon proposals on a topic related to this theme. 
Call for Special Session Proposals 
We invite you to submit special session proposals on any topic 
relevant to the broad areas of interest of ESWEEK. The special 
session should cover a topic that is contemporary, hot, and 
complementary to the regular sessions. The special session should 
be able to generate enthusiasm among the ESWEEK parƟcipants.
