 © Sergey Tinyakov via CanvaWelcome to the 15th European Congress on Menopause and Andropause 
  
 "Empowering Science and Healthcare" 
 Dear colleagues and friends, 
 It is a gratifying pleasure to welcome you to Valencia 2025 for the15th EMAS Congress, with the theme,“Empowering Science and Healthcare”. This congress is an outstanding opportunity to receive the latest news on women’s and men’s health in midlife and beyond. 
 Excellent science and clinical novelty have been the main determinants guiding the attractive programme created by the Scientific Committee. These two premises have led to the elaboration of a rich panel of sessions in which, in addition to the privilege of receiving the most advanced science from world leaders, will be added the stimulating discussion of debatable topics with key opinion leaders and educational opportunities related to clinical practice. 
 We want to thank the numerous actors who have joined the local organizing and the scientific committees to achieve the splendid offer of EMAS. The high-quality speakers from around the world, the many colleagues presenting their most recent data, affiliated scientific societies providing worldwide perspectives, collaborating companies, officers and members of the board, EMAS administrative resources and, of course, you, our EMAS Members and congress delegates, who are the main objective of the congress. 
 We hope you will have a profitable and enjoyable experience at EMAS 2025 in Valencia.
