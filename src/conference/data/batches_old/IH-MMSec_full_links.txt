13th ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security 
 ACM IH&MMSec 2025, San Jose, CA, June 18-20 
 The 2025 workshop will be held at San Jose, CA. 
 The ACM IH&MMSec workshop is one of the prime events in the area of multimedia security and attracts researchers from all over the world. 
 The workshop focuses on information-hiding topics, such as steganography, steganalysis, digital watermarking, anonymity, hard-to-intercept communications, and covert channels. It also covers a variety of multimedia security topics, including multimedia authentication, multimedia forensics, biometrics, and privacy. 
 The research presented at this workshop captures state-of-the-art work conducted in academic, industrial, and government institutions worldwide. Papers cover significant theoretical aspects of the field, as well as novel industrial and commercial applications of techniques and algorithms developed in the area.

 12th ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security (IH&MMSec'24) 
 href="/event/12th-acm-workshop-information-hiding-and-multimedia-security-ihmmsec24" - 12th ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security (IH&MMSec'24)
12th ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security (IH&MMSec'24)Call for papers: The IH&MMSec workshop has established its reputation as one of the premier outlets in the fields of information hiding and multimedia security. Paper submission deadline: February 16, 2024 
 For more than 20 years, the fields of Information Hiding and Multimedia Security (IH&MMSec) have allied advances of multiple disciplines, accumulating a substantial body of knowledge. The IH&MMSec workshop has established its reputation as one of the premier outlets for research in these and related areas. Continuing this tradition, the 2024 workshop edition solicits novel papers documenting research, industrial, or government practice. The event will be held at Parador de Baiona, a historic fortress with a spectacular view over the ocean, situated in the beautiful town of Baiona in Galicia (Spain). 
  
 For more information and updates, the conference website is:http://www.ihmmsec.org<http://www.ihmmsec.org/> 

List of Topics 
  
 Submitted papers should addresssecurity and privacy aspects in relation to multimedia host signals(including images, audios, videos, texts, network traffic, etc.): 
 Forensics and counter-forensics 
 Steganography and steganalysis 
 Covert and subliminal channels 
 Watermarking and fingerprinting 
 Networks and protocols 
 Anonymity and privacy 
 Biometrics 
 Deep fake analysis 
  
 This year acall for special sessionsis included. For details about the corresponding proposal procedure, please refer to the conference website. 

Submission Guidelines 
  
 All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome: 
 Short papers: | 4-6 pages, describing preliminary results, e.g. work in progress with limited test sets or just giving indications or tendencies... 
 Full papers: | 10–12 pages, describing general and detailed research contributions. Full papers are expected to back their key claims with strong evidence (such as mathematical proofs, statistical modelling, or extensive testing). 
  
 Technical papers submitted for IH&MMSec 2024 are to be written in English. 
 Authors are invited to submit either short papers (4-6 pages, including references, for preliminary yet interesting results) or full papers (10-12 pages, including references, with general and detailed research 
 contributions). Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are 
 simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference. Manuscripts must be properly anonymized for double-blind review. 
 The manuscript must be submitted via EasyChair at:https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ihmmsec24
