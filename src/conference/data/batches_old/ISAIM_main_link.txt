 ISAIM 2024 
 The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence. The series was started by Martin Golumbic, Peter L. Hammer and Frederick Hoffman in 1990, and the editorial board of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence serves as the permanent Advisory Committee. Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions.

 ABOUT THE SYMPOSIUM 
 The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM) is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). This is the eighteenth Symposium in the series, which is sponsored byAnnals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence. 
 We seek submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled lessons learned from the development of the application. Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day Symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions. 
 Work that will have been published as of January 2024 should not be submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the previously published work. However, the ISAIM web site proceedings are not archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review elsewhere at the time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM. 
 Authors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in an archival special volume of theAnnals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and unpublished to be considered for the special volume.
