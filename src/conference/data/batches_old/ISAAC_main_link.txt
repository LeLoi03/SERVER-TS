ISSAC 2025 
 The International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC) is the premier conference for research in symbolic computation and computer algebra. ISSAC 2025 will be the 50th meeting in the series, which started in 1966 and has been held annually since 1981. The conference presents a range of invited speakers, tutorials, short communications, software demonstrations and vendor exhibits with a center-piece of contributed research papers. 
  
 ISSAC 2025 will be held from July 28th to August 1st, 2025, at thehref="https://www.cimat.mx/" - Center for Research in Mathematics
    (CIMAT)
in Guanajuato, Mexico.

 Conference topics 
 All areas of computer algebra and symbolic computation are of interest at ISSAC 2025. These include, but are not limited to: 
 Algorithmic aspects: 
 Exact and symbolic linear, polynomial and differential algebra 
 Symbolic-numeric, homotopy, perturbation and series methods 
 Computational algebraic geometry, polynomial and semialgebraic optimization 
 Computational group theory and number theory, quantifier elimination and logic 
 Computer arithmetic 
 Summation, recurrence equations, integration, solution of ODEs & PDEs 
 Symbolic methods in other areas of pure and applied mathematics 
 Complexity of algebraic algorithms and algebraic complexity 
 Software aspects: 
 Design of symbolic computation packages and systems 
 Language design and type systems for symbolic computation 
 Data representation 
 Considerations for modern hardware 
 Algorithm implementation and performance tuning 
 Mathematical user interfaces 
 Use with systems such as digital libraries, courseware, simulation and optimization, automated theorem-proving, computer-aided design, and automatic differentiation. 
 Application aspects: 
 Applications that stretch the current limits of computer algebra algorithms or systems, use computer algebra in new areas or new ways, or apply it in situations with broad impact.

Submission Instructions 
 Regular Papers 
 ISSAC 2025 invites the submission of original research contributions to be considered for publication and presentation at the conference. Papers should not duplicate work published or submitted for consideration elsewhere. 
 Papers must be in English and should not exceed 8 pages in the ACM two-column style, found at: | http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template | which can be downloaded from: | https://portalparts.acm.org/hippo/latex_templates/acmart-primary.zip | . | However, 2 additional pages may be used for bibliographical references, and/or for experimental results (tables, figures), experimental data (e.g. input or output systems for a solver) and computer program code (library code, scripts, worksheets, Makefiles, etc.). The portion of the paper before these two additional pages must be self-contained. 
 Extended abstracts are not allowed. 
 At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper. 
 Submission is via EasyChair, at the web site | href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=issac2025" - https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=issac2025 | . 
 Software Presentations 
 The software presentations at ISSAC are opportunities to demonstrate and communicate about new implementations of algorithms in symbolic and algebraic computation. Of relevance are presentations for new software, new packages or new developments that present some originality or improved performance compared to the state of the art. 
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract in PDF format of no more than 4 pages. The abstracts will be reviewed by the software committee and relevant experts when needed. The review criteria are content, originality, style and relevance. The accepted software abstracts will be printed and distributed at the conference as well as published in an upcoming issue of the ACM SIGSAM Communications in Computer Algebra. 
 Poster Presentations 
 The poster session at ISSAC is a venue to announce early research results or ongoing projects that might not yet be complete. Posters reporting on recent work published or accepted or submitted elsewhere are also welcome (with original publications clearly referenced). The authors are encouraged to create their poster presentations on a single large A0 sheet. 
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract in PDF format of no more than 4 pages. The abstracts will be reviewed by the short communications committee and relevant experts when needed. The review criteria are content, originality, style and relevance. The accepted poster abstracts will be printed and distributed at the conference as well as published in an upcoming issue of the ACM SIGSAM Communications in Computer Algebra.
