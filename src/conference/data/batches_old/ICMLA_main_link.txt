Welcome to the ICMLA'25 Official Web Site 
  
 ICMLA'25 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to present their latest achievements and innovations in the area of machine learning (ML). 
 The conference provides a leading international forum for the dissemination of original research in ML, with emphasis on applications as well as novel algorithms and systems. Following the success of previous ICMLA conferences, the conference aims to attract researchers and application developers from a wide range of ML related areas, and the recent emergence of Big Data processing brings an urgent need for machine learning to address these new challenges. The conference will cover both machine learning theoretical research and its applications. Contributions describing machine learning techniques applied to real-world problems and interdisciplinary research involving machine learning, in fields like medicine, biology, industry, manufacturing, security, education, virtual environments, games, are especially encouraged. 
 Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xploreâ€™s scope and quality requirements. The conference is technically co-sponsored by IEEE. 
 It is planned that ICMLA'25 will be organized as in pre-pandemics time, with participants attending the conference in person, unless Covid rules will change towards the end of the year and this will not be possible.

 Call for Papers 
 ICMLA 2025 aims to bring together researchers and practitioners to present their latest achievements and innovations in the area of machine learning (ML). 
 The conference provides a leading international forum for the dissemination of original research in ML with emphasis on applications as well as novel algorithms and systems. Following the success of previous ICMLA conferences, the conference aims to attract researchers and application developers from a wide range of ML related areas, and the recent emergence of Big Data processing brings an urgent need for machine learning to address these new challenges. The conference will cover both machine learning theoretical research and its applications. Contributions describing machine learning techniques applied to real-world problems and interdisciplinary research involving machine learning, in fields like medicine, biology, industry, manufacturing, security, education, virtual environments,games, are especially encouraged. 
 Contributions describing applications of machine learning (ML)techniques to real-world problems, interdisciplinary research involving machine learning, experimental and/or theoretical studies yielding new insights into the design of ML systems, and papers describing development of new analytical frameworks that advance practical machine learning methods are especially encouraged. 
 The technical program will consist of, but is not limited to, the following topics of interest: 
 statistical learning 
 neural network learning 
 learning through fuzzy logic 
 learning through evolution (evolutionary algorithms) 
 reinforcement learning 
 multi-strategy learning 
 cooperative learning 
 planning and learning 
 multi-agent learning 
 online and incremental learning 
 scalability of learning algorithms 
 inductive learning 
 inductive logic programming 
 Bayesian networks 
 support vector machines 
 case-based reasoning 
 machine learning for bioinformatics and computational biology 
 multi-lingual knowledge acquisition and representation 
 grammatical inference 
 knowledge acquisition and learning 
 knowledge discovery in databases 
 knowledge intensive learning 
 knowledge representation and reasoning 
 machine learning and information retrieval 
 machine learning for web navigation and mining 
 learning through mobile data mining 
 text and multimedia mining through machine learning 
 distributed and parallel learning algorithms and applications 
 feature extraction and classification 
 theories and models for plausible reasoning 
 computational learning theory 
 cognitive modeling 
 deep and transfer learning 
 federated learning 
 machine learning on the edge 
 machine learning for computer vision 
 hybrid learning algorithms 
 Applications of machine learning in: 
 medicine, health, bioinformatics and systems biology 
 industrial and engineering applications 
 security applications 
 smart cities and autonomous driving 
 game playing and problem solving 
 intelligent virtual environments 
 economics, business and forecasting applications, etc. 
 The conference will include a number of interesting keynote plenary talks, which will be announced on the conference web site as arrangements are finalized. Previous invited speakers included numerous fellows of AMLA, AMIA, AAAS, AAAI, etc. 
 Paper Submission 
 High quality papers in all Machine Learning areas are solicited. Papers that present new directions in ML will receive careful reviews. Authors are expected to ensure that their final manuscripts are original and are not appearing in other publications. Paper should be limited to 8 pages and submitted in IEEE format (double column). Papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, originality, significance and clarity. All submissions will be handled electronically. Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, as a hardcopy. Authors of the accepted papers need to present their papers at the conference. A selected number of accepted papers will be invited for possible inclusion, in an expanded and revised form, in some journal special issues. 
 ICMLA'25 Best Paper Award and ICMLA'25 Best Poster Award will be conferred at the conference to the authors of the best research paper and best poster presentation, respectively, based on the reviewers and Programme Committee recommendations. 
 Detailed instructions for submitting papers can be found atHow to Submit 
 Important Dates: 
 The submission time is set to 11:59 PM - PT on the date specified. Try to submit early as the system might be busy around the due time. We will not be able to facilitate individual late submissions.
