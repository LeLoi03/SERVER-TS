 Submission Overview: 
 Please indicate in the title of your submission whether this is a regular paper or a brief announcement. All regular rejected papers will automatically be considered for brief announcements. Titles of regular papers that should not be considered for this option should mention “full paper only” after the title. Submissions must use the final ACM “acmsmall” format fromhttps://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. More details are athref="https://spaa.acm.org/submission-guidelines/" - https://spaa.acm.org/submission-guidelines/
. 
 Regular Papers: 
 A regular paper submission must report on original research that has not been previously or concurrently published. 
 Each paper should have no more than 20 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the acmart LaTeX class with acmsmall option). It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. 
 All necessary details to substantiate the main claims of the paper should be included either in the body of the paper or in a supplementary material. However, the reviewers are not obligated to read the supplementary material. 
 Brief Announcements: 
 Examples of good brief announcements include: work in progress, announcement of tools/libraries, challenge problems posted to the community, and corrections to earlier results. Brief announcements may also include smaller results of interest. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed six single-column pages for brief announcements excluding the bibliography. 
 Theory vs. Experiments 
 A submission naturally falls into one of the following three categories. 
 A.Theory (main contributions are theoretical) 
 B.Experiments (main contributions are experimental) 
 C.Theory and Experiments (main contributions are a mix of theory and experiments) 
 To help assign suitable reviewers, please indicate which category the submission belongs to during the submission process. 
 Double-Blind Policy: 
 SPAA 2025 will employ a lightweight double-blind review process. That means, the submission should omit authors’ names, affiliations, and contact information. In addition, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, the reference should be made in the third person. Any supplemental materials, if applicable, should also be anonymized. However, authors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of the paper as they normally would, such as submitting them to arXiv or giving talks on their research ideas. The reviewers will be asked to refrain from actively looking for the identity of the authors via web search. 
 Conflict of Interest Policy: 
 To ensure a fair and high-quality reviewing process we ask ALL authors of a submitted paper to register their conflicts with the PC members at the submission site. The following categories are considered as a conflict of interest: 
 Academic advisor or advisee (with no time limit) 
 Postdoctoral mentor or mentee (with no time limit) 
 Collaborators within the past three years, including a joint research or development project, a joint paper, or a funding relationship 
 Members of the same institution within the past 3 years 
 Family members or close friends 
 Someone involved in an alleged incident of harassment (not required that the incident be reported) 
 Anyone whose relationship with an author would prevent the reviewer from being objective in his/her assessment 
 Note that if the program chair has reason to doubt the validity of the claim of conflict of interest, then they may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for the conflict. Falsely declared conflicts (i.e., do not satisfy one of the listed reasons) risk rejection without consideration of merit. If an author believes that he or she has a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above or if he or she is uncertain, the author is encouraged to contact the program chair.
