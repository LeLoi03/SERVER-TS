 WHAT IS NEW ABOUTACML2025? 
 The 17th Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML 2025) will take place between December 09-12, 2025, in Taipei, Taiwan. The conference aims to provide a leading international forum for researchers in machine learning and related fields to share their new ideas, progress and achievements. Submissions from regions other than the Asia-Pacific are also highly encouraged. 
 The conference calls for high-quality, original research papers in the theory and practice of machine learning. The conference also solicits proposals focusing on frontier research, new ideas and paradigms in machine learning. ACML has taken place annually since 2009 in locations throughout the Asia-Pacific region. This is the 17th Conference to be held in Taipei Taiwan, after previous conferences were held in Hanoi, Vietnam (2024), İstanbul, Turkey (2023), Hyderabad, India (2022), virtual mode (2021), Bangkok (converted to virtual mode), Thailand (2020), Nagoya, Japan (2019), Beijing, China (2018), Seoul, Korea (2017), Hamilton, New Zealand (2016), Hong Kong, China (2015), Nha Trang, Vietnam (2014), Canberra, Australia (2013), Singapore (2012), Taoyuan, Taiwan (2011), Tokyo, Japan (2010), and Nanjing, China (2009).
