Overseas participants should check if they need to apply for a Chinese visa. 
 In 2024, China has expanded its visa-free access to additional countries. Building on last year's inclusion of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Malaysia the list now also includes Switzerland, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, New Zealand Australia, and Poland. 
 Moreover, citizens of the following 54 countries and regions can enjoy a 144-hour visa-free transit policy when visiting Wuhan (via Tianhe Airport): Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland France Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands Poland Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Monaco, Russia, the United Kingdom, Ireland Cyprus Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Serbia, Croatia, Albania, Belarus, Norway, the United States, Canada Brazil Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Japan, Singapore, Brunei, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar. 
 To the best of our knowledge, to enjoy the 144-hour visa-free transit policy: 1) the passport must have a minimum validity of 3 months; 2) no previous record of being denied a Chinese visa; 3) the departure location before arriving in Wuhan and the destination after leaving Wuhan must be in different countries or regions (e.g. from Tokyo to Wuhan and from Wuhan to Hong Kong). 
 Important:the above information only indicates that you may not need a Visa to visit Wuhan, but please double check the Visa policy from an official source before making your travel arrangement! 
 If you need an invitation letter to support your visa application, please contact the Local ChairDr.Cheng Tan (cheng_tan@whut.edu.cn)Important:if you need a room during the conference, please contact the local organization team via Email: cheng_tan@whut.edu.cn.
