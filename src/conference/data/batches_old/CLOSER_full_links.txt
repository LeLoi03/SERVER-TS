 The International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science aims at bringing together engineers, researchers and practitioners interested in advances and applications concerning the cloud infrastructure, operations, and available services through the global network. Further, the conference considers as essential the link to Services Science, acknowledging the service-orientation in most current IT-driven collaborations, and provides a forum for discussing how Services Science can provide theory, methods and techniques to design, analyze, manage, market and study various aspects of Cloud Computing.

 View PDFHTML (experimental)Abstract:mdx II is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud platform designed to accelerate data science research and foster cross-disciplinary collaborations among universities and research institutions in Japan. Unlike traditional high-performance computing systems, mdx II leverages OpenStack to provide customizable and isolated computing environments consisting of virtual machines, virtual networks, and advanced storage. This paper presents a comprehensive performance evaluation of mdx II, including a comparison to Amazon Web Services (AWS). We evaluated the performance of a 16-vCPU VM from multiple aspects including floating-point computing performance, memory throughput, network throughput, file system and object storage performance, and real-world application performance. Compared to an AWS 16-vCPU instance, the results indicated that mdx II outperforms AWS in many aspects and demonstrated that mdx II holds significant promise for high-performance data analytics (HPDA) workloads. We also evaluated the virtualization overhead using a 224-vCPU VM occupying an entire host. The results suggested that the virtualization overhead is minimal for compute-intensive benchmarks, while memory-intensive benchmarks experienced larger overheads. These findings are expected to help users of mdx II to obtain high performance for their data science workloads and offer insights to the designers of future data-centric cloud platforms.
