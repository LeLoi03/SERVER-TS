 Refugees with travel document 
 'On Arrival' visa procedure is very quick and simple. 
 'On Arrival' visas are 'Tourist Visas'.They bear multiple re-entry facility. Tourist Visa 'On Arrival' is the only entry visa to Nepal.For your stay in Nepal for SSS (and MAC) participation and travel within Nepal, you should get 'Tourist Visa'.Please follow these simple procedures for Tourist Visa 'On Arrival'at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), Kathmandu, Nepal, if you have not acquired Visa prior to boarding the plane. 
 Before boarding the plane to Nepal, fill the form "Visa On-arrival" at | https://nepaliport.immigration.gov.np/ | . If you miss this step, you can fill it up using Kiosk machines upon your arrival at the airport. There will be someone at the Kiosk machines to help you if needed. If you fill the form online, you will get submission receipt with barcode, please print it out (or take a picture in your phone) and bring it with you. Please fill it within 15 days of reaching Nepal as it is valid only for 15 days. 
 Take this form (printed or photo) and go to the visa fee collection counter (near Kiosk machines at the airport) and pay your visa fee according to your visa requirement ( 15/30/90 Days). While you can use different modes of payments (at visa fees collection counter), we advise you to carry some cash to be on the safe side (cash does not necessarily need to be USD, they will have a conversion rate). Visas can be extended while in Nepal. Therefore, if you are not sure of your length of stay, we recommend getting Tourist Visa 'On Arrival' for 15 days and then extend depending on your need. | 15 Days – 30 USD 
 30 Days – 50 USD 
 90 Days – 125 USD | Visa fee Exceptions: Children below 10 years (except US citizens) are exempt from the visa fee but proof of age is required. Nationals from SAARC countries, who are entering Nepal for the first time, are exempt from any fee for up to 30 days visa (but visa application is still required). 
 Proceed to the Immigration Desk with your online form, payment receipts, and your passport.

Papers that are rejected at an early round (1 or 2) may be reworked, corrected, enhanced, and resubmitted at a later round (2 or 3), if wished by the authors. Of course, accepted papers at an early round are definitely accepted and should not be submitted again at a later round. In case of resubmission, reviews from the previously submitted round will be transmitted to the reviewers of the resubmission round. 
 Paper Submission 
 Papers are to be submitted electronically throughhref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sss2025" - EasyChair
. All submissions must conform tothe formatting instructions of Springer LNCS series. Each submission must be an original work written in English, in PDF format. 
 Double-blind Review 
 All submissions must be anonymous. We use a somewhat relaxed implementation of double-blind peer review: you are free to disseminate your work through arXiv and other online repositories and give presentations on your work as usual. However, please make sure you do not mention your own name or affiliation in the submission, and please do not include obvious references in the text that reveal your identity. A reviewer who has not previously seen the paper should be able to read it without accidentally learning the identities of the authors. Please feel free to ask the general co-chairs if you have any questions about the double-blind policy of SSS 2025. 
 Submissions 
 There are two types of submissions: regular papers and brief announcements. 
 A regular submission must not exceed 15 pages (including the title, abstract, figures, and excluding references). Additional necessary details for an expert to verify the main claims of the submission may be included in a clearly marked appendix if extra space is needed. 
 A brief announcement submission must not exceed 5 pages including everything. 
 Any submission deviating from these guidelines will be rejected without consideration of its merits. It is recommended that a regular submission begins with a succinct statement of the problem being addressed, a summary of the main results or conclusions, a brief explanation of their significance, a brief statement of the key ideas, and a comparison with related work, all tailored to a non-specialist. Technical development of the work, directed to the specialist, should follow. Papers outside of the conference scope will be rejected without review. For the third round only, if requested by the authors on the cover page, a regular submission that is not selected for a regular presentation will also be considered for the brief announcement format. This will not affect consideration of the paper for a regular presentation.Publication 
 Regular papers and brief announcements will be included in the conference proceedings. Conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS conference series. 
 Special Issue 
 Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of an international journal (under negotiation). 
 Paper Award 
 Prizes will be given to the best regular paper and best student regular paper. A regular paper is eligible for the best student paper if at least one of its authors is a full-time student at submission time. Authors should clearly indicate whether their submission is eligible to be considered for the best student regular paper award (e.g., using a\thanksin the title). The PC may decline to confer awards or may split awards.

A regular paper is eligible for the best student paper if at least one of its authors is a full-time student at submission time. Authors should clearly indicate whether their submission is eligible to be considered for the best student regular paper award (e.g., using a\thanksin the title). The PC may decline to confer awards or may split awards.

 Refugees with travel document 
 'On Arrival' visa procedure is very quick and simple. 
 'On Arrival' visas are 'Tourist Visas'.They bear multiple re-entry facility. Tourist Visa 'On Arrival' is the only entry visa to Nepal.For your stay in Nepal for SSS (and MAC) participation and travel within Nepal, you should get 'Tourist Visa'.Please follow these simple procedures for Tourist Visa 'On Arrival'at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), Kathmandu, Nepal, if you have not acquired Visa prior to boarding the plane. 
 Before boarding the plane to Nepal, fill the form "Visa On-arrival" at | https://nepaliport.immigration.gov.np/ | . If you miss this step, you can fill it up using Kiosk machines upon your arrival at the airport. There will be someone at the Kiosk machines to help you if needed. If you fill the form online, you will get submission receipt with barcode, please print it out (or take a picture in your phone) and bring it with you. Please fill it within 15 days of reaching Nepal as it is valid only for 15 days. 
 Take this form (printed or photo) and go to the visa fee collection counter (near Kiosk machines at the airport) and pay your visa fee according to your visa requirement ( 15/30/90 Days). While you can use different modes of payments (at visa fees collection counter), we advise you to carry some cash to be on the safe side (cash does not necessarily need to be USD, they will have a conversion rate). Visas can be extended while in Nepal. Therefore, if you are not sure of your length of stay, we recommend getting Tourist Visa 'On Arrival' for 15 days and then extend depending on your need. | 15 Days – 30 USD 
 30 Days – 50 USD 
 90 Days – 125 USD | Visa fee Exceptions: Children below 10 years (except US citizens) are exempt from the visa fee but proof of age is required. Nationals from SAARC countries, who are entering Nepal for the first time, are exempt from any fee for up to 30 days visa (but visa application is still required). 
 Proceed to the Immigration Desk with your online form, payment receipts, and your passport.

 Call for Papers 
 SSS is an international forum for researchers and practitioners in the design and development of distributed systems with a focus on systems that are able to provide guarantees on their structure, performance, and/or security in the face of an adverse operational environment.

 New Conference Model 
 We experiment with a new conference model. There will be THREE non-overlapping deadlines, and thus three submission rounds. Papers that are rejected at an early round (1 or 2) may be reworked, corrected, enhanced, and resubmitted at a later round (2 or 3), if wished by the authors. Of course, accepted papers at an early round are definitely accepted and should not be submitted again at a later round. In case of resubmission, reviews from the previously submitted round will be transmitted to the reviewers of the resubmission round. 
 Paper Submission 
 Papers are to be submitted electronically throughhref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sss2025" - EasyChair
. All submissions must conform tothe formatting instructions of Springer LNCS series. Each submission must be an original work written in English, in PDF format. 
 Double-blind Review 
 All submissions must be anonymous. We use a somewhat relaxed implementation of double-blind peer review: you are free to disseminate your work through arXiv and other online repositories and give presentations on your work as usual. However, please make sure you do not mention your own name or affiliation in the submission, and please do not include obvious references in the text that reveal your identity. A reviewer who has not previously seen the paper should be able to read it without accidentally learning the identities of the authors. Please feel free to ask the general co-chairs if you have any questions about the double-blind policy of SSS 2025. 
 Submissions 
 There are two types of submissions: regular papers and brief announcements. 
 A regular submission must not exceed 15 pages (including the title, abstract, figures, and excluding references). Additional necessary details for an expert to verify the main claims of the submission may be included in a clearly marked appendix if extra space is needed. 
 A brief announcement submission must not exceed 5 pages including everything. 
 Any submission deviating from these guidelines will be rejected without consideration of its merits. It is recommended that a regular submission begins with a succinct statement of the problem being addressed, a summary of the main results or conclusions, a brief explanation of their significance, a brief statement of the key ideas, and a comparison with related work, all tailored to a non-specialist. Technical development of the work, directed to the specialist, should follow. Papers outside of the conference scope will be rejected without review. For the third round only, if requested by the authors on the cover page, a regular submission that is not selected for a regular presentation will also be considered for the brief announcement format. This will not affect consideration of the paper for a regular presentation.Publication 
 Regular papers and brief announcements will be included in the conference proceedings. Conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS conference series. 
 Special Issue 
 Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of an international journal (under negotiation). 
 Paper Award 
 Prizes will be given to the best regular paper and best student regular paper. A regular paper is eligible for the best student paper if at least one of its authors is a full-time student at submission time. Authors should clearly indicate whether their submission is eligible to be considered for the best student regular paper award (e.g., using a\thanksin the title). The PC may decline to confer awards or may split awards.
