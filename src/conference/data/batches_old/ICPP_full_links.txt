 Registration 
 Call For Papers 
 ICPP, the International Conference on Parallel Processing, provides a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to present their latest research ﬁndings in all aspects of parallel and distributed computing. ICPP is one of the oldest computer science conferences; ICPP 2024 is the 53rd edition of ICPP. 
 ICPP2024 will be held in Gotland, Sweden, fromAugust 12 - 15, 2024. ICPP 2024 is a premier venue for presenting the latest research on all aspects of parallel processing. Topics of interest in ICPP 2024 papers include, but are not limited to: 
 Algorithms: | Parallel and Distributed Algorithms, Parallel and Distributed Combinatorial & Numerical Methods, Scheduling Algorithms for Parallel and Distributed Applications and Platforms, Algorithmic Innovations for Parallel and Distributed Machine Learning, Post-Moore parallel algorithms.

 Submission Guidelines 
 Paper submissionsshould not exceed 10 pages (including references)and all submissions must be made electronically through the conference submission portal (href="https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/icpp" - https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/icpp
) in PDF format printable on US letter size (8.5" x 11") paper. Please use the ACM format located at:https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. More speciﬁcally, we recommend using \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} conﬁguration for submissions prepared in LaTex. Changes to the template (e.g., margin, font size) could lead to automatic rejection. Up to two additional pages may be subsequently purchased (if needed) for the camera-ready version. Submissions should represent original research results and cannot already be under review or accepted for publication in another venue. 
 The review process isdouble-blind, so submissions shouldnotreveal the identity of the authors. Authors should leave out author names, aﬃliations, and (any) acknowledgment from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in thethird person(e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the Program Committee and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Authors with further questions about double-anonymous reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email. 
 The ICPP 2024 technical program includes areproducibility initiative, where the submitters will be given an option to submit details about the artifacts that enable their experiments to be reproduced. A reproducibility submission consists of the description of the computational artifacts (up to two pages appendix) and persistent and permanent links to the computational artifacts submission (href="https://icpp23.sci.utah.edu/submissions/reproducibility/icpp-reproducibility-initiative.html" - more information regarding the ICPP reproducibility initiative here
). The submission of the reproducibility artifacts will be voluntary, but their presence will be an advantage during the decision process compared to submissions with equivalent ratings without artifacts. 
 All accepted papers that are presented at the conference will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Accepted papers will also need to follow the conference registration policy to be included in the conference proceedings. We will oﬀer rejected papers an opportunity to be forwarded to workshop organizers to be considered in one of the workshops if the authors choose to do so. 
 Important note to authors about the new ACM open access publishing model 
 ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidancehref="https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance" - here
. 
 Further information may be found on the ACM website, as follows: 
 Full details of the new ICPS publishing model 
 Full details of the ACM Open program 
 Please direct all questions about the new model toicps-info@acm.org.

 Abstract Submission:April 8, 2024April 22nd, 2024(Required) 
 Paper Submission:April 15, 2024April 29th, 2024

 Submission Link 
 Please visithref="https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/icpp" - this link
to make paper submissions. 
 Please Note 
 At least one author of an accepted paper will attend the conference in person. 
 The expectation of attendance is implicit in submitting a paper to a conference, rather than a journal, and brings ethical responsibilities to participate actively in the conference (talking to other attendees, presenting the paper, and attending conference sessions). 
 It is expected that all accepted papers will be presented in person. 
 As an author of an accepted paper, this means you should exhaust all efforts for at least one of you to attend, including seeking a visa (where needed). 
 Any allowance for remote presentation will be considered only after clear evidence that attendance is impossible. 
 The conference proceedings will be finalized after the conference based on the papers presented. 
 A registration fee is required for all accepted papers, regardless of attendance. 
 Contact 
 If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the ICPP 2024 Program Committee Track Chairs for inquires about a specific track or Co-Chairs (href="mailto:icpp24-pc@kth.se" - icpp24-pc@kth.se
) for Technical Program questions.
