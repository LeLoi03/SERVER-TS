 Welcome to ACE!  

 The Australasian Computing Education Conference (ACE) is a conference on research, teaching, and innovation in computing education in its various aspects, at all levels, and in all contexts. ACE is the only Australasian conference devoted entirely to education in Computing. To keep up to date with computing education in the region, please consider joining the Australasian ACM SIGCSE Chapter by registering with the mailing list. To join, simply send an email to listserv@listserv.acm.org with SUBSCRIBE sigcse-australasia-members Your Name (where "Your Name" is, obviously, your name!) as the subject line and the only line in the body of the message.  
 ACE is held in conjunction with Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW), and in-cooperation with SIGCSE. The ACE 2025 proceedings will be published in the ACM Digital Library. ACSW arranges the venues and registrations for all ACSW conferences.  
 In 2025, ACE will be held in the week of 10th February, 2025 at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia.
