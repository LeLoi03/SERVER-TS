 and INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS 
 20th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE 
 Dear Colleague, 
 ICTERI supports and respects all the aspects that help promote diversity in our conference community, which aspires to facilitate a truly international and multicultural gathering. Therefore, we prefer physical assembly for the conference as the most effective mode for scientific exchange and community building. We fully understand, however, that some participants might be under higher risk or stricter constraints, like international travellers. This is why we allow virtual participation for the attendees, as an exclusion which must be negotiated with the Program Chairs. 
 The speakers, who present accepted contributed papers, must be physically present at the conference. 
 The information about thearrangements and requirementsfor thevirtual attendeesare provided and updated athref="https://icteri.org/icteri-2025/hybrid/" - https://icteri.org/icteri-2025/hybrid/
. 
 ICTERI Conference Languageis ENGLISH. 
 ICTERI is an annual peer-reviewed international Computer Science conference. It focuses on research, design, development, deployment, and usage of advanced Information Systems (IS) and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Infrastructures in industry and education. Special attention is given to the feasibility and practicality of the proposed ideas/solutions, with a focus on their potential or existing implementation. This can be demonstrated, for example, by a proof-of-concept implementation, a comprehensive prototype, a comprehensive case study, or the analysis of real use cases. Submissions on academic-industrial partnerships for ICT innovation, knowledge transfer, and technological/methodological reports are also welcome. 
 We solicit submissions of original work, not previously published, or submitted for publication elsewhere.
