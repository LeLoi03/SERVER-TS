 Guidelines for Submissions 
 The purpose of having a paper registration deadline a week ahead of the actual paper submission is to overlap review assignments (which can take a long time) with giving you extra time to improve the quality of your submission. While we could have opted to freeze the title, authors and abstract fields by the paper registration deadline, we have decided against this, in order to provide you some flexibility in making modifications until the actual submission deadline. However, we do not want authors to misuse this flexibility. To adhere to the spirit of this intention, we need you to: 
 Please make the paper title as close to the final version as possible. 
 The author list should not change (order of authors can) after registration. If there is a change, you should send an email indicating the change at least 48 hours before the paper submission deadline to the PC chair. 
 Consequently the Conflict List should also be finalized by the abstract registration. Please ensure it is accurate at the time of registration. 
 Please make the abstract as close to the final version as possible. 
 Flagrant violation of the above could result in an outright rejection of the submission

Paper Evaluation Objectives 
 The committee will make every effort to judge each submitted paper on its own merits. There will be no target acceptance rate. We expect to accept a wide range of papers with appropriate expectations for evaluation – while papers that build on significant past work with strong evaluations are valuable, papers that open new areas with less rigorous evaluation are equally welcome and especially encouraged. We also acknowledge the wide range of evaluation methodologies in HPCA including modeling, simulation, prototyping, experimental implementation, real product evaluation, etc. 
 Paper Formatting 
 Papers must be submitted in printable PDF format and should contain amaximum of 11 pagesof single-spaced two-column text,not including references. You may include any number of pages for references, but see below for more instructions. If you are using LaTeX to typeset your paper, then we suggest that you usehref="https://hpca-conf.org/2025/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hpca2025-latex-template.zip" - our template
. Thehref="https://hpca-conf.org/2025/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/HPCA_2025_template.pdf" - sample paper
was prepared with that template. 
 If you use a different software package to typeset your paper, then please adhere to the guidelines given in the table below.Please ensure that you include page numbers with your submission.This makes it easier for the reviewers to refer to different parts of your paper when they provide comments. Please ensure that your submission has a banner at the top of the title page, which contains the submission number and the notice of confidentiality. If using the template, just replace ‘NaN’ with your submission number.

 Content 
 Reviewing will bedouble blind: therefore, please do not include any author names on any submitted documents except in the space provided on the submission form. You must also ensure that the metadata included in the PDF does not give away the authors. If you are improving upon your prior work, refer to your prior work in the third person and include a full citation for the work in the bibliography. For example, if you are building onyour ownprior work in the papers, you would say something like: “While the authors of [x][y] did X, Y, and Z, this paper additionally does W, and is therefore much better.” Do NOT omit or anonymize references for blind review. There is one exception to this for your own prior work that appeared in IEEE CAL, arXiv, workshops without archived proceedings, etc., as discussed later in this document. 
 Figures and Tables 
 Ensure that the figures and tables are legible. Please also ensure that you refer to your figures in the main text. Many reviewers print the papers in gray-scale. Therefore, if you use colors for your figures, ensure that the different colors are highly distinguishable in gray-scale. 
 References 
 There is no length limit for references. Each reference must explicitly list all authors of the paper. Papers not meeting this requirement will be rejected. Since there is no length limit for the number of pages used for references, there is no need to save space here. 
 Paper Submission Instructions 
 Guidelines for Determining Authorship 
 IEEE guidelines dictate that authorship should be based on asubstantial intellectual contribution.It is assumed that all authors have had a significant role in the creation of an article that bears their names. In particular, the authorship credit must be reserved only for individuals who have met each of the following conditions: 
 Made a significant intellectual contribution to the theoretical development, system or experimental design, prototype development, and/or the analysis and interpretation of data associated with the work contained in the article; 
 Contributed to drafting the article or reviewing and/or revising it for intellectual content; and 
 Approved the final version of the article as accepted for publication, including references. 
 A detailed description of the IEEE authorship guidelines and responsibilities is availablehere. Per these guidelines, it is not acceptable to award honorary authorship or gift authorship. Please keep these guidelines in mind while determining the author list of your paper. 
 Declaring Authors 
 Declare all the authors of the paper upfront. Addition/removal of authors once the paper is accepted will have to be approved by the program chair, since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for reviewer assignment. 
 Areas and Topics 
 Authors should indicate these areas on the submission form as well as specific topics covered by the paper for optimal reviewer match. If you are unsure whether your paper falls within the scope of HPCA, please check with the program chair – HPCA is a broad, multidisciplinary conference and encourages new topics. 
 Declaring Conflicts of Interest 
 Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected. 
 Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper. A conflict occurs in the following cases: 
 Between advisors and advisees, forever. 
 Between family members, forever (if they might be potential reviewers). 
 Between people who have collaborated in the last 4 years. This collaboration can consist of a joint research or development project, a joint paper, or when there is direct funding from the potential reviewer (as opposed to company funding) to an author of the paper. Co-participation in professional activities, such as tutorials or studies, is not cause for conflict. When in doubt, the author should check with the | href="mailto:hpca2025@psu.edu" - program chair | . 
 Between people from the same institution or who were in the same institution in the last 4 years, or where one of them is being actively considered for employment (e.g.invitation for interview) by the other person’s institution. 
 When there is funding involving the potential reviewer (as opposed to merely funding from the reviewer’s company). 
 Between people who are members of the same researchcenter where unpublished work is regularly discussed (e.g., at review meetings) 
 Between people whose relationship prevents the reviewer from being objective in his/her assessment. 
 There may be others not covered by the above with whom you believe a COI exists, for example, an ongoing collaboration which has not yet resulted in the creation of a paper or proposal. Please report such COIs; however, you may be asked to justify them. Please be reasonable. For example, you cannot declare a COI with a reviewer just because that reviewer works on topics similar to or related to those in your paper. The program chair may contact co-authors to explain a COI whose origin is unclear. 
 The following scenarios donotconstitute a conflict: 
 Authors of previously-published, closely related work onthat basis alone. 
 “Service” collaborations such as co-authoring a report for a professional organization, serving on a program committee, or co-presenting tutorials. 
 Co-authoring a paper that is a compendium of various projects, community-wide tools (e.g., gem5), non-research articles, and working groups (e.g. RISC-V) withno true research collaboration among the co-authors. 
 People who work on topics similar to or related to thosein your papers. 
 People under the same umbrella funding award where there is no close collaboration, no discussion of unpublished work, and no joint benefit in the paper being published. 
 Most reviews will be solicited among the members of theprogram committee and the external review committee, but other members from the community may also write reviews.Please declare all your conflicts (not just restricted to the PC and ERC)on the submission form. When in doubt, contact the program chair. 
 ArXiv Submissions 
 Authors may submit their work to HPCA 2025 for publication even if the paper has been submitted to or currently appears on Arxiv. However, please do recognize that Arxiv submissions cause serious issues with the double-blind reviewprocess. The PC chair has already advised the PC members not to consider Arxiv submissions in their evaluation. However, we encourage the authors to reduce the possibility of their name being disclosed. While there is no magical solution to hide from the power of web search in locating Arxiv papers, we encourage authors to avoid substantially similar titles abstract etc., to reduce this match. 
 Concurrent Submissions and Workshops 
 By submitting a manuscript to HPCA 2025, the authors guarantee that the manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any conference, journal, or the archived proceedings of a workshop (e.g., in the IEEE digital library) – see exceptions below. The authors also guarantee that no paper that contains significant overlap with the contributions of the submitted paper will be under review for any other conference or journal or an archived proceedings of a workshop during the HPCA 2025 review period. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection. 
 The only exceptions to the above rules are for the authors’ own papers in (1) workshops without archived proceedings such as in the IEEE digital library (or where the authors chose not to have their paper appear in the archived proceedings), or (2) venues such as IEEE CAL or arXiv where there is an explicit policy that such publication does not preclude longer conference submissions. In all such cases, the submitted manuscript may ignore the above work to preserve author anonymity. This information must, however, be provided on the submission form – the PC chair will make this information available to reviewers if it becomes necessary to ensure a fair review. If you have already put your manuscript on arXiv, in the interest of double blind review, modify the title for the version you submit to HPCA. As always, if you are in doubt, it is best to contact thehref="mailto:hpca2025@psu.edu" - program chair
. 
 Finally, theIEEE Plagiarism Policycover a range of ethical issues concerning the misrepresentation of other works or one’s own work.
