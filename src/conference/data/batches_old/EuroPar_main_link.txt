 Dresden - Art and Culture, Elbe Valley and Scientific Hub 
 Dresden is the capital of the Free State of Saxony and the easternmost city in Germany. Dresden is internationally renowned as a city of art and culture, with numerous important buildings, more than 50 museums and at least 30 theaters. The Saxon State Orchestra, based in the Semperoper, is one of the best classical orchestras in the world. Several major musical events are important highlights in the European music calendar every year. Dresden has a long history as the capital and royal residence for the Electors and Kings of Saxony. 
 Dresden is also famous for its unique scenic location in the Elbe Valley. The Elbe riverside meadows characterize the city, as for example the foothills of the Eastern Ore Mountains visible on the horizon and the proximity of Saxon Switzerland. 
 The scientific landscape of Dresden is diverse and varied. There are over 40 research institutions in the city, and all four major German research organizations have facilities here. 
 TUD Dresden University of Technology is one of the largest Universities of Technology in Germany and is among the leading and most dynamic universities in the country. Since 2012, TUD has been one of the eleven German Universities of Excellence. 
 » Join us for an unforgettable experience where connections are made, ideas flourish, and memories are created. Euro-Par 2025 at Dresden will be the event of the year you won't want to miss! «
