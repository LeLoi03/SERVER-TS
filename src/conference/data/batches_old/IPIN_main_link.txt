 Call for Papers: IPIN Conference and Workshop 
 Last Update07/Feb/2025 
 IPIN solicits submission of high quality technical papers reporting original work not previously published, nor currently submitted for consideration elsewhere. Papers are submitted as one of two types: 
 Call for Regular Papers: | Regular papers are limited to 6 | IEEE format | pages (including references), for oral presentation. Note that authors are encouraged to submit 6-page, original and unpublished full articles. After acceptance and successful revision, a final paper may be up to 8 pages long. However, please note that for papers longer than 6 pages, additional page fees (per page) will apply at the time of registration and final submission of the paper. Please do not submit any paper with more than 6 pages for initial review. | Manuscripts are submitted according to the instructions for authors. Papers undergo a single-blind review process by at least two reviewers. Accepted regular papers will be submitted to IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Sponsored by the IEEE Journal of Indoor and Seamless Positioning and Navigation ( | J-ISPIN | ), six best papers will be selected and awarded during the conference. The winners of the best papers will be waived the APC for publication of extended versions of their papers in the IEEE J-ISPIN. | PDF | href="docs/IPIN2025_CFP-mainTrack_v1_20250207.pdf" - Call for Papers - PDF Version

 Call for Work-in-Progress (WiP) Papers: | Work-in-Progress (WiP) papers are limited to 5 to 9 single-column | href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/wqyfdgftmcfw" - CEUR-WS format | pages, for poster presentation. | Manuscripts are submitted according to the instructions for authors. Papers undergo a single-blind review process by at least two reviewers. Accepted WiP papers will be submitted to CEUR-WS.org, which is currently indexed by Scopus, Ei Compendex and DBLP. 
 Please note that the TPC strictly adheres to the IEEE rules for the peer review process. Reviewers treat the contents of the submitted papers as confidential information not to be disclosed to others before publication. We expect our reviewers to not make any inappropriate use of the special knowledge that the access provides. 
 The conference emphasizes open science practices, which will be positively received during the review process.
