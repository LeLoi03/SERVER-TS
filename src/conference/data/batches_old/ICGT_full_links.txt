 ICGT 2025 
 The18th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2025)will be held in Koblenz, Germany, as part ofhref="https://conf.researchr.org/home/staf-2025" - STAF 2025
(Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). The conference takes place under the auspices of EASST,EATCS, andIFIP WG 1.3. 
 Aims and Scope 
 The use of graphs and graph-like structures as a formalism for specification and modelling is widespread in all areas of computer science as well as in many fields of computational research and engineering. Relevant examples include software architectures, pointer structures, state space and control/data flow graphs, UML and other domain-specific models, network layouts, topologies of cyber-physical environments, quantum computing and molecular structures. Often, these graphs undergo dynamic change, ranging from reconfiguration and evolution to various kinds of behaviour, all of which may be captured by rule-based graph manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph transformation form a fundamental universal modelling paradigm that serves as a means for formal reasoning and analysis, ranging from the verification of certain properties of interest to the discovery of fundamentally new insights. 
 ICGT aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas.

 10 - 13 June 2025, 18th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2025), Koblenz, Germany 
 Date: 10 - 13 June 2025 
 Location: Koblenz, Germany 
 Deadline: Tuesday 28 January 2025 
 The use of graphs and graph-like structures as a formalism for specification and modelling is widespread in all areas of computer science as well as in many fields of computational research and engineering. Relevant examples include software architectures, pointer structures, state space and control/data flow graphs, UML and other domain-specific models, network layouts, topologies of cyber-physical environments, quantum computing and molecular structures. Often, these graphs undergo dynamic change, ranging from reconfiguration and evolution to various kinds of behaviour, all of which may be captured by rule-based graph manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph transformation form a fundamental universal modelling paradigm that serves as a means for formal reasoning and analysis, ranging from the verification of certain properties of interest to the discovery of fundamentally new insights. 
 ICGT aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas. 
 In order to foster a lively exchange of perspectives on the subject of the conference, the programme committee of ICGT 2025 encourages all kinds of contributions related to graphs and graph transformation, either from a theoretical point of view or a practical one.

 STAF2025 - 18th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT'2025) 
 Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 23:53:33 +0100 From: Joerg Endrullis <j.endrullis@vu.nl> To: <concurrency@listserver.tue.nl> Subject: [Concurrency] ICGT 2025 - Call for Papers ====================================================== ICGT 2025 International Conference on Graph Transformations 2025href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icgt-2025" - https://conf.researchr.org/home/icgt-2025
------------------------------------------------------ Research Papers Abstracts: 28 Jan 2025 (AoE) Research Papers Submission: 4 Feb 2025 (AoE) Journal-First Submission: 22 Apr 2025 (AoE) Conference: within 10-13 Jun 2025 ====================================================== The 18th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2025) will be held in Koblenz, Germany, as part of STAF 2025 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). The conference takes place under the auspices of EASST, EATCS, and IFIP WG 1.3. Aims and Scope ============== The use of graphs and graph-like structures as a formalism for specification and modelling is widespread in all areas of computer science as well as in many fields of computational research and engineering. Relevant examples include software architectures, pointer structures, state space and control/data flow graphs, UML and other domain-specific models, network layouts, topologies of cyber-physical environments, quantum computing and molecular structures. Often, these graphs undergo dynamic change, ranging from reconfiguration and evolution to various kinds of behaviour, all of which may be captured by rule-based graph manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph transformation form a fundamental universal modelling paradigm that serves as a means for formal reasoning and analysis, ranging from the verification of certain properties of interest to the discovery of fundamentally new insights. ICGT aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas. Research Papers =============== In order to foster a lively exchange of perspectives on the subject of the conference, the programme committee of ICGT 2025 encourages all kinds of contributions related to graphs and graph transformation either from a theoretical point of view or a practical one. Topics ------ Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following subjects: * General models of graph transformation (e.g. adhesive categories and hyperedge replacement systems) * Analysis and verification of graph transformation systems * Graph-based machine learning, including graph neural networks and models of rule inference * Graph theoretical properties of graph languages * Automata on graphs and parsing of graph languages * Logical aspects of graph transformation * Computational models based on graphs * Structuring and modularisation of graph transformation * Hierarchical graphs and decomposition of graphs * Parallel, concurrent, and distributed graph transformation * Term graph and string diagram rewriting * Petri nets and other models of concurrency * Business process models and notations * Bigraphs and bigraphical reactive systems * Graph databases and graph queries * Model-driven development and model transformation * Model checking, program analysis and verification, simulation and animation * Syntax, semantics and implementation of programming languages including domain-specific and visual languages * Graph transformation languages and tool support * Efficient algorithms (e.g. pattern matching, graph traversal, network analysis) * Applications and case studies in software engineering (e.g. software architectures, refactoring, access control, and service-orientation) * Applications to computing paradigms (e.g. bio-inspired, quantum ubiquitous, and visual) * Graph transformation and artificial intelligence (e.g., AI for graph transformations, applying graph transformations in AI engineering and search-based software engineering) Submission Types ---------------- Authors are invited to submit research papers in three possible categories. We are currently in discussion whether to go Open Access for ICGT 2025. We will update and detail the calls as soon as possible. Please take a look at the ICGT web site. (1) Regular research papers, including papers describing applications and case studies. Papers will be evaluated with respect to their originality, significance, and technical soundness. Additional material intended for reviewers (but not publication) may be included in a clearly marked appendix. (While the exact layout is dependent on the final publication venue, the content limit will correspond to the usual 16 pages in the LNCS style, excluding references and appendices) (2) Tool presentation papers, which demonstrate the main features and functionality of graph-based tools. A tool presentation may have an appendix with a detailed demo description which will be reviewed but not included in the proceedings. (While the exact layout is dependent on the final publication venue, the content limit will correspond to 8 pages in the LNCS style, excluding references and appendices, for the main part and the equivalent of 4 pages in the LNCS style for the demo description) (3) Blue Skies, reporting on new research directions or ideas which are not yet sufficiently developed to fit in other categories. (While the exact layout is dependent on the final publication venue, the content limit will correspond to the usual 8 pages in the LNCS style, excluding references and appendices) Special Issue -------------- Authors of the best papers at the conference will be invited to prepare and submit extended journal versions to be considered for publication in a special issue after an independent round of peer review (details TBA). Journal-First Track =================== We invite authors of previously published papers in all areas of graph transformation to submit a journal-first contribution. Authors of accepted journal-first papers will be invited to present their work at ICGT 2025, enriching the programme, and providing an additional pathway to engage with the community. Contributions in this category must have been published in high-quality journals, other high-quality conferences, and quality book chapters not earlier than 2021. Criteria -------- * The original contribution must have been peer-reviewed and published in a quality journal, quality conference (other than ICGT), or as a book chapter in 2021 or later. * It must be within the scope of ICGT (authors should briefly justify this in their submission). * The paper should not be an extended journal version of a paper previously published at ICGT. * Authors should indicate whether the paper has previously been presented in equivalent Journal-First tracks of other conferences. As contributions in this track will have already been peer-reviewed they will not be reviewed again for technical content. Rather, the presentation proposals will be evaluated against the criteria above. In the case where we have more submissions than available presentation slots at ICGT 2025, we will prioritise presentation proposals that: (1) will allow more authors to attend the conference, e.g., those with presenters who are not represented in the research papers track; and (2) will best complement the conference's technical programme. Format ------ Authors should submit a presentation proposal consisting of the paper's title, the paper's authors, the abstract, a link to the original publication, who will be presenting the paper, and a brief justification of its relevance to the ICGT community. The presentation proposal should be prepared using Springer's LNCS format with a maximum of 2 pages. The presentation proposals will not be included in ICGT's proceedings.
