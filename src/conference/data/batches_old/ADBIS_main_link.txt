 NextConference overview 
 Thehref="http://adbis.eu/" - ADBIS
series of conferences provide a forum for the dissemination of research accomplishments and promotes interaction and collaboration among the database, information systems, data science, artificial intelligence and machine learning communities from European countries and the rest of the world. ADBIS conferences have provided an international platform for researchers and developers to present and discuss cutting-edge results on database theory, data management and information technologies, data engineering, analytics and visualization, and their advanced applications. ADBIS 2025 will consist of regular sessions with technical contributions reviewed and selected by an international program committee, as well as invited keynote and tutorial talks presented by leading scientists. 
 DEI Disclaimer 
 The ADBIS community believes that diversity and culture of support encourage retention and attraction of talent, promote diversity of thought and perspective, and help make the scientific community more flexible and responsive in times of change. For these reasons, ADBIS 2025 participates in theDatabase Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)initiative aiming to guide researchers in our community to adopt a more inclusive mindset. For more information, see the ADBIS 2025DEI statement

 Paper Submission 
 ADBIS 2025 invites original papers (not submitted elsewhere in parallel) describing results that broadly belong to the aforementioned list of topics. Accepted long papers will be published in a Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volume and accepted short papers are published in Springer's Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) series. The program committee may decide to accept a submission as a short paper if it reports interesting results but does not justify publication of a full paper. 
 LONG papers can be:Regular research papers, reporting novel, solid research findings within the scope of the conference, typically but not exclusively found in proposing new models, querying or data handling methods, algorithms, data structures, and system architectures for the management of data. 
 Experimental re-evaluation papers, assessing previously published research results in terms of (i) performance evaluation for algorithms and systems, or, (ii) assessment of the application for methodologies, with the contribution of the paper being found (i) in the evaluation findings and (ii) in the discussion of strong and weak aspects of the algorithm/system/method being assessed. 
 SHORT papers can be: 
 Early findings/work-in-progress reports for prompt dissemination and discussion of early research results, that include early experimental findings and implementations, with an emphasis on (i) the description of the early findings, (ii) the possibilities they present, and, (iii) the difficulties being faced towards full fruition. 
 Vision papers, discussing possibilities and challenges in the exploration of radically new system architectures or methodologies for data management in important areas related to the scope of the conference, or areas that are currently considered outside the scope of the conference but hold the potential of becoming relevant. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 The page limits are as follows: 
 LONG (research or experimental) papers: 16 LNCS style pages, including references 
 SHORT (early findings or visionary) papers: up to 10 LNCS style pages, including references 
 Papers should be submitted in PDF format using theCMTonline submission system at:href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADBIS2025" - https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADBIS2025
. 
 Authors should consulthref="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" - Springer’s authors’ guidelines
and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Licence-to-Publish agreement. The corresponding author, who must match the corresponding author marked on the paper, must have the full right, power, and authority to sign the agreement on behalf of all of the authors of a particular paper, and accepts responsibility for releasing this material on their behalf. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. An author of an accepted paper must register to ADBIS 2025 in order to have the paper published, and accepted papers must be presented at the conference by one of the authors. 
 Shepherding 
 Borderline papers will go through a shepherding phase where they will be expected to address the concerns of the reviewers, expressed as a list of required revisions. Failing to properly address them in due time will entail final rejection. The shepherding process will involve: authors will be given a list of issues/improvements that have to be addressed within 3 weeks’ time; authors improve the paper addressing these concerns; authors submit the revised paper in camera-ready format; the PC chairs ultimately decide whether the revised paper is acceptable as is or not to the final program. 
 Shepherding Schedule 
 The schedule for shepherding is as follows (All deadlines are 11:59 PM AoE): 
 Notification of shepherding status: | June 4, 2025 
 Authors submit revised, camera-ready version: | June 24, 2024 
 Notification of acceptance for shepherded papers: | July 1, 2024 
 Camera-ready documents and copyright: | July 15, 2024 
 Awards 
 Springer will sponsor the ADBIS 2025 Best Paper Award, Best PhD Symposium Paper Award, Best Demonstration and Best Short Paper, which will be announced during the ADBIS 2025 Banquet. 
 Special Issue 
 The best papers of the conference will be invited to submit an extended and revised version of their paper to a special issue in the Information Systems journal of Elsevier (https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/information-systems). 
 Inclusion and Diversity in Writing and Presentation 
 Authors are strongly encouraged to be inclusive in writing and presentation of their work. 
 Please visit the subsection "D&I materials" athttps://dbdni.github.io/for details. 
 Use of Generative AI 
 Authors should explicitly disclose the use of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in their manuscripts when these tools are employed for more than just editing the author’s text. This disclosure can be made through a statement placed at the end of the manuscript, preceding the References section. 
 If it comes to our notice that a submission utilized large language models (LLMs) without clear disclosure, such papers will be subject to immediate desk rejection. However, if there is no usage of such technologies, no disclosure statement is required.
