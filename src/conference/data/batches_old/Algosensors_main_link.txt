 ALGOWIN 
 2025 
 Scope 
 TheInternational Symposium on Algorithmics of Wireless Networks(ALGOWIN), previously known as ALGOSENSORS, is an international forum dedicated to the algorithmic aspects of wireless networks. It covers algorithmic issues arising in wireless networks of all types of computational entities, static or mobile, including sensor networks, sensor-actuator networks, autonomous robots, and drones. The focus is on the design and analysis of algorithms, models of computation, graph and network algorithms, and experimental analysis. 
 ALGOWIN 2025 will be held at the Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw, Poland. It will be part ofhref="http://algo-conference.org/2025" - ALGO 2025

 Proceedings 
 The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer “Lecture Notes in Computer Science” series after the conference (expected October 2025). 
 Special Issue 
 Selected papers will be invited to a special issue of the Theoretical Computer Science journal. 
 Awards 
 Awards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper. The awards are kindly sponsored by Springer. To be eligible for the best student paper award, at least one of the paper authors must be a full-time student at the time of submission, and the student(s) must have made a significant contribution to the paper. The program committee may decline to make these awards or may split them. 
 Paper Submission 
 Papers are to be submitted electronically using thehref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=algowin2025" - EasyChair server
. The submissions must contain original results that have not already been published and are not concurrently submitted to a journal or conference with published proceedings. By submitting a paper, the authors acknowledge that in case of acceptance at least one of the authors will register for ALGO/ALGOWIN 2025 and present the paper. 
 Submissions must be in the form of a single pdf file prepared using the LNCS latex templates and style files (available, together with Springer’s authors’ guidelines, fromhttps://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are also available on Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj#.WsdHOy5uZpg). 
 Each submission should consist of the main part of the paper, not exceeding 12 pages (including the title page and excluding the references), plus an optional clearly marked appendix (to be read at the discretion of the program committee). Any figure pertaining to the main part of the paper should be included therein (within the 12 page limit). The first page must include an indication of whether the paper is eligible for the best student paper award.
