 Here theShort version Conference ScheduleIUI 2025 
 The ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (ACM IUI) 2025 is the 30th annual premiere venue where researchers and practitioners meet and discuss state-of-the-art advances at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Ideal IUI submissions should address practical HCI challenges using machine intelligence and discuss both computational and human-centric aspects of such methodologies, techniques and systems.The theme for IUI 2025 isSustainability, covering a wide variety of topics such as intelligent user interfaces accounting social inclusion, interactive intelligent systems for environmental sustainability, human control of energy management or resource conservation, behavioural change, and data-driven decision making for environmental monitoring. While we encourage submissions related to this theme, the scope of the conference is not limited to the theme only. 
 In person conference 
 IUI 2025 is intended to be an in-person conference. There will be no separate virtual attendance registration option; all registrations are for in-person attendance. In exceptional circumstances (such as visa denial), a pre-recorded video presentation will be allowed, however the registration fee must still be paid.

 The ACM Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (ACM IUI) is the annual premiere venue where researchers and practitioners meet and discuss state-of-the-art advances at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Ideal IUI submissions should address practical HCI challenges using machine intelligence and discuss both computational and human-centric aspects of such methodologies, techniques and systems. 
 Contributions are welcome from all relevant arenas, including academia, industry, government, and non-profit organizations. We strongly believe that diverse insights are critical to the vitality of the IUI community and the conference will accept papers for both long and short oral presentations. Contributions to IUI are expected to be supported by rigorous evidence appropriate to the claims (e.g., user study, system evaluation, computational analysis).

 Papers 
 We invite original paper submissions that are not under consideration elsewhere. Accepted papers will appear in the ACM Digital Library and citation indices. A selected set of accepted top quality full papers will be invited to submit their extended versions for publication in an ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS) special issue titled ‚ÄúHighlights of IUI 2025‚Äù that will appear in 2026. 
 All accepted papers will be invited for oral presentation as part of the main conference program. Additionally, all authors of accepted papers are invited to present a poster of their work during the poster session. 
 We also encourage authors to discuss potential ethical considerations of their work; aspects pertaining to current societal issues; diversity, inclusion, and equality; and other topics under the broad responsible AI topic. We encourage authors to consider practical and societal implications of their work (as well as its shortcomings) throughout their projects and to include a reflection on those implications in their papers in particular how the proposed methods and insights could be applied and deployed in a realistic setting and how they can improve people‚Äôs lives in the real world. 
 Highlights of this year 
 We also encourage authors to discuss potential ethical considerations of their work; aspects pertaining to current societal issues; diversity, inclusion, and equality; and other topics under the broad responsible AI topic. 
 Reflection of practical and societal impact 
 We encourage authors to consider practical and societal implications of their work (as well as its shortcomings) throughout their projects and to include a reflection on those implications in their papers in particular how the proposed methods and insights could be applied and deployed in a realistic setting and how they can improve people's lives in the real world. 
 We also encourage authors to discuss potential ethical considerations of their work in terms of diversity inclusion, and equality; and other topics under the broad responsible AI topic and its societal impact. We recognize that technology is rarely neutral --- simply by making some things easier than others, it reshapes society (Winner, 1980;Green, 2020). Further, given the incredibly short invention-to-application cycles for AI-related technologies, it is becoming increasingly unlikely that ‚Äúsomebody else‚Äù will carefully consider how an emerging intelligent user interface technology might impact the world before this technology is deployed. Because it is often difficult to anticipate the cumulative or indirect impacts of an invention, we provide a few concrete suggestions to consider throughout the research process and for reflecting on one‚Äôs work at the end. 
 Our purpose is to help authors ensure that the likely societal consequences of their work are consistent with their intentions and values. For colleagues who are not yet experienced with incorporating societal impacts into their IUI research but who are willing to give it a try, we preparedhref="https://iui.acm.org/2024/societal_impact.html" - some simple ideas to consider

 Platform 
 All materials must be submitted electronically to PCS 2.0https://new.precisionconference.com/~sigchiby the abstract and paper deadline. 
 In PCS 2.0, first click "Submissions" at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society conference, and track select "SIGCHI", "IUI 2025" and "IUI 2025 Papers", respectively, and press "Go". 
 Anonymization 
 ACM IUI uses a double-blind review process. All submissions (and supplemental materials) must be appropriately anonymized according to the following guidelines: 
 Authors' names and affiliations are not visible anywhere in the paper. 
 Acknowledgements should be anonymized or removed during the review process. 
 Self-citations should be included where necessary but must use the third person. For example, "... as shown in our previous user study [2] ... " is not allowed, whereas "... as shown in Smith et al. [2] " is acceptable (because in this case the citation [2] will NOT be perceived as self-citation). 
 Failure to follow these guidelines may result in submissions being desk rejected without review. 
 Authors should also be aware of thehref="https://sigchi.org/about/policies/conference-policies/submission-and-review/" - SIGCHI
                    Policy
                    for Submission and Review at SIGCHI Conferences
. 
 Accessibility 
 Authors are asked to make their paper submissions accessible (so that reviewers with vision impairments can access them, for example). The authors of accepted papers will be required to make their final PDFs accessible. Please use thehref="https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/" - SIGCHI

using\documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart}for the LaTeX template. 
 Papers are of variable length. Paper length must be based on the weight of the contribution. We encourage authors to stay within a 10,000 word limit. Authors of papers exceeding 12,000 words should add a note at the end of their manuscript explaining how the length of the paper is commensurate with the contribution of the work.
