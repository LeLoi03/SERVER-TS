Welcome to Xin Li's Homepage! 
 I am an Associate Professor in the

 Research 
 I am broadly interested in theory of computation. Especially, I am interested in the use of randomness in computation, complexity theory, coding theory, and cryptography. A significant part of my previous work has been on explicit constructions ofrandomness extractors. For example, I have made key contributions in the recent line of research that has resulted in an almost optimal solution to the long standing open problem of constructing explicit two source extractors. Seeherefor a briefy history of this problem. 
  
 I obtained my Ph.D. degree fromUniversity of Texas at Austinin 2011, under the supervison ofDavid Zuckerman. After that I was a Simons Postdoctoral Fellow at University of Washington. Previously I worked a little on quantum computing and human computer interaction. Here is my recenthref="RS_XinLi.pdf" - research statement

 I am supported by the following grants: 
 NSF Award CCF-1617713
