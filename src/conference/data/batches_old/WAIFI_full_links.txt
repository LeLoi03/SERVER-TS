 Workshop Goals 
 This workshop is a forum of mathematicians, computer scientists, engineers and physicists performing research on finite field arithmetic, interested in communicating the advances in the theory, applications, and implementations of finite fields. The workshop will help to bridge the gap between the mathematical theory of finite fields and their hardware/software implementations and technical applications, specially in cryptography and coding theory. 
 WAIFI 2026 will be held in Santander, Spain 
  
 Main Workshop Themes 
 The topics of WAIFI 2026 include but are not limited to: 
 Theory of finite field arithmetic: | Bases (canonical; normal; dual; etc.) 
 Polynomials (irreducible; primitive; permutation) 
 Boolean functions and special functions over finite fields 
 Algebraic curves over finite fields 
 Dynamical systems over finite fields 
 Hardware & Software implementations: | Design & implementation of finite field processors 
 Design & implementation of arithmetic algorithms 
 Pseudorandom number generators 
 Hardware/software co-design 
 Applications of finite fields in: | Cryptography (ciphers; PQC; etc)

 WAIFI 2024: The International Workshop on the Arithmetic of Finite Fields 
 June 10 - 12, 2024,Carleton UniversityLocation:Carleton University 
 Description 
 Please visit the official page for this workshop here:href="http://www.waifi.org/" - http://www.waifi.org/
. 
 The International Workshop on the Arithmetic of Finite Fields (WAIFI) is a forum of mathematicians, computer scientists and engineers performing research on finite field arithmetic, interested in communicating the advances in the theory, applications, and implementations of finite fields. The workshop will help to bridge the gap between the mathematical theory of finite fields and their hardware/software implementations and technical applications. This is the tenth edition of the workshop and the first one in North America (see details of the previous WAIFI editions athref="http://www.waifi.org/" - http://www.waifi.org/
). The workshop has historically been accompanied by a proceedings volume; typically published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series of Springer:href="https://link.springer.com/conference/waifi" - https://link.springer.com/conference/waifi
. 
 The topics of WAIFI include but are not limited to: 
 - theory of finite field arithmetic, 
 - hardware/software implementations of finite field arithmetic, 
 - application areas (e.g., error correcting codes, cryptography, communications systems, quantum communications). 
 For example, efficient finite field arithmetic has been an important topic of research in recent years due to applications in post-quantum cryptography. Certain proposed standards for cryptography that will remain secure even in the presence of a large-scale quantum computer are based on computational problems on lattices that rely on a series of computations involving polynomials over finite fields. The security and performance of these systems require the underlying finite field arithmetic to be efficient, while staying constant time (that is, not depending on the inputs to the computations). Parameters for these schemes are chosen so that the polynomial rings permit fast computation using a variant of the Fast Fourier Transform multiplication method (for fast polynomial multiplication), and Montgomery methods for constant-time pointwise arithmetic in the underlying field. It is expected that the works presented in this workshop and published in the accompanying proceedings will have implications for many communications systems, including post-quantum cryptography beyond what is presented above, error correcting codes used for communications robust in the presence of transmission errors, efficient network coding protocols that improve on classical routing for multicast networks, etc. We will encourage participation from students and early-career researchers, both domestic and international, and expect that the topics presented in this workshop will positively influence their future careers, both in terms of opening new scientific avenues and also providing them with exposure to top-level research and professors in these areas.
