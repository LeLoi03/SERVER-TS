 Preliminary CALL FOR PAPERS 
 This year’s theme of the conference is the use of Enterprise Modeling and Enterprise Architecture for system analysis and design to support industry 5.0 and society 5.0. At the core of fulfilling these visions are adoptions of a human-centric approach for digital technologies, up-skilling and reskilling European workers, modern, resource-efficient and sustainable industries and transition to a circular economy, as well as, a globally competitive and world-leading industry, speeding up investment in research and innovation. All of these challenges need support for congruence between business and information technology. Enterprise Modeling and Enterprise Architecture are well positioned to support this by providing methods and tools for system development, as well as investigating and reporting on the current state-of-research and state-of-practice. 
 Relevant topics include but are not limited to: 
 Foundations of enterprise modeling: 
 Modeling Theory 
 Tool Development and Support 
 Modeling with AI solutions 
 Meta-Modeling 
 Model Life-cycle Management 
 Quality and Validation of Enterprise Models 
 Active and Smart models 
 Enterprise modeling for software development: 
 Requirements Engineering 
 Model-Based Software Engineering (MBSE) 
 Agile Systems Development 
 Modeling for AI solutions 
 LowCode NoCode tools 
 Enterprise modeling languages and ontologies: 
 Conceptualizations, Notations, and Ontologies 
 Multi-Perspective and Multi-Level Enterprise Modeling 
 Business Process Modeling 
 Business Rules Modeling 
 Human factors of enterprise modeling: 
 Human-Model Interaction 
 Participatory and Collaborative Modeling 
 End-user modeling 
 Inclusive modeling for well-being and ageing 
 Ethical aspects of enterprise modeling 
 Enterprise engineering: 
 Digital Ecosystems 
 Business intelligence and Data-driven Enterprises 
 Digital Twins and IoT 
 Blockchain technology 
 Enterprise Transformation 
 Enterprise Architecture Management 
 Enterprise Strategy 
 Capability Management 
 Knowledge Management 
 Enterprise Modeling for Resilience and Sustainability:
