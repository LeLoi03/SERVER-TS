 ACM SenSys 2025 
 6 - 9 MayIrvine, USA 
 The 23rd ACM Conference on 
 Embedded Networked Sensor Systems 
 In transition to Conference on 
 Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems 
 Announcement from the Joint 
 SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI Steering Committee 
 We are excited to announcethe plans of merging threeleading conferences — SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI — into a single premier event under the new nameSenSys: Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems. This unified conference will focus on advancing research at the intersection of sensing systems and embedded artificial intelligence. Originating from distinct yet complementary research areas, these three conferences have driven innovation across multiple disciplines, including sensor networks, embedded systems, mobile computing, wireless communication, signal processing, data science, and AI-driven applications. As intelligent sensing systems continue to permeate diverse research domains, the necessity for a unified, high-impact forum has become apparent. The newly expanded SenSys conference will provide a comprehensive platform where researchers and industry professionals can converge to present state-of-the-art research, exchange novel ideas, address key challenges, and shape the future of the field. 
 SenSys'25 will continue as a SenSys event (Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems), while the merger with IPSN and IoTDI is pending final approvals ofthe ACM and the IEEE. SenSys'25 will bring the three communities together and mark an important milestone in the transition toward a fully unified conference. The merger will be finalized as soon as the necessary approvals and structure are in place. SenSys 2025 will be collocated with CPS-IoT Week 2025, providing a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange. All accepted papers in 2025 will be published in the ACM SenSys proceedings. In addition, we are exploring the possibility of introducing multiple submission deadlines in the future.

Sensys: The ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems 
 SenSys introduces a highly selective, single-track forum for research on systems issues of networked sensing and actuation, broadly defined. Systems of smart sensors and actuators will revolutionize a wide array of application areas by providing an unprecedented density and fidelity of instrumentation. They also present systems challenges because of resource constraints, uncertainty, irregularity, mobility, and scale. This conference provides an ideal venue to address research challenges facing the design, development, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of these systems. Sensing and actuation systems require contributions from many fields, from wireless communication and networking, embedded systems and hardware, energy harvesting and management, distributed systems and algorithms, data management, and applications, so we welcome cross-disciplinary work.
