 Privacy in statistical databases is about finding tradeoffs to the tension between the increasing societal and economic demand for accurate information and the legal and ethical obligation to protect the privacy of individuals and enterprises which are the respondents providing the statistical data. In the case of statistical databases, the motivation for respondent privacy is one of survival: data collectors cannot expect to collect accurate information from individual or corporate respondents unless these feel the privacy of their responses is guaranteed. 
 Beyond respondent privacy, there are two additional privacy dimensions to be considered: privacy for the data owners (organizations owning or gathering the data, who would not like to share the data they have collected at great expense) and privacy for the users (those who submit queries to the database and would like their analyses to stay private). 
 "Privacy in Statistical Databases 2024" (PSD 2024) is a conference organized by thehref="https://crises-deim.urv.cat" - CRISES research group
atUniversitat Rovira i Virgiliwith proceedings published by Springer-Verlag in Lecture Notes in Computer Science. The purpose of PSD 2024 is to attract world-wide, high-level research in statistical database privacy.

Those ten PSD conferences follow a tradition of high-quality technical conferences on SDC which started with "Statistical Data Protection-SDP'98", held in Lisbon in 1998 and with proceedings published by OPOCE, and continued with the AMRADS project SDC Workshop, held in Luxemburg in 2001 and with proceedings published in Springer LNCS 2316. 
 Like the aforementioned preceding conferences, PSD 2024 originates in Europe, but wishes to stay a worldwide event in database privacy and SDC. Thus, contributions and attendees from overseas are welcome.
