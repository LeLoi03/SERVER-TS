 We are delighted to extend a warm invitation to you for the 26th International Conference on Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications (DICTA 2025). DICTA is the premier conference organized in Australia on computer vision, image processing pattern recognition, and related areas. DICTA was established in 1991 as a flagship conference of the Australian Pattern Recognition Society (APRS) and has been historically co-sponsored technically by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the International Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR). The 26th DICTA 2025 conference will be held in Adelaide Convention Centre, Adelaide, Australia from Dec 3-5, 2025. DICTA 2025 will feature regular and special sessions, industry demos and panels, journal-to-conference track, challenges, and keynote talks from distinguished speakers. 
 DICTA 2025 offers ample opportunities to connect with the brightest minds from academia and industry in the field of digital image processing. We invite students, academic and industry researchers as well as practitioners to submit their latest work for presentation at DICTA 2025. We look forward to welcoming you all to Adelaide for an enriching conference experience!
