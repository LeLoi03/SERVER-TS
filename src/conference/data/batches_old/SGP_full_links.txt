 SYMPOSIUM ON GEOMETRY PROCESSING SGP 2025 BILBAO, SPAIN JUNE 30 - JULY 4, 2025 
 SGP 
 2025 
 The conference will be located at the Bizkaia Aretoa building, in Bilbao, Spain. 
 Graduate School: June 30 - July 1, 2025 
 Conference: July 2 - 4, 2025 
 Registration for the Conference and Graduate School 
 SGP'25 Program will be available here 
 SGP is the premier venue for disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in geometry processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science, and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation, simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections. Continuing a successful tradition from previous years, SGP will also offer a Graduate School, targeted at students and researchers new to the field. Courses will be taught by leading experts and complemented by interactive demonstrations to provide in-depth knowledge of recent and fundamental aspects of geometry processing. The SGP 2025 will be located at the Bizkaia Aretoa. This building is located in one of the most emblematic parts of Bilbao, offering incredible views of the famous and majestic Guggenheim Museum.

 Winner of the Computer Graphics Forum 2024 Cover Image Contest 
 This image shows the inside of the teaser figure 'fertility' from Polygon Laplacian Made Robust. It visualizes the condition numbers of individual polygon stiffness matrices. The mesh transitions from the input mesh to our result from left to right. The original mesh features disfigured polygons with alarming (yellow) or terrible (magenta) condition numbers. With our tailored smoothing algorithm, polygons become very regular and, combined with our improved polygon Laplacian, result in better condition numbers (blue) and improved robustness in computational simulation. Blender was used to stylize the geometry and render the image.
