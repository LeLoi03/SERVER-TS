Objectives and Scope 
 In the last decades, we have witnessed a proliferation of approaches that 
 integrate several modelling, verification and simulation techniques, 
 facilitating more versatile and efficient analysis of software-intensive 
 systems. These approaches provide powerful support for the analysis of 
 different functional and non-functional properties of the systems, complex 
 interaction of components of different nature as well as validation of 
 diverse aspects of system behaviour. The iFM conference series is a forum 
 for discussing recent research advances in the development of integrated 
 approaches to formal modelling and analysis. The conference covers all 
 aspects of the design of integrated techniques, including language design, 
 verification and validation, automated tool support and the use of such 
 techniques in software engineering practice. To credit the effort of tool 
 developers, we use EAPLS artifact badging.

 Areas of interest include (but are not limited to): 
 Formal and semi-formal modelling notations 
 Combining formal methods with different performance, simulation and | system analysis techniques 
 Program verification, model checking, and static analysis 
 Theorem proving, decision procedures and SAT/SMT solving 
 Runtime analysis, monitoring and testing 
 Program synthesis 
 Modelling, analysis and synthesis of cyber-physical, hybrid, embedded, | probabilistic, distributed or concurrent systems 
 Abstraction and refinement 
 Model learning and inference 
 Approaches to integrating formal methods into software engineering | practice or industry 
 Approaches to integrating formal methods into standardisation or | certification processes 
 Formal methods for artificial intelligence, including machine learning | and data-based techniques 
 Tools and case studies supporting the integration of formal methods

 Paper Categories 
 iFM 2025 solicits high-quality papers reporting research results and/or 
 experience reports related to the overall theme of formal methods 
 integration. 
 We solicit papers in the following categories: 
 (1)Regular papers(limit 16 pages) presenting original scientific research 
 results, 
 tools, their foundation and evaluations, applications of formal methods, 
 including rigorous evaluations and case studies. 
 (2)Short papers(limit 6 pages) describing any work in the area of formal 
 methods, including work-in-progress and preliminary results that are 
 sufficiently interesting for the iFM community. 
 All page limits exclude the references. Appendices may be included, but 
 they will only be read by a reviewer at their discretion. 
 Regular and short papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted 
 for publication elsewhere. Papers will undergo a thorough review process. 
 Submissions will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, 
 correctness, originality, and clarity. 
 The submissions will be reviewed and selected for publication based on the 
 above-mentioned criteria as well as suitability to the conference’s 
 technical program. The review process is single blind. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 Submissions for all categories should be made using the iFM 2025 EasyChair 
 site: 
 href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ifm2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ifm2025
Submissions must be in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style files. 
 Springer requires that authors should consult Springer’s authors’ 
 guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for 
 Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to 
 include their ORCIDs in their papers. After a paper is accepted, the 
 corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors 
 of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The 
 corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the 
 corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to 
 Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. 
 The conference proceedings will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in 
 Computer Science series. A special issue of the Formal Aspects of Computing 
 journal is planned for extended versions of selected papers from iFM 2025. 
 All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. At least one 
 author of each accepted paper must register to the conference by the early 
 registration date. 
 EAPLS Artifact Badging 
 Reproducibility of experiments is crucial to foster an atmosphere of open, 
 reusable and trustworthy research. To improve and reward reproducibility 
 and to give more visibility and credit to the effort of tool developers in 
 our community, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit 
 possible artifacts associated with their paper for evaluation, and based on 
 the level of reproducibility they will be awarded one or more badges. See 
 https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/. 
 Artifact submission is optional and the result of the artifact evaluation 
 will not alter the paper’s acceptance decision. 
 Best Paper 
 iFM 2025 will honor the best paper selected with respect to reviews, 
 program committee discussions and conference presentations with an award.
