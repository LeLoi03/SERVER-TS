 CAiSE'25 | 37th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering | Theme: Bridging Silos | Vienna, AustriaJune 16-20, 2025 | Register 
 Theme: Bridging Silos 
 Engineering real-world information systems requires a coherent design encompassing human, organizational, economic, societal, and technological aspects. Information systems are applied in diverse contexts such as business process management, geographical information systems, and digital twins. The discipline continually evolves with trends in data science, machine learning, process mining, blockchain, mobile computing, sustainability, new regulations, cyber warfare, and military conflicts, all influencing its development. Each application context and emerging trend can lead to specializations within information systems engineering, necessitating various research traditions and needs. While beneficial, these specializations risk creating silos. Thus, the CAiSE conference, the premier event for this discipline, aims to prevent such fragmentation. 
 Therefore, the theme for this year’s CAiSE conference is "Bridging Silos." We encourage submissions that consider information systems engineering as a cohesive design involving multiple aspects. Submissions focused on specific specializations should explicitly position their results within the broader context to engage researchers across different areas and avoid silo formation.

 CAiSE'25 Call for Papers 
 The CAiSE’25 organization calls for full papers with a special emphasis on the theme ofBridging Silos. 
 Engineering real-world information systems requires a coherent design, encompassing human, organizational, economic, societal, and technological aspects. Information systems are utilized in increasingly diverse contexts such as business process management, geographical information systems, and digital twins. At the same time, the discipline continually evolves with trends in data science, machine learning, process mining, blockchain, mobile computing, sustainability, new regulations, cyber warfare, and military conflicts, all influencing its development. Each application context and emerging trend can lead to specializations within information systems engineering, necessitating various research traditions and needs. While beneficial, these specializations risk creating silos within the field of information systems engineering. Thus, the CAiSE conference, the premier event for this discipline, aims to prevent such fragmentation. Therefore, the theme for this year’s CAiSE conference isBridging Silos. 
 We encourage submissions that consider information systems engineering (ISE) as a cohesive design involving multiple aspects across the life cycle of information systems across their design, development, deployment and operation. Submissions concerned with specific specializations are certainly welcome, but they must explicitly position their results within the broader context to engage researchers across different areas and avoid silo formation. 
 In addition to offering an exciting scientific program, CAiSE’25 will feature a best paper award, and a journal special issue: 
 Best Paper Award: | prize EUR 1000 (sponsored by Springer) 
 A small selection of best papers will be invited to submit enhanced versions for consideration in a special issue of Elsevier Information Systems journal dedicated to this conference. 
 Papers should be submitted as PDF, following Springer’s LNCS format,and should not exceed 14 pages, excluding the references, but including all text, figures, and appendices. Submissions not conforming to the LNCS format, the page limitations, or being obviously out of the scope of the conference, will be rejected without review. For Springer’s LNCS format, see the guidelines provided at: 
 href="https://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html" - Springer’s LNCS Format Guidelines
The results described in the submitted paper must be unpublished and must not be under review elsewhere. Three to five keywords characterizing the paper should be listed at the end of the abstract. Each paper will be reviewed by at least two program committee members and, if positively evaluated, a third review will be conducted by one additional program board member. The selected papers will be discussed among the paper reviewers online, as well as during the program board meeting. As the review process is not blind, please indicate your name and affiliation on your submission. Accepted papers will be presented at CAiSE’25 and published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) conference proceedings. 
 Authors submitting their work to CAiSE'25 are encouraged to share their research widely to foster early feedback and collaboration - papers under review at CAiSE 2025 may be submitted to preprint servers such as arXiv or similar platforms. 
 Types of Scientific Papers 
 We invite three types of scientific papers: technical papers, empirical papers, and exploratory papers. The type of submission must be indicated in the submission system. Each contribution should explicitly identify the information systems engineering problem addressed, its expected real-world impact, and the research method used. Furthermore, as mentioned above, submissions concerned with specific specializations within the information systems engineering field are certainly welcome. However, they must explicitly position their results within the broader context to engage researchers across different areas and avoid silo formation. We strongly advise authors to clearly emphasize these aspects in their paper, including the abstract. 
 Technical Papers 
 Technical papers describe original insights pertaining to the field of information systems engineering. A technical paper should clearly describe the situation or type of problem tackled, the relevant state of the art, the position or solution suggested and its potential, as well as demonstrate the benefits of the contribution through a rigorous evaluation. We explicitly welcome three kinds of technical papers: 
 Technology oriented papers: | produce and evaluate some technological artifact (infrastructure, tool, language, or system) in controlled/scoped experiments in lab settings. 
 Method oriented papers: | evaluate, produce and evaluate some socio-technological artifact (a method, approach to be used in an information systems engineering context) that needs to be evaluated in a (less controllable) real world setting. 
 Conceptual and theoretical papers: | deal with ontological, philosophical, semiotic, and mathematical foundations of information systems engineering. These papers typically use a deduction and/or argumentation based approach to develop a point/contribution as part of their evaluation. 
  
 Empirical Papers 
 Empirical papers evaluate existing problem situations including problems encountered in practice, or validate proposed solutions with scientific means, i.e., by empirical studies, experiments, case studies, experience reports, simulations, etc. Scientific reflection on problems and practices in industry also falls into this category. The topic of the evaluation presented in the paper as well as its causal or logical properties must be clearly stated. The research method must be sound and appropriate. 
 Exploratory Papers 
 Exploratory papers describe completely new research positions or approaches, in order to face a generic situation arising because of new ICT, new kinds of activities, or new IS challenges. They must precisely describe the situation and demonstrate why current methods, tools, ways of reasoning, or meta-models are inadequate. They must also rigorously present their approach and demonstrate its pertinence and correctness in addressing the identified situation.
