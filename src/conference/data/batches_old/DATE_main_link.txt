 »DATE 2025 - Call for Papers 
 DATE 2025 - Call for PapersThe DATE conference is the main European event bringing together designers and design automation users, researchers and vendors as well as specialists in the hardware and software design, test and manufacturing of electronic circuits and systems. DATE puts a strong emphasis on both technology and systems, covering ICs/SoCs, reconfigurable hardware and embedded systems as well as embedded software. 
 The three-day event consists of a conference with regular papers, late breaking results papers and extended abstracts, complemented by timely keynotes, special days, focus sessions, embedded tutorials, half-day workshops and multi-partner project sessions. The event will also host the Young People Programme and unplugged sessions fostering the networking and the exchange of information on relevant issues, recent research outcomes and career opportunities. 
 DATE 2025is the 28th edition of an event that has always been the place for researchers, young professionals and industrial partners to meet, present their research and discuss the current development and next trends, with high emphasis on social interaction. 
 AtDATE 2025, the DATE community, again, comes together for the conference in an intensive three-day format, focussing on interaction as well as further strengthening the community. The vast majority of regular papers will be presented in technical sessions using short flash-presentations, where the emphasis is on poster-supported live interactions (in addition to the common full-length presentation videos available before, during and after the conference). By this, we continue to focus on the core value of conferences: meeting, discussing and exchanging.

 The Conference 
 The conference addresses all aspects of research into technologies for electronic and (embedded) systems engineering. It covers the design process, test and tools for design automation of electronic products ranging from integrated circuits to distributed large-scale systems. This includes both hardware and embedded software design issues. The conference scope also includes the elaboration of design requirements and new architectures for challenging application fields such as sustainable computing, smart societies and digital wellness, secure systems, autonomous systems and smart industry, and state of the art applications of artificial intelligence. Engineers, scientists and researchers involved in innovative industrial designs are particularly encouraged to submit papers to foster feedback from design to research. 
 Special Days on Emerging Topics 
 The scientific research track is complemented by a set of sessions focussing on emerging topics bringing new challenges to the community, with presentations and interactions on interesting and timely issues. 
 Special Day "New Trends in AI/ML" 
 This Special Day will focus in exploring the latest trends and innovations in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). AI (and mainly generative AI) is booming since the release of chat-GPT and it will change the future of Design, Automation and Test. This Special Day will highlight the following topics: 
 Design of hardware architectures, including automatic exploration of large design spaces, assistance of the human designer, resource selection and optimisation 
 Verification of hardware architectures, with topics such as performance prediction, (formal) design validation, accelerating simulations thanks to AI-Augmented Surrogate Models 
 AI-Accelerated Physical Design and Validation of layout and floorplans 
 Sustainability in AI/ML Development. 
 During the talks, AI/ML techniques such as Neural architecture search (NAS), Generative adversarial networks (GAN), Reinforcement learning, hybridisation of classical and AI techniques, federation of Small Language Models (or agents) will be discussed. 
 These topics will be presented by a lineup of distinguished speakers who are expert in their respective fields. The day will conclude with a panel discussion allowing exchanges with the audience and trigger discussions on the interaction between the various domains presented during the day. 
 This event is ideal for AI/ML researchers, data scientists, hardware designers, software developers, sustainability advocates, and anyone interested in the future directions of AI and ML for Design, Automation and Test.

 Special Day "Emerging Computing Paradigms" 
 -formerly "Unconventional Computing"- 
 Sustaining increasingly challenging compute workloads requires going beyond technology scaling with von Neumann architectures in traditional CMOS. Examples include NP-hard optimisation, massive sensor processing in IoT, as well as deep learning and artificial intelligence where training compute requirements grow by ~750x every two years. Therefore, rethinking computing toward more sustainable and efficient solutions is urgently needed. This can take place by bringing computation closer to its physical substrate, or by seeking new computing paradigms across all layers of the compute stack, thereby spanning architecture, circuit, and device solutions. 
 The Special Day on Emerging Computing Paradigms covers key emerging topics in the areas of quantum computing, neuromorphic engineering, physics-based computing, probabilistic computing, reversible and adiabatic computing, and cellular automata. Starting with talks by key experts and closing with a panel discussion, this Special Day aims to outline tradeoffs and synergies in the wide landscape of unconventional computing approaches.

 Special Initiative “Autonomous Systems Design” 
 Fueled by the progress of Artificial Intelligence, autonomous systems are increasingly becoming integral parts of many Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) applications, such as automated driving, robotics, avionics, industrial automation and smart systems in general. Autonomous systems are self-governed and self-adaptive systems that are designed to operate in an open and evolving environment, which is not completely defined at design time. This poses a unique challenge to the design and verification of dependable autonomous systems. The DATE Special Initiative on Autonomous Systems Design will include peer-reviewed papers, special sessions and interactive sessions addressing these challenges.

 Unplugged Sessions on Unconventional Computing 
 Come join us for stimulating brainstorm discussions in small groups about the future of digital engineering. Our focus this year will be on Unconventional Computing. Unconventional computing is computing by any of a wide range of new or unusual methods. Examples are analogue mechanical, analogue electrical, biological, membrane, optical, fluidics, micromechanical, etc. computing. In this session we will on the one hand look into different examples of unconventional computing and will subsequently explore the commonalities and foundations of these approaches. Abstraction and analogy seem to always be at the heart of unconventional computing approaches. Furthermore, the value (performance, cost, energy consumption) of these approaches seems to lie in their restriction to a particular class of problems. (Electrical) analogue computing for example excels at solving differential equations. We will try to chart the boundaries of operation where value is created. 
 We consider quantum computing to be outside the scope of the unplugged session. 
 If you want to get involved in the discussions, please contact the chairs accordingly.

 Focus Session proposals must consist of an extended summary of up to 1,500 words in a PDF file, describing the topic, the authors/speakers and the format and must be submitted athref="https://softconf.com/date25/focus-session/" - https://softconf.com/date25/focus-session/(link is external)
byFriday, 11 October 2024 AoE. The submitter of a Focus Session proposal will be notified of acceptance or rejection of his/her proposal byTuesday, 19 November 2024 AoE. In case of acceptance, contributors of accepted Focus Sessions will be asked to submit final texts or statements of panellists, as appropriate, for publication in the proceedings as final, camera-ready manuscripts byFriday, 17 January 2025 AoE. Panel sessions are entitled to one (1) page per panellist in the proceedings; Hot-Topic Sessions are allocated a maximum of six (6) pages paper per speaker or one single paper for the entire session which should not exceed ten (10) pages. As a rule of thumb, no more than four speakers per session should be planned for Hot-Topic Sessions. For the accepted Focus Sessions, it is the responsibility of the Focus Session organiser(s) to ensure that theFriday, 17 January 2025 AoEdeadline is met and all the camera-ready manuscripts from their respective Focus Sessions are technically sound and meet the editorial standards of the DATE proceedings. The Focus Session Co-Chairs may decline the publication of the final manuscripts in the DATE proceedings if the above responsibility is not fulfilled. Accepted or invited speakers to the Focus Sessions will be required to register for the conference. 
 Further Instructions for Focus Session Submissions 
 In addition to the above-stated important instructions, e.g. w.r.t. author list and double submissions, please adhere to the following: 
 Session Chair/Co-Chair: Every special session submission must name a chair and a co-chair; the chair and the co-chair are responsible for the preparation of the session and for the monitoring of the session; they cannot be selected among the moderators/panelists, or speakers/presenters.

 Technical tutorials on selected topics will be given by leading experts in their respective fields. The submission should motivate the topic and its relevance for both academia and industry, specify whether it covers foundational topics or cutting-edge ones, describe the target audience (expected type of attendees? expected number? match with typical DATE audience?), the reason for a tutorial (why a tutorial, why now). Hands-on tutorials are welcomed. Moreover, the submission should include a brief abstract with a list of learning objectives, and a clear planning hereto (organisation in sessions, possible speakers, what will be done to attract the audience), and the DATE topic to which it is more closely related. We target few top-quality well-attended tutorials. In particular, we look for hands-on and tutorials on fundamentals which should clearly identified in the proposal. Extended conference talks will not be accepted as tutorials. Marketing of company tools are not accepted either. 
 A tutorial submission example is availablehref="/DATE2025-Tutorial-Template.docx" - here for download

HACK@DATE – HackTheSilicon: The World's Largest Hardware Security Challenge 
 HackTheSilicon is a premier global hardware security competition co-located with leading conferences such as DAC, USENIX, and CHES. As hardware and firmware become increasingly central to our digital infrastructure, so do the risks associated with their vulnerabilities. Security-critical flaws in hardware can lead to severe consequences, from data breaches to system compromises, threatening entire computing platforms with implications even for national security. To address these challenges, the brightest minds in academia and industry must collaborate to identify and mitigate these risks. 
 Organized by a consortium of industry and academic leaders—including Intel, Synopsys, the Technical University of Darmstadt (Germany), and Texas A&M University (USA)—this challenge is a cutting-edge platform for testing and advancing hardware security techniques. Since its inception in 2018, HackTheSilicon has attracted hundreds of participants from around the globe, fostering innovation and collaboration in the field. This year, HackTheSilicon expanded to the Design Automation and Test in Europe (DATE) conference with HACK@DATE, further solidifying its reputation as a leading hardware security challenge. The competition continues to promote innovation, encourage collaboration, and bridge the gap between academia and industry. 
 The competition replicates real-world scenarios where security engineers identify vulnerabilities in a given design. Contestants compete to: 
 Discover security vulnerabilities. 
 Implement exploits demonstrating these weaknesses. 
 Propose mitigation strategies or patches. 
 Report findings with comprehensive documentation. 
 The open-source SoC used in the competition, riddled with security flaws, has been co-developed by Intel, TU Darmstadt, and Texas A&M. Vulnerabilities span a wide range of scenarios, from data corruption to sensitive information leakage, providing participants with a diverse and realistic challenge. 
 Who Can Take on the Challenge? 
 HACK@DATE is open to teams from industry, academia, or hybrid collaborations. Participants will receive an altered OpenTitan SoC design riddled with planted security vulnerabilities. Your mission: 
 Identify vulnerabilities in the design. 
 Assess their impact on the system. 
 Develop exploits to demonstrate their severity. 
 Propose robust mitigations to address the issues. 
 Teams are free to use any tools or techniques and must submit a detailed report on their findings. Submissions will be evaluated based on the number and severity of discovered vulnerabilities, exploit sophistication, and the quality of the mitigation proposals, including automation methods and tools. 
 Two Phases, One Goal 
 The competition unfolds in two phases: 
 Phase 1: Teams analyze the provided SoC design and submit their findings. 
 Phase 2: Only the top-performing teams from Phase 1 will advance to the showdown during | DATE 2025 | , where the best will compete for the top honors. 
 Why Participate? 
 This is your chance to: 
 Push the boundaries of hardware security innovation. 
 Collaborate with global experts in industry and academia. 
 Solve real-world security challenges with high stakes. 
 Showcase your expertise on an international stage. 
 Are you ready to outsmart the vulnerabilities and make your mark in the world of hardware security? Join HACK@DATE and prove it! 
 Honoring the Innovators 
 The winners of this year’s challenge will be recognized during the prestigious DATE award ceremony, celebrating their contributions to advancing the field of hardware security.

SoC Labs: The academic community for System On Chip development 
 This workshop focuses on how the academic community can simplify SoC design in an ARM-based ecosystem. Our community-based projects range from microcontroller based designs undertaken by PhD or Masters students to complex A class processor systems developed by research teams. The workshop aims to combine presentations by individual project teams from around the world with practical skills training on how you too can take a SoC design from concept to tape out. 
 The workshop will start with the presentation of SoC Labs and projects, selected from the participants of thehref="https://soclabs.org/article/soc-design-contest-202425-understanding-our-world" - "Understanding our world" research and education design contest(link is external)
. We will present actual silicon devices and results from academic projects using a low cost ASIC fabrication path and verification board based on the community's reusable nanoSoC reference design. The workshop will then have an education section on how to structure a SoC design project, the range of SoC reference designs from simple microcontroller to complex Linux based systems and advanced techniques such as the use of 'Chiplets'. The aim of the workshop is to enable the development of more academic SoC design projects and make it more accessible for individuals and organizations who may have no prior experience, especially in ASIC fabrication. Finally, SoC Labs will announce a new SoC design contest for the coming year along with details of support from initial design to final tape out.
