AIMS AND SCOPE ********************** The International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology (QUATIC) is a leading scientific conference that gathers experts from industry and academia to exchange ideas and approaches regarding all quality aspects in ICT systems engineering and management. This forum seeks to foster lively discussion on how to further the state-of-the-art and define future directions, as well as to disseminate advanced new methods, techniques, and tools. QUATIC 2024, now in its 17th edition, will be hosted in Pisa, in the beautiful region of Tuscany in central Italy straddling the Arno just before it empties into the Tyrrhenian Sea. QUATIC 2024 invites practitioners and researchers to submit technical papers reporting original research and experience results in all topics and sub-fields of Quality in ICT process, product and applications domains, as well as sharing practical studies. The conference is organized into thematic tracks that serve as dedicated discussion venues on focused topics of interest, mixing well-established traditional QUATIC topics and newly proposed tracks covering breakthrough research challenges: - Emerging Topics and Technologies in Requirements Engineering - Alessio Ferrari (CNR) and Sallam Abualhaija (University of Luxembourg) - Human Factors for Quality Software - Rodrigo Santos (UNIRIO) and Xiaofeng Wang (Free University of Bozen-Bolzano) - ICT Process Improvement, Organisation, and Governance - Gleison Santos (UNIRIO) and Edna Canedo (Universidade de BrasÃ­lia (UnB)) - Innovative Strategies for Total Quality in Business Processes and Software - Mohamad Kassab (Pennsylvania State University) and Phillip Laplante (NIST) - Quality Aspects of Empirical Studies - Roberto Verdecchia (University of Florence) and Marcos Kalinowski (PUC-Rio) - Quality Aspects of Services and Cloud Computing - Vasilios Andrikopoulos (University of Groningen) and Elisabetta Di Nitto (Politecnico di Milano) - Quality in Adaptive Software - Claudia Raibulet (Universita' degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca) and Karthik Vaidhyanathan (International Institute of Information Technology) - Quality in the Age of AI - Grace Lewis (Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute) and Domenico Bianculli (University of Luxembourg) - Sustainability as a Quality Concern - Luis Cruz (Delft Technical University) and Maja Kirkeby (Roskilde University) - Verification, Validation, and Testing - Mercedes Merayo (Universidad Complutense de Madrid) and Filippo Ricca (University of Genova) The relevant topics specific to each track are available from the conference website athref="https://2024.quatic.org/thematic-tracks" - https://2024.quatic.org/thematic-tracks.

SUBMISSIONS ****************** QUATIC 2024 accepts the following types of contributions: * Research and experience papers (full papers, between 12 and 16 pages). Full papers should describe novel and scientifically rigorous contributions to any aspect related to the quality of ICT systems. Experience papers should present original reports on relevant industrial case studies. * Innovative and exploratory papers (short papers, between 6 and 8 pages). Short papers should describe new, unconventional approaches that fundamentally challenge established research directions and current state of practice, but which are at an early stage of investigation. All papers must conform to the Springer CCIS Format [1] and be submitted through the EasyChair linkhref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=quatic2024" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=quatic2024
, selecting the track that best suits their field. QUATIC 2024 will employ a double-blind review process. Authors of full and short papers should submit a PDF version of their paper without names and affiliations, or other elements that allow the authors' identification, to guarantee a double-blind review process. Submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the track's Program Committee. Work without substantial new material or failing to follow length and formatting guidelines will be desk rejected and therefore will not be reviewed. The iThenticate plagiarism checker [2] will be used to verify submissions' originality. Authors need to comply with Springer Nature Code of Conduct [3] and QUATIC's Code of Ethical Conduct [4]. PROCEEDINGS ******************* Accepted full and short papers will be included in the proceedings of QUATIC 2024, subject to one of the authors registering for the conference.
