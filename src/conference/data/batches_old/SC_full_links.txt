SC25
November 16–21, 2025 St. Louis, MO
Established in 1988 
 The annual SC conference has grown steadily in size and impact over time, drawing more than 13,000 attendees over the last several years. SC is held in a different city in the United States each year. SC20 was our first virtual event due to the global pandemic. 
 A Diverse Community 
 SC has built a diverse community of participants including researchers, scientists, application developers, computing center staff and management, computing industry staff, agency program managers, journalists, and congressional staffers. This diversity is one of the conference’s strengths, making it a yearly “must attend” forum for stakeholders throughout the technical computing community. 
 The Technical Program 
 The Technical Program is the heart of the SC conference. It has addressed virtually every area of scientific and engineering research, as well as technological development and education. The Technical Program‘s presentations, tutorials, panels, and discussion forums have shared breakthroughs and inspired innovative ideas in the field of HPC. 
 Site Selection 
 The SC Conference selects conference sites in the United States through a competitive bid process at least five years prior to each conference to ensure the best possible experience for diverse attendees from around the world. The size of SC as well as the infrastructure and technical networking requirements limit the number of convention centers and cities that can host the international SC audience. The site selection process attempts to balance the necessary infrastructure needs with aspects of the location that impact the attendee’s experience. 
 Sponsoring Societies 
 ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, is the world’s largest educational and scientific computing society, uniting computing educators, researchers, and professionals to inspire dialogue, share resources, and address the field's challenges. With more than 90,000 members worldwide, ACM strengthens the computing profession‘s collective voice through strong leadership, promotion of the highest standards, and recognition of technical excellence. ACM supports the professional growth of its members by providing opportunities for lifelong learning, career development, and professional networking. 
 acm.orgWith nearly 100,000 members, the IEEE Computer Society is the world's leading organization of computer professionals. Founded in 1946, the Computer Society is the largest of the 37 societies of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The Computer Society's vision is to be the leading provider of technical information and services to the world's computing professionals. The Society is dedicated to advancing the theory, practice, and application of computer and information processing technology.
