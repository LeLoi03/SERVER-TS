 ISAGA Conference 2025 
 Welcome to the 56th International Simulation and Gaming Association's Conference 2025 
 The ISAGA Conference will take place from July 15-18, 2025 
 in Stuttgart, Germany 
 Founded in the seventies,href="https://isaga.com/" - ISAGA
is one of the oldest communities of people involved in the domain of gaming and simulation. Its members cover a vast knowledge and tradition in developing and using simulation, gaming, and related methods. Today, the community brings together researchers and practitioners from the fields of management, social and environmental sciences, education, planning, and technical sciences. They study the design, facilitation, and debriefing methods as well as evaluation protocols of gaming/simulation.Join us at the Stuttgart conference for dynamic discussions and fresh insights on this fascinating topic!

 We are "Shaping the Future" through Simulation & Gaming 
 In a world where uncertainty looms large, simulation and gaming provide us with powerful tools to explore, experiment, and envision the future. Whether it’s modeling the impact of climate change, predicting market trends, or designing urban landscapes, simulation and gaming empower us to shape a better tomorrow. Let’s discuss the opportunities and challenges of “shaping the future” through simulation and gaming. 
 ISAGA Conference meets EUPF​ 
 The European Simulation And Gaming Forum (EUPF) is one of the largest simulation game conferences in Europe for the German-speaking community, which takes place every two years. In 2025 it will be integrated into the ISAGA Conference: We will therefore bring together the best of two worlds and experience a lot of interaction and discussion with very special event formats at our conference.

 We are awarding the Global Simulation & Gaming Award 
 Hosting the ISAGA 2025 conference in Stuttgart, ZMS together with ISAGA decided to launch a global competition with an award cermony. Thehref="https://zms.dhbw-stuttgart.de/en/research/global-simulation-gaming-award/" - Global Simulation & Gaming Award
acknowledges and honours outstanding academic theses within the broad spectrum of Simulation and Gaming. Up to three prizes will be awarded for final theses and a special prize will be awarded for dissertations. 
 We are celebrating 25 Years of SAGSAGA 
 SAGSAGA celebrates a remarkable milestone — 25 years of advancing simulation and gaming. From its origins to today’s stage, SAGSAGA has fostered creativity and cross-disciplinary exchange. As part of the ISAGA Conference 2025, we want to look back together on eventful 25 years, raise our glasses and celebrate the anniversary together.

 We are "Shaping the Future" through Simulation & Gaming 
 In a world where uncertainty looms large, simulation and gaming provide us with powerful tools to explore, experiment, and envision the future. Whether it is modelling the impact of climate change, predicting market trends, or designing urban landscapes, simulation and gaming empower us to shape a better tomorrow. Let’s discuss the opportunities and challenges of “shaping the future” through simulation and gaming. 
 Content 
 The theme of our conference is „Shaping the Future through Simulation and Gaming“. We are pleased to offer generous space for future-oriented topics and to engage in a dialogue about the role of simulation and gaming in this context. 
 Submissions on topics with the following focus are particularly welcome: 
 Artificial intelligence, big data and automation 
 Augmented and virtual reality 
 Sustainability and climate change 
 Resilience and adaptability 
 City and spatial planning, infrastructure use or development (transport, energy, water…) 
 Urban planning and public participation 
 New work and organisational development 
 Society in transition 
 Innovative social work 
 Lifelong learning and future skills 
 Future-oriented learning and teaching in schools, universities and other institutions 
 Research on facilitation and evaluation 
 Innovations in the public sector 
 National and international conflicts 
 Dealing with crisis and disaster management 
 The above-mentioned future topics can be considered from a wide variety of simulation and gaming aspects. Be it questions relating to new games and methods, areas of application, facilitation, evaluation etc. Everything is welcome. This also applies to rather general submissions on the subject of simulation and gaming. As always, we look forward to everyone contributing to the discourse. 
 Types of Contributions 
 We look forward to receiving numerous submissions and a lively participation in our conference.You can submit entries for the following categories. All submissions will be subjected to a quality check and assigned to suitable presentation formats.

 Outside the box 
 Scientific Papers 
 Scientific papers present qualitative or quantitative empirical research and discuss findings. Submissions that offer background research, literature reviews, or theoretical analyses on specific topics are also welcome. 
 Accepted papers will allow for an oral presentation of the work during an interactive paper session. We highly encourage submissions that align with the above-mentioned theme of the conference. Full and short papers may be submitted, covering mature results or addressing early work. All papers should be following the Springer LNCS format and adhere with the guidelines of Springer, and present novel and relevant findings in Simulation and Gaming.

 Please take note on the following requirements: 
 Papers must be written in English 
 Papers shall be about 6-15 pages including abstract, figures, tables, and references 
 Abstracts must be within 150-250 words 
 Paper format must follow the Springer LNCS format. ( | more information here | ) 
 Please submit your papers in anonymised form via Conftool 
 Best Practice Papers 
 In contrast to scientific papers, this category focuses on contributions with a high practical approach. We welcome experience reports, best practice case studies and other submissions that provide guidance and inspiration for practical applications in the field of gaming and simulation. 
 All papers will be peer-reviewed. Accepted papers will allow for an oral presentation of the work during a paper session, therefore at least one of the authors must attend the conference. Selected papers will be published in English in ourhref="https://zms.dhbw-stuttgart.de/en/research/zms-publication-series/" - ZMS publication series
. 
 Please take note on the following requirements: 
 Papers must be written in English 
 Papers must be about 4-15 pages, including abstract, figures, tables and references 
 Abstracts must be within 150-250 words 
 Posters 
 Work and ideas at an early stage can also be submitted as poster to the conference. During the conference, there will be an opportunity to present the posters and to engage with the conference participants. Abstracts (300-600 words) are required for submission and acceptance as poster presentations. 
 At least one of the authors must attend the conference. 
 Based on the reviews, papers that are not accepted for presentation may be recommended to be included as a poster presentation, too. 
 Please submit: 
 A summary detailing the topic from 300 up to 600 words 
 Workshops 
 Workshops are interactive events centered on a certain topic, issue or game. They are collaborative and active, not mere presentations. 
 Facilitators invite participants to actively work on a topic or design artefacts or focus on the design, play an exploration of games. They involve participants in hands-on exploration and creation. Organizers of workshops may request either 60 or 90-minute time slots, which should be specified in the proposal. We welcome submissions that resonate with the conference theme. Please provide a brief description of the workshop topics, activities, structure, setup and information about the facilitators. The program committee will evaluate all submissions. 
 Please send us your proposal including: 
 The name(s) of the workshop organizer(s), 
 A summary detailing the topic from 300 up to 600 words 
 Please include the design, the activity and how it involves participants 
 Outside the box 
 A format for anyone who is thinking sideways! 
 Dealing with the future means being open to new ideas. That’s why the ISAGA Conference 2025 has the ‘outside the box’ category. Any submissions that cannot be assigned to the classic types of submissions are welcome here. Do you have creative ideas that go beyond classic presentation and workshop formats (i.e. a small game, a new method, a warmup,…)? Then this category is for you! 
 Please send us your proposal including: 
 The name(s) of the organizer(s) 
 A summary detailing the topic from 300 up to 600 words 
 Please explain the design, including the time frame and spatial requirements and involvement of attendees
