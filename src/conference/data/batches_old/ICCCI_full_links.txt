 17thInternational Conference on Computational Collective Intelligence 
 12-15 November 2025, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam 
  
 Category B 
 in the 2021 CORE conference rankingsICCCI 2025 is an international scientific conference for research in the field of Computational Collective Intelligence, to be held on 12-15 November 2025 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. 
 The aim of this conference is to provide an internationally respected forum for scientific research in the computer-based methods of collective intelligence and their applications. The scope of ICCCI 2025 includes all topics related with processing data and knowledge from autonomous sources, especially in: collective processing, knowledge integration, data integration, group decision making, multi-criteria decision making, consensus computing, and social networks. 
 The conference is hosted by VNU-HCM International University, Vietnam and jointly organized by Wrocław University of Science and Technology, Poland in cooperation with with IEEE SMC Technical Committee on Computational Collective Intelligence and European Research Center for Information Systems (ERCIS) / The proceedings of ICCCI 2025 will be published by Springer in series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence LNCS/LNAI and and Communications in Computer and Information Science CCIS. 
 The conference will take placeexclusivelyon-site. All accepted papers must be presented in person during the conference in Vietnam.

 Computational Collective Intelligence 
 Our Goal 
 Computational Collective Intelligence (CCI) strives to cover new methodological, theoretical, and practical aspects of computational collective intelligence understood as the form of intelligence that emerges from the collaboration and competition of many individuals (artificial and/or natural). The goal of this technical committee is to provide a forum for exchanging scientific research and technological achievements accomplished by the international community. It focuses on research and applications of the computational methods of Collective Intelligence and their applications in a wide range of fields such as the semantic web, social networks and multi-agent systems, group decision making, and consensus computing. 
 Join Us 
 We welcome anyone who is interested in the field of Computational Collective Intelligence to join us. We may share and discuss new results in research, development and applications of Computational Collective Intelligence and promote an exchange of ideas and cooperation. As a member of this TC, you will be invited to participate in organizing events arranged by us, and to submit papers to our publications. To join, please contact the TC Chair.
