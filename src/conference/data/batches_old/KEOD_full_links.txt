Knowledge Engineering (KE) encompasses the technical, scientific, and social aspects of building, maintaining, and utilizing knowledge-based systems. It draws on AI, databases, expert systems, decision support systems, and software engineering, while integrating insights from logic, cognitive science, and socio-cognitive engineering. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) and Low-code/No-code Platforms have expanded KE’s reach by enabling automated ontology generation and greater accessibility. 
  
 Ontology Development (OD) focuses on creating reusable semantic structures like vocabularies, glossaries, and formal ontologies. These structures are essential in applications such as knowledge graphs, digital twins, explainable AI (XAI), cybersecurity, and IoT interoperability. Ontologies also play a crucial role in ensuring ethical AI development, mitigating bias, and enhancing transparency. 
  
 KEOD serves as a key venue for researchers and practitioners to explore traditional and cutting-edge topics like LLM-based Ontology Development, Ontology-driven Digital Twins, and Ontology-enhanced Low-code Platforms, fostering innovation in KE and OD across academia and industry.
