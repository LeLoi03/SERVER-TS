Conference ISITA:

ISITA2024 Welcome 
 ISITA2024 — November 10–13, 2024 — National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, TAIWAN 
 The International Symposium on Information Theory and Its Applications (ISITA) is a leading conference on information theory. Since its inception in 1990, ISITA has been a forum for interdisciplinary interaction, gathering leading researchers to discuss topics of common interest in the field of information theory. 
 In 2024, the ISITA will be held on November 10–13 at National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (Taiwan Tech), Taipei, TAIWAN.ISITA 2024 creates a setting for international exchange to provide a place for individuals, especially young researchers including students, to know the joy of research, and to share new results in information theory and its applications with the world. 
 ISITA 2024 is planned as an in-person conference.
