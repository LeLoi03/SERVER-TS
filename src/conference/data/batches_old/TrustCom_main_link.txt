 Introduction 
 As computer systems, communication networks and artificial intelligence (AI) undergo rapid development, accompanied by increasing complexity, the expectations of users for trust, security, and privacy have grown considerably. This presents a significant challenge, as traditional security technologies and measures may struggle to meet the evolving demands within open, dynamic, heterogeneous, mobile, wireless, and distributed computing environments. Consequently, the imperative is to construct systems and networks that enable users to access more comprehensive services while concurrently upholding trust, security, and privacy. In response to this challenge, trusted computing and communications have emerged as pivotal and innovative technologies, capturing the heightened interest of researchers. These advancements offer promising solutions to address the intricate demands of contemporary computing landscapes. 
  
 The IEEE TrustCom-2024 (23rd IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications) is a forum for presenting leading works on trusted computing, communications, networking and machine learning, with regard to trust, security, privacy, reliability, dependability, survivability, availability, and fault tolerance aspects of computer systems and networks, as well as AI. 
  
 The 23rd IEEE TrustCom continues the tradition of successful IEEE TrustCom conferences held from 2002 to 2023 across Asia, Europe, Australia, and America. It will feature sessions of regular presentations, workshops, tutorials and keynote speeches. TrustCom-2024 will be hosted in Sanya, China. Sanya, a picturesque coastal city, offers an ideal setting for the conference and provides opportunities for exploration, including visits to renowned sites such as Tianya Haijiao, Wuzhizhou Coral Island, and the beaches of Yalong Bay. 
  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to TrustCom-2024. Accepted papers will be submitted for possible inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore's scope and quality requirements. The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.
