 Welcome to Rome 
 The Eternal City welcomes you! Throughout the centuries, the magic of Rome has been recounted on paper in the words of poets and writers, wonderfully depicted in the works of great artists. Rome's grandiose monuments, hundreds of churches, and spectacular fountains outline its marvellous skyline, making it the city with the highest concentration of historical, archaeological, and architectural heritage worldwide. Its historic centre, bounded by the perimeter of the Aurelian Walls, is an overlay of evidence spanning nearly three millennia and has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The heart of Catholic Christianity, Rome is also the only city in the world to host a foreign state within its borders, the enclave of Vatican City.

 Upon exiting the station, head towards the Basilica di San Paolo. If you're on the right side, you'll easily spot the white bell tower of the Basilica. 
 Proceed to cross the traffic light and continue westward along Viale Ferdinando Baldelli, staying left-hand sidewalk. 
 At the traffic lights, shortly after passing the Bambino Gesù Hospital, make a left turn onto Via Tullio Levi Civita, ensuring you stay on the right-hand sidewalk. 
 As soon as you reach the intersection of Via Tullio Levi Civita and Viale Marconi, cross Viale Marconi. 
 Continue straight for one more block along Via Corrado Segrè. Here, you will reach the pedestrian gate of the Faculty, identifiable by the University's distinctive pyramid-shaped logo. 
 Alternatively, bus 170, which connects Stazione Termini (an interchange stop between the A and B metro lines) with the EUR district, stops at Viale Guglielmo Marconi, just one block away from the venue in both southbound and northbound directions. Additionally, bus 23 departs from the terminal bus stop at Largo San Leonardo Murialdo, just a 5-minute walk from the venue, and provides a direct connection to the Vatican City district. It's important to note that the bus service may experience delays during heavy traffic or rush hours. Furthermore, bus 670 has its terminus at Via Salvatore Pincherle, which is about 400 meters far from the conference venue. It is important to note that the bus service may experience delays during heavy traffic or rush hours.

 Welcome to Rome 
 The Eternal City welcomes you! Throughout the centuries, the magic of Rome has been recounted on paper in the words of poets and writers, wonderfully depicted in the works of great artists. Rome's grandiose monuments, hundreds of churches, and spectacular fountains outline its marvellous skyline, making it the city with the highest concentration of historical, archaeological, and architectural heritage worldwide. Its historic centre, bounded by the perimeter of the Aurelian Walls, is an overlay of evidence spanning nearly three millennia and has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The heart of Catholic Christianity, Rome is also the only city in the world to host a foreign state within its borders, the enclave of Vatican City.

(please exclusively use this provided link for submissions). As per tradition, paper designated as "full paper" will be included in the post-proceedings published in SpringerLecture Notes in Computer Science(LNCS).Regular paper submission guidelines 
 The following two paper categories are welcome. Any submission must be explicitly marked as “full paper” or “short paper”.Full papers | – scientific research papers, surveying works and industrial experiences describing significant C(I)IP advances. Papers should be no longer than 20 pages, including bibliography and well‐marked appendices. These submissions correspond to what was previously indicated as "regular papers" in the call for papers. 
 Short papers | – early results or work in progress with initial findings. Papers should be 4 to 6 pages long, including bibliography and well‐marked appendices. These submissions correspond to what was previously indicated as "ongoing research" in the call for papers. Short papers will be presented as posters and they will NOT be included in the post-proceedings published in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). 
 All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. All paper submissions must contain a title, a short abstract, and a list of keywords. All submissions will be subjected to a thoroughdouble‐blind reviewby at least three reviewers. Submitted papers shall be anonymised, and all author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, and obvious traceable references should be eliminated to be eligible for the review process.Submission 
 Submitted manuscripts should represent significant and novel research contributions. All manuscripts will have to be submitted in anonymized form for double-blind review. (Seehttps://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/6/228027-effectiveness-of-anonymization-in-double-blind-review/abstractfor arguments substantiating this change.) To that effect:The title page should not contain any author names or affiliations. 
 Authors should carefully review figures and appendices (especially survey instruments) to ensure affiliations are not accidentally included. 
 When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. Only blind the reference itself in the (unusual) case that a third-person reference is infeasible. 
 Authors may include links to websites that contain source code, tools, or other supplemental material. Neither the link in the paper nor the website or any of the materials therein may contain the authors’ names and affiliations. 
 Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.While submitted papers must be anonymous, authors may choose to give talks about their work, post a preprint of the paper online, disclose security vulnerabilities to vendors or the public, etc. during the review process. Submissions should be made according to the Springer LNCS format. For optimisation reasons, authors are encourage to use the followingLaTeX Proceedings Templates, available in the scentific autoring platform Overleaf.
