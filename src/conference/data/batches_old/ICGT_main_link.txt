 ICGT 2025 
 The18th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2025)will be held in Koblenz, Germany, as part ofhref="https://conf.researchr.org/home/staf-2025" - STAF 2025
(Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). The conference takes place under the auspices of EASST,EATCS, andIFIP WG 1.3. 
 Aims and Scope 
 The use of graphs and graph-like structures as a formalism for specification and modelling is widespread in all areas of computer science as well as in many fields of computational research and engineering. Relevant examples include software architectures, pointer structures, state space and control/data flow graphs, UML and other domain-specific models, network layouts, topologies of cyber-physical environments, quantum computing and molecular structures. Often, these graphs undergo dynamic change, ranging from reconfiguration and evolution to various kinds of behaviour, all of which may be captured by rule-based graph manipulation. Thus, graphs and graph transformation form a fundamental universal modelling paradigm that serves as a means for formal reasoning and analysis, ranging from the verification of certain properties of interest to the discovery of fundamentally new insights. 
 ICGT aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas. The conference not only serves as a well-established scientific publication outlet, but also as a platform to boost inter- and intra-disciplinary research and to leeway for new ideas.

 href="#submission-types" - Submission Types
Authors are invited to submit research papers in three possible categories. The accepted papers will be published as LNCS volume. 
 (1)Regular research papersincluding papers describing applications and case studies. Papers will be evaluated with respect to their originality, significance, and technical soundness. Additional material intended for reviewers (but not publication) may be included in a clearly marked appendix. 16 pages in theLNCS style, excluding references and appendices. 
 (2)Tool presentation papers, which demonstrate the main features and functionality of graph-based tools. A tool presentation may have an appendix with a detailed demo description which will be reviewed but not included in the proceedings. 8 pages in theLNCS style, excluding references and appendices. 
 (3)Blue Skies, reporting on new research directions or ideas which are not yet sufficiently developed to fit in other categories. 8 pages in theLNCS style, excluding references and appendices. 
 Furthermore, there will also be ahref="https://conf.researchr.org/track/icgt-2025/icgt-2025-journal-first" - Journal-First track
allowing for previously published work (in book chapters, journals, or other conferences since 2021) to be presented at ICGT 2025. 
 Special Issue 
 Authors of the best papers at the conference will be invited to prepare and submit extended journal versions to be considered for publication in a special issue after an independent round of peer review (details TBA). 
 Research Track 
 Papers must be submitted using the STAF 2025 Easychair instance (selecting the ICGT track during the submission process):
