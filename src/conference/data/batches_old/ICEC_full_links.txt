 University of Amazon State - EST 
 Manaus/Amazonas, Brazil, September 30-October 3, 2024

 Submission link | href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icec20241" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icec20241 
 The International Federation for Information Processing invites researchers and practitioners in Entertainment Computing to submit their contributions to the The 23rd International Conference on Entertainment Computing (IFIP-ICEC 2024), to be held in Manaus, capital of the Amazon, Brazil on September 30th to October 3rd. 
 Topics and tracks 
 Journal Track 
 Our Journal track will be published as a special issue of the prestigious Elsevier Entertainment Computing Journal (ENTCOM) (https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/entertainment-computing). We invite authors to submit their strong and mature works to this track, which will have a double blind revision process with a short time for rebuttals. Accepted papers will be presented in the conference too, and they will be published at a later date. Papers presented for the journal track should follow the submission and publication process of ENTCOM. 
 Conference Track 
 Accepted conference papers will be published in a book form in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Accepted papers will be scheduled for long presentations and discussion at the conference. 
 Works in Progress 
 Work in Progress (WiP) contributions provide an opportunity to present late-breaking work, new experimental projects, research in early phases or with more limited scope than typical full papers. A WiP submission is a shorter submission describing the research problem, contribution, and value to the community, submitted as a PDF file. Accepted papers will be included into the official Springer LNCS proceedings and will be scheduled for presentation and discussion at the conference. 
 Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works 
 Interactive demonstrations, installations and games show early implementations of novel, interesting, and important entertainment computing concepts, systems, installations or games, or can serve to showcase results not previously described in the research literature. 
 Both research and industry are encouraged to submit and showcase demonstrators of novel approaches to entertainment. We particularly encourage demonstrations with which attendees can interact and play. 
 Student Game and Interactive Entertainment Competition 
 All students up to and including PhD candidate level are eligible to send in their game or interactive entertainment installation, as long as the demonstrator is fully experiential, and the demonstrator is part of a research endeavor. This could be a platform to perform research with, a research through design contribution, or a design exemplar of something that advances the state of the art, but the paper detailing the game or interactive entertainment installation should make clear what the development of it may add to our knowledge of games and entertainment. 
 Doctoral Consortium 
 The Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for doctoral students to explore and develop their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of distinguished researchers in entertainment computing and/or serious games. We invite students who feel they would benefit from this kind of feedback on their dissertation work to apply for this unique opportunity to share their work with students in a similar situation as well as senior researchers in the field. The strongest candidates will be those who have a clear idea and an area, and have made some progress, but who are not so far along that they can no longer make changes. Also, as well as stating how you will gain from acceptance, both you and your advisor should be clear on what you can contribute to the Doctoral Consortium. 
 Workshops and Tutorials 
 We invite proposals in all areas of entertainment computing and serious games research (see conference topics listed above) and particularly welcome proposals that will focus on and promote discussion on new and emerging trends in these areas.

 Calls for Submissions 
 Full Research Papers 
 Chairs: Helmut Hlavacs, Univ. of Vienna, AUSTRIA and Angelo Di Iorio, Univ. of Bologna, Italy 
 Full papers are the main media for presenting high impact, mature research with original new results. Submissions should describe novel unpublished work addressing one or more of the research topics listed. All technical papers will be published in the official Springer LNCS proceedings. Papers must be submitted using the Springer LNCS format. 
 Paper length should reflect the contribution and maturity of the submission and reviewers from the program committee will be instructed to judge the contribution of a paper relative to its length. For example, typical contributions presenting significant research advances/results should not exceed 12 pages in length excluding references (Full Technical Papers). In addition, videos are encouraged and can be included in the paper or as Electronic Supplementary Material. 
 See the Springer LNCS guidelines on how to include these. The committee may accept submissions conditionally or route them for a different category, when appropriate, and consult with authors to adjust their paper according to the review needs. Accepted papers will be scheduled for long presentations and discussion at the conference. 
 Works in Progress 
 Chairs: Erik van der Spek Eindhoven, University of Technology and Andrea Nuzzolese, National Research Council of Italy 
 Work in Progress (WiP) contributions provide an opportunity to present late-breaking work, new experimental projects, research in early phases or with more limited scope than typical full papers. A WiP submission is a shorter submission describing the research problem, contribution, and value to the community, submitted as a PDF file. Accepted papers will be included into the official Springer LNCS proceedings and will be scheduled for presentation and discussion at the conference. 
 WiP submissions should not exceed 8 pages in length, excl. references, in Springer LNCS format. Submissions with exceeding length relative to their contribution can be rejected. The committee may accept submissions conditionally or route them for a different category, when appropriate, and consult with authors to adjust their paper according to the review needs. 
 Workshops and Tutorials 
 We invite proposals for workshops and tutorials that will be held at IFIP-ICEC 2023. 
 Workshops 
 Chairs: Jannicke Baalsrud Hauge KTH Royal Institute of Technology Sweden and Barbara Goebl University of Wien Austria 
 We invite proposals in all areas of entertainment computing and serious games research (see conference topics listed above) and particularly welcome proposals 
 that will focus on and promote discussion on new and emerging trends in these areas. Workshop proposals must include the following information: 
 – Workshop or tutorial title and short abstract (max. 50 words) 
 – Workshop summary, short review of state of the art, motivation and goals 
 – Workshop format (an activity plan and its rationale towards the goals) 
 – Workshop format for participant enrollment (e.g. position papers, prior expression of interest, or other applicable requirement for planning and organization); 
 – Profile of participants (and estimated number of participants) 
 – Contact of the organizers (name, affiliation, address, phone#, email); 
 – Short but relevant bio information of the organizers; 
 – Expected workshop outcomes (proceedings, special issue of journals, project proposals, etc.); 
 – Proposed workshop due dates (take into consideration conference schedules); workshops can be scheduled for either half a day (4h) or a full day (8h). 
 – Workshops are open to all IFIP-ICEC attendees at no additional cost, even if not submitting contributions. 
 Submissions need to adhere to the stated workshop proposal deadline. Additionally, to be considered for inclusion in the conference proceedings, authors of workshop proposals may also submit a 6 page (maximum, excl. references) paper in the Springer LNCS format, observing the deadline for full paper submission. Regular workshop proposals will not be included in the proceedings. 
 Tutorials 
 Chairs: Allegra De Filippo 
 We invite proposals for tutorials that will be held in conjunction with ICEC 2023. We invite proposals in all areas of entertainment computing (see conference topics listed above) and particularly welcome proposals that will focus on and promote discussion on new and emerging trends. Tutorial proposals should be two pages in length and must include the following information: 
 – Contact information (name, affiliation, address, phone number and email) of the tutorial organizer(s); 
 – Relevant CV information of the tutorial leader(s); 
 – Tutorial title; 
 – Tutorial objective; 
 – Background/relevance of tutorial topic; 
 – Intended duration (3h or 6h); and 
 – Brief summary of the content. 
 To be considered for inclusion in the conference proceedings, authors of tutorial proposals may also submit a 6 page (maximum) paper in the Springer LNCS 
 format, observing the deadline for full paper submission. Regular tutorial proposals will not be included in the proceedings. 
 Interactive Entertainment / Experiential Works 
 Chairs: Jerome Dupire CNAM Paris and Andrea Poltronieri Univ of Bologna 
 Interactive demonstrations, installations and games show early implementations of novel, interesting, and important entertainment computing concepts, systems, installations or games, or can serve to showcase results not previously described in the research literature. 
 Both research and industry is encouraged to send in and showcase demonstrators of novel approaches to entertainment. We particularly encourage demonstrations with which attendees can interact and play. 
 Demonstration, installation, or a game submission is a shorter submission describing a novel approach to entertainment computing concepts. The submissions will be peer-reviewed and should be composed of a document with 4-5 pages using Springer LNCS format, and structured as follows: (1) up to four pages for an extended abstract and (2) a final page that contains the link to an online video, a list of technical requirements (including electrical and connectivity needs), and physical space requirements (including display and footprint needs). Successful submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. 
 The extended abstract should be written according to the underlying structure of the structured abstract and must be clear, straightforward, and easy to understand. The extended abstract must contain the following sections: abstract and keywords, introduction, methodology, findings, conclusion, and references. 
 Sections can be named differently, and subsections can be included. Supporting figures, tables and images of the results may be included in the extended abstract. 
 By default, demos and games will have a table, chairs and internet connection available. By their nature, interactive installations are intended for larger, potentially public spaces. We will try to accommodate for the needs of these types of installations, but please include a minimal set-up so that we know the range of requirements that we will need to meet. Successful authors of demonstration/installation submissions will be contacted by the chair to confirm the availability of the requested resources. The abstract, digital video and requirements supplement must be submitted electronically. 
 Student Game and Interactive Entertainment Competition 
 Chairs: Erik van der Spek and Mara Dionisio 
 Next to the Interactive Entertainment expo, IFIP-ICEC 2023 also organizes a competition for student games and interactive entertainment. All students up to and including PhD candidate level are eligible to send in their game or interactive entertainment installation, as long as the demonstrator is fully experiential, and the demonstrator is part of a research endeavor. This could be a platform to perform research with, a research through design contribution, or a design exemplar of something that advances the state of the art, but the paper detailing the game or interactive entertainment installation should make clear what the development of it may add to our knowledge of games and entertainment. For PhD candidates, this could be a good venue to have the artifact contribution of your game peer reviewed and published in official proceedings. 
 Submissions to the game and interactive entertainment competition should be done in a 4-6 page extended abstract in Springer LNCS format, that among others clearly describes the research goal, a description of the experience of the demonstrator with pictures, and how the demonstrator advances the state of the art. 
 Submissions furthermore require a video of at least 1:30 minutes that clearly shows the experience of the game or interactive entertainment installation. A download link to the executable in case of a game is highly appreciated. Teamwork is allowed, as long as the total amount of work into the game or installation does not exceed 48 person-months. 
 At least one of the student authors on the paper needs to register and be physically present at the conference to showcase the game or installation in order to have a chance at winning the competition. A jury of experts is formed at the conference to select the winner, and the winner will be announced at the end of the conference. 
 There are two submission moments for the student competition. In order to be eligible for the proceedings, you have to submit your paper by the early submission deadline. If you want to participate in the competition without a conference proceedings paper, there is also a late submission deadline. 
 Doctoral Consortium 
 Chair: Esteban Clua 
 The Doctoral Consortium provides an opportunity for doctoral students to explore and develop their research interests in an interdisciplinary workshop, under the guidance of a panel of distinguished researchers in entertainment computing and/or serious games. We invite students who feel they would benefit from this kind of feedback on their dissertation work to apply for this unique opportunity to share their work with students in a similar situation as well as senior researchers in the field. The strongest candidates will be those who have a clear idea and an area, and have made some progress, but who are not so far along that they can no longer make changes. Also, as well as stating how you will gain from acceptance, both you and your advisor should be clear on what you can contribute to the Doctoral Consortium. 
 The Consortium will provide a supportive setting for feedback on students’ current research and guidance on future research directions. It will also offer each student comments and fresh perspectives on their work from researchers and students outside their own institution and promote the development of a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research. 
 Current graduate students pursuing a PhD project who would benefit from detailed workshop discussions of their doctoral research should submit a single PDF file consisting of a 4-page extended abstract of your thesis work in Springer LNCS format, clearly specifying the originality of the work with respect to current concepts and techniques, the importance of the work with respect to fundamental issues and themes in entertainment computing, results to date and their validity and contribution of the work (expected and/or achieved) to entertainment computing and/or serious games. 
 Candidates must also send a biographical note, the sponsor or project grant name (if applicable), and affiliation, as well as a one-paragraph statement of expected benefits of participation for both yourself and the other consortium participants (i.e., what will you contribute as well as gain).
