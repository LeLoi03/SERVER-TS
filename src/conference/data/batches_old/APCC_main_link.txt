 This year, the 30th APCC,also known as APCC 2025, is coming to Japan for the fifth time, thanks to the great effort and strong support from IEICE Communications Society. One of the main purposes of the APCC conference series is to provide researchers and engineers in the AP region with an opportunity to discuss topics related to advanced communication technologies and services, while opening the door to the world. Through those interactive face-to-face discussions, APCC series, as a regular international conference in the AP region, can effectively stimulate research collaborations and developments in future communication technologies. 
 This year, we are excited to hold APCC 2025 in Osaka â€“ Japan.
