 Manuscript Submission 
 Submission and Submission Requirements 
 Paper submissions are managed through EasyChair. 
 Please visit thehref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nca2024" - submission link
to send your manuscript. 
 Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere and must be cleared for publication in the NCA Proceedings, which will be submitted to IEEE Xplore and CSDL. 
 The manuscript must be written in English, and must not exceed 8 pages for regular papers or 4 pages for short papers. NCA follows a single-blind review methodology, but authors can freely choose to omit their names and affiliation in the submitted PDF. The full author list still has to be included in EasyChair during submission. 
 Manuscript page limit 
 Regular Papers: 8 pages, including all figures, tables, and references. 
 Short Papers: 4 pages, including all figures, tables, and references. 
 Purchasing extra pages 
 Regular Papers: Up to 2 extra pages may be purchased at €100 (EUR) per extra page. 
 Short Papers: Up to 1 extra page may be purchased at €100 (EUR). 
 Authors can decide to submit full papers longer than 8 pages (up to 10 pages) before the reviewing process. This is an indication of their will to purchase extra pages during the registration process. Therefore,longer papers accepted as full papers cannot be shrunk when preparing camera ready versions. This is to respect the work made by reviewers and other authors which decided to stay in the limits. Authors who submitted papers as full papers and they were accepted to the conference as short papers, will need to reduce their size to 4 pages (or 5 pages by purchasing 1 extra page) in the camera ready version. 
 Accepted papers and Publication Policies 
 Every regular paper accepted must have attached to it at least one registration at the full rate. Thus, for a manuscript for which all authors are students, one student author will be required to register at the full registration rate. For manuscripts where at least one author is already registered at the full rate, this fulfills the obligation. 
 No-show papersare defined as papers submitted by authors who subsequently did not present the paper at the technical meeting. This year, all presentations will be given in person at the conference venue. No-show papers that were not withdrawn and were published in the Proceedings must be identified as "No-Show" in the files submitted to the Conference Publishing Services (CPS) for further publication.No-shows will not be available on IEEE Xplore or other public access IEEE forums. IEEE CPS will maintain an archive of no-shows. 
 The IEEE CPS strongly discourages changes and, in particular, withdrawals of papers once submitted and included in the program. 
 If under any circumstances it becomes necessary for the author to withdraw or change a paper, IEEE CPS policy dictates that the request to do this must come directly from the author and not from any third party. IEEE CPS policy also states that in this case the author will be held liable for all costs that are incurred. It would then be up to the author to get reimbursed for the expense from any third party if he/she feels it is justified. The IEEE CPS cannot act as a policing entity on behalf of the author in this regard. 
 Best Paper Awards 
 The NCA2024 Program Committee will selectBest PaperandBest Student Paper. The first author of the Best Student Paper must be a BSc/MSc/PhD student.
