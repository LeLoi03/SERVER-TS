18th International KES Conference 
 Welcome to KES-AMSTA-24 
 AMSTA-24 is an international scientific conference for research in the field of agent and multi-agent systems. Agents and multi-agent systems are related to a modern software paradigm which has long been recognized as a promising technology for constructing autonomous, complex and intelligent systems. 
 Consisting of keynote talks by experts in the field, oral and poster presentations, KES-AMSTA-24 will provide an excellent opportunity for researchers to discuss modern approaches and techniques for agent and multi-agent systems and their applications, as well as intelligent systems in the field of social networks, self-organisation and trust. 
 Proceedings 
 The Full Papers conference proceedings will be published bySpringeras book chapters in a volume of theKES Smart Innovation Systems and Technologiesseries, submitted for indexing inScopusand Thomson-ReutersConference Proceedings Citation Index(CPCI) and theWeb of Science. (The Short Papers and Abstracts conference proceedings will be published online and will not appear in the Springer volume). 
 Smart Digital Futures 
 The conference will take place as part of theSmart Digital Futures 2024multi-theme conference which groups AMSTA-24, HCIS-24, IDT-24, InMed-24, SEEL-24 and STS-24 in one venue.
