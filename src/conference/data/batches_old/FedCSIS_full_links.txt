 Themissionof the FedCSIS Conference Series is to provide a presentation, discussion and a reputable publication forum in computer science and intelligence systems. The forum invites researchers and practitioners from around the world to contribute their research results focused on their scientific and professional interests in a chosen area. 
 The FedCSIS conference consists of theMain TrackandThematic Session. Papers submitted to the Main Track can be assigned, by their authors, toTopical Areas,which are managed byTopical Area Curators. Based on the scope of the contribution, Topical Area Curators select its reviewers from theMain TrackProgram Committee. Besides the Main Track, the authors may prefer to submit their papers to Thematic Session, which announce their ownCalls for Thematic Session Papersand are assisted by the FedCSIS Chairs in reaching out to the FedCSIS Community. 
 For all five Topical Areas, situated within a general domain of Computer Science, the continually emerging topic of Intelligence Systems stands as the common denominator. All Thematic Sessions also refer to the Intelligence Systems from different perspectives. They are regarded as a path toward introducing more Intelligence into Computer Science and IT.

 FedCSIS Conference Series Timeline 
 2005: the story begins 
 The first event that the history of FedCSIS conference series can be traced to, took place in 2005. It was the Scientific Session organized within the scope of the 2005 Autumn Meeting of the Polish Information Processing Society (PIPS). 
 2006: first full-blown conference 
 In 2006, the first event under the name International Multiconference on Computer Science and Information Systems (IMCSIT) took place. It was co-located with the 2006 Autumn Meeting of the Polish Information Processing Society. The IMCSIT multiconference was co-located with the Autumn Meetings of PIPS till 2010, when IMCSIT became an independent event under the new name (FedCSIS) and with a somewhat modified formula. 
 2007: data loss 
 In 2007 computers holding data related to the 2005 and 2006 events have been sabotaged by hackers and the web sites for the two events have been lost. What remained intact, were the 2005 and 2006 proceedings, which can be found inhref="https://fedcsis.org/archive/" - conference archive
. 
 2009: IFAC Workshop 
 In 2009, within the scope of the IMCSIT conference, the 30thIFAC Workshop on Real-Time Programming was organized. It resulted in anhref="https://fedcsis.org/archive/proceedings_2009_RTS" - independent proceedings volume
. 
 2011: FedCSIS is born 
 In 2011, the first edition of the Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS) took place. The change in name was related to the recognition that the term multiconference became questionable, due to a number of bad quality multiconferences organized around the world. It was also an initial attempt to bring more structure to the event. 
 2014 and 2015: special events 
 In 2014 and 2015 two special (dissemination) workshops have been organized within the scope of respective FedCSIS conferences. They were: “E2LP Workshop Application of Innovative Teaching Methods in Embedded Engineering” and “QMR Workshop on Logics for Qualitative Modelling and Reasoning”. Both those events resulted from funded projects and produced their own proceedings, which can be found in thehref="https://fedcsis.org/archive/" - conference archive
. We plan to host dissemination events in the future and welcome proposals to organize them. 
 2014: position papers introduced 
 In 2014, for the first time, a separate volume containing position papers was produced. Position papers relate to an ongoing research or experience. There are two types of position papers: 
 Challenge paperspropose and describe research challenges in theory or practice of computer science and information/intelligence systems. The papers in this category must be based on deep understanding of existing research or industrial problems. Based on such understanding and experience, they need to define new exciting research directions and show why these directions are crucial to the society at large. 
 Emerging research paperspresent preliminary research results from work-in-progress based on sound scientific approach but presenting work not completely validated as yet. They must describe precisely the research problem and its rationale. They must also define precisely the intended future work including the expected benefits from solution to the tackled problem. Subsequently, they may be more conceptual than experimental. 
 2014: data minining competition 
 2014 was also the first time we organized a data mining competition associated with the FedCSIS conference. Since then, such FedCSIS data-science-style challenges have been organized almost every year, using the specialized online platformKnowledgePit. Every year, one can find in the FedCSIS program – and in the FedCSIS proceedings – Technical Sessions focused on the discussion of competition results and descriptions of the winning solutions submitted by the data science teams from around the world. 
 2017: communication papers introduced 
 In 2017, communication papers were introduced as a separate category of contributions (in a separate volume). They report on research topics worthy of immediate communication. They may be used to mark a hot new research territory or to describe work in progress in order to quickly present it to scientific community. They may also contain additional information omitted from the earlier papers or may present software tools and products in a research state. 
 2019: numbering of conferences 
 In 2019, we realized that the number of conferences that had been organized in the series has reached the level where it may be valuable to indicate that this is the 14thedition of the event. 
 2020: adjusting conference structure 
 In 2020, conference structure was evaluated on the basis of 14 years of experiences. As a result, five tracks were introduced, while events that had been loosely grouped into areas, were aligned within tracks, becoming their Technical Sessions. This structural alignment resulted in dropping the term “federated” from the name, while keeping the acronym FedCSIS. The latter was a deliberate decision, aiming at showing historical continuity of the event. 
 2021: CORE B ranking 
 During the 2020–21 evaluation cycle the FedCSIS conference series has obtained categoryBin theCORE ranking.We are very proud that we have reached this recognition, while not being part of earlier ranking. This shows that we have developed a valuable scientific event. This also gives us guidance how to proceed to obtain even higher ranking in the next round. 
 2021: adjusting conference name 
 FedCSIS conference series is evolving with the world. This evolution is based on recognizing changes in the world around us. One of them is the raise of artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analytics. As a result, it is our belief that “information systems” of the old are becoming “intelligence infused systems” of today. As a matter of fact, it becomes difficult to point to information systems that do not contain components realizing some form of, broadly understood, artificial intelligence. Hence, we have decided that from this year on the name of the conference series will become “Conference on Computer Science and Intelligence Systems (FedCSIS)”. As can be seen, we are the same FedCSIS, but adjusted to the world of 2020s. 
 2021: Professor Zdzisław Pawlak Award becomes an all-FedCSIS recognition 
 Thehref="https://fedcsis.org/2021/zp_award" - Zdzisław Pawlak Awards
have been always of great importance for the FedCSIS community. In his research, late Professor Pawlak – undoubtedly one of the fathers of computer science and intelligence systems – has always emphasized a need of cross-disciplinary, cross-country and cross-generation cooperation. Therefore, in 2021, we decided to broaden the range of awards and established the following categories as eligible forall Tracks and all Technical Sessionsof the FedCSIS conference: 
 Best Paper Award | (€600): the best out of all papers accepted to the conference; 
 Young Researcher Paper Award | (€400): the best out of papers whereby all authors are younger than 40 years; 
 Industry Cooperation Award | (€400): the best out of papers whereby there are at least two different authors, one working in academia and another one in industry; 
 International Cooperation Award | (€400): the best out of papers whereby there are at least two different authors working in institutions located in two different countries. 
 2022: anniversaries 
 The FedCSIS story becomes longer and longer. We believe in continuity, tradition and evolution. Accordingly, we appreciate other long-term conference initiatives and we always welcome them if they want to join our FedCSIS community. In 2022, two out of FedCSIS Technical Sessions are particularly worth mentioning with this respect: 
 The first of them is thehref="https://fedcsis.org/2022/csp" - CS&P
symposium. Although held within FedCSIS for the first time, this is going to be actually the 30th event organized in theCS&P series! 
 The second anniversary goes back to Professor Zdzisław Pawlak again. In 2022, it is 40 years since he has founded Rough Sets, one of his most recognized achievements. With this respect, it is our great pleasure to re-establish thehref="https://fedcsis.org/2022/rsta" - RSTA
series focused on foundations and applications of this theory. 
 Such anniversaries will always have the very special place in the FedCSIS conference program.

FedCSIS 2025Invited speakers and Keynotes 
 Themissionof the FedCSIS Conference Series is to provide a presentation, discussion and a reputable publication forum in computer science and intelligence systems. The forum invites researchers and practitioners from around the world to contribute their research results focused on their scientific and professional interests in a chosen area. 
 The FedCSIS conference consists of theMain TrackandThematic Session. Papers submitted to the Main Track can be assigned, by their authors, toTopical Areas,which are managed byTopical Area Curators. Based on the scope of the contribution, Topical Area Curators select its reviewers from theMain TrackProgram Committee. Besides the Main Track, the authors may prefer to submit their papers to Thematic Session, which announce their ownCalls for Thematic Session Papersand are assisted by the FedCSIS Chairs in reaching out to the FedCSIS Community. 
 For all five Topical Areas, situated within a general domain of Computer Science, the continually emerging topic of Intelligence Systems stands as the common denominator. All Thematic Sessions also refer to the Intelligence Systems from different perspectives. They are regarded as a path toward introducing more Intelligence into Computer Science and IT.
