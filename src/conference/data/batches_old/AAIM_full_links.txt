 Call for Papers: 
  
 AAIM focuses on new results in all areas of algorithm design, operation research, and combinatorial optimization and their applications are welcome. Both theoretical and experimental/applied works of general algorithmic interest are sought. Special considerations will be given to algorithmic research that is motivated by real-world applications. Experimental and applied papers are expected to show convincingly the usefulness and efficiency of the target algorithms in practical settings. 
  
 The topics include, but are not limited to: 
  
 Algorithms and data structures 
 Algorithmic game theory and incentive analysis 
 Approximation algorithms and online algorithms 
 Automata, languages, logic, and computability 
 Bioinformatics, computational biology and medicine, and biomedical applications 
 Biomedical imaging algorithms 
 Blockchain 
 Combinatorial optimization 
 Combinatorics and discrete structures related to algorithms and complexity 
 Communication networks and optimization 
 Complexity theory 
 Computational algebra, geometry, number theory, and statistics 
 Computational learning theory, knowledge discovery, and data mining 
 Cryptography, reliability, and security 
 Database theory, large databases, and natural language processing 
 Experimental algorithmic methodologies 
 Geometric information processing and communication 
 Graph algorithms and theory 
 Graph drawing and information visualization 
 Internet algorithms and protocols 
 Large graph algorithms and social network analysis 
 Optimization algorithms in economic and operations research 
 Parallel and distributed computing and multicore algorithms 
 Parameterized algorithms, heuristics, and analysis 
 Pattern recognition algorithms 
 Trustworthy algorithms and trustworthy software 
  
 Publication and Special Issue: 
  
 The conference proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. After the conference, selected papers will be invited to a special issue of journals: Theoretical Computer Science, Journal of Combinatorial Optimization. The invited papers will go through the normal reviewing process. 
  
 Paper Submission: 
  
 Only previously unpublished new results will be considered for publication. Papers that have already been published or simultaneously submitted at another journal or conference (with published proceedings) will not be considered. 
  
 AAIM 2024 will only accept PDF format submissions via Springer Online Conference Service. 
  
 A submission should start with the title of the paper, each author's name, affiliation, and e-mail address, and a one-paragraph summary of the results. This should be followed by a scholarly exposition of the ideas, techniques, and a full description of the results achieved. A clear indication of the motivation and comparison with prior or related work should be presented. The paper should not exceed 12 pages, including bibliography, formatted for letter-size paper using 10 point font, with at least one inch margins around. Authors are required to submit their papers in the Springer LNCS Format. 
  
 Additional details can be included in a clearly marked appendix, to be consulted at the discretion of program committee members. The appendix is not included in the page limit, and will not be published in the conference proceedings.
