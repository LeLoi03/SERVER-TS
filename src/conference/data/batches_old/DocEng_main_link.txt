The 25thACM Symposium on Document Engineering 
 September 2, 2025 to September 5, 2025 
 University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UKThe 25thACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng'25) seeks original research papers that focus on the design, implementation, development, management, use and evaluation of advanced systems where documents and document collections play a key role. DocEng emphasizes innovative approaches to document engineering technology, use of documents and document collections in real-world applications, and novel principles, tools and processes that improve our ability to create, manage, maintain, share, and productively use these. 
 In particular, DocEng'25 seeks contributions on the theme ofDocument Trust and Security. 
 You are invited to submit original papers to DocEng'25, to be held in Nottingham, UK. Attendees at this international forum have interests that span all aspects of document engineering and applications.

 Proceedings and post-proceedings 
 Accepted articles will be published in the DocEng 2025 proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. 
 The program committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each submission as well as its general accessibility to the DocEng audience. Papers will be judged on significance, originality, and clarity. The paper must be organised so that it is easily understood by an audience with varied expertise. The paper should clearly identify what has been accomplished, why it is significant, and how it relates to previous work. 
 Submissions 
 Full papers: describing complete works of research (up to 10 pages). 
 Short papers: describing smaller complete works of research, novel challenges or visions (up to 4 pages). 
 Demonstrations: of interesting use-cases of systems or tools (up to 2 page abstract). 
 We are excited to announce a new Demonstrations submission type for DocEng 2025! Authors are invited to submit a 2-page abstract highlighting use cases, systems, or processes focused on document engineering. This submission type welcomes contributions from both technical and non-technical practitioners, providing a platform to share experiences, insights, and recommendations for future directions in document-related innovation. 
 Submissions should be prepared using the ACM format. Guidelines are available athttps://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template. 
 Please note that Word users should use the interim template; DocEng does not use TAPS. 
 Accepted papers will be presented as a talk or poster. Demonstrators will give 10-minute presentations in a demonstration session. 
 Papers can be submitted online at:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=doceng25" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=doceng25
