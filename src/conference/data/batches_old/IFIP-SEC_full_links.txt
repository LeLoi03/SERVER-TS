 Conflict of Interest: A real or apparent conflict of interest (COI) exists when the author and reviewer have a mutual stake in the acceptance of the submission or in some fashion one has influence over the other. For some (not all-inclusive) examples, COIs exist when the author and reviewer are involved in: 
 - an advisoral relationship (one is or was on the other's dissertation committee). 
 - an employment relationship (one is the boss of the other). 
 - a contractual relationship (one controls the awarding of contracts to the other). 
 - a close personal relationship. 
 - a financial relationship. 
 - a current or very recent collaboration, co-authorship, or co-worker relationship.
