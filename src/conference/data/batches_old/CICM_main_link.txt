 The 18th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM 2025) 
 Objectives 
 Digital and computational solutions are the prevalent means for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of mathematical information. Separate communities have developed to investigate and build computer based systems for automated deduction, computer algebra, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user interfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their integration can lead to synergies offering significant added value. The Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM) offers a venue for discussing and developing solutions to the great challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas. 
 The conference addresses research from these areas, and it usually adds workshops and a doctoral programme.

 CICM 2025 Second Announcement and Call for Papers 18th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics - CICM 2025 - 6 - 11 October 2025 Brasilia, Brazil http://www.cicm-conference.org/2025 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- More and more mathematical information is digitally processed, generated, communicated stored, and curated. CICM brings together the many separate communities that have developed theoretical and practical solutions for mathematical applications such as computation, deduction, knowledge management, and user interfaces. It offers a venue for discussing problems and solutions in each of these areas and their integration. Besides the CICM main program soliciting formal CICM submissions there will be associated workshops with separate submission options. We are inviting formal submissions on all topics relating to intelligent computer mathematics, in particular, but not limited to * theorem proving and computer algebra * mathematical knowledge management * digital mathematical libraries A comprehensive but not exhausting list of topics of interest can be found on the conference website: https://cicm-conference.org/2025/cicm.php?event=&menu=topics The program committee is chaired by Valeria de Paiva, Berkeley and Peter Koepke, Bonn. *** Formal Paper Submissions *** Formal submissions in one of the following categories will be reviewed rigorously and accepted papers will be published in a volume of Springer LNAI: * regular papers (up to 15 pages + bibliography) present novel research results * project and survey papers (up to 15 pages + bibliography) summarize existing results * system and dataset descriptions (4 to 5 pages + bibliography) present digital artifacts *** Doctoral Symposium: Two-Page Abstracts*** The doctoral program provides PhD students a forum to present early results to receive constructive feedback and mentoring. To attend submissions of two-page abstracts are expected in which the focus and research questions of the expected PhD theses are described; details on completed research tasks and remaining research plans should be given. In addition to these abstract, a two-pages CV of the applicant should also be submitted, detailing background information (name university, supervisor), education (sought degree, previous degrees), employments and relevant research experience (publications, attended conferences/workshops). The doctoral program will be chaired by Claudia Nalon, UnB Brasilia and Marcelo Finger, USP Sao Paulo. Further details on the program will be announced on the CICM 2025 website. *** Important Dates *** Formal submissions - Abstract deadline: April 28, 2025 - Full paper deadline: May 5, 2025 - Reviews sent to authors: June 16, 2025 - Rebuttals due: June 20, 2025 - Notification of acceptance: July 4, 2025 - Camera-ready copies due: July 18, 2025 - Conference: October 6-11, 2025 Doctoral programme applications - Submission deadline: TBA *** Submissions *** All submissions should be made via EasyChair at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm25 using the Springer LNCS style files https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines If software or data is relevant to a paper, a link that provides access to the software/data must be provided to enable reproduction of results. *** Best Papers *** CICM 2025 honors the best paper and best student paper with respect to reviews and program committee discussions with an award. ------------------------------------------------------------------------
