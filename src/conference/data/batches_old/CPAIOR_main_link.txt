 CPAIOR 2025 
 The22ndInternational Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, 
 and Operations Research 
  
 Melbourne,Australia 
 November 10-13,2025 
 Co-located withhref="https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/" - ICAPS 2025
 
 The aim ofCPAIORis to bring together researchers fromConstraint Programming(CP),Artificial Intelligence(AI), andOperations Research(OR) to present new techniques, applications, and theoretical & practical insights from a wide array of problems, fostering opportunities for experts in one area to learn about techniques from the others. 
 The conference series also emphasises how the integration of techniques from different fields can lead to new results on difficult problems, encouraginginterdisciplinary collaborationandinnovative problem-solving. On that end, papers and presentations that actively combine, integrate, or contrast approaches from more than one of the areas are especially welcomed. High-quality papers from a single area, as well as applications showcasing CP/AI/OR on challenging practical problems, are also a focus of the conference series. 
 CPAIOR 2025is the 27th edition of the meeting (the first five of which were workshops), and the 22ndedition of the conference with formal published proceedings. Please check thehref="https://cpaior.org/" - website of the CPAIOR conference series
for details on the previous conferences and thehref="https://link.springer.com/conference/cpaior" - website of the last 20 CPAIOR proceedings
, within theLecture Notes in Computer Scienceseries at Springer.

 Call for Papers 
 The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research will be held in Melbourne, Australia from November 10 to November 13, 2025. The conference will be co-located withhref="https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/home/" - ICAPS 2025
. 
 While the conference will take place later in the year than usual, papers are still due in December 2024, in order to not interfere with the usual sequence of conference deadlines. 
 The aim of the conference is to promote a space where researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Operations Research (OR) present innovative techniques, new applications, and original cutting-edge ideas, thereby encouraging researchers from one area to learn from the others. Of particular interest to the conference are papers that integrate concepts and methodologies from these different fields, either proposing interesting new techniques for complex/practical problems or expanding our theoretical insights and cross-field understanding. However, high-quality original papers from a single area are welcome when also relevant to the other communities involved. The conference also strongly encourages regular papers or experience reports showcasing CP/AI/OR techniques on challenging real-world applications. 
 The program committee invites submissions that include, but are far from limited to, the following topics: 
 New methodologies in the interface between predictive and prescriptive pipelines, such as machine learning techniques applied to tackle optimization problems and, conversely, CP/OR techniques to address AI and machine learning tasks. 
 Novel relaxation and inference methods based on constraint propagation, polyhedral techniques/cutting planes, convex/second-order conic optimization, graph-based algorithms, dynamic programming, and decision diagrams for optimization. 
 New search perspectives involving enumeration/branch-and-bound strategies, innovative decomposition techniques (e.g., based on column generation/Benders), intelligent backtracking, incomplete search, and learning-based heuristics. 
 Advanced integrated methods that expose new model transformations, communication strategies across MIP/CP/SAT solvers, distributed solution techniques, and solver selection (e.g., portfolio approaches). 
 Innovative models and applications of CP/AI/OR techniques. 
 Implementation or evaluation of CP/AI/OR techniques and optimization systems. 
 Submissions are of two types: regular papers (submitted for publication and presentation) and extended abstracts (submitted for presentation only). 
 The conference will recognize a distinguished paper award and a student paper award. 
 Instructions for Regular Papers 
 Regular papers present original unpublished work and can be of two types: 
 long papers (at most 15 pages plus references) 
 short papers (at most 8 pages plus references) 
 Both long and short papers will undergo rigorous review and are subject to the same criteria of quality. Both types are also eligible for the distinguished paper or student paper award. Short papers are particularly encouraged for interesting and novel work in progress, for which the practical or theoretical relevance is not yet fully identified. 
 Submissions to CPAIOR aresingle blind. In a single blind review process, the author names are not hidden for the reviewers, but the reviewer names are hidden for the authors.The conference proceedings will be published in theSpringer Lecture Notes in Computer Scienceseries. All regular papers should be prepared in the format used for that series (LNCS instructions). 
 Submission schedule for regular papers (both long and short): 
 Abstracts: December 8, 2024 (AoE: anywhere on Earth) 
 Full papers: December 15, 2024 (AoE,no extension possible) 
 Rebuttal Phase: January 26-29, 2025 (AoE) 
 Notification: February 10, 2025 
 Camera ready: TBA 
 Papers submitted to CPAIOR must not be under review at a different venue at the same time during the reviewing period. Abstracts can be submitted if the paper is still under review elsewhere, but the paper will have to be withdrawn by the full paper submission deadline from CPAIOR or the other venue. 
 Instructions for Extended Abstracts 
 Extended abstracts should be one or two pages in length and may present preliminary work or work already published in other outlets. The extended abstracts are submitted for presentation only (if accepted), and will not be formally published in the LNCS conference volume. A collection of the accepted extended abstracts will be published on the conference website. A submission representing work submitted or published in another outlet should state that outlet. Extended abstracts will be reviewed to ensure appropriateness for the conference. 
 Submission schedule for extended abstracts: 
 Abstract: August 2025 (TBA) 
 Notification: September 2025 (TBA) 
 Submission Process 
 We will use OpenReview.net to manage the reviewing process. Please use the following link to submit your papers: 
 href="https://openreview.net/group?id=cpaior.org/CPAIOR/2025/Conference" - https://openreview.net/group?id=cpaior.org/CPAIOR/2025/Conference
Reviewing will follow the same process as in previous years: the process issingle-blind, andall submissions, reviews, rebuttals and comments will stay privatethroughout the entire review period as well as afterwards. The OpenReview.net platform can support a much more open, community-engaged process, however we have decided not to use those features for now. We aim to start a discussion within the community about any potential changes for future conferences. 
 For any queries on the submission process, please contact the Program Chair Guido Tack athref="mailto:cpaior2025@gmail.com" - cpaior2025@gmail.com
