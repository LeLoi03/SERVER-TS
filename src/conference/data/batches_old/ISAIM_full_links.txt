 ISAIM 2024 
 The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence. The series was started by Martin Golumbic, Peter L. Hammer and Frederick Hoffman in 1990, and the editorial board of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence serves as the permanent Advisory Committee. Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions. 
 If you have a question about ISAIM 2024, please email athref="mailto:isaim-l@lists.ou.edu" - isaim-l@lists.ou.edu

Please note that due to retiring a mail server at the University of Oklahoma this fall, we had to change the initial email address isaim2024@cs.ou.edu that could be used for contacting the organizers, to this new email address, which is now an actual mailing list, hosted at a separate server. Our apologies for the inconvenience.
