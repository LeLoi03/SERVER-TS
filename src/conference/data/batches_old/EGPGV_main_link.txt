 The Eurographics Symposium on Parallel Graphics and Visualization (EGPGV) aims to foster the exchange of experiences and knowledge on leveraging and defining new trends in parallel graphics and visualization. This area is important due to the widespread availability of multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and cluster systems. Computationally demanding and data-intensive applications in graphics and visualization are strongly affected by this trend and require novel, efficient parallel solutions.

 Call for Papers 
 The Eurographics Symposium on Parallel Graphics and Visualization (EGPGV) aims to foster the exchange of experiences and knowledge on leveraging and defining new trends in parallel graphics and visualization. This area is important due to the widespread availability of multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and cluster systems. Computationally demanding and data-intensive applications in graphics and visualization are strongly affected by this trend and require novel, efficient parallel solutions. 
 EGPGV 2025 will take place on June 2, 2025, and will be co-located with EuroVis 2025, held June 2 to June 6, 2025, in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg. 
 The proceedings of EGPGV will be published in the Eurographics Proceedings Series and the Eurographics Digital Library. 
 EGPGV seeks papers on graphics and visualization that involve parallel computing and/or focus on very large data sets. Papers on techniques, data structures, algorithms, systems, and applications are welcomed. Parallel computing includes high-performance computing and cloud environments, (multi-)GPU computing and heterogeneous, hybrid architectures, and shared and/or distributed memory architectures. Further, papers focused on processing very large data sets (either for visualization or graphics) are welcomed, even if they do not have a particular focus on parallelism. 
 Typical symposium topics include: 
 Computationally and data-intensive rendering 
 Scientific visualization (e.g., volume, flow, and tensor visualization) 
 Machine learning as applied to parallel graphics, visualization, and/or large data analytics 
 Information visualization and visual analytics 
 In situ analytics and in situ visualization 
 Out-of-core processing of large data sets for visualization or graphics 
 Simulations for virtual environments (physics-based animation, collision detection, acoustics) 
 Mesh processing, level-of-detail, and geometric methods 
 Visual computing (image- and video-based rendering, image processing and exploitation, segmentation) 
 Scheduling, memory management, and data coherence 
 Parallelization approaches and algorithms, such as MapReduce 
 Database-related methods, algorithms or approaches, and query-based visualization 
 Advanced hardware for data handling or visualization 
 Large and high-resolution displays, virtual environments 
 Scientific, engineering, and industrial applications 
 Data analytics on large scientific data sets 
 In general, appropriate topics for the symposium fall into one of four categories: 
 (1) parallel graphics, 
 (2) rendering of very large data sets, 
 (3) parallel visualization and analytics, and 
 (4) processing of large data sets for visualization or analytics. 
 Submission types: 
 Full Papers (8 to 10 pages) in Eurographics format (+1 page for references) 
 Short Papers (up to 4 pages) in Eurographics format (+1 page for references) 
 Important Dates: 
 Abstract Deadline: February 17, 2025 (extended!) 
 Submission Deadline: February 24, 2025 (extended!)
