 CASCADE 2025 will be held in Saint-Etienne, FR, on April 2 to 4, 2025. 
 CASCADE is a new conference and the merge of COSADE and CARDIS. Its main goal is to encourage research and exchange on cryptographic implementations and embedded security challenges. It welcomes contributions from academia and industry. CASCADE encourages in particular submissions by European PhD students willing to present their work while benefiting from: 
 a constructive review process prioritizing technical and editorial feedback over taste, 
 interactions with their research community without long-distance travels, 
 exposure to industrial challenges that may generate new research discussions. 
 Papers can be submitted for review on two dates (one in the summer, one in the winter) for a single event in April. 
 The first conference will be organized by Université Jean Monnet, Saint-Etienne France and it will be held at Telecom Saint-Etienne. 
 The program committee is seeking original papers on all aspects of physical security. You are invited to participate and submit your contribution to CASCADE'25. More details onhref="cfp.html" - Call For Papers page

 Thanks to our generous sponsors, we are able to offer a limited number of registration fee waivers. The general chairs will select the recipients. Interested candidates should send a CV and a letter from their supervisor (for PhD students) as soon as possible tohref="mailto:vincent.grosso@cnrs.fr, pierre.louis.cayrel@univ-st-etienne.fr, b.colombier@univ-st-etienne.fr?subject=CASCADE 2025 fee waiver" - vincent.grosso@cnrs.fr, pierre.louis.cayrel@univ-st-etienne.fr and b.colombier@univ-st-etienne.fr with the subject line "CASCADE 2025 fee waiver"
. We will consider applications as they are received. In our selection process, we will give priority to PhD students who would not otherwise be able to attend the conference due to financial constraints. We also encourage gender equality in our selection process.

 Call for papers 
 CASCADE is a new conference issued from the merge of COSADE and CARDIS that focuses on cryptographic implementations, physical attacks and embedded security. Its main goal is to encourage research and exchanges on cryptographic implementations and embedded security challenges. It welcomes contributions from the academia and industry and encourages in particular submissions by European PhD students willing to present their work while benefiting from: 
 a constructive review process privileging technical and editorial feedback over taste, 
 interactions with their research community without long-distance travels, 
 exposition of industrial challenges that may generate new research discussions. 
 Papers can be submitted for review on two dates (one in the summer, one in the winter) for a single event in April. 
 Since 1994, CARDIS has been the venue for security experts from industry and academia to exchange on security of smart cards and related applications. Since 2010, COSADE has been an additional venue with dedicated focus on side-channel analysis, implementation attacks and secure designs. Starting in 2025, CARDIS and COSADE will merge into CASCADE, creating a unique annual international event to gather the community. For its first edition, CASCADE will take place in Saint-Étienne (France), from April 2 to 4, 2025. 
 Topics 
 The program committee is seeking original papers on all aspects of design, development, deployment, evaluation, and application of cryptographic implementations and secure embedded systems. You are invited to participate and submit your contributions to CASCADE'25. Submissions across a broad range of the development phase are encouraged, from exploratory research and proof-of-concept studies to practical applications and deployment. The program committee also invites survey and Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that assess, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as these papers offer significant value to our community. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Attacks and Countermeasures 
 Physical and remote side-channel attacks & countermeasures 
 Fault injection attacks and countermeasures 
 Combined implementation attacks and countermeasures 
 Micro-architectural attacks and countermeasures 
 Hardware tampering and tamper-resistance 
 Reverse engineering, (anti-)cloning, and (anti-)counterfeiting 
 Hardware trojans and detection mechanisms 
 Machine learning attacks and countermeasures 
 Efficient and Secure Cryptographic Implementations 
 Hardware & software cryptographic implementations 
 Algorithmic aspects of cryptographic implementations 
 Hardware security mechanisms, physically unclonable functions, true random number generator 
 Cryptographic implementations for RISC-V architectures 
 Post-quantum cryptographic implementations 
 Lightweight cryptography 
 White-box cryptography 
 Tools and Methodologies 
 Formal methods, techniques, and security models (for embedded security) 
 Secure design and verification tools for hardware/software 
 Security proofs in relevant models 
 Computer-aided cryptographic engineering 
 Domain-specific languages for cryptographic systems 
 Automated and machine learning analysis frameworks 
 Security evaluation platforms and tooling 
 Open benchmarks for efficient and secure designs 
 Applications 
 Applications of secure embedded systems 
 Trusted execution environments and trusted computing platforms 
 Security of the internet of things 
 Security of RISC-V architectures 
 Timeline 
 All deadlines are 23:59:59 Anywhere on Earth (AoE).

 Instruction for authors 
 Submissions must be original, unpublished, anonymous and not submitted to journals or other conferences or workshops with proceedings. Submissions must be written in English and should be at most 20 pages in total (excluding references and appendices) strictly following Springer's LNCS format (with default margins, font size, etc.). There is no limit on the length of the bibliography and appendices when submitting. However, the reviewers are not required to read any appendices and the camera-ready version should be self-contained without appendices and strictly adhere to the page limit. Papers not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration. All submissions will be blind-refereed. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper. The proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Both submissions and accepted papers must follow the LNCS default author instructions accessible on the Springer webpage:https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines.
