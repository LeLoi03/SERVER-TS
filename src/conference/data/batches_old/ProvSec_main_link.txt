ProgramVenueKeynotesProvable security is a critical tool for analyzing the security of modern cryptographic primitives in order to achieve high assurance of trustworthy and secure cyber systems. Provable security methodology contributed greatly to the analysis of cryptographic schemes and protocols, as well as their implementations in trusted and secure systems. However, cryptographic primitives without a rigorous "proof" cannot be regarded as sound. Security flaws in many cryptographic schemes and protocols once considered secure without formal analysis have been discovered using Provable Security methodology. Although Provable Security provides confidence in using cryptographic schemes and protocols for various real-world applications, schemes with Provable Security are sometimes not efficient enough for practical purposes, and it may be difficult to verify the correctness of the proofs. 
  
 We will continue to promote "Practical Security" as the theme for ProvSec2025. The event convened researchers and practitioners to provide a confluence of new practical cyber security technologies, including their applications and integration with IT systems in various industrial sectors.

 Instructions for Authors 
 All submissions should use the Springer LNCS format. Details on the Springer LNCS format can be obtained here. 
 https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelinesAuthors should not change the font or the margins of the LNCS format. The main body for the submission should not exceed 16 pages but there is no page limit on the references, appendices and supplementary material. Note that reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material. It is strongly encouraged that submissions are processed in LaTeX. All submissions must be anonymous and must have page numbers. All submissions will be blind-refereed and thus must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references. Submissions must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere or has submitted in parallel to a journal or any other conference/workshop that has proceedings. Accepted submissions may not appear in any other conference or workshop that has proceedings. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. 
 Authors should submit their paper using this link: 
 href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=provsec2025" - https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=provsec2025
Proceedings including all accepted papers will be published in Springer LNCS and will be available at the conference.
