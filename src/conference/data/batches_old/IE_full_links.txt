 About IE2025 
 A convention, in the sense of a meeting, is a gathering of individuals who meet at an arranged place and time in order to discuss or engage in some common interest. The most common conventions are based upon industry, profession, and fandom. Trade conventions typically focus on a particular industry or industry segment, and feature keynote speakers. 
 Professional conventions focus on issues of concern along with advancements related to the profession. Such conventions are generally organized by societies or communities dedicated to promotion of the topic of interest. Fan conventions usually feature displays, shows, and sales based on pop culture and guest celebrities. Science fiction conventions traditionally partake of the nature of both professional conventions.

 closepopupSumio MoriokaInterstellar Technologies Inc., JapanDr. Sumio Morioka leads long-term technological R&D for satellite and rocket systems at Interstellar Technologies Inc., a leading 
 NewSpace company in Japan (https://www.istellartech.com/en). After receiving his degree in Computer Science from Osaka University in 1997, he conducted research on high-performance LSI design and security technologies at NTT, IBM, Sony, NEC's central research 
 labs, and Imperial College London. Notably, he contributed to the development and integration of security technologies in the 
 PlayStation Portable and PS3, earning the Sony MVP Award in 2004. Since joining his current organization in 2016, he has led 
 efforts to successfully launch the first privately developed rocket into space in Japan, earning recognition from the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry.

 closepopupDirk KutscherHong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)Prof. Dr. Dirk Kutscher holds a PhD from The University of Bremen, Germany. He has held a full professor position for computer science and networking at the University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer, Germany and researcher positions in both industry and academic research organizations. Previously he has been the CTO for Virtual Networking and IP at Huawei's German Research Center, the Chief Researcher for Networking at NEC Laboratories Europe, and a Visiting Researcher at KDDI R&D Laboratories in Japan. He is co-chairing two Research Groups in the Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) on Information-Centric Networking (ICNRG) and on Decentralized Internet Infrastructure (DINRG). Dirk has published several IETF RFCs, books, and research publications on Internet technologies and holds several international patents. Dirk has held leading positions in multiple international research projects and has recently been serving as the technical director for the Piccolo project, a new European research initiative on in-network computing. He has won many awards for best papers in international conference and excellent research work by NEC and Huawei. Dirk has been one of the key innovators in Information-Centric Networking and has recently proposed Compute-First Networking as a new way for integrating distributed computing and networking.

 21st International Conference on Intelligent Environments (IE 2025) 
 Darmstadt, Germany 
 23th-26th of June 2025 
 https://www.ie2025.fraunhofer.de/ 
  
 Proceedings will be Published in IEEE 
  
 The International Conference on Intelligent Environments (IE) is in its twenty-first year and is now recognized as a major annual venue in the area. IE, which has been hosted worldwide, offers a truly international forum and welcomes contributions from all over the planet. Intelligent environments refer to physical spaces in which information and communication technologies, artificial intelligence, interface sensing and actuating technologies are woven to create interacting spaces. The ultimate objective of such environments is to enrich users' activities, while allowing users to manage them and be aware of each other’s capabilities. 
  
 The 21st International Conference on Intelligent Environments (IE2025) will take place in Darmstadt, Germany. Conveniently located just a 30-minute bus ride from Frankfurt International Airport, the city offers excellent accessibility for global attendees. Renowned as a hub of innovation and research, Darmstadt provides an inspiring setting for the conference. For those unable to attend in person, IE2025 will also offer hybrid (online) participation options. 
  
 Conference Program: IE is a multidisciplinary event welcoming contributions from a diversity of various relevant areas, including sensors and actuators, signal processing (incl. audio and images), networking, human-computer interaction, artificial intelligence, software engineering, context-awareness, internet of things, pervasive and ubiquitous computing, applied in domains such as healthcare, education, culture, building environments and smart cities. The event will include the followings. 
 - full (8-page) and short (4-page) papers 
 - 2 special sessions 
 - workshops 
 - 3 tutorials 
 - a doctoral colloquium 
 - an industrial forum
