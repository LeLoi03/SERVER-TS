 SCOPE 
 The International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods is a major point of contact between researchers, engineers and practitioners on the areas of Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, both from theoretical and application perspectives. 
 Contributions describing applications of Pattern Recognition techniques to real-world problems, interdisciplinary research, experimental and/or theoretical studies yielding new insights that advance Pattern Recognition methods are especially encouraged. 
  
 Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the proceedings of ICPRAM with an ISBN. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. There will be both oral and poster sessions.

 PAPER SUBMISSION 
 Authors can submit their work in the form of a complete paper or an abstract, but please note that accepted abstracts are presented but not published in the proceedings of the conference. Complete papers can be submitted as a Regular Paper, representing completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, portraying a short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue discussing ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research focused on one of the conference topic areas. 
  
 Authors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics. Each paper should clearly indicate the nature of its technical/scientific contribution, and the problems, domains or environments to which it is applicable. To facilitate the double-blind paper evaluation method, authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors, including the authors’ personal details, the acknowledgments section of the paper and any other reference that may disclose the authors’ identity. 
  
 When submitting a complete paper please note that only original papers should be submitted. Authors are advised to readINSTICC's ethical norms regarding plagiarism and self-plagiarismthoroughly before submitting and must make sure that their submissions do not substantially overlap work which has been published elsewhere or simultaneously submitted to a journal or another conference with proceedings. Papers that contain any form of plagiarism will be rejected without reviews. Authors should also avoid using an excessive number of self-citations. 
  
 All papers must be submitted through the online submission platformPRIMORISand should follow the instructions and templates that can be found underGuidelines and Templates. After the paper submission has been successfully completed, authors will receive an automatic confirmation e-mail.
