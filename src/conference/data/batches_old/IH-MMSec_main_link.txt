13th ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security 
 ACM IH&MMSec 2025, San Jose, CA, June 18-20 
 The 2025 workshop will be held at San Jose, CA. 
 The ACM IH&MMSec workshop is one of the prime events in the area of multimedia security and attracts researchers from all over the world. 
 The workshop focuses on information-hiding topics, such as steganography, steganalysis, digital watermarking, anonymity, hard-to-intercept communications, and covert channels. It also covers a variety of multimedia security topics, including multimedia authentication, multimedia forensics, biometrics, and privacy. 
 The research presented at this workshop captures state-of-the-art work conducted in academic, industrial, and government institutions worldwide. Papers cover significant theoretical aspects of the field, as well as novel industrial and commercial applications of techniques and algorithms developed in the area.

For more than 20 years, the fields of Information Hiding and Multimedia Security (IH&MMSec) have allied advances of multiple disciplines, accumulating a substantial body of knowledge. The IH&MMSec workshop has established its reputation as one of the premier outlets for research in these and related areas. Continuing this tradition, the 2025 workshop edition solicits novel papers documenting research, industrial, or government practice. The event will be held in San Jose, California, in the United States. 
 Submitted papers should address security and privacy aspects in relation to multimedia host signals (including images, audio, videos, texts, network traffic, etc.): 
 Forensics and counter-forensics 
 Steganography and steganalysis 
 Covert and subliminal channels 
 Watermarking and fingerprinting 
 Networks and protocols 
 Anonymity and privacy 
 Biometrics 
 Deep fake analysis 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the use or advances of the following methods: 
 Information, coding, and complexity theory 
 Game and decision theory 
 Statistical modeling 
 Machine learning and deep learning 
 Adversarial machine learning 
 DNN watermarking 
 Deep learning security 
 Secure Signal Processing 
 Benchmarking and replication 
 Obfuscation and privacy-preserving systems 
 This year a call for special sessions is included. For details about the corresponding proposal procedure, please refer to the conference website.Paper submitted to the Special Sessions will go through the regular review process. More detailshere. 
 Authors are invited to submit either short papers (4-6 pages, including references, for preliminary yet interesting results) or full papers (10-12 pages, including references, with general and detailed research contributions).
