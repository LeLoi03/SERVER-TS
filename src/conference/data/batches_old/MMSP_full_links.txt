 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP) 
 The 27th IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP 2025) will be held fromSeptember 21toSeptember 23, 2025, inShougang Industrial Park, Beijing, China(one of the key venues for the 2022 Winter Olympics). Organized by the Multimedia Signal Processing Technical Committee of the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS), this workshop aims to convene researchers and practitioners from academia and industry who are dedicated to advancing the field of multimedia signal processing. 
 MMSP 2025 will feature a comprehensive technical program, including oral sessions, poster sessions, special sessions, industry sessions, keynote speeches, invited talks, challenges, and panel discussions. We are particularly interested in contributions that address the following topics, though submissions are not limited to these areas: 
 Multimedia with Generative Models 
 Multimedia Safety, Security, and Forensics in the AI Era 
 Multimedia with Self-Supervised Learning 
 Multimedia with Large-Scale Models 
 Multimedia with Big Data 
 Multimedia Communication 
 In addition to academic contributions, we welcome successful projects from research groups and industry companies to demonstrate their innovative ideas and products. This workshop aims to foster collaboration, share knowledge, and promote the development of multimedia technologies. 
 We look forward to your participation in MMSP 2025 and to the exciting discussions and advancements that will emerge from this gathering of experts in the field. 
 **Important Notice**: 
 1. China has recently optimized itsvisa-free transit policy, so that Individuals from 54 eligible countries, traveling from China to a third country (region), can enterVISA-FREEthrough any of the 60 open ports (including Beijing) and stay for no more than240 hours.

 IEEE 27th International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP) 
 The 27th IEEE International Workshop on Multimedia Signal Processing (MMSP 2025) will be held fromSeptember 21toSeptember 23, 2025, inShougang Industrial Park, Beijing, China(one of the key venues for the 2022 Winter Olympics). Organized by the Multimedia Signal Processing Technical Committee of the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS), this workshop aims to convene researchers and practitioners from academia and industry who are dedicated to advancing the field of multimedia signal processing. 
 MMSP 2025 will feature a comprehensive technical program, including oral sessions, poster sessions, special sessions, industry sessions, keynote speeches, invited talks, challenges, and panel discussions. We are particularly interested in contributions that address the following topics, though submissions are not limited to these areas: 
 Multimedia with Generative Models 
 Multimedia Safety, Security, and Forensics in the AI Era 
 Multimedia with Self-Supervised Learning 
 Multimedia with Large-Scale Models 
 Multimedia with Big Data 
 Multimedia Communication 
 In addition to academic contributions, we welcome successful projects from research groups and industry companies to demonstrate their innovative ideas and products. This workshop aims to foster collaboration, share knowledge, and promote the development of multimedia technologies. 
 We look forward to your participation in MMSP 2025 and to the exciting discussions and advancements that will emerge from this gathering of experts in the field. 
 **Important Notice**:
