The ACM SIGSIM International Conference on Principles of Advanced Discrete Simulation (SIGSIM-PADS) focuses on cutting-edge research at the intersection of Computer Science and Modeling and Simulation (M&S). High-quality papers are solicited in all aspects of M&S. 
 SIGSIM-PADS'25 offers a set of thematic tracks (regular and special, the latter provide a novel focus each year), a two-phase submission process (which allows authors to significantly refine and enhance their submissions), an optional artifact review and badging, and the opportunity for authors (based on the decision of the Technical Program Committee) that their paper will be included in a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS) which complements the regular ACM Proceedings of SIGSIM PADS. Presentation at the conference is mandatory for all papers. The figure below illustrates the paper submission and reviewing process. 

All the submissions are made throughhref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigsimpads2025" - EasyChair
.

 Track Chair: 
 Jerome Feret (DI-NES, Paris, France) 
 Due to the inherent complexity of models found in biology and other application areas, their simulation can often only be achieved with model reduction. Model reduction is an interdisciplinary area where ideas from mathematics, physics, and computer sciences are combined to discover the most important quantities to drive the dynamics of the modeled systems. This session will cover: 
 Exact, numerically approximate, or interval-based model reduction approaches 
 Both differential and stochastic approaches 
 Approaches based on low-level descriptions (such as ODEs and CTMCs) or higher lever descriptions (such as rule-based models) of models. 
 2.Cutting-edge approaches in Computational Economics 
 Track Co-Chairs:

 ConferenceJune 23-26th 2025 
 (see also above figure about submission and reviewing process) 
 Paperssubmitted to the first callmay receive reviews that include suggestions for improvements, areas of concern, and additional points that can be addressed or incorporated. In this case, authors have an interim period between the first and second submission deadlines to consider the feedback, make revisions, and further polish their submissions. Authors can resubmit their revised papers to the second call. Our two-phase process ensures a higher quality of papers through an iterative feedback loop. This allows authors to engage more deeply in the review process, gaining a better understanding of where improvements can be made. By addressing concerns and making improvements, authors increase the likelihood of their papers being accepted. This process fosters a culture of excellence and continuous improvement, pushing the boundaries of research and innovation in the field of M&S. Papers can also bedirectly submitted to the second call. A regular review process will occur in this case, with an accept/reject outcome, and in case of acceptance with a publication either in the ACM regular proceedings or the TOMACS special issue. All contributions that meet the standards and criteria set by the conference committee will be accepted for presentation at the ACM SIGSIM PADS'25 International Conference. For each accepted paper, at least one author must attend the conference and present their work. 
 ACM TOMACS Special Issue 
 ACM SIGSIM PADS'25 offers an exciting opportunity for authors, in collaboration with ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS).Selection for the Special Issue:Upon submission of a paper to the ACM SIGSIM PADS'25 conference, the Technical Program Committee (TPC) holds the discretion to propose that the paper be included in a special issue of TOMACS. Even papers requiring major revisions can be recommended during the first call for the TOMACS special issue. Authors of these papers will then have the opportunity to address feedback and submit their revised manuscripts by the second deadline set for the conference.Special Issue Publication Timeline:The special issue of TOMACS will be released concurrently with the Conference Proceedings. This ensures that the spotlight remains on the most influential and innovative research at the time of the conference.Turnaround Time:For papers that require only minor revisions, the turnaround time from submission to acceptance for the TOMACS special issue can be as short as 3.5 months. The process will span approximately 6 months for papers needing major revisions, ensuring authors ample time to refine and improve their work while benefiting from a timely publication.Benefits:Selected papers enjoy the prestige of being published in a special issue of a reputable journal with a short turnaround time. Authors benefit from rapid feedback, revisions, and publication as well as the opportunity to present the work at PADS. 
 PhD Colloquium 
 ACM SIGSIM PADS also invites students to participate in the PhD Colloquium and Poster Session at the 2025 ACM SIGSIM PADS by submitting an extended abstract illustrating their research activities. 
 The extended abstracts must be in double-column format, up to two pages (including references). Abstracts accepted to the colloquium will be published in the conference proceedings. 
 Travel grants are available for students taking part. 
 For more information, see thePhD Colloquiumpage. 
 Paper Formats 
 Papers must be written in English and present original and unpublished content. All tracks accept full and short paper contributions. 
 Full papersshould be at most 10 pages in ACM proceedings format, not including references. 
 Short papersshould be at most 4 pages in ACM proceedings format, not including references. 
 Extended abstractsshould be at most 2 pages including references. 
 Short papers should describe interesting, novel research in an early stage of development or position papers of interest to the community. All short papers will be fully reviewed and published in the conference proceedings. 
 All papers should be formatted according to theStandard ACM Proceedings Template. Only LaTeX papers will be accepted for the camera ready submission. 
 Paper Reviewing 
 All first time submissions will be reviewed using a dual-anonymous review process, i.e., the identity of authors and referees will not be revealed to each other. To ensure blind reviewing,all identifying information must be removed from the manuscript:this includes removing authors’ names and affiliations, acknowledgments, funding information, and all references to the authors’ work that would disclose their identity. 
 Please note if you are submitting a revised version to the second call, it will be reviewed with a single-anonymous review process, so the identity of authors may be revealed if the authors wish so. In addition, please be aware that EasyChair does not handle revised versions, you need to submit your paper to the second call as a new submission. 
 In any case authors’ names and affiliations, acknowledgements etc. need to be added to the accepted manuscripts. 
 Artifact Evaluation 
 PADS has joined the group of ACM conferences that have established an optional reviewing process to evaluate artifacts and reproduce computational results. When submitting a contribution, the authors can choose to undergo evaluation, but this process has no effect on the standard paper evaluation process, as the reproducibility process only starts after the paper is accepted. 
 For more information, see theArtifact Evaluationpage.
