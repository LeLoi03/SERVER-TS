 General Information 
 27th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing, September 22-25, Timișoara, România 
 href="https://easychair.org/smart-program/AVM25/" - AVM 2025
(17th Alpine Verification Meeting) is collocated with SYNASC 2025 
 SYNASCaims to stimulate the interaction among multiple communities focusing on defining, optimizing and executing complex algorithms in several application areas. Thefocusof the conference then ranges from symbolic and numeric computation to formal methods applied to programming, artificial intelligence, distributed computing and computing theory. The interplay between these areas, in fact, is essential in the current scenario where economy and society demand for the development of complex, data intensive, trustable and highperformantcomputational systems. 
 In this context we invite for: 
 href="https://synasc.ro/2025/submission/" - Research paper submissions
href="https://synasc.ro/2025/special-sessions/" - Special session proposals
href="https://synasc.ro/2025/workshops/" - Satellite workshop proposals
href="https://synasc.ro/2025/tutorials/" - Tutorial proposals
SYNASC 2025 is organized by: 
 Department of Computer Science 
 West University of Timisoara, Romania 
 DetailsResearch Institute for Symbolic Computation 
 Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria 
 DetailsResearch Institute e-Austria 
 Timisoara, Romania 
 Detailsand it is heldSeptember 22-25, 2025 in Timișoara, Romania.

 Evolution of SIGSAM, ISSAC and ACM's relationships 
 You canfind here a document presenting the situation about evolution of SIGSAM, ISSAC and ACM’s relationships. 
  
 The goal is to trigger an informed discussion within the SIGSAM and ISSAC communities, which will then be asked to answer a consultation on the option to follow, during the business meeting at ISSAC 2024 conference and online. 
  
 The discussion takes placein this SIGSAM hosted forum.
