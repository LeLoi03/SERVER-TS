 Call for papers 
 Original unpublished papers on all aspects of real-time, network and embedded systems are welcome. RTNS invites submissions covering a wide range of topics, including, but not limited to: 
 Real-time applications design and evaluation: | automotive, avionics, space, railways, telecommunications, process control, multimedia. 
 Real-time aspects of emerging smart systems: | cyber-physical systems and emerging applications, real-time big data, real-time edge/fog and cloud computing, smart grid. 
 Real-time system design and analysis: | real-time tasks modeling, task/message scheduling, evaluation, mixed-criticality systems, Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) analysis, quality of service, security, thermal and power-aware system design. 
 Software technologies for real-time systems: | model-driven engineering, programming languages, compilers, WCET-aware compilation and parallelization strategies, middleware, Real-Time Operating Systems, virtualization, hypervisors. 
 Formal specification and verification: | application of formal models, such as model checking, satisfiability modulo theories or constraint programming, to solve real-time problems. 
 Real-time distributed systems: | fault tolerance, time synchronization, task/messages allocation, adaptability and reconfiguration, publisher/subscriber protocols, distributed real-time database. 
 Real-time networks: | Networks on Chip (NoC), wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks, Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN), industrial IoT, SDN, 5G, end-to-end latency analysis. 
 Hardware support for real-time systems: | hardware/software co-design, power/temperature-aware techniques, design of predictable hardware, multi-core and many-core platforms, hardware accelerators, cache related issues, interconnect and memory. 
 We encourage boththeoreticalandexperimentalworks that push the boundaries of current knowledge. We welcome contributions from both established researchers and newcomers to the field in order to create a diverse and dynamic environment. RTNS prefers original results, raising questions and discussions, and advancing the state-of-the-art or practice. 
 Accepted papers will be presented to an international audience, providing a platform for authors to share their insights and garner feedback from their peers. Best papers and best student papers awards will be presented at the conference, along with an award for the best presentation. Outstanding papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their work for a special issue ofSpringer Real-Time Systems journal. The extended papers must have at least 35% new content. 
 Building on the success of the multi-round submission system introduced last year, the 33rd RTNS conference continues this innovative approach and now offers an additional third round of submissions to accommodate more high-quality research. RTNS now offers 3 deadlines:January, May, and August (more details below). 
 Submit your best work and join us in Pisa for an engaging and enlightening experience at RTNS 2025!
