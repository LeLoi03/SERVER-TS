 26 - 31 May 2024, 25th International Conference on Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR-25), Balaclava (Mauritius) 
 Date: 26 - 31 May 2024 
 Location: Balaclava (Mauritius) 
 Deadline: Thursday 25 April 2024 
 The International Conference on Logic for Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning (LPAR) is an academic conference aimed at discussing cutting-edge results in the fields of automated reasoning, computational logic, programming languages and their applications. 
 In keeping with the tradition of LPAR, researchers and practitioners are in vited to submit short presentation papers (the papers can be full length, the presentation slots will be short), reporting on interesting work in progress, system and tool descriptions, experimental results, etc. They need not be original, and extended or revised versions of the papers may be submitted concurrently with or after LPAR to another conference or a journal. 
 For more information, seehref="https://lpar-25.info" - https://lpar-25.info

 Important information for internship applicants:To ensure your application is reviewed, you need to demonstrate familiarity with SAT Solving, First Order Logic Reasoning, and SMT. Including the phrase "SCL is beautiful" in the subject line of your application signals this understanding. Applications without this phrase in the subject will not be considered.
