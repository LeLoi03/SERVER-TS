 21st IEEE International eScience Conference (eScience’25) Call for Papers 
 The 21st IEEE International eScience Conference (eScience’25) will be held in Chicago on September 15-18, 2025. 
 eScience studies, enacts, and improves the ongoing process of innovation in computationally-intensive or data-intensive research methods; typically this is carried out collaboratively, often using distributed computing infrastructure. eScience encompasses all fields of research and addresses all stages of the research lifecycle, from formulation of the research questions, through large scale simulations and data analytics, scientific discovery, up to long-term sharing, publication, reusing, and reapplying of the results, data as well as the relevant tools, processes and knowledge. 
 eScience’25 welcomes paper submissions for its technical program. The conference will be an interdisciplinary forum for researchers, developers, and users of applications and enabling IT technologies. The conference welcomes conceptualization, implementation, and experience contributions enabling and driving innovation in data- and compute-intensive research. eScience covers all disciplines, from the physical and biological sciences to the social sciences, arts, and humanities. Infrastructure and technologies can include a broad spectrum, such as HPC, cloud, IoT, as well as artificial intelligence and machine learning methods. 
 Submissions may include all aspects of eScience and its associated technologies, applications, algorithms, and tools, with a strong focus on practical solutions and open challenges. Ideal papers involve the interplay between applications and infrastructure technologies, with a focus on novelty in one or both. 
 Topics of interest related to eScience also include, but are not limited to: 
 Artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, generative AI, large language models applied/applicable in science 
 Research computing cyberinfrastructure (e.g., cloud, cluster, HPC, supercomputer) 
 Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) principles for scientific software, data, workflows, models 
 Reproducible and replicable eScience 
 Translational research in computer and computational sciences 
 Continuum computing: convergence between cloud computing, edge computing, and/or the Internet of Things (IoT) 
 Education and e-Science 
 Collaborative, reproducible and replicable eScience 
 Science gateways, data portals, and digital repositories 
 Resource management and scheduling 
 Programming paradigms and models 
 Real-time (time-sensitive) computing (e.g., for scientific instruments) 
 Automation and event-based computing 
 Big data stacks and big data ecosystems 
 File and storage systems, I/O, and data management 
 Scientific applications, algorithms, tools, and technologies 
 Scientific workflows and distributed computing paradigms (e.g., FaaS) 
 Blockchain technologies in science 
 Fault tolerance, resilience, and security 
 The conference is now soliciting full papers (8 pages excluding references) that present previously unpublished research achievements or eScience experiences and solutions Submitted papers should use the IEEE 8.5×11manuscript guidelines: double-column text using single-spaced 10-point font on 8.5×11-inch pages. All submissions will be single-blind peer reviewed. Selected full papers will receive a slot for an oral presentation. Accepted posters will be presented during a poster reception. Accepted full papers will be published in the IEEE conference proceedings. Rejected full papers can be re-submitted for a poster or workshop presentation. 
 Submitted papers may also be posted on preprint servers (e.g. arXiv). 
 At least one author of each accepted paper must register as an author at the full registration rate. Each author registration can be applied to only one accepted submission. Note. The use of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of the paper. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the paper that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content. Authors are fully responsible for all content they submit.
