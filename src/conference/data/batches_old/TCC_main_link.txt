The Theory of Cryptography Conference deals with the paradigms, approaches, and techniques used to conceptualize natural cryptographic problems and provide algorithmic solutions to them. More specifically, the scope of the conference includes, but is not limited to the: 
 study of known paradigms, approaches, and techniques, directed towards their better understanding and utilization 
 discovery of new paradigms, approaches and techniques that overcome limitations of the existing ones 
 formulation and treatment of new cryptographic problems 
 study of notions of security and relations among them 
 modeling and analysis of cryptographic algorithms 
 study of the complexity assumptions used in cryptography 
 TCC is dedicated to providing a premier venue for the dissemination of results within its scope. The conference aims to provide a meeting place for researchers and to be instrumental in shaping the identity of the theoretical cryptography community. With these goals in mind, TCC 2025 is planned to be an in-person meeting. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to present the paper in person at the conference, unless there are extenuating circumstances approved by the chairs.

 Proceedings 
 Proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. The online version will be available to all conference attendees. Physical books will be available after the conference for a separate fee. Instructions for preparing the final proceedings version will be sent to the authors of accepted papers. The final copies of the accepted papers will be due on the final version deadline listed. This is a strict deadline, and authors should prepare accordingly. 
 Luca Trevisan Young Researcher Award 
 This prize is for the best paper authored solely by young researchers, where a young researcher is a person that at the time of the paper's submission is at most two years past their graduation from a PhD program. Eligibility must be indicated at the time of submission, using a checkbox in the submission form. The program committee may decline to make the award, or may split it among several papers.
