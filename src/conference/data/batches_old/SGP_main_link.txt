 SGP is the premier venue for disseminating new research ideas and cutting-edge results in geometry processing. In this research area, concepts from mathematics, computer science, and engineering are studied and applied to offer new insights and design efficient algorithms for acquisition, modeling, analysis, manipulation, simulation and other types of processing of 3D models and shape collections. Continuing a successful tradition from previous years, SGP will also offer a Graduate School, targeted at students and researchers new to the field. Courses will be taught by leading experts and complemented by interactive demonstrations to provide in-depth knowledge of recent and fundamental aspects of geometry processing.
