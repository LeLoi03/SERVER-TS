 Present CFP : 2025 
 Authors are invited to electronically submit original, English-language research works to AIAI Conference. 
  
 Starting from AIAI 2025, the length of the standard paper submission has been increased to 14 PAGES (with references included), formatted according to the well known Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series format. 
  
 Please note that the minimum length of submitted papers must be no less than 8 pages. Manuscripts with less than 8 pages long will not be taken into consideration for the Conference and they will immediately be rejected. 
  
 Submitted papers must present unpublished work, not being considered for publication in other journals or conferences, while being evaluated for this Conference. 
 All submitted papers will be evaluated by at least two independent reviewers for quality, correctness, originality, and relevance. Accept/Reject notifications and reviews will be send to all authors that submitted their work via email. 
  
 Accepted papers will be included in the Springer IFIP AICT Series Proceedings and they will be available on line. 
  
 The Hybrid Conference will provide the authors of all accepted papers with the opportunity to present their paper either Physically (on-site), at the venue of the Conference, or Remotely (on-line)
