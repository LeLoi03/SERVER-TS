 William Chappell 
 VP of Mission Systems, 
 Microsoft 
 Michaela Blott 
 Senior Fellow, 
 AMD Research 
 Jason Cong 
 Volgenau Chair for Engineering Excellence Professor, 
 UCLA Computer Science Department 
 Dr. William Chappell is the Vice President and CTO for the Strategic Missions and Technologies Division at Microsoft. As CTO for SMT, he works across the quantum, 5G, mission, space and federal teams to infuse technologies, such as our AI advances, into the product lines, while developing new concepts for the future of the cloud. On the Mission Engineering team in SMT, he developed the Azure Space and Spectrum team, as well as the strategic modeling and simulation team, which includes silicon cloud design. 
 Prior to Microsoft, he was the director of the Microsystems Technology Office (MTO) for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) of the Department of Defense. Serving in this position, he focused the office on three key priorities important to national security. These thrusts included ensuring unfettered use of the electromagnetic spectrum, building an alternative business model for acquiring advanced DoD electronics that feature built-in trust, and developing circuit architectures for next-generation machine learning. MTO creates the MEMS, photonic, and electronic components needed to gracefully bridge the divide between the physical world in which we live and the digital realm where our information resides. Under Dr. Chappell’s leadership, MTO developed the basic underpinnings of computation and sensing needed for an effective, information-driven society. 
 Prior to his work in government, Dr. Chappell was a professor at Purdue University specializing in electromagnetics. Dr. Chappell received his BS, MS, and PhD degrees in Electrical Engineering, all from the University of Michigan. 
 Dr. Michaela Blott is a Senior Fellow at AMD Research. She heads a team of international scientists driving groundbreaking research into AI, from robotics to computer architectures, model optimizations and green AI. 
 Her journey includes a Ph.D. from Trinity College Dublin and a Master's degree from the University of Kaiserslautern, Germany, and brings over 25+ years of experience in leading-edge AI, computer architecture and advanced FPGA design, in research institutions (ETH Zurich and Bell Labs) and development organizations. She is highly active in the research community as industrial advisor to numerous EU projects and research centres, serves on technical program committees and her contributions to the field were further recognized through multiple Women in Tech Awards. 
 JASON CONG is the Volgenau Chair for Engineering Excellence Professor at the UCLA Computer Science Department (and a former department chair), with joint appointment from the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. He is the director of Center for Domain-Specific Computing (CDSC) and the director of VLSI Architecture, Synthesis, and Technology (VAST) Laboratory. Dr. Cong’s research interests include novel architectures and compilation for customizable computing, synthesis of VLSI circuits and systems, and quantum computing. He has over 500 publications in these areas, including 19 best paper awards, and 4 papers in the FPGA and Reconfigurable Computing Hall of Fame. He and his former students co-founded AutoESL, which developed the most widely used high-level synthesis tool for FPGAs (renamed to Vivado HLS and Vitis HLS after Xilinx’s acquisition). He is member of the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and a Fellow of ACM, IEEE, and the National Academy of Inventors. He is recipient of the SIA University Research Award, the EDAA Achievement Award, the IEEE Robert N. Noyce Medal for “fundamental contributions to electronic design automation and FPGA design methods”, and the Phil Kaufman Award for “sustained fundamental contributions FPGA design automation technology, from circuit to system levels, with widespread industrial impact

 Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
 The Artificial Intelligence (AI)program highlights the advances in the field with a focus on leading AI designs and AI usage in design automation. While artificial intelligence and neural network research has been ongoing for more than half a century, recent advances in computing and acceleration of the pace and scale of machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing the impact of artificial intelligence on every aspect of our daily lives, ranging from smart consumer electronics and services to self-navigating cars and personalized medicine. While AI was already changing computing from devices through near and far edges all the way to datacenters, more recently, the advances in Generative AI are further transforming our day to day lives and the way electronics is developed from chips to systems. 
 TheAIsessions at DAC focuses on the fundamentals, accomplishments to date, and challenges ahead in development ofML/AI hardware, software and systems as well as application of AI/ML in design automation, providing a forum for researchers and practitioners across all the widely varying disciplines involved to connect, engage, and join in shaping the future of this exciting field.

 Design (DES) 
 DAC has served as a meeting place for designers of electronics from chips to systems for over five decades. Increasingly, the challenges faced by the industry require co-optimization of design, methodologies and tools that can only be achieved using cross-domain interaction of researchers and practitioners. DAC serves this need by covering design as a topic area in the research and engineering tracks. 
 The design topics covered in the research track include thedesign of cyber-physical, System-on-Chip (SoC) and multi-die architectures, accelerator-based computing, emerging models of computation such as brain-inspired and quantum computing, digital and analog circuits, and emerging device technologies. 
 Separately the Engineering Track allows tool users to share challenges and benefits of different tools, flows, and methodologies for IP, front-end, back-end as well as systems and software design, and provides excellent opportunities for education and networking between end users and tool developers. There is no other way to improve your “design IQ” in such a short amount of time than to attend the Engineering Track.

 Electronic Design Automation (EDA) 
 Electronic Design Automation (EDA)is even more important now with the continuous scaling of semiconductor devices, blending development requirements from chips to systems and extending beyond electronics into interactions with mechanical, electromagnetic effects of system design. Demands for lower power, higher reliability, and more agile electronic systems raise new challenges to design automation enabling such systems. For the past five decades, the primary focus of the research track at DAC has been to showcase leading-edge research and practice in tools and methodologies for the design of circuits and systems. 
 In addition to the traditional EDA topics ranging from physical design to system architectures, DAC features high-quality papers ondesign research, design practices, and design automation for cross-cutting topics including low-power, reliability, multicore/application-specific/heterogeneous architectures, 3-D integrations, multi-die systems, emerging device technologies, design automation of "things", and their applications. DAC's EDA technical program has been ensuring the best-in-class solutions that promise to advance EDA.

 Security (SEC) 
 Security (SEC)sessions at DAC focuses on the urgent need to create, analyze, evaluate, and improve the hardware, embedded systems and software base of the contemporary security solutions. Secure and trustworthy software and hardware components, platforms and supply chains are vital to all domains including financial, healthcare, transportation, and energy. Security of systems is becoming equally important. A revolution is underway in many industries that are "connecting the unconnected". Such cyber physical systems, e.g., automobiles, smart grid, medical devices, etc., are taking advantage of integration of physical systems with the information systems. Notwithstanding the numerous benefits, these systems are appealing targets of attacks. Attacks on the cyber-part of such systems can have disastrous consequences in the physical world. The scope and variety of attacks on these systems present design challenges that span embedded hardware, software, networking, and system design. 
 Security sessions at DAC will feature invited special sessions, panels, and lecture/poster presentations by both engineers and researchers to share their knowledge and experience on this evolving environment.

 Systems (SYS) 
 Systems Designis the art of choosing and designing the proper combination of hardware and software components to achieve system-level design goals like speed, efficiency, reliability, security, and safety. Systems Design is an increasingly diverse, disruptive, and challenging field for designs ranging from data centers, mobile devices, medical devices, automotive, consumer, robotics, drones, industrial applications and beyond. Software at the embedded scale is built into devices that may not necessarily be recognized as computing devices (e.g., thermostats, toys, defibrillators, and anti-lock brakes), but nevertheless controls the functionality and perceived quality of these devices. Software at the system-level increasingly drives system design requirements as well as workloads that determine chip and system architectures and testing. 
 The Systems sessions at DAC provide a forum for discussing the challenges of embedded design and an opportunity for leaders in the industry and academia to come together to exchange ideas and roadmaps for the future for this rapidly expanding area.

 Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
 The Artificial Intelligence (AI)program highlights the advances in the field with a focus on leading AI designs and AI usage in design automation. While artificial intelligence and neural network research has been ongoing for more than half a century, recent advances in computing and acceleration of the pace and scale of machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing the impact of artificial intelligence on every aspect of our daily lives, ranging from smart consumer electronics and services to self-navigating cars and personalized medicine. While AI was already changing computing from devices through near and far edges all the way to datacenters, more recently, the advances in Generative AI are further transforming our day to day lives and the way electronics is developed from chips to systems. 
 TheAIsessions at DAC focuses on the fundamentals, accomplishments to date, and challenges ahead in development ofML/AI hardware, software and systems as well as application of AI/ML in design automation, providing a forum for researchers and practitioners across all the widely varying disciplines involved to connect, engage, and join in shaping the future of this exciting field.

 Design (DES) 
 DAC has served as a meeting place for designers of electronics from chips to systems for over five decades. Increasingly, the challenges faced by the industry require co-optimization of design, methodologies and tools that can only be achieved using cross-domain interaction of researchers and practitioners. DAC serves this need by covering design as a topic area in the research and engineering tracks. 
 The design topics covered in the research track include thedesign of cyber-physical, System-on-Chip (SoC) and multi-die architectures, accelerator-based computing, emerging models of computation such as brain-inspired and quantum computing, digital and analog circuits, and emerging device technologies. 
 Separately the Engineering Track allows tool users to share challenges and benefits of different tools, flows, and methodologies for IP, front-end, back-end as well as systems and software design, and provides excellent opportunities for education and networking between end users and tool developers. There is no other way to improve your “design IQ” in such a short amount of time than to attend the Engineering Track.

 Electronic Design Automation (EDA) 
 Electronic Design Automation (EDA)is even more important now with the continuous scaling of semiconductor devices, blending development requirements from chips to systems and extending beyond electronics into interactions with mechanical, electromagnetic effects of system design. Demands for lower power, higher reliability, and more agile electronic systems raise new challenges to design automation enabling such systems. For the past five decades, the primary focus of the research track at DAC has been to showcase leading-edge research and practice in tools and methodologies for the design of circuits and systems. 
 In addition to the traditional EDA topics ranging from physical design to system architectures, DAC features high-quality papers ondesign research, design practices, and design automation for cross-cutting topics including low-power, reliability, multicore/application-specific/heterogeneous architectures, 3-D integrations, multi-die systems, emerging device technologies, design automation of "things", and their applications. DAC's EDA technical program has been ensuring the best-in-class solutions that promise to advance EDA.

 Security (SEC) 
 Security (SEC)sessions at DAC focuses on the urgent need to create, analyze, evaluate, and improve the hardware, embedded systems and software base of the contemporary security solutions. Secure and trustworthy software and hardware components, platforms and supply chains are vital to all domains including financial, healthcare, transportation, and energy. Security of systems is becoming equally important. A revolution is underway in many industries that are "connecting the unconnected". Such cyber physical systems, e.g., automobiles, smart grid, medical devices, etc., are taking advantage of integration of physical systems with the information systems. Notwithstanding the numerous benefits, these systems are appealing targets of attacks. Attacks on the cyber-part of such systems can have disastrous consequences in the physical world. The scope and variety of attacks on these systems present design challenges that span embedded hardware, software, networking, and system design. 
 Security sessions at DAC will feature invited special sessions, panels, and lecture/poster presentations by both engineers and researchers to share their knowledge and experience on this evolving environment.

 Systems (SYS) 
 Systems Designis the art of choosing and designing the proper combination of hardware and software components to achieve system-level design goals like speed, efficiency, reliability, security, and safety. Systems Design is an increasingly diverse, disruptive, and challenging field for designs ranging from data centers, mobile devices, medical devices, automotive, consumer, robotics, drones, industrial applications and beyond. Software at the embedded scale is built into devices that may not necessarily be recognized as computing devices (e.g., thermostats, toys, defibrillators, and anti-lock brakes), but nevertheless controls the functionality and perceived quality of these devices. Software at the system-level increasingly drives system design requirements as well as workloads that determine chip and system architectures and testing. 
 The Systems sessions at DAC provide a forum for discussing the challenges of embedded design and an opportunity for leaders in the industry and academia to come together to exchange ideas and roadmaps for the future for this rapidly expanding area.
