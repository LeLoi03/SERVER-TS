 The 1st Annual IEEE Communications Society Demonstration Conference 
 Welcome to the 2025 IEEE 26th International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR) 
 High Performance Switching and Routing (HPSR) is an essential technology for today's high-speed, high-capacity data networks; HPSR has supported the wired and wireless network infrastructure of telecommunications carriers and Internet service providers. In these networks, new paradigms such as network virtualization, cloud edge computing, green networking, and the Internet of Things have emerged one after another, and HPSR has played an important role in each of them. In recent years, it has become especially important in data center networking. As artificial intelligence, especially large-scale language models, is expected to transform society, the need for switching and routing of huge amounts of traffic in data center networks has increased the importance of research and development of HPSR. The IEEE International Conference on HPSR has been held annually to date as a forum for the presentation of cutting-edge research results related to HPSR technology and the 26thedition will be held in Osaka, Japan from May 20 to May 22, 2025. We hope to contribute to the further development of the HPSR community through the presentation of cutting-edge research results on HPSR and heated discussions among participants. We are looking forward to receiving your contributions of cutting-edge research results on HPSR.

 Submit your paper 
 The design of next-generation networks and future communication systems will be shaped by improved services, leading to greater management complexity for network providers across diverse technology platforms. Innovative networking technologies are essential to efficiently and effectively handle the complexities of traffic demands, particularly with the rise of over-the-top services offered by network data-center operators and individual companies. 
 The focus of IEEE HPSR 2025 is to asses groundbreaking services and technologies and their impact on networks, telecommunications, and supporting data communication systems. To inspire these discussions, we are seeking original and thought-provoking works on switching, routing, and networking and their applied technologies.
