Paper Submittals 
 The IOLTS Program Committee invitesoriginal, unpublished, and not currently under review submissionsfor IOLTS 2025. 
 Submitted papers must be complete manuscripts, up to six pages (the references do not count towards the page limit,andreferences don’t have page limits) in a standard IEEE A4 two-column format. Papers exceeding the page limit will be returned without review. Authors should clearly explain the significance of the work, highlight novel features, and describe its current status. 
 If a paper is accepted as a full paper (6 pages) or a poster (2 pages), authors will be invited to prepare a camera-ready paper for inclusion in the formal proceedings of the conference and will be required to present the paper at the conference. 
 For every presentation at the conference (including full oral presentations, poster presentations, and special session presentations), an associated ‘author’ registration (full registration rate) is required. 
 The areas of interest include (but are not limited to) the following topics: 
 Dependable system design 
 Dependable Computer Architectures 
 Design-for-Reliability 
 Design for Reliability approaches for Low-Power 
 Cross-layer reliability approaches 
 Fault-Tolerant and Fail-Safe systems
