 AISC Program 
 13th February 2025 
 Australasian Information Security Conference (AISC 2025) will be held as part of the Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW 2025,http://acsw.core.edu.au/), which represents the largest annual gathering of computer scientists and researchers in Australasia. This conference aims at promoting research on all aspects of cyber security, digital forensics, and cryptography and increasing communication between academic and industrial researchers working in this area. AISC 2025 welcomes not only computer scientists and researchers, but also educators, students, technicians, practitioners and industry from across the world. We encourage contributions from different fields such as system security, network security, cyber security, cryptology and etc. The accepted papers will be submitted to the ACM library.

 Instructions for Authors 
 Author instructions and LaTeX/Word templates for ACM publications can be found via the following link: 
 https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template 
 Papers should be submitted via Easychair athref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acsw2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acsw2025
All the submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted to another conference or journal for consideration of publication. Submissions must be fully anonymous with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references. Submissions must be written in English and have at most 20 pages including bibliography usingACMpackage with no changes to the style. Submissions can exceed 20 pages, but any content beyond 20 pages should be placed in the Appendix. Papers should be sufficiently intelligible and self-contained without appendices so that PC members can make decisions without reading appendices. 
  
 New OA publishing model for ICPS 
 In the current model, ACM charges a production fee to conference organizers, but no publication fees are charged to individual authors. Separate OA options are available for an additional fee payable by the organizers. In the new model,all ICPS papers published in the DL will automatically be made OA, and production/OA fees will no longer be charged to conference organizers.Papers that fall into the following categorieswill be published in the DL at no charge: 
 If the corresponding author is affiliated with an institution participating in ACM’s transformativeACM Open model. | A list of the 700+ institutions currently participating in ACM Open is availablehere. 
 Note that, by the end of 2024, we expect roughly 50% of papers published in the DL to be covered by ACM Open agreements; by the end of 2025, we expect the proportion to rise to 60%-70%; and, in the longer term, we expect to get to roughly 80%. 
 If the country in which your institution is located is onthis list of countriescovered by ACM’s agreements withEIFLandhref="https://www.research4life.org/" - Research4Life
and/or classified by the World Bank as low-income countries.
