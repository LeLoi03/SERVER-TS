 IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture® 
 TheIEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture®is the premier forum for presenting, discussing, and debating innovative microarchitecture ideas and techniques for advanced computing and communication systems. This symposium brings together researchers in fields related to microarchitecture, compilers, chips, and systems for technical exchange on traditional microarchitecture topics and emerging research areas. The MICRO community has enjoyed a close interaction between academic researchers and industrial designers.

 by Lieven Eeckhout 
 The MICRO Steering Committee has unanimously agreed to allow general chairs (and the rest of the organizing commitee) to submit papers to the conference they are organizing. The rationale for explicitly allowing general chair(s) to submit is that they do not participate in the paper selection process, nor are they involved in the program chair and program committee selection process.

 Announcements 
 MICRO is Almost at Capacity! 
 October 24, 2024 
 This year we have the fortune of benefiting from a great deal of enthusiasm for the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Microarchitecture conference in Austin, Nov 2nd through 6th. As a result we are looking at a record breaking number of registrants this year. Unfortunately, the downside is that we are likely to exceed the venue capacity for the main conference before the conference's opening date. We expect to reach this limit within the next week and once this happens we will close any new registrations. If you are interested in attending please register ASAP to ensure you are able to attend. It is unlikely that we will have any on-site registration. We are looking forward to seeing as many of you as possible in two weeks!
