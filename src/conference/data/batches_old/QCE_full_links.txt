IEEE Quantum Week— theIEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE)— bridges the gap between the science of quantum computing and the development of the industry surrounding it. This event brings a perspective to the quantum industry that differs from strictly academic or business conferences. 
 IEEE Quantum Week is a multidisciplinary venue that gives attendees the unique chance to discuss challenges and opportunities with quantum researchers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, developers, students, practitioners, educators, programmers, and newcomers. 
 Sign up for Quantum Week AlertsAttend in-person for the full IEEE Quantum Week experience! 
 QCE25 will be held in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA, as an in-person conference and expo at the Albuquerque Convention Center.Virtual registration options are available for those who are unable to travel to the conference. 
 Come to IEEE Quantum Week to network with your peers and explore partnerships in industry, government, and academia. You will find experts on the following areas of focus: 
 quantum systems software 
 quantum technology engineering 
 hybrid quantum-classical computing architectures & algorithms 
 distributed quantum computing 
 quantum-genAI nexus 
 quantum simulation 
 quantum machine learning (QML) 
 adiabatic computing 
 integrated HPC & quantum platforms 
 software engineering methods & tools 
 quantum error correction and mitigation 
 quantum utility 
 quantum advantage 
 quantum benchmarks 
 quantum optimization techniques 
 quantum sensing 
 simulation of chemical, | physical and biological systems 
 quantum applications 
 With your contributions and support, together we are building the premier meeting of quantum minds to help advance the field.

IEEE Quantum Week— theIEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE)— bridges the gap between the science of quantum computing and the development of the industry surrounding it. This event brings a perspective to the quantum industry that differs from strictly academic or business conferences. 
 IEEE Quantum Week is a multidisciplinary venue that gives attendees the unique chance to discuss challenges and opportunities with quantum researchers, scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, developers, students, practitioners, educators, programmers, and newcomers. 
 Sign up for Quantum Week AlertsAttend in-person for the full IEEE Quantum Week experience! 
 QCE25 will be held in Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA, as an in-person conference and expo at the Albuquerque Convention Center.Virtual registration options are available for those who are unable to travel to the conference. 
 Come to IEEE Quantum Week to network with your peers and explore partnerships in industry, government, and academia. You will find experts on the following areas of focus: 
 quantum systems software 
 quantum technology engineering 
 hybrid quantum-classical computing architectures & algorithms 
 distributed quantum computing 
 quantum-genAI nexus 
 quantum simulation 
 quantum machine learning (QML) 
 adiabatic computing 
 integrated HPC & quantum platforms 
 software engineering methods & tools 
 quantum error correction and mitigation 
 quantum utility 
 quantum advantage 
 quantum benchmarks 
 quantum optimization techniques 
 quantum sensing 
 simulation of chemical, | physical and biological systems 
 quantum applications 
 With your contributions and support, together we are building the premier meeting of quantum minds to help advance the field. 
 Looking for a Sneak Peek at What to Expect QCE25? 
 IEEE Quantum Week showcases quantum research, practice, applications, education, and training. As a teaser for IEEE Quantum Week 2025, here is the QCE24 final program:

 Submission Guidelines 
 All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The following paper categories are available: 
 Full papers | are 8-10 pages (including figures and tables and appendices), plus two additional pages for references. Full papers should fall into one of the following categories: | Research papers (RESP)that describe the paper’s contributions and/or innovations as well as the research methods used. 
 Survey papers (SURP)that describe a survey on a research topic in the fields of quantum computing and engineering. 
 Short papers | are 4-6 pages (including figures and tables and appendices), plus one additional page of references. Short papers should fall into one of the following categories: | New Ideas and Emergent Results (NIER)papers describe novel and promising ideas and/or techniques that are in an early stage of development. 
 Experience and Application (EXAP)papers describe the experiences gained from applying/evaluating quantum computing and engineering research results in practice. It is encouraged that the partners from both practice and research join in the effort as co-authors and that the paper reflects the perspective of both sides. The papers should emphasize the value of the experience to the community. 
 Artifact papers (ARTI)describe model problems, exemplars, or useful sets of resources for the broader quantum computing and engineering community. 
 Submit your paper using the | href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qce25" - EasyChair submission website | to one of the Paper Tracks (i.e., QALG, QAPP, QTEM, QSYS, QML, QPHO, or QNET) described above. 
 Organizers and track chairs greatly appreciated your early abstract submission for planning purposes. To submit your abstract early, enter the author information, title, abstract, and keywords in the | href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=qce25" - EasyChair submission | text boxes. This information can be updated later if need be. Early abstract submission is optional but encouraged. 
 Indicate the Paper Type (i.e., RESP, SURP, NIER, EXAP, ARTI) in the file name and description of your EasyChair submission. 
 For further information about the submission process, requirements and deadlines, the selection process, and any other questions regarding the program itself or contact information, please consult the QCE website athref="https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2025/call-for-technical-papers/" - https://qce.quantum.ieee.org/2025/call-for-technical-papers/
