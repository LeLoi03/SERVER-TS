 Call for Special Sessions, Tutorials and Workshops 
 The ACIIDS 2025 invites proposals for Special Sessions, Workshops, and Tutorials to be held during the conference. 
 They intend to provide researchers in focused areas the opportunity to present and discuss their work and offer a forum for interaction among a broader community of researchers. A Session or Workshop will consist of a group of papers in a sub-discipline of Intelligent Information and Database Systems related to the main topics of ACIIDS 2025, while Tutorials mainly focus on presenting new trends and research opportunities in the fields of databases and intelligent systems. 
 Please send the proposals to Dr Bogumiła Hnatkowska (bogumila.hnatkowska@pwr.edu.pl) with the following information: 
 Title & acronym of the session, workshop, or tutorial 
 Brief profiles of organizers 
 General description of the session, workshop, or tutorial scope 
 List of topics 
 Proposed Board of Reviewers (to be invited) 
 The papers will be required to meet the same standards as ACIIDS papers and will be published in the conference proceedings, in a bound volume by Springer-Verlag. 
 All the Special Sessions and Doctoral Track will be centralized as tracks in the same conference submission and reviewing system as the regular papers. 
 The organizers will be responsible for the advertisement and promotion of the special session and the conference including the Special Session webpage preparation. 
 The review process for the conference is highly rigorous. It comprises two phases: we gather reviews from reviewers, and in the second phase submissions and reviews are re-evaluated by the Meta-reviewing Committee. Although the Organizers of Special Sessions are responsible for the review process, the final decision regarding acceptance will be made by the ACIIDS Program Committee. 
 These rules aim to select the best papers and ensure the highest quality of the chosen papers. Our review model ensures that papers from both the Main Track and Special Sessions are held to an equally high standard.
