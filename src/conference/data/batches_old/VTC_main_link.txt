 VTC2025-Spring: Recent Results 
 As an adjunct to the main conference, the Technical Program Committee is opening a Recent Results track that will offer the opportunity for rapid publication of emerging work by industry and academia. Authors have the option of seeking an oral or poster presentation accompanied by a paper in the proceedings, or a demo accompanied by a short paper. 
 The Recent Results track will accept submissions in all topics relevant to VTC. It differs from other tracks in that submission of 2-page abstracts (with results) will be considered as well as 5-page full papers. All abstracts submitted to the Recent Results track will undergo peer-review by subject matter experts, and the full paper version of accepted submissions will be submitted for publication in the conference proceedings and on IEEE Xplore® (conditional on presentation by one of the authors at the conference). All submissions should emphasize the novelty of the work and the results obtained. 
 Deadlines 
 Submission of full papers EXTENDED:13 March 2025 
 Acceptance notification:20 April 2025 
 Final paper submission:4 May 2025
