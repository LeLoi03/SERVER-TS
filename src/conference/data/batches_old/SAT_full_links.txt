The International Conferences on 
 Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT)[Next Conference] · [Past Meetings] · [Related Sites]The International Conferences on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing are the primary annual meetings for researchers studying the propositional satisfiability problem (SAT), a prominent problem in both theoretical and applied computer science. SAT lies at the heart of the most important open problem in complexity theory (PvsNP) and underlies many applications in, among other examples, artificial intelligence, operations research, and electronic design engineering. The primary objective of the conferences is to bring together researchers from various areas and communities, including theoretical and experimental computer science as well as the many relevant application areas to promote collaboration and the communication of new theoretical and practical results in SAT-related research and its industrial applications.

The International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT) is the premier annual meeting for researchers focusing on the theory and applications of the propositional satisfiability problem, broadly construed. In addition to plain propositional satisfiability, it also includes Boolean optimization (such as MaxSAT and Pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints), Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF), Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT), Model Counting, and Constraint Programming (CP) for problems with clear connections to Boolean-level reasoning. 
  
 Many hard combinatorial problems can be tackled using SAT-based techniques including problems that arise in Formal Verification, Artificial Intelligence, Operations Research, Computational Biology, Cryptography, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Mathematics, etc. Indeed, the theoretical and practical advances in SAT research over the past twenty years have contributed to making SAT technology an indispensable tool in a variety of domains. 
  
 SAT 2024 aims to further advance the field by soliciting original theoretical and practical contributions in these areas with a clear connection to satisfiability. Specifically, SAT 2024 invites scientific contributions addressing different aspects of SAT interpreted in a broad sense, including (but not restricted to) theoretical advances (such as exact algorithms, proof complexity, and other complexity issues), practical search algorithms, knowledge compilation, implementation-level details of SAT solvers and SAT-based systems, problem encodings and reformulations, applications (including both novel application domains and improvements to existing approaches), as well as case studies and reports on findings based on rigorous experimentation.

Authors:Martina Seidl 
 AbstractBecause of the duality of universal and existential quantification, quantified Boolean formulas (QBF), the extension of propositional logic with quantifiers over the Boolean variables, have not only solutions in terms of models for true formulas like in SAT. Also false QBFs have solutions in terms of counter-models. Both models and counter-models can be represented as certain binary trees or as sets of Boolean functions reflecting the dependencies among the variables of a formula. Such solutions encode the answers to application problems for which QBF solvers are employed like the plan for a planning problem or the error trace of a verification problem. Therefore, models and counter-models are at the core of theory and practice of QBF solving. In this invited talk, we survey approaches that deal with models and counter-models of QBFs and identify some open challenges.

href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.SAT.2024.2" - Scalable Proof Production and Checking in SMT (Invited Talk)
Authors:Cesare Tinelli 
 AbstractSolvers for Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) have become crucial components in safety- or mission-critical formal methods applications, in particular model checking, verification, and security analysis. Since state-of-the-art SMT solvers are large and complex systems, they are prohibitively difficult to prove correct. Hence, proof production is essential as a way to demonstrate instead the correctness of their responses, making those responses amenable to independent verification. Historically, the main challenges for proof production in SMT have been solver performance and proof coverage, often leading to the disabling of many sophisticated solving techniques when running in proof-production mode, or to coarse-grained, and harder to check, proofs. The first part of this talk presents a flexible proof-production architecture designed to handle the complexity of versatile, industrial-strength SMT solvers, and discusses how it has been leveraged to produce detailed proofs, even for sophisticated reasoning components. The architecture, implemented in the state-of-the-art SMT solver cvc5, allows proofs to be produced modularly, as needed, and with various safeguards for correctness. The architecture supports the generation of textual proof certificates in different formats, for offline proof checking by external tools, as well as a rich API, which is useful for online integration of the SMT solver into other reasoning tools such as, for instance, skeptical proof assistants. Extensive experimental evaluations with both SMT-LIB benchmarks and benchmarks provided by industrial partners have shown that the new architecture results in greater proof coverage than previous approaches, imposes a small runtime overhead, and supports fine-grained proofs in the great majority of cases. The second part of the talk gives an overview of a new generic language for expressing SMT proof certificates that builds on almost two decades of work and experience in proof generation and checking in SMT and combines the benefits of several previous efforts on the topic. While developed to express cvc5’s proof certificates, the language is meant to be useful to other SMT solvers as well. It is in fact a logical framework, based on the syntax and semantics of the upcoming Version 3 of the SMT-LIB standard, that can be customized, as in the case of cvc5, with the specific proof system used by the solver through the definition of new symbols, binders and proof rules. In addition, it features an intuitive syntax for representing natural-deduction-style proofs and the ability to integrate other proof formats (such as, for instance, those currently used by SAT solvers) via the use of oracles. The talk discusses an initial evaluation of the proof language, obtained with a companion checker for it and an instantiation to cvc5’s proof system. The evaluation shows the viability of high-performance, fine-grained proof production and checking for SMT. The talk concludes with a brief overview of future work and new potential applications enabled by scalable proof certificate production and checking.

Authors:Moshe Y. Vardi 
 AbstractThe standard approach to algorithm development is to focus on a specific problem and develop for it a specific algorithm. Codd’s introduction of the relational model in 1970 included two fundamental ideas: (1) relations provide a universal data representation formalism, and (2) relational databases can be queried using first-order logic. Realizing these ideas required the development of a meta-algorithm, which takes a declarative query and executes it with respect to a database. In this talk, I will describe this approach, which I call Logical Algorithmics, in detail, and trace a decades-long path from the comoutational complexity theory of relational queries to recent tools for Boolean reasoning.

Authors:Markus Anders, Sofia Brenner, and Gaurav Rattan 
 AbstractSymmetry reduction is crucial for solving many interesting SAT instances in practice. Numerous approaches have been proposed, which try to strike a balance between symmetry reduction and computational overhead. Arguably the most readily applicable method is the computation of static symmetry breaking constraints: a constraint restricting the search-space to non-symmetrical solutions is added to a given SAT instance. A distinct advantage of static symmetry breaking is that the SAT solver itself is not modified. A disadvantage is that the strength of symmetry reduction is usually limited. In order to boost symmetry reduction, the state-of-the-art tool BreakID [Devriendt et. al] pioneered the identification and tailored breaking of a particular substructure of symmetries, the so-called row interchangeability groups. In this paper, we propose a new symmetry breaking tool called satsuma. The core principle of our tool is to exploit more diverse but frequently occurring symmetry structures. This is enabled by new practical detection algorithms for row interchangeability, row-column symmetry, Johnson symmetry, and various combinations. Based on the resulting structural description, we then produce symmetry breaking constraints. We compare this new approach to BreakID on a range of instance families exhibiting symmetry. Our benchmarks suggest improved symmetry reduction in the presence of Johnson symmetry and comparable performance in the presence of row-column symmetry. Moreover, our implementation runs significantly faster, even though it identifies more diverse structures.

Authors:Olaf Beyersdorff, Johannes K. Fichte, Markus Hecher, Tim Hoffmann, and Kaspar Kasche 
 AbstractThe propositional model counting problem #SAT asks to compute the number of satisfying assignments for a given propositional formula. Recently, three #SAT proof systems kcps (knowledge compilation proof system), MICE (model counting induction by claim extension), and CPOG (certified partitioned-operation graphs) have been introduced with the aim to model #SAT solving and enable proof logging for solvers. Prior to this paper, the relations between these proof systems have been unclear and very few proof complexity results are known. We completely determine the simulation order of the three systems, establishing that CPOG simulates both MICE and kcps, while MICE and kcps are exponentially incomparable. This implies that CPOG is strictly stronger than the other two systems.

Authors:Armin Biere, Katalin Fazekas, Mathias Fleury, and Nils Froleyks 
 AbstractMany practical applications of satisfiability solving employ multiple steps to encode an original problem formulation into conjunctive normal form. Often circuits are used as intermediate representation before encoding those circuits into clausal form. These circuits however might contain redundant isomorphic sub-circuits. If blindly translated into clausal form, this redundancy is retained and increases solving time unless specific preprocessing algorithms are used. Furthermore, such redundant sub-formula structure might only emerge during solving and needs to be addressed by inprocessing. This paper presents a new approach which extracts gate information from the formula and applies congruence closure to match and eliminate redundant gates. Besides new algorithms for gate extraction, we also describe previous unpublished attempts to tackle this problem. Experiments focus on the important problem of combinational equivalence checking for hardware designs and show that our new approach yields a substantial gain in CNF solver performance.

Authors:Ilario Bonacina, Maria Luisa Bonet, and Massimo Lauria 
 AbstractPopular redundancy rules for SAT are not necessarily sound for MaxSAT. The works of [Bonacina-Bonet-Buss-Lauria'24] and [Ihalainen-Berg-Järvisalo'22] proposed ways to adapt them, but required specific encodings and more sophisticated checks during proof verification. Here, we propose a different way to adapt redundancy rules from SAT to MaxSAT. Our rules do not require specific encodings, their correctness is simpler to check, but they are slightly less expressive. However, the proposed redundancy rules, when added to MaxSAT-Resolution, are already strong enough to capture Branch-and-bound algorithms, enable short proofs of the optimal cost of notable principles (e.g., the Pigeonhole Principle and the Parity Principle), and allow to break simple symmetries (e.g., XOR-ification does not make formulas harder).

Authors:Yi Chu, Chu-Min Li, Furong Ye, and Shaowei Cai 
 AbstractLocal search has been widely applied to solve the well-known (weighted) partial MaxSAT problem, significantly influencing many real-world applications. The main difficulty to overcome when designing a local search algorithm is that it can easily fall into local optima. Clause weighting is a beneficial technique that dynamically adjusts the landscape of search space to help the algorithm escape from local optima. Existing works tend to increase the weights of falsified clauses, and such strategies may result in an unpredictable landscape of search space during the optimization process. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Unified Soft Clause Weighting Scheme called Unified-SW, which increases the weights of all soft clauses in feasible local optima, whether they are satisfied or not, while preserving the hierarchy among them. We implemented Unified-SW in a new local search solver called USW-LS. Experimental results demonstrate that USW-LS, outperforms the state-of-the-art local search solvers across benchmarks from anytime tracks of recent MaxSAT Evaluations. More promisingly, a hybrid solver combining USW-LS and TT-Open-WBO-Inc won all four categories in the anytime track of MaxSAT Evaluation 2023.

Authors:Robin Coutelier, Mathias Fleury, and Laura Kovács 
 AbstractChronological backtracking is an interesting SAT solving technique within CDCL reasoning, as it backtracks less aggressively upon conflicts. However, chronological backtracking is more difficult to maintain due to its weaker SAT solving invariants. This paper introduces a lazy reimplication procedure for missed lower implications in chronological backtracking. Our method saves propagations by reimplying literals on demand, rather than eagerly. Due to its modularity, our work can be replicated in other solvers, as shown by our results in the solvers CaDiCaL and Glucose.

Authors:Yogesh Dahiya, Meena Mahajan, and Sasank Mouli 
 AbstractIn this paper, we obtain new size lower bounds for proofs in the Polynomial Calculus (PC) proof system, in two different settings. - When the Boolean variables are encoded using ±1 (as opposed to 0,1): We establish a lifting theorem using an asymmetric gadget G, showing that for an unsatisfiable formula F, the lifted formula F∘G requires PC size 2^{Ω(d)}, where d is the degree required to refute F. Our lower bound does not depend on the number of variables n, and holds over every field. The only previously known size lower bounds in this setting were established quite recently in [Sokolov, STOC 2020] using lifting with another (symmetric) gadget. The size lower bound there is 2^{Ω((d-d₀)²/n)} (where d₀ is the degree of the initial equations arising from the formula), and is shown to hold only over the reals. - When the PC refutation proceeds over a finite field 𝔽_p and is allowed to use extension variables: We show that there is an unsatisfiable AC⁰[p] formula with N variables for which any PC refutation using N^{1+ε(1-δ)} extension variables, each of arity at most N^{1-ε} and size at most N^c, must have size exp(Ω(N^{εδ}/polylog N)). Our proof achieves these bounds by an XOR-ification of the generalised PHP^{m,r}_n formulas from [Razborov, CC 1998]. The only previously known lower bounds for PC in this setting are those obtained in [Impagliazzo-Mouli-Pitassi, CCC 2023]; in those bounds the number of extension variables is required to be sub-quadratic, and their arity is restricted to logarithmic in the number of original variables. Our result generalises these, and demonstrates a tradeoff between the number and the arity of extension variables. Since our tautology is represented by a small AC⁰[p] formula, our results imply lower bounds for a reasonably strong fragment of AC⁰[p]-Frege.

Authors:Alexis de Colnet 
 AbstractTop-down compilers of CNF formulas to circuits in decision-DNNF (Decomposable Negation Normal Form) have proved to be useful for model counting. These compilers rely on a common set of techniques including DPLL-style exploration of the set of models, caching of residual formulas, and connected components detection. Differences between compilers lie in the variable selection heuristics and in the additional processing techniques they may use. We investigate, from a theoretical perspective, the ability of top-down compilation algorithms to find small decision-DNNF circuits for two different variable selection strategies. Both strategies are guided by a graph of the CNF formula and are inspired by what is done in practice. The first uses a dynamic graph-partitioning approach while the second works with a static tree decomposition. We show that the dynamic approach performs significantly better than the static approach for some formulas, and that the opposite also holds for other formulas. Our lower bounds are proved despite loose settings where the compilation algorithm is only forced to follow its designed variable selection strategy and where everything else, including the many opportunities for tie-breaking, can be handled non-deterministically.

Authors:Daniel Faber, Adalat Jabrayilov, and Petra Mutzel 
 AbstractIn this paper, we revisit SAT encodings of the partial-ordering based ILP model for the graph coloring problem (GCP) and suggest a generalization for the bandwidth coloring problem (BCP). The GCP asks for the minimum number of colors that can be assigned to the vertices of a given graph such that each two adjacent vertices get different colors. The BCP is a generalization, where each edge has a weight that enforces a minimal "distance" between the assigned colors, and the goal is to minimize the "largest" color used. For the widely studied GCP, we experimentally compare the partial-ordering based SAT encoding to the state-of-the-art approaches on the DIMACS benchmark set. Our evaluation confirms that this SAT encoding is effective for sparse graphs and even outperforms the state-of-the-art on some DIMACS instances. For the BCP, our theoretical analysis shows that the partial-ordering based SAT and ILP formulations have an asymptotically smaller size than that of the classical assignment-based model. Our practical evaluation confirms not only a dominance compared to the assignment-based encodings but also to the state-of-the-art approaches on a set of benchmark instances. Up to our knowledge, we have solved several open instances of the BCP from the literature for the first time.

Authors:Dror Fried, Alexander Nadel, Roberto Sebastiani, and Yogev Shalmon 
 AbstractGiven a combinational circuit Γ with a single output o, AllSAT-CT is the problem of enumerating all solutions of Γ. Recently, we introduced several state-of-the-art AllSAT-CT algorithms based on satisfying generalization, which generalizes a given total Boolean solution to a smaller ternary solution that still satisfies the circuit. We implemented them in our open-source tool HALL. In this work we draw upon recent theoretical works suggesting that utilizing generalization algorithms, which can produce solutions that entail the circuit without satisfying it, may enhance enumeration. After considering the theory and adapting it to our needs, we enrich HALL’s AllSAT-CT algorithms by incorporating several newly implemented generalization schemes and additional SAT solvers. By conducting extensive experiments we show that entailing generalization substantially boosts HALL’s performance and quality (where quality corresponds to the number of reported generalized solutions per instance), with the best results achieved by combining satisfying and entailing generalization.

Authors:Vojtěch Havlena, Lukáš Holík, Ondřej Lengál, and Juraj Síč 
 AbstractWe propose a method for efficient handling string constraints with string-integer conversions. It extends the recently introduced stabilization-based procedure for solving string (dis)equations with regular and length constraints. Our approach is to translate the conversions into a linear integer arithmetic formula, together with regular constraints and word equations. We have integrated it into the string solver Z3-Noodler, and our experiments show that it is competitive and on some established benchmarks even several orders of magnitude faster than the state of the art.

Authors:Lukáš Holík and Pavol Vargovčík 
 AbstractWe introduce a SAT-enabled version of an antichain algorithm for checking language emptiness of alternating finite automata (AFA) with complex transition relations encoded as compact logical formulae. The SAT solver is used to compute predecessors of AFA configurations, and at the same time, to evaluate the subsumption of newly found configurations in the antichain of the previously found ones. The algorithm could be naively implemented by an incremental SAT solver where the growing antichain is represented by adding new clauses. To make it efficient, we 1) force the SAT solver to prioritize largest/subsumption-strongest predecessors (so that weaker configurations are not even generated), and 2) store the antichain clauses in a special variant of a trie that allows fast subsumption testing. The experimental results suggest that the resulting emptiness checker is very efficient compared to the state of the art and that our techniques improve the performance of the SAT solver.

Authors:Alexey Ignatiev, Zi Li Tan, and Christos Karamanos 
 AbstractBoolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers are a family of highly efficient reasoning engines, which are frequently used for solving a large and diverse variety of practical challenges. This applies to multidisciplinary problems belonging to the class NP but also those arising at higher levels of the polynomial hierarchy. Unfortunately, encoding a problem of user’s interest to a (series of) propositional formula(s) in conjunctive normal form (CNF), let alone dealing with a SAT solver, is rarely a simple task even for an experienced SAT practitioner. This situation gets aggravated further when the user has little to no knowledge on the operation of the modern SAT solving technology. In 2018, the PySAT framework was proposed to address the issue of fast and "painless" prototyping with SAT solvers in Python allowing researchers to get SAT-based solutions to their problems without investing substantial time in the development process and yet sacrificing only a little in terms of performance. Since then, PySAT has proved a useful instrument for solving a wide range of practical problems and is now a critical package for the PyPI infrastructure. In the meantime, there have been advances in SAT solving and enhancements to PySAT functionality to extend its modelling and solving capabilities in order to make modern SAT technology accessible and deployable on a massive scale. This paper provides a high-level overview of the current architecture of PySAT and some of its capabilities including arbitrary Boolean formula manipulation, CNF preprocessing, and support for external user-defined propagators.

Authors:Yoichiro Iida, Tomohiro Sonobe, and Mary Inaba 
 AbstractParallelization of SAT solvers is an important technique for improving solver performance. The selection of the learnt clauses to share among parallel workers is crucial for its efficiency. Literal block distance (LBD) is often used to evaluate the quality of clauses to select. We propose a new method, Parallel Clause sharing based on graph Structure (PaCS), to select good clauses for sharing. First, we conducted three preliminary experiments to assess the performance of LBD in parallel clause sharing: a performance comparison between the LBD and clause size, an analysis of the utilization of shared clauses, and a comparison of the LBD values of shared clauses at originating and receiving workers. These experiments indicate that the LBD may not be optimal for learnt clause sharing. We attribute the results to the LBD’s inherent dependency on decision trees. Each parallel worker has a unique decision tree; thus, a sharing clause that is good for its originating worker may not be good for others. Therefore, we propose PaCS, a search-independent method that uses the graph structure derived from the input CNF of SAT problems. PaCS evaluates clauses using their edges' weight in the variable incidence graph. Using the input CNF’s graph is effective for parallel clause sharing because it is the common input for all parallel workers. Furthermore, using edge weight can select clauses whose variables' Boolean values are more likely to be determined. Performance evaluation experiments demonstrate that our strategy outperforms LBD by 4% in the number of solved instances and by 12% in PAR-2. This study opens avenues for further improvements in parallel-solving strategies using the structure of SAT problems and reinterpretations of the quality of learnt clauses.

Authors:Markus Iser and Christoph Jabs 
 AbstractThis paper presents Global Benchmark Database (GBD), a comprehensive suite of tools for provisioning and sustainably maintaining benchmark instances and their metadata. The availability of benchmark metadata is essential for many tasks in empirical research, e.g., for the data-driven compilation of benchmarks, the domain-specific analysis of runtime experiments, or the instance-specific selection of solvers. In this paper, we introduce the data model of GBD as well as its interfaces and provide examples of how to interact with them. We also demonstrate the integration of custom data sources and explain how to extend GBD with additional problem domains, instance formats and feature extractors.

Authors:Dmitry Itsykson and Sergei Ovcharov 
 AbstractWe study the symbolic approach to the propositional satisfiability problem proposed by Aguirre and Vardi in 2001 based on OBDDs and symbolic quantifier elimination. We study the theoretical limitations of the most general version of this approach where it is allowed to dynamically change variable order in OBDD. We refer to algorithms based on this approach as OBDD(∧, ∃, reordering) algorithms. We prove the first exponential lower bound of OBDD(∧, ∃, reordering) algorithms on unsatisfiable formulas, and give an example of formulas having short tree-like resolution proofs that are exponentially hard for OBDD(∧, ∃, reordering) algorithms. We also present the first exponential lower bound for natural formulas with clear combinatorial meaning: every OBDD(∧, ∃, reordering) algorithm runs exponentially long on the binary pigeonhole principle BPHP^{n+1}_n.

Authors:Leszek Aleksander Kołodziejczyk and Neil Thapen 
 AbstractIt has become standard that, when a SAT solver decides that a CNF Γ is unsatisfiable, it produces a certificate of unsatisfiability in the form of a refutation of Γ in some proof system. The system typically used is DRAT, which is equivalent to extended resolution (ER) - for example, until this year DRAT refutations were required in the annual SAT competition. Recently [Bogaerts et al. 2023] introduced a new proof system, associated with the tool VeriPB, which is at least as strong as DRAT and is further able to handle certain symmetry-breaking techniques. We show that this system simulates the proof system G₁, which allows limited reasoning with QBFs and forms the first level above ER in a natural hierarchy of proof systems. This hierarchy is not known to be strict, but nevertheless this is evidence that the system of [Bogaerts et al. 2023] is plausibly strictly stronger than ER and DRAT. In the other direction, we show that symmetry-breaking for a single symmetry can be handled inside ER.

Authors:Jean-Marie Lagniez, Pierre Marquis, and Armin Biere 
 AbstractIn this paper, we explore the application of blocked clause elimination for projected model counting. This is the problem of determining the number of models ‖∃ X . Σ‖ of a propositional formula Σ after eliminating a given set X of variables existentially. Although blocked clause elimination is a well-known technique for SAT solving, its direct application to model counting is challenging as in general it changes the number of models. However, we demonstrate, by focusing on projected variables during the blocked clause search, that blocked clause elimination can be leveraged while preserving the correct model count. To take advantage of blocked clause elimination in an efficient way during model counting, a novel data structure and associated algorithms are introduced. Our proposed approach is implemented in the model counter d4. Our experiments demonstrate the computational benefits of our new method of blocked clause elimination for projected model counting.

Not surprisingly, it has been studied in depth and the two-watched-literal scheme, enhanced with implementation details boosting its performance, has emerged as the dominant method. In pseudo-Boolean solvers, the importance of unit propagation is similar, but no dominant method exists: counter propagation and watched-based extensions are efficient for different types of constraints, which has opened the door to hybrid methods. However, probably due to the higher complexity of implementing pseudo-Boolean solvers, research efforts have not focused much on concrete implementation details for unit propagation but rather on higher-level aspects of other procedures, such as conflict analysis. In this paper, we present (i) a novel methodology to precisely assess the performance of propagation mechanisms, (ii) an evaluation of implementation variants of the propagation methods present in {RoundingSat} and (iii) a detailed analysis showing that hybrid methods outperform the ones based on a single technique. Our final contribution is to show that a carefully implemented hybrid propagation method is considerably faster than the preferred propagation mechanism in {RoundingSat}, and that this improvement leads to a better overall performance of the solver.

Authors:Franz-Xaver Reichl, Friedrich Slivovsky, and Stefan Szeider 
 AbstracteSLIM is a tool for circuit minimization that utilizes Exact Synthesis and the SAT-based local improvement method (SLIM) to locally improve circuits. eSLIM improves upon the earlier prototype CIOPS that uses Quantified Boolean Formulas (QBF) to succinctly encode resynthesis of multi-output subcircuits subject to don't cares. This paper describes two improvements. First, it presents a purely propositional encoding based on a Boolean relation characterizing the input-output behavior of the subcircuit under don't cares. This allows the use of a SAT solver for resynthesis, substantially reducing running times when applied to functions from the IWLS 2023 competition, where eSLIM placed second. Second, it proposes circuit partitioning techniques in which don't cares for a subcircuit are captured only with respect to an enclosing window, rather than the entire circuit. Circuit partitioning trades completeness for efficiency, and successfully enables the application of exact synthesis to some of the largest circuits in the EPFL suite, leading to improvements over the current best implementation for several instances.

Authors:Christoph Scholl, Tobias Seufert, and Fabian Siegwolf 
 AbstractMotivated by the application of quality assessment of logic locking we introduce Hierarchical Stochastic SAT (HSSAT) which generalizes Stochastic SAT (SSAT). We look into the complexity of HSSAT and for solving HSSAT formulas we provide a prototype solver which computes exact evaluation results (i.e., without any approximation and without any imprecision caused by numerical rounding errors). Finally, we perform an intensive experimental evaluation of our HSSAT solver in the context of quality assessment of logic locking.

Authors:Dominik Schreiber 
 AbstractRecent advances have enabled powerful distributed SAT solvers to emit proofs of unsatisfiability, which renders them as trustworthy as sequential solvers. However, this mode of operation is still lacking behind conventional distributed solving in terms of scalability. We argue that the core limiting factor of such approaches is the requirement of a single, persistent artifact at the end of solving that is then checked independently (and sequentially). As an alternative, we propose a bottleneck-free setup that exploits recent advancements in producing and processing LRAT information to immediately check all solvers' reasoning on-the-fly during solving. In terms of clause sharing, our approach transfers the guarantee of a derived clause’s soundness from the sending to the receiving side via cryptographic signatures. Experiments with up to 2432 cores (32 nodes) indicate that our approach reduces the running time overhead incurred by proof checking by an order of magnitude, down to a median overhead of ≤ 42% over non trusted solving.

Authors:Irfansha Shaik and Jaco van de Pol 
 AbstractLayout synthesis is mapping a quantum circuit to a quantum processor. SWAP gate insertions are needed for scheduling 2-qubit gates only on connected physical qubits. With the ever-increasing number of qubits in NISQ processors, scalable layout synthesis is of utmost importance. With large optimality gaps observed in heuristic approaches, scalable exact methods are needed. While recent exact and near-optimal approaches scale to moderate circuits, large deep circuits are still out of scope. In this work, we propose a SAT encoding based on parallel plans that apply 1 SWAP and a group of CNOTs at each time step. Using domain-specific information, we maintain optimality in parallel plans while scaling to large and deep circuits. From our results, we show the scalability of our approach which significantly outperforms leading exact and near-optimal approaches (up to 100x). For the first time, we can optimally map several 8, 14, and 16 qubit circuits onto 54, 80, and 127 qubit platforms with up to 17 SWAPs. While adding optimal SWAPs, we also report near-optimal depth in our mapped circuits.

Authors:Hadar Shavit and Holger H. Hoos 
 AbstractBoolean satisfiability (SAT) is an NP-complete problem with important applications, notably in hardware and software verification. Characterising a SAT instance by a set of features has shown great potential for various tasks, ranging from algorithm selection to benchmark generation. In this work, we revisit the widely used SATZilla features and introduce a new version of the tool used to compute them. In particular, we utilise a new preprocessor and SAT solvers, adjust the code to accommodate larger formulas, and determine better settings of the feature extraction time limits. We evaluate the extracted features on three downstream tasks: satisfiability prediction, running time prediction, and algorithm selection. We observe that our new tool is able to extract features from a broader range of instances than before. We show that the new version of the feature extractor produces features that achieve up to 26% lower RMSE for running time prediction, up to 3% higher accuracy for satisfiability prediction, and up to 15 times higher closed gap for algorithm selection on benchmarks from recent SAT competitions.

Authors:Friedrich Slivovsky 
 AbstractIn applications, QBF solvers are often required to generate strategies. This typically involves a process known as strategy extraction, where a Boolean circuit encoding a strategy is computed from a proof. It has previously been observed that Craig interpolation in propositional logic can be seen as a special case of QBF strategy extraction. In this paper we explore this connection further and show that, conversely, any strategy for a false QBF corresponds to a sequence of interpolants in its complete (Herbrand) expansion. Inspired by this correspondence, we present a new strategy extraction algorithm for the expansion-based proof system Exp+Res. Its asymptotic running time matches the best known bound of O(mn) for a proof with m lines and n universally quantified variables. We report on experiments comparing this algorithm with a strategy extraction algorithm based on combining partial strategies, as well as with round-based strategy extraction.

Authors:Jiong Yang, Yaroslav A. Kharkov, Yunong Shi, Marijn J. H. Heule, and Bruno Dutertre 
 AbstractQuantum Computing (QC) is a new computational paradigm that promises significant speedup over classical computing in various domains. However, near-term QC faces numerous challenges, including limited qubit connectivity and noisy quantum operations. To address the qubit connectivity constraint, circuit mapping is required for executing quantum circuits on quantum computers. This process involves performing initial qubit placement and using the quantum SWAP operations to relocate non-adjacent qubits for nearest-neighbor interaction. Reducing the SWAP count in circuit mapping is essential for improving the success rate of quantum circuit execution as SWAPs are costly and error-prone. In this work, we introduce a novel circuit mapping method by combining incremental and parallel solving for Boolean Satisfiability (SAT). We present an innovative SAT encoding for circuit mapping problems, which significantly improves solver-based mapping methods and provides a smooth trade-off between compilation quality and compilation time. Through comprehensive benchmarking of 78 instances covering 3 quantum algorithms on 2 distinct quantum computer topologies, we demonstrate that our method is 26× faster than state-of-the-art solver-based methods, reducing the compilation time from hours to minutes for important quantum applications. Our method also surpasses the existing heuristics algorithm by 26% in SWAP count.

Authors:Jinqiang Yu, Graham Farr, Alexey Ignatiev, and Peter J. Stuckey 
 AbstractWidespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and machine learning (ML) models on the one hand and a number of crucial issues pertaining to them warrant the need for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). A key explainability question is: given this decision was made, what are the input features which contributed to the decision? Although a range of XAI approaches exist to tackle this problem, most of them have significant limitations. Heuristic XAI approaches suffer from the lack of quality guarantees, and often try to approximate Shapley values, which is not the same as explaining which features contribute to a decision. A recent alternative is so-called formal feature attribution (FFA), which defines feature importance as the fraction of formal abductive explanations (AXp’s) containing the given feature. This measures feature importance from the view of formally reasoning about the model’s behavior. Namely, given a system of constraints logically representing the ML model of interest, computing an AXp requires finding a minimal unsatisfiable subset (MUS) of the system. It is challenging to compute FFA using its definition because that involves counting over all AXp’s (equivalently, counting over MUSes), although one can approximate it. Based on these results, this paper makes several contributions. First, it gives compelling evidence that computing FFA is intractable, even if the set of contrastive formal explanations (CXp’s), which correspond to minimal correction subsets (MCSes) of the logical system, is provided, by proving that the problem is #P-hard. Second, by using the duality between MUSes and MCSes, it proposes an efficient heuristic to switch from MCS enumeration to MUS enumeration on-the-fly resulting in an adaptive explanation enumeration algorithm effectively approximating FFA in an anytime fashion. Finally, experimental results obtained on a range of widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FFA approximation approach in terms of the error of FFA approximation as well as the number of explanations computed and their diversity given a fixed time limit.

Authors:Tianwei Zhang, Tomáš Peitl, and Stefan Szeider 
 AbstractWe obtain the smallest unsatisfiable formulas in subclasses of k-CNF (exactly k distinct literals per clause) with bounded variable or literal occurrences. Smaller unsatisfiable formulas of this type translate into stronger inapproximability results for MaxSAT in the considered formula class. Our results cover subclasses of 3-CNF and 4-CNF; in all subclasses of 3-CNF we considered we were able to determine the smallest size of an unsatisfiable formula; in the case of 4-CNF with at most 5 occurrences per variable we decreased the size of the smallest known unsatisfiable formula. Our methods combine theoretical arguments and symmetry-breaking exhaustive search based on SAT Modulo Symmetries (SMS), a recent framework for isomorph-free SAT-based graph generation. To this end, and as a standalone result of independent interest, we show how to encode formulas as graphs efficiently for SMS.
