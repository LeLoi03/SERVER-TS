 Welcome to CDVE2025 
 CDVE2025 will be held inBangkokin October 19-22, 2025. Our host is the School of Information Technology, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology, Thailand. Mark your agenda! You are all welcome to join us! This series of conference has reached its 22nd years. During the conferences, people from all the continents get together to discuss the state-of-art and advances in cooperative design, visualization, engineering and other applications. This is a very specific conference with a lot of opportunities to discuss face to face among the participants. 
 Invitation to submit papers 
 The conference focus is "cooperative". The CDVE 2025 conference invites submissions of original papers from a broad range of areas in cooperative design, cooperative visualization, and cooperative engineering. It includes those which encompass multiple users, locations, or sensors. Multimodal cooperation and integration in engineering are within the conference attention as well. Topics also cover social networks, IoT, sensor networks e-health care, e-education etc. Check ourhref="calls.html" - call for
