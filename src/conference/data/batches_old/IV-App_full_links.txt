 The International Conference on Information Visualization Theory and Applications aims at becoming a major point of contact between researchers, engineers and practitioners in Information Visualization, covering themes relating to Information and Data Visualization, as well as Visual Analytics or Scientific Visualization. 
 IVAPP is organized in 3 major tracks: 
 Information Visualization 
 Scientific Visualization 
 Visualization Techniques 
  
 Important Dates 
 Regular Paper Submission (1st batch): October 2, 2024 
 Position Paper / Regular Paper (2nd batch) Submission: November 13, 2024 
 Proposals for Workshops and Special Sessions: October 17, 2024 
 Proposals for Tutorials, Demos, and Panels: January 17, 2025 
 All deadlines refer to AOE time, i.e. "Anywhere on Earth" 
 Instructions 
 Authors can submit their work in the form of a complete paper or an abstract, but please note that accepted abstracts are presented but not published in the proceedings of the conference. Complete papers can be submitted as a Regular Paper, representing completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, portraying a short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue discussing ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research focused on one of the conference topic areas. 
 Regular and position paper submissions must be anonymized for the double-blind review process, which will involve two or more expert reviewers. Paper acceptance will be based on quality, relevance to the conference theme and originality as part of the peer-review process. The conference program will include both oral and poster presentations. Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as technical tutorials, dedicated to technical/scientific topics, are also envisaged. 
 All accepted complete papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and on digital support (e.g., see the proceedings from VISIGRAPP 2024:https://doi.org/10.5220/0000183300003660). SCITEPRESS is a member of CrossRef (http://www.crossref.org/) and every paper on our digital library is given a DOI (Digital Object Identifier). The proceedings will be submitted for indexation by SCOPUS, Google Scholar, DBLP, Semantic Scholar, EI and Web of Science / Conference Proceedings Citation Index. 
 A short list of presented papers will be selected so that revised and extended versions of these papers are planned to be published by Springer in a CCIS Series book (final approval pending). 
 A short list of best papers will be invited for a post-conference special issue of the Springer Nature Computer Science Journal. 
 Furthermore, we would like to inform that the event will be of hybrid nature, in the sense that online presentations of accepted papers will be possible for those authors that are unable to travel to the venue. 
 Please see further information and detailed submission instructions athref="https://ivapp.scitevents.org/CallForPapers.aspx" - https://ivapp.scitevents.org/CallForPapers.aspx
