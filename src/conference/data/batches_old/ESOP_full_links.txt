 34th European Symposium on Programming 
 What is new in 2025? 
 ESOP features two submission rounds in 2025. 
 ESOP introduces an optional journal-first channel on round 1. 
 Scope 
 ESOP is an annual conference devoted to fundamental issues in the specification, design, analysis, and implementation of programming languages and systems. 
 ESOP seeks contributions on all aspects of programming language research including, but not limited to, the following areas: 
 programming paradigms and styles 
 methods and tools to specify and reason about programs and languages 
 programming language foundations 
 methods and tools for implementation, concurrency and distribution 
 applications and emerging topics 
 Contributions bridging the gap between theory and practice are particularly welcome. 
 Important Dates 
 ESOP 2025 features a two-round submission scheme. 
 Round 1: 
 Submission deadline: | May 30, 2024 
 Rebuttal: | July 23-25, 2024 
 Notification: | August 8, 2024 
 Round 2: 
 Submission deadline: | October 10, 2024 | (submitted papers can be polished until October 14 23:59, AoE) 
 Rebuttal: | December 3-5, 2024 
 Notification: | December 19, 2024 
 The important dates are available in thehref="/2025/cfp" - Joint Call for Papers
. 
 Submission Categories 
 href="https://esop25.mpi-sws.org" - Submit paper
ESOP 2025 solicits three forms of contributions: 
 Research Papersare articles that advance the state-of-the-art on the theory and practice of programming languages and systems. | For the sake of flexibility, submitted research papers may be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, ACM’s PACMPL, or ACM’s TOPLAS format. There is no page limit for submissions, but authors should be aware that reviewers are likely to balance the review time for all papers and that camera-ready papers may not exceed 25 pages (excluding bibliography) and must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS. 
 Experience Reportsare articles reporting on systems and techniques developed in practice, such as artifacts tools, mechanized proofs, and educational systems, both in academic and industrial settings. These articles must include a critical evaluation of the experience reported. Submitted and camera-ready experience report papers must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, not exceeding 15 pages (excluding bibliography). 
 Fresh Perspectivesare articles that promote new insights on programming languages and systems in a particularly elegant way. These papers may offer new tutorial perspectives of known concepts, or they may introduce fresh new insights and ideas that could lead to relevant future developments. Submitted and camera-ready fresh perspective papers must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, not exceeding 15 pages (excluding bibliography). 
 The paper review process will bedouble-blind. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions and they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). 
 Accepted papers will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Springer’s formatting style files and other information can be found on the Springer website. 
 The papers can be submittedhref="https://esop25.mpi-sws.org" - here
. 
 Paper Submission And Evaluation 
 We welcome paper submissions at both submission rounds. Submissions of each round will be reviewed by the PC and external reviewers for their technical soundness and originality. 
 Round 1 submissions will receive one of three outcomes: Accept, Reject, Revise. In the latter case, the PC will provide a concrete list of revision requests to be completed by the Round 2 submission deadline. Such revised submissions will be reviewed by the same set of reviewers and will either be accepted or rejected. Rejected Round 1 submissions mayNOTbe resubmitted to Round 2. 
 Papers submitted directly to Round 2 will either be accepted or rejected. 
 Artifact Evaluation 
 ESOP 2025 will have a post-paper-acceptance voluntary artifact evaluation. Authors will be encouraged to submit artifacts for evaluation after paper notification. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision. Note: artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including 1-page bibliography), that will appear in the conference proceedings.

 Journal-First Submissions 
 ESOP research papers submitted by the round 1 deadline are eligible to the Journal First channel, if marked so at submission time. The requirements of TOPLAS apply to these submissions. Accepted Journal First papers will appear in the ESOP proceedings as a 3-page extended abstract (excluding bibliography), will be presented at the conference, and published at TOPLAS. ESOP Journal First submissions will be reviewed by the ESOP PC, with an additional review coordinated with TOPLAS. After submission, Journal-First papers will not be allowed to switch to a different paper category; yet the ESOP PC reserves the right to treat a Journal-First submission as a regular ESOP submission, in which case, the paper will be eligible for the Journal-After publication scheme. 
 Journal-After Submissions 
 Revised and expanded versions of accepted ESOP research papers are eligible for the ESOP Journal-After TOPLAS channel. A call will open in January at a predefined date after the ESOP notification, and to which all accepted papers may apply. A first light review round will be performed by the ESOP PC, to reach Reject or Revise decisions. Papers with Revise decisions will proceed to a second thorough review round, in which additional reviews will be coordinated with TOPLAS towards a final Reject or Accept decision.

 Scope 
 The ESOP conference is a premier European venue devoted to fundamental issues in the specification, design, analysis and implementation of programming languages and systems. Covered areas include: Programming paradigms and styles; Methods and tools to write and specify programs and languages; Methods and tools for reasoning about programs; Programming systems design and implementation. 
 History 
 The first ESOP conference was held in 1986 in Saabrücken, Germany, co-chaired by Bernard Robinet and Reinhard Wilhelm with proceeding published as Springer-Verlag LNCS 213. After first six biannual editions, ESOP joined ETAPS in 1998 as one of its founding conferences.
