 Welcome Message from ICIN 2025 Chairs 
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee of the28th Conference on Innovation in Clouds, Internet, and Networks (ICIN 2025), it is our great pleasure to welcome you to this year’s event, taking place inParis, France, from March 11 to 14, 2025. We are delighted to host you in this vibrant and historic city, where groundbreaking ideas and collaborations continue to shape the future of networking and computing. 
 Since its inception in 1989,ICIN has served as a leading forum for industry experts, researchers, and policymakers, facilitating discussions on emerging trends, research challenges, and transformative technologies in cloud networking and the Internet. This year, under the theme“Towards Full Life Cycle Automation in the IoT-Edge-Cloud Continuum,”ICIN 2025 will explore the latest advances in autonomous network management, orchestration, and intelligence across distributed computing infrastructures. 
 TheICIN 2025 programhas been carefully designed to offer a comprehensive and high-quality technical experience, including: 
 Seven technical tracks | : five dedicated to | full papers | and two to | short papers | . 
 A dedicated demo track | , showcasing innovative solutions and prototypes.

 A high-profile panel | featuring most keynote speakers, fostering discussions on the future of networking, AI-driven automation, and cloud-edge intelligence. 
 We extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has contributed to making ICIN 2025 possible, emphasizing the invaluable help of Aziza Lounis and Prosper Chemouil. The Organizing Committee has worked tirelessly to curate an exceptional program that balances academic rigor with industry relevance. We deeply appreciate theauthorswhose high-quality submissions shape the backbone of the conference. We also extend our heartfelt thanks to the members of theTechnical Program Committeeand thereviewers, whose dedication and expertise have ensured the scientific rigor and excellence of the selected papers. We would like to express our sincere appreciation to Noël Crespi for his unwavering support of the conference in his role as Chair of the steering committee. 
 A special thanks goes to oursponsors(Orange and Nokia), whose invaluable support has helped make ICIN 2025 a reality. We are also grateful toIEEE and IEEE ComSoc, long-standing partners of ICIN, for their continued support in advancing research and collaboration in cloud, internet, and networking technologies. 
 We invite you to actively participate in discussions, share your insights, and engage with peers from around the world.We hope you find ICIN 2025 a stimulating, inspiring, and rewarding experience, as we personally do. 
 After an Olympic Paris 2024, here comes an Olympic ICIN 2025 in Paris—we’re ready to welcome you at the highest level!
