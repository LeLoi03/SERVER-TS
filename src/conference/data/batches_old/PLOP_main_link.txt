 ABOUT PLoP 
 The International Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, People & Practices 
 Pattern Languages of Programs (PLoP) conference is a premier event for pattern enthusiasts to gather, discuss, and learn. Originally focused on software-related patterns and pattern languages, PLoP has expanded into all aspects of the built world—anything that is designed and made by people, including organizations, culture, and individual practice. 
 PLoP 2025 welcomes paper authors and nonauthors alike! Writers Workshops offer authors feedback on their papers while Imagination Run Wild sessions offer everyone, including nonauthors, a chance to share in a variety of session formats. 
 PLoP brings together practitioners and researchers whose interests span a broad range of topics, but all of whom share an interest in exploring the power of patterns. PLoP invites you to add your expertise to the growing body of patterns. At PLoP we focus on improving the written expression of patterns (both their form and content) through writers’ workshops. We also welcome workshops and presentations under the umbrella of “let your imagination run wild” sessions, which as the title suggests, are limited only by your imagination. Proposals may be in the form of a workshop, presentation, lightening talk, or whatever. Bring it on! 
 Whether you’re a pattern novice, an expert, interested in sharing, or curious about learning, you are welcome to contribute to the PLoP 2025 program with a paper and/or an “Imagination Run Wild” session.

 IMAGINATION RUN WILD IS BACK! 
 Since we had such a great response last year, in addition to Writers’ Workshops, PLoP 2025 will have a variety of other sessions under the umbrella of “Imagination Run Wild.” These sessions offer everyone, including newcomers, an opportunity to learn about patterns and related topics. 
 If you are new to patterns, this is your year to attend PLoP. The conference welcomes pattern authors and nonauthors – old friends and newcomers – pattern experts and the patterns curious – come one, come all. Regardless of what you do at PLoP, you will have a fun and engaging time!

What Past Attendees 
 Are Saying 
 Ceci Fernandes 
 I left PLoP 2023 feeling nourished with good thoughts, good energy from peer attendees, powerful metaphors (that I couldn’t wait to use at work), and a sense of community connection. It was my first PLoP and I felt more than welcome at all times!“ 
  
 Indu Alagarsamy 
 I attended my very first PLoP conference last year. It was unlike any other conference I’ve attended. It was vibrant, and I participated in many activities, such as Writers’ Workshops, Games, and Focus Groups, where I could participate meaningfully. It was a wonderful experience that brought diverse people from various industries and countries together to collectively solve problems and learn from one another to contribute to each of our industries.” 
 Marden Neubert 
 I had a wonderful experience at my first PLoP conference last year. It was an incredible opportunity to connect with many renowned authors of patterns. Participating in the writers’ workshop allowed me to assist other pattern writers from diverse cultures in improving their pattern writing.” 
 HISTORY 
 The PLoP Conference 
 The Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, People, and Practices (PLoP) was established thirty years ago by The Hillside Group. It gathers people who wish to improve the quality of life through designing and using social and technical systems in a more humane way, effectively articulating professional and other creative practices, and sharing this tacit knowledge more broadly. To achieve this, the conference promotes the use of patterns and pattern languages, as well as the underlying theory of the nature of order. 
 Originating in the work of Christopher Alexander on building architecture, these ideas have been further developed in computer science, fundamentally changing the perception of software development. Much of the pioneering work in this area originated at this and other PLoP conferences throughout the world. Patterns and pattern languages have expanded to many other areas, including art, well-being, learning, psychology, organizational development and change, sociology, and anthropology. PLoP encourages a variety of submissions regardless of the area they target. 
 MISSION 
 The Hillside Group 
 The mission of the Hillside Group is to improve the quality of life and society as a whole. This includes architects, developers, managers, owners, workers, educators, students, and more. Understanding and helping the human element is critical for achieving success. The Hillside Group believes in making processes and design more humane by paying attention to real people and existing practices. 
 The Hillside Group promotes the use of patterns and pattern languages to record, analyze, and share knowledge to help achieve its mission. The Hillside Group sponsors a variety of activities to achieve this mission—organizing workshops, hosting PLoP (pattern) conferences, and producing publications for discussing, recording, and documenting successful practices.

 IMAGINATION RUN WILD SUBMISSIONS 
 We welcome proposals for hour-long presentations that will get all of us thinking as well as 5-minute lightning talks that explore partially formed ideas. Longer sessions may include workshops/focus groups that bring together people interested in exploring a topic. Free format groups may include open spaces orfishbowls. Half-baked ideas could be discussed in a planned or pop-up birds-of-feather. 
 Let your imagination run wild and propose something! The conference organizers are open to receiving a variety of session types and activities. If you wish to propose an activity that does not fit into any of the formats mentioned in this call,href="mailto:plop-irw@hillside.net" - contact Kiyoka Hayashi, the “Imagination Run Wild” program chair

 Some Imagination Run Wild sessions will have their own time slot while others will run concurrently with writers’ workshops. So, there will always be a variety of options for all attendees throughout the conference. 
 Reports from any of these sessions may be included in the conference proceedings (subject to review). 
 SUBMISSIONS OPEN SOON! 
 PAPERSUBMISSIONS 
 We welcome papers describing patterns and pattern languages, experience reports, essays, empirical evaluations, reflections, etc. After the initial screening by the program committee, you will get the opportunity to improve your paper under the guidance of a dedicated shepherd. If your paper is accepted at the conference, it will be discussed in a writers’ workshop session with other authors and participants. Based on what you learn at writers’ workshops, you will make final improvements to your paper after the conference and submit it for the proceedings. 
 To enable the paper content to benefit from the shepherding process and the writers’ workshop discussions, please be mindful of the number of pages in your submission. You want to create a paper that allows your shepherd and the writers’ workshop attendees to digest the material and provide meaningful feedback. 
 If you have any questions about paper submissions,href="mailto:plop-papers@hillside.net" - contact Hugo Ferreira, the papers program chair

 Paper Submission & Review Process 
 The papers submitted at PLoP are discussed inWriters’ Workshops, where authors work together to improve their papers. Before papers are accepted for a Writers’ Workshop, they are shepherded.Shepherdingis an iterative process, in which an experienced author discusses a submission with an author to refine a paper prior to the conference. All paper submissions are peer-reviewed after shepherding. 
 This applies to paper submissions only, not the Imagination Run Wild submissions. 
 There is a three stage paper submission process for the conference: 
 1 
 Step 1 
 Submissions are assessed for suitability and quality by the program committee. 
 See examples of pasthref="https://www.hillside.net/plop/2022/index.php?nav=program#acceptedpapers" - Accepted Submissions
. 
 2 
 Step 2 
 Each paper found suitable is assigned a shepherd, an experienced (pattern) writer, who helps the author improve the paper. Each paper is also assigned one program committee member to supervise shepherding. 
 Shepherding involves several iterations, each producing a revision of the paper. Each author and shepherd decide the extent of revision. 
 3 
 Step 3 
 After shepherding, each paper is assessed once more by the program committee members and program chairs. The decision to accept a paper takes into account the willingness of the author to consider the comments they received from their shepherd (as reported by the shepherd and program committee member who supervised shepherding). 
 Writers’ Workshops 
 At the conference, the papers are discussed in writers’ workshops with groups of paper authors and possibly other conference participants. Authors are expected to take into account comments they received in the writers’ workshops to improve their papers. 
 At least one of the authorsof accepted papers is expected to register for the conference.Failure to do so will result in acceptance being withdrawn. 
 For more information, viewA Pattern Language for Writers’ Workshopsby Richard Gabriel. 
 Shepherding Process 
 Shepherding is a revision process. Shepherds are experienced writers of patterns, essays, and other pattern-related papers. Each author of a submitted paper is assigned a shepherd who helps the author revise and improve the paper. All shepherds have experience with the shepherding process, either having been a shepherd before or having been helped by a shepherd. 
 Shepherding is about improving the manuscript. A shepherd can provide detailed reviews, make suggestions for both major and minor improvements, copyedit, or even provide draft material—it all depends on how the author and shepherd decide to work together. Shepherding is done before a paper is peer reviewed by the program committee. 
 Near the end of the shepherding, shepherds submit their recommendations to the Program Committee, which then decides whether it is accepted to a writers’ workshop of the conference. After a paper has been accepted, its author and shepherd can continue revising the paper to produce the conference draft version. 
 Richard Gabriel has written aguide to shepherding. 
 We are looking forward to your submission and meeting you at Skamania.
