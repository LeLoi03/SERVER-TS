 Welcome to ICCGV 2025 
 Following the success of previous seven years' event in Tokyo(2018), Jeju Island(2019), online conferences from 2020-2022, Chengdu(2023), Hangzhou(2024) respectively, the Eighth International Conference on Computer Graphics and Virtuality(ICCGV 2025) will take place inChengdu, China,duringhref="tour.html" - February 21-23, 2025
. Conference consists of keynote lectures, oral presentation, poster presentation, online presentation on all aspects of computer graphics and virtuality. All professors, researchers and university students in related fields are cordially invited to participate in the conference. You're welcome to contribute a paper to ICCGV 2025. It's advised that you read thehref="sub.html" - Submission Guidelines
before submission. 
 继前七届会议分别在日本东京(2018)、韩国济州岛(2019)举办、以及由于疫情期间在线上开会(2020-2022), 2023年开始重新开启线下线上模式, 分别在成都(2023)、杭州(2024), 第八届计算机图形和虚拟国际会议(ICCGV2025)计划于2025年2月21-23日在四川成都举行。 会议诚挚邀请国内外学者提交计算机图形和虚拟等领域的论文, 请大家认真阅读投稿须知并踊跃投稿。
