Cooperative Information Systems (CIS) facilitate the cooperation between individuals, organisations, smart devices, and systems of systems, by providing flexible, scalable and intelligent services to enterprises, public institutions and user communities. As a result, people and smart devices can interact, share information and work together across physical barriers. The domain of CIS integrates research results from different related computing areas, such as: distributed systems, coordination technologies, collaborative decision making, enterprise architecture, business process management and conceptual modelling. In recent years, several innovative technologies have emerged: Cloud Computing, Service Oriented Computing, the Internet of Things, Linked Open Data, Semantic Systems, Collective Awareness Platforms, Block Chain, Processes as a Service, etc, that enable the next generation of CISs.The CoopIS conference series began in 1993 as the International Conference on Intelligent and Cooperative Information Systems and was renamed the International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems in 1994.

 SCOPE 
 Cooperative Information Systems (CIS) facilitate the cooperation between individuals, organisations, smart devices, and systems of systems, by providing flexible, scalable and intelligent services to enterprises, public institutions and user communities. As a result, people and smart devices can interact, share information and work together across physical barriers. The domain of CIS integrates research results from different related computing areas, such as: distributed systems, coordination technologies, collaborative decision making, enterprise architecture, business process management and conceptual modelling. 
 In recent years, several innovative technologies have emerged: Cloud Computing, Service Oriented Computing, the Internet of Things, Linked Open Data, Semantic Systems, Collective Awareness Platforms, Block Chain, Processes as a Service, etc, that enable the next generation of CISs. 
 In developing the next generation CISs, research is needed towards (1) the applicability and use of the above mentioned innovative technologies, (2) approaches to develop CISs in particular catering towards the multitude of stakeholders involved in the development of socio-cyber-physical systems, and (3) associated modelling techniques to express and analyse the different aspects of these systems in cohesion.

 KEYNOTE SPEAKERS 
 CoopIS 2025 will have several invited keynote speakers, who are internationally recognized experts in their areas. Their names are not yet confirmed.PAPER SUBMISSION 
 Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that are not under review for any other conference, workshop, or journal. The contributions should address research questions that relate to one of the topics listed above. 
  
 We particularly encourage: 
 1. Contributions that introduce and evaluate technological innovations (e.g., new techniques, tools, methods or software). 
 2. Empirical studies (e.g. quantitative data on the effects of novel approaches in technical, social, or economical terms). 
 3. Systematic surveys of emerging technologies and competing paradigms. 
 4. Case studies of the trustworthiness of information systems in various application areas. 

The research questions addressed should both be practically relevant and appealing to the general information systems field, and each paper should include a systematic evaluation of the contribution and relate this contribution to related scientific work. 
  
 Submitted papers will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 reviewers. Papers are evaluated in terms of originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity. 
  
 Submissions for full papers must not exceed 18 pages (including the list of references) in the final camera-ready paper style. The program chairs may decide to accept some of the submissions as short papers (which would then need to be shortened to 11 pages). 
  
 Submitted papers must be written in English, laid out according to the final camera-ready formatting instructions, and be submitted in electronic form in PDF format. 
  
 Each accepted paper must have one of its authors registered for the conference before the camera-ready deadline. The conference organizers reserve the right to remove a paper from the proceedings if no author is officially registered by the camera-ready deadline. Moreover, only papers that have been presented by their authors during the conference will be published in the conference proceedings. 
  
 The proceedings will be published by Springer Verlag in their Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Author instructions can be found at:https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines 
 PUBLICATIONS 
 All accepted complete papers will be published by Springer in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference. 
 The proceedings will be abstracted/indexed in DBLP, Google Scholar, EI-Compendex, INSPEC, Japanese Science and Technology Agency (JST), Norwegian Register for Scientific Journals and Series, Mathematical Reviews, SCImago, Scopus and zbMATH. LNCS volumes are also submitted for the inclusion in ISI Proceedings.
