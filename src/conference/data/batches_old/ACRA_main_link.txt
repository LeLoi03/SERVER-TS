 Professor Michael Milford | conducts interdisciplinary research at the boundary between robotics, neuroscience, computer vision and machine learning, and is a multi-award winning educational entrepreneur. His research models the neural mechanisms in the brain underlying tasks like navigation and perception to develop new technologies in challenging application domains such as all-weather, anytime positioning for autonomous vehicles. From 2022 – 2027 he is leading a large research team combining bio-inspired and computer science-based approaches to provide a ubiquitous alternative to GPS that does not rely on satellites. He is also one of Australia’s most in demand experts in technologies including self-driving cars, robotics and artificial intelligence, and is a passionate science communicator. He currently holds the position of Director of the QUT Centre for Robotics, Australian Research Council Laureate Fellow, Professor at the Queensland University of Technology, and is a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellow and Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering. 
 Professor Paulo de Souza | is the Executive Dean of the School of Engineering and a leader in bridging science, industry, and society through engineering innovation. With a career spanning academia, research, and industry, he has driven transformative advancements in fields ranging from ecosystem sustainability and industrial optimization to planetary exploration. Previously, he held leadership roles at Griffith University, CSIRO, and NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover program. A Fellow of multiple prestigious institutions, he has co-authored groundbreaking research recognized by | Science Magazine | . Professor de Souza holds a PhD from Johannes Gutenberg Universität and a master’s in mechanical engineering from UFES, Brazil. 
 Professor Dana Kulić | develops autonomous systems that can operate in concert with humans, using natural and intuitive interaction strategies while learning from user feedback to improve and individualise operation over long-term use. Her research in rehabilitation technology enables highly accurate, non-invasive, measurement of human movement, which can be deployed in industrial settings for accurate measurement of operator movement. She has served as the Global Innovation Research Visiting Professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, and the August-Wilhelm Scheer Visiting Professor at the Technical University of Munich. Since 2019, Dr. Kulić is a professor and director of Monash Robotics at Monash University, Australia. In 2020, Dr. Kulić was awarded the ARC Future Fellowship. Her research interests include robot learning, humanoid robots, human-robot interaction and mechatronics.

 Professor Michael Milford | conducts interdisciplinary research at the boundary between robotics, neuroscience, computer vision and machine learning, and is a multi-award winning educational entrepreneur. His research models the neural mechanisms in the brain underlying tasks like navigation and perception to develop new technologies in challenging application domains such as all-weather, anytime positioning for autonomous vehicles. From 2022 – 2027 he is leading a large research team combining bio-inspired and computer science-based approaches to provide a ubiquitous alternative to GPS that does not rely on satellites. He is also one of Australia’s most in demand experts in technologies including self-driving cars, robotics and artificial intelligence, and is a passionate science communicator. He currently holds the position of Director of the QUT Centre for Robotics, Australian Research Council Laureate Fellow, Professor at the Queensland University of Technology, and is a Microsoft Research Faculty Fellow and Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering. 
 Professor Paulo de Souza | is the Executive Dean of the School of Engineering and a leader in bridging science, industry, and society through engineering innovation. With a career spanning academia, research, and industry, he has driven transformative advancements in fields ranging from ecosystem sustainability and industrial optimization to planetary exploration. Previously, he held leadership roles at Griffith University, CSIRO, and NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover program. A Fellow of multiple prestigious institutions, he has co-authored groundbreaking research recognized by | Science Magazine | . Professor de Souza holds a PhD from Johannes Gutenberg Universität and a master’s in mechanical engineering from UFES, Brazil. 
 Professor Dana Kulić | develops autonomous systems that can operate in concert with humans, using natural and intuitive interaction strategies while learning from user feedback to improve and individualise operation over long-term use. Her research in rehabilitation technology enables highly accurate, non-invasive, measurement of human movement, which can be deployed in industrial settings for accurate measurement of operator movement. She has served as the Global Innovation Research Visiting Professor at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, and the August-Wilhelm Scheer Visiting Professor at the Technical University of Munich. Since 2019, Dr. Kulić is a professor and director of Monash Robotics at Monash University, Australia. In 2020, Dr. Kulić was awarded the ARC Future Fellowship. Her research interests include robot learning, humanoid robots, human-robot interaction and mechatronics.
