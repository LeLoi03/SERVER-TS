 The Symposium on Solid and Physical Modeling (SPM) is an international conference series organized annually with the support of theSolid Modeling Association (SMA). SPM'24 will be hosted atConcordia University, July 8-10, 2024. The conference aims at all aspects of geometric and physical modeling, and their application in design, analysis and manufacturing, as well as in biomedical, geophysical, digital entertainment, and other areas. The conference serves also as a ceremony for awarding the 2024 Pierre Bézier Prize for contributions to solid, shape, and physical modeling.
