 2025 
 25th Symposium on Algorithmic Approaches for Transportation Modeling, Optimization and Systems 
 Scope 
 The ATMOS 2025 symposium will be held in connection withhref="https://algo-conference.org/2025/" - ALGO 2025
in Warsaw, Poland on September 18-19, 2025. 
 Since 2000,href="https://atmos-symposium.eu/" - ATMOS
brings together researchers and practitioners who are interested in all aspects of algorithmic methods and models for transport optimization. The symposium provides a forum for the exchange and dissemination of new ideas and techniques. The aim of making transportation better gives rise to very complex and large-scale optimization problems requiring innovative solution techniques and ideas from algorithms, mathematical optimization, theoretical computer science, and operations research.

 Paper submission 
 Authors are invited to submit high-quality manuscripts reporting original unpublished research in the topics related to the symposium. Simultaneous submission to other journals or conferences with published proceedings is not allowed. By submitting a paper the authors acknowledge that in case of acceptance, at least one of the authors must register at ALGO/ATMOS 2025, attend the conference on-site, and present the paper. 
  
 Submissions must be in the form of a single PDF file prepared according to thehref="https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/OASIcs#author" - author instructions
and using thehref="https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/OASIcs#author" - LaTeX OASIcs style file
and must be submitted electronically via thehref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atmos2025" - EasyChair submission system
. 
  
 ATMOS 2025 accepts two types of submissions, both of which will be reviewed with the same quality standards by the Program Committee. 
  
 Regular paper submissions: A regular paper submission should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state its key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main results. A regular paper submission should consist of a main body plus an optional and clearly marked appendix. The target length for the main body (excluding the bibliography, the front page(s) (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, …)) is 12-15 pages. The total paper, including the bibliography, the front page(s) (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, …) and the optional appendix, may not exceed 20 pages. Authors should include all necessary details in their submission so that the Program Committee can judge the correctness, importance and originality of their work. Any material (e.g., proofs or experimental results) omitted (from the main part of 15 pages) due to space limitations can be put into the optional appendix, which will be read at the Program Committee’s discretion. Regular papers will be allotted up to 20 pages in the proceedings. 
  
 Short papersubmissions: A short paper submission may present preliminary results or work-in-progress on a specific topic. Authors should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A short paper submission should have at least 4 and at most 6 pages. Authors should provide sufficient details in their submission so that the Program Committee can judge the correctness, importance and originality of their work. Short papers will be allotted up to 6 pages in the proceedings.
