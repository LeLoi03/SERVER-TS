 The International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science aims at bringing together engineers, researchers and practitioners interested in advances and applications concerning the cloud infrastructure, operations, and available services through the global network. Further, the conference considers as essential the link to Services Science, acknowledging the service-orientation in most current IT-driven collaborations, and provides a forum for discussing how Services Science can provide theory, methods and techniques to design, analyze, manage, market and study various aspects of Cloud Computing.

 SCOPE 
 The International Conference on Cloud Computing and Services Science (CLOSER), focuses on the highly important area of Cloud Computing, inspired by some latest advances that concern the infrastructure, operations, and available services through the global network. Further, the conference considers as essential the link to Services Science, acknowledging the service-orientation in most current IT-driven collaborations. The conference is nevertheless not about the union of these two (already broad) fields, but about Cloud Computing where we are also interested in how Services Science can provide theory, methods and techniques to design, analyze, manage, market and study various aspects of Cloud Computing. 
 Emerging Enterprise Technologies are profoundly changing the way we think of IT - from economics and efficiency to process and usage models. Many organizations look to the "externalized" IT systems and services as a potential cost-savings advantage by moving internally hosted IT services to external providers. Other organizations view the "external" IT as potential disaster recovery systems or as on-demand capacity to boost business continuity and customer service levels. We need to take a closer look, discerning what emerging enterprise technologies are and how they can catalyze creativity and produce a competitive advantage. There is hence a new wave of interest in 'Externalization of IT' - anything as a service (including Software as a Service, Infrastructure as a Service, Platform as a Service), On Demand delivery, outsourcing, edge cloud and so on. This emerging facilitation and way of utilizing services through IT is what we are referring to as Cloud Computing.

 PAPER SUBMISSION 
 Authors can submit their work in the form of a complete paper or an abstract, but please note that accepted abstracts are presented but not published in the proceedings of the conference. Complete papers can be submitted as a Regular Paper, representing completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, portraying a short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue discussing ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research focused on one of the conference topic areas. 
  
 Authors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics. Each paper should clearly indicate the nature of its technical/scientific contribution, and the problems, domains or environments to which it is applicable. To facilitate the double-blind paper evaluation method, authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors, including the authors’ personal details, the acknowledgments section of the paper and any other reference that may disclose the authors’ identity.
