 22nd International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence 
 University of Lille (France) 
 25th-27th June, 2025 
 href="https://www.dcai-conference.net" - www.dcai-conference.net
The 22nd International Conference on Distributed Computing and Artificial Intelligence 2025 is an annual forum that will bring together ideas, projects and knowledge associated with distributed computing and artificial intelligence, and their application in different areas. This meeting will be held in University of Lille (France) within PAAMS'25, from 25th-27th June, 2025. 
 Nowadays, most computing systems, ranging from personal laptops/computers to cluster/grid/cloud computing systems, are capable of parallel and distributed computing. Distributed computing performs an increasingly important role in modern signal/data processing, information fusion and electronics engineering (e.g., electronic commerce, mobile communications and wireless devices). Particularly, applying artificial intelligence in distributed environments is becoming an element of high added value and economic potential. Research on Intelligent Distributed Systems has matured over the last decade and many effective applications are now being deployed. Artificial intelligence is changing our society. Its application in distributed environments, such as the Internet, electronic commerce, mobile communications, wireless devices, distributed computing, is becoming more widespread, and is becoming an element of high added value and economic potential, in both industry and research. These technologies are changing constantly as a result of the large research and technical effort being undertaken in both universities and businesses. The exchange of ideas between scientists and technicians from both academic and business backgrounds is essential to facilitating the development of systems that meet the demands of today's society. Technology transfer in this field is still a challenge and for that reason this type of contributions will be given special consideration at this symposium.

 The Doctoral Consortium is intended for students who have a specific research proposal and some preliminary results, but who are still far from completing their dissertation. 
 All proposals submitted to the Doctoral Consortium will undergo a thorough reviewing process with the aim of providing detailed and constructive feedback. The accepted submissions will be presented at the Doctoral Consortium and published in the conference proceedings. 
 The submissions should identify: 
 Problem statement 
 Related work 
 Hypothesis 
 Proposal 
 Preliminary Results and/or Evaluation Plan 
 Reflections 
 SubmissionsFormat 
 All papers must be formatted according to the LNNS template, with a maximum length of 10 pages (6 pages for Doctoral Consortia), including figures and references:

Review process 
 DCAI welcomes the submission of application papers with preference to the topics listed in the call for papers. All submitted papers will undergo a thorough review process; each paper will be refereed by at least three experts in the field based on relevance, originality, significance, quality and clarity. 
 The papers must consist of original, relevant and previously unpublished sound research results related to any of the topics of the conference. 
 Publication 
 Accepted papers will be included in DCAI Proceedings. At least one of the authors will be required to register and attend the symposium, where they will present the paper, this will allow for its inclusion in conference proceedings.All the accepted papers will be published byLecture Notes in Networks and Systemsseries of Springer Verlag.
