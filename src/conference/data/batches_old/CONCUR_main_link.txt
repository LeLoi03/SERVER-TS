 CONCUR 2025 
 The purpose of CONCUR 2025, the 36th International Conference on Concurrency Theory, is to bring together researchers, developers, and students in order to advance the theory of concurrency, and promote its applications. It will be co-located with QEST+FORMATS, FMICS and a number of workshops (under the joint name CONFEST 2025) and will take place August 25-30, 2025 at the University of Aarhus, Denmark.

 CALL FOR PAPERS 
 Paper submission 
 CONCUR 2025 solicits high quality papers reporting research results and/or experience related to the topics mentioned below. 
 All papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. 
 Each paper will undergo a thorough review process. The paper may be supplemented with a clearly marked appendix, which will be reviewed at the discretion of the program committee. 
 The CONCUR 2025 proceedings will be published byhref="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/series/LIPIcs#author" - LIPIcs
. 
 Papers must be submitted electronically as PDF files viahref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=concur2025" - EasyChair
. 
 Submissions follow a single blind process. 
 Papers must not exceed 15 pages (excluding references and clearly marked appendices) using the LIPIcs style. 
 Topics 
 Submissions are solicited in the theory and practice of concurrent systems. The principal topics include (but are not limited to): 
 Basic models of concurrency such as abstract machines, domain-theoretic models, categorical and coalgebraic models, game-theoretic models, parametric models, process algebras, graph transformation systems, Petri nets, hybrid systems, mobile and collaborative systems, probabilistic systems, real-time systems, quantum systems, biology-inspired systems, and synchronous systems; 
 Logics for concurrency such as modal logics, program logics, probabilistic and stochastic logics, temporal logics, multi-agent logics, and resource logics; 
 Verification and analysis techniques for concurrent systems such as abstract interpretation, atomicity checking, model checking, race detection, pre-order and equivalence checking, run-time verification, state-space exploration, static analysis, synthesis, testing, theorem proving, type systems, and security analysis; 
 Distributed/parallel algorithms and concurrent data structures: design, analysis, complexity, correctness, fault tolerance, reliability, availability, consistency, self-organization, self-stabilization, commitment schemes, communication protocols; 
 Theoretical foundations, tools, and empirical evaluations of architectures, execution environments, and software development for concurrent systems such as geo-replicated systems, distributed ledgers, communication networks, multiprocessor and multi-core architectures, quantum computing, quantum communication, shared and transactional memory, resource management and awareness, compilers and tools for concurrent programming, programming models such as component-based, object- and service-oriented.
