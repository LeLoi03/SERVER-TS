 About ICPE 
 The International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE) originated 16 years ago from the fusion of an ACM workshop on software and performance prediction and a SPEC workshop focused on benchmarking and performance evaluation. 
 ICPE continues true to its origins with focus both on software performance modeling, prediction, and measurement as well as on benchmark-based performance evaluation. The areas to which such principles are applied have evolved over the years with the technological evolution in academia and industry. 
 ICPE contributions appear at all levels of system and software design, performance modeling, and measurements of performance, from the cloudâ€™s core to edge, from mobile devices to major data centers, from web applications to scientific applications. 
 ICPEâ€™s focus on performance engineering attracts both industrial practitioners and academics, united by their interest in quantifying the performance impact of various aspects of complex system design and implementation. Participants are also intellectually curious about design cycle lengths, lifetime maintenance issues, quality of experience, and the costs of delivering systems and services.

 The goal of the International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE) is to integrate theory and practice in the field of performance engineering by providing a forum for sharing ideas and experiences between industry and academia. Nowadays, complex systems of all types, like Web-based systems, data centers and cloud infrastructures, social networks, peer-to-peer, mobile and wireless systems, cyber-physical systems, the Internet of Things, real-time and embedded systems, have increasingly distributed and dynamic system architectures that provide high flexibility, however, also increase the complexity of managing end-to-end application performance. 
 ICPE brings together researchers and industry practitioners to share and present their experiences, discuss challenges, and report state-of-the-art and in-progress research on performance engineering of software and systems, including performance measurement, modeling, benchmark design, and run-time performance management. The focus is both on classical metrics such as response time, throughput, resource utilization, and (energy) efficiency, as well as on the relationship of such metrics to other system properties including but not limited to scalability, elasticity, availability, reliability, and security. 
 ICPE has been included in theCORE 2021 conference rankingwith rank B.

 Proceedings of the 15th ACM/SPEC International Conference 
 Years of planning have gone into preparing for ICPE 2024 in London, UK. For the first time in UK, the organization of ICPE has generated a great deal of excitement and expectation of productive interactions between the usual participants of ICPE conferences, the members of the various SPEC working groups, and a desire to increase the involvement of the local scientific community with ICPE. 
 It is our pleasure to welcome you to the 15th ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE), hosted at South Kensington, London, UK, from May 7-11, 2024. ICPE is the leading international forum for presenting and discussing novel ideas, innovations, trends and experiences in the field of performance engineering. 
 ICPE formed from merging the ACM Workshop on Software Performance (WOSP, since 1998) and the SPEC International Performance Engineering Workshop (SIPEW, since 2008). Despite the peculiar time we are all living in around the world, we are pleased to introduce an exciting program, which is the result of hard work by the authors, the program committee, and the conference organizers.
