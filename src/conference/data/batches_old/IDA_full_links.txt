Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2025) 
 IDA 2025 will take place in Konstanz, Germany, May 7-9 2025. 
 AdvancingIntelligent Data Analysisrequires novel, potentially game-changing ideas. IDA’s mission is to promote ideas over performance: a solid motivation can be as convincing as exhaustive empirical evaluation. Therefore IDA accepts all inspiring papers for both presentation and publication. In order to create an open atmosphere that encourages discussion, the IDA symposium is intentionally small-scale and single-track.

 Abstract 
 The present study addresses the group detection problem using spatio-temporal data. This study relies on modeling contextual information embedded in the trajectories of surrounding agents as well as temporal dynamics in the trajectories of the agent of interest to determine if two agents belong to the same group. Specifically, our proposed method, called T-DANTE, builds upon the Deep Affinity Network (DANTE) [16] for Clustering Conversational Interactants using spatio-temporal data and extends it by incorporating Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) (i.e., Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)) to capture the temporal dynamics inherent in the trajectories of agents. Our ablation study demonstrates that including context information, combined with temporal dynamics, yields promising results for the group detection task across five real-world pedestrian and five simulation datasets using two common evaluation metrics, namely Group Correctness and Group Mitre metrics. Moreover, in the comparative study, the proposed method outperformed three state-of-the-art baselines in terms of the group correctness metric by at least 17.97% for pedestrian datasets. Although some baselines perform better in simulation datasets, the difference is not statistically significant.
