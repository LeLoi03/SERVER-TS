 Scope 
 The IPCO conference is a forum for researchers and practitioners working on various aspects of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. The aim is to present recent developments in theory, computation, and applications. The scope of IPCO is viewed in a broad sense, to include algorithmic and structural results in integer programming and combinatorial optimization as well as revealing computational studies and novel applications of discrete optimization to practical problems. 
 Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts of their recent work by November 6, 2022 (23:59 CET); see the submission guidelines below for more information. The Program Committee will select the papers to be presented on the basis of the submitted extended abstracts. Contributions are expected to be original, unpublished and not under review by journals or conferences with proceedings before the notification date (January 20, 2023). Papers violating these requirements will not be considered by the Program Committee. 
 During the conference, approximately 33 papers will be presented in single-track sessions. Each lecture will be 30 minutes long. The proceedings will be published as a volume of Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science. They will contain extended abstracts of all accepted submissions. It is expected that revised and extended versions will subsequently be submitted for publication in appropriate journals. 
 Submission Guidelines and Instructions for Authors 
 The extended abstract – in Springer LNCS format – should not exceed 12 pages plus references. Please check the Springer Information for LNCS Authors for additional information. Appendices are allowed only if they fit within the 12 page limit. Submissions not following these guidelines will not be considered. It is allowed to put full versions of the submitted papers in an on-line repository. 
 The first page should contain the title, the authors’ names with their affiliations, and a short abstract. The introduction should be a broadly accessible exposition of the main ideas and techniques used to achieve the results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work. In particular, the introduction should convey to the non-expert why the paper should be accepted to IPCO. Submitted extended abstracts will be reviewed according to the standards of top tier reviewed conferences. The main acceptance criteria used by the Program Committee are the quality and originality of the research, plus its interest to people working in the field. It is crucial that the importance of the work is understood by the committee. The claimed results must be correct and new. 
 A paper will not be considered in any of the following cases: 
 – It has already been published. 
 – It is under review by a journal or another conference with proceedings. 
 – It has a member of the Program Committee among its authors. 
 – It is submitted after the submission deadline. 
 It is not allowed to submit a paper that has been submitted to IPCO 2023 to a journal or a conference with proceedings before the IPCO 2023 notification date.

 What is IPCO? 
 IPCO (Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization) is a conference that is sponsored by the Mathematical Optimization Society. IPCO is a forum for researchers and practitioners working on various aspects of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. The aim is to present recent developments in theory, computation, and applications of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. There are two key features of the IPCO conferences: 
 First, there are no invited talks. Instead, a program committee selects the contributions on the basis of extended abstracts submitted by prospective participants. 
 Second, the papers at the meeting are presented in a single stream (no parallel sessions), and preliminary versions of all papers are provided to participants at the beginning of the meeting. 
 The presented papers are published in the proceedings of the conference. These proceedings serve as a conference record as well as a means of rapid dissemination of results, since they are published within six months of submission. Most journals, including Mathematical Programming, Mathematics of Operations Research, INFORMS Journal on Computing, Operations Research, SIAM Journal on Computing, SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, SIAM Journal on Optimization, Theoretical Computer Science do not view publication of an early version of a paper in an IPCO proceedings as a prior publication which would otherwise make the paper unacceptable. 
 What is the Scope of IPCO? 
 The two themes of IPCO - integer programming and combinatorial optimization - are viewed in a broad sense, to include algorithmic and structural results in topics such as 
 approximation algorithms 
 branch and bound algorithms 
 branch and cut algorithms 
 computational biology 
 computational complexity 
 computational geometry 
 cutting plane algorithms 
 diophantine equations 
 geometry of numbers 
 graph and network algorithms 
 integer programming 
 matroids and submodular functions 
 on-line algorithms and competitive analysis 
 polyhedral combinatorics 
 randomized algorithms 
 random graphs 
 scheduling theory and scheduling algorithms 
 semidefinite programs 
 In all these areas, IPCO welcomes structural and algorithmic results. IPCO is not restricted to theory. Computational and practical work, implementations, novel applications of these techniques to practical problems, and revealing computational studies, are most welcome. 
 Which Type of Paper is Appropriate for IPCO? 
 The main acceptance criteria used by the program committee are the quality and originality of the research, plus its interest to people working in the field. These acceptance criteria have made it possible for younger, less established researchers to present their results in an attractive format to a large audience of active researchers. The program committee normally consists of researchers from a broad variety of fields. Therefore, someone preparing an extended abstract can safely assume that a large portion of the program committee will not be experts in the topic of the paper. These are precisely the readers to whom the abstract should be directed. It also is crucial that the importance of the work is understood by the committee. And of course, the claimed results should be correct and new. 
 The Timing of IPCO 
 IPCO is held every year, normally in late spring. Until 2018 years divisible by three (ISMP years) were skipped. From 2021 on, IPCO does take place also in ISMP years, normally with a considerable temporal and geographic distance. The submission deadline usually is in the late fall of the year preceding the meeting. All submissions are read by the program committee. Approximately two months after the deadline, the program committee meets and decides which papers to include in the meeting. Authors are usually notified of the decision of the program committee in the end of January. Authors of accepted papers are asked to submit a final version (which may again be an extended abstract or a full paper) by early spring. These final versions are printed in the proceedings of IPCO, which are provided to all participants at the conference. Finally, the IPCO conference then takes place in May or June. An IPCO conference usually takes three days. During these three days, approximately thirty-three papers are presented; each lecture is thirty minutes long.

 IPCO (Integer Programming and Combinatorial Optimization) is a conference that is sponsored by the Mathematical Optimization Society. IPCO is a forum for researchers and practitioners working on various aspects of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. The aim is to present recent developments in theory, computation, and applications of integer programming and combinatorial optimization. There are two key features of the IPCO conferences: 
 First, there are no invited talks. Instead, a program committee selects the contributions on the basis of extended abstracts submitted by prospective participants. 
 Second, the papers at the meeting are presented in a single stream (no parallel sessions), and preliminary versions of all papers are provided to participants at the beginning of the meeting. 
 The presented papers are published in the proceedings of the conference. These proceedings serve as a conference record as well as a means of rapid dissemination of results, since they are published within six months of submission. Most journals, including Mathematical Programming, Mathematics of Operations Research, INFORMS Journal on Computing, Operations Research, SIAM Journal on Computing, SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, SIAM Journal on Optimization, Theoretical Computer Science do not view publication of an early version of a paper in an IPCO proceedings as a prior publication which would otherwise make the paper unacceptable. 
 What is the Scope of IPCO? 
 The two themes of IPCO - integer programming and combinatorial optimization - are viewed in a broad sense, to include algorithmic and structural results in topics such as 
 approximation algorithms 
 branch and bound algorithms 
 branch and cut algorithms 
 computational biology 
 computational complexity 
 computational geometry 
 cutting plane algorithms 
 diophantine equations 
 geometry of numbers 
 graph and network algorithms 
 integer programming 
 matroids and submodular functions 
 on-line algorithms and competitive analysis 
 polyhedral combinatorics 
 randomized algorithms 
 random graphs 
 scheduling theory and scheduling algorithms 
 semidefinite programs 
 In all these areas, IPCO welcomes structural and algorithmic results. IPCO is not restricted to theory. Computational and practical work, implementations, novel applications of these techniques to practical problems, and revealing computational studies, are most welcome. 
 Which Type of Paper is Appropriate for IPCO? 
 The main acceptance criteria used by the program committee are the quality and originality of the research, plus its interest to people working in the field. These acceptance criteria have made it possible for younger, less established researchers to present their results in an attractive format to a large audience of active researchers. The program committee normally consists of researchers from a broad variety of fields. Therefore, someone preparing an extended abstract can safely assume that a large portion of the program committee will not be experts in the topic of the paper. These are precisely the readers to whom the abstract should be directed. It also is crucial that the importance of the work is understood by the committee. And of course, the claimed results should be correct and new. 
 The Timing of IPCO 
 IPCO is held every year, normally in late spring. Until 2018 years divisible by three (ISMP years) were skipped. From 2021 on, IPCO does take place also in ISMP years, normally with a considerable temporal and geographic distance. The submission deadline usually is in the late fall of the year preceding the meeting. All submissions are read by the program committee. Approximately two months after the deadline, the program committee meets and decides which papers to include in the meeting. Authors are usually notified of the decision of the program committee in the end of January. Authors of accepted papers are asked to submit a final version (which may again be an extended abstract or a full paper) by early spring. These final versions are printed in the proceedings of IPCO, which are provided to all participants at the conference. Finally, the IPCO conference then takes place in May or June. An IPCO conference usually takes three days. During these three days, approximately thirty-three papers are presented; each lecture is thirty minutes long.
