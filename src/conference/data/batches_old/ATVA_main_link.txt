 href="#submissions" - SUBMISSIONS
ATVA welcomes submissions in the following two categories: 
 Regular research papers (18 pages, excluding references, must be anonymized) 
 Tool papers (10 pages, excluding references, not anonymized) 
 Submissions in both categories must be in Springer’s LNCS format. Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting can be found at the Springer websitehttps://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs. Adding line numbers (LaTeX package lineno) is highly recommended. Submissions authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed and encouraged. 
 An artifact evaluation will be undertaken, which will be optional for regular papers and mandatory for tool papers. 
 Papers must be submitted through EasyChair:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atva2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atva2025
Accepted papers in both categories will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A few outstanding papers will be selected for a distinguished paper award. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference. 
 href="#regular-papers" - Regular papers
Regular papers should not exceed 18 pages in Springer’s LNCS format, not counting references and appendices. Additional material may be placed in an appendix, to be read at the discretion of the reviewers, and to be omitted in the final version. 
 Regular papers at ATVA 2025 will follow a full double-blind review process, which means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, the reference should be made in the third person. These are firm submission requirements, and any regular paper that does not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. 
 Authors of accepted regular papers will be invited (but are not required) to submit a relevant artifact for evaluation by the artifact evaluation committee. The submission deadline for this artifact evaluation will be soon after the paper acceptance notification. 
 Independent of the artifact evaluation process, research paper authors are encouraged to include a URL to a repository in their original submission, if such a repository is available and is pertinent to the paper. This repository could contain code, datasets, results, etc. This would be for the consideration of the PC reviewers of the submission, at their discretion. If such a URL is included in the submission, the contents of the repository should adhere to the guidelines of a double blind review process. 
 href="#tool-papers" - Tool papers
Tool papers should not exceed 10 pages in Springer’s LNCS format, not counting references. Tool papers will follow a single-blind review process. They do NOT need to be anonymized. 
 Each tool paper submission must be followed by a separate artifact submission via EasyChair. Please see the Artifact Evaluation track instructions in the conference web site for more information. Papers describing tools that have already been presented (in any conference) will be accepted only if significant and clear enhancements to the tool are reported and implemented.
