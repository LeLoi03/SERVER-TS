Instruction 
 Green computing, in the context of cloud and pervasive computing, is an emerging research field in computer science and engineering. Pervasive and cloud computing are promising paradigms that have been seeing exponential growth in the deployments and poised to take major roles in human's daily life. But in order to realize this potential, both are facing the critical challenges related to energy consumption, for example, controlling the energy spent by the large-scale data centers and prolonging the battery life of mobile devices in pervasive computing and Internet of Things (IoT). New concepts and technologies such as mobile cloud computing (MCC), software-defined networking (SDN), Edge / Fog and hybrid cloud services can be explored to make data centers and wireless devices more energy efficient. 
  
 The 19thInternational Conference on Green, Pervasive, and Cloud Computing (GPC 2024) focuses on pervasive and environmentally sustainable computing. GPC 2024 will be held on 27th-30thSeptember 2024 at Macao, China, and will provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss and exchange novel ideas, results, experiences and work-in-process on the Green, Pervasive, and Cloud Computing.

 Acknowledgments:I thank my mother, father, and my family for their unconditional support over the years. I have, so far, been privileged and very lucky to collaborate with and learn from many outstanding researchers (undergraduate/graduate students, scientists, and numerous professors) over the years from around the world (South America, North America, Europe, Asia, Middle East, Australia/New Zealand, and Africa) in many of my research activities and publications. These great colleagues have contributed (and continue to contribute) in one way or another to my growth, research accomplishments and academic career. My deepest gratitude goes to all of them. A special thank you goes to my early mentors - Martin Richards, Alan Mycroft, Matthew Doar at the University of Cambridge (England) & Chris Adams (deceased) and Brendan Murphy (deceased) at the University of Buckingham (England) whose tireless efforts and encouragements during my early Computer Science days will always be remembered.
