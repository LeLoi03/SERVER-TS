FedCSIS 2025Invited speakers and Keynotes 
 Themissionof the FedCSIS Conference Series is to provide a presentation, discussion and a reputable publication forum in computer science and intelligence systems. The forum invites researchers and practitioners from around the world to contribute their research results focused on their scientific and professional interests in a chosen area. 
 The FedCSIS conference consists of theMain TrackandThematic Session. Papers submitted to the Main Track can be assigned, by their authors, toTopical Areas,which are managed byTopical Area Curators. Based on the scope of the contribution, Topical Area Curators select its reviewers from theMain TrackProgram Committee. Besides the Main Track, the authors may prefer to submit their papers to Thematic Session, which announce their ownCalls for Thematic Session Papersand are assisted by the FedCSIS Chairs in reaching out to the FedCSIS Community. 
 For all five Topical Areas, situated within a general domain of Computer Science, the continually emerging topic of Intelligence Systems stands as the common denominator. All Thematic Sessions also refer to the Intelligence Systems from different perspectives. They are regarded as a path toward introducing more Intelligence into Computer Science and IT. 
 Topical Areas 
 Topical Area 1: | Advanced Artificial Intelligence in Applications 
 Topical Area 2: | Computer Science & Systems 
 Topical Area 3: | Network Systems and Applications 
 Topical Area 4: | Information Technology for Business and Society

 15thInternational Workshop on Computational Optimization (WCO'22) 
 Sofia, Bulgaria, 4 - 7 September, 2022 
 Committee 
 href="https://www.fedcsis.org/2022/wco/awards" - Best Paper Award - Past Winners
Many real world problems arising in engineering, economics, medicine and other domains can be formulated as optimization tasks. These problems are frequently characterized by non-convex, non-differentiable, discontinuous, noisy or dynamic objective functions and constraints which ask for adequate computational methods. 
 The aim of this workshop is to stimulate the communication between researchers working on different fields of optimization and practitioners who need reliable and efficient computational optimization methods. 
 We invite original contributions related to both theoretical and practical aspects of optimization methods. 
 Topics 
 The list of topics includes, but is not limited to: 
 combinatorial and continuous global optimization 
 unconstrained and constrained optimization 
 multiobjective and robust optimization 
 optimization in dynamic and/or noisy environments 
 optimization on graphs 
 large-scale optimization, in parallel and distributed computational environments 
 meta-heuristics for optimization, nature-inspired approaches and any other derivative-free methods 
 exact/heuristic hybrid methods, involving natural computing techniques and other global and local optimization methods 
 numerical and heuristic methods for modeling 
 The applications of interest are included in the list below, but are not limited to: 
 classical operational research problems (knapsack, traveling salesman, etc) 
 computational biology and distance geometry 
 data mining and knowledge discovery 
 human motion simulations; crowd simulations 
 industrial applications 
 optimization in statistics, econometrics, finance, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering 
 environment modeling and optimization 
 Best Paper Award 
 The best WCO'22 paper will be awarded during the social dinner of FedCSIS 2022. 
 The best paper will be selected by WCO'22 co-Chairs by taking into consideration the scores suggested by the reviewers, as well as the quality of the given oral presentation. 
 Paper submission
