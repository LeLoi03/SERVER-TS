 Demos 
 MobileCLIP: Real-Time Image-Text Models 
 Wednesday, June 19 - Friday June 21, during exhibition hours 
 Demo shows zero-shot scene classification running real-time on an iPhone. Since these models align image and text modalities, they can perform zero-shot image classification or image-text/text-image retrieval at blazing speeds. The app showcases the research work, “MobileCLIP: Fast Image-Text Models through Multi-Modal Reinforced Training” being presented at the same venue. The app is built by David Koski, Megan Maher Welsh with contributions from Hugues Thomas, Mouli Sivapurapu, Jian Zhang. 
 Flow Composer for Apple ML 
 Wednesday, June 19 - Friday June 21, during exhibition hours 
 Demo shows usage of Apple ML features on Mac Book Pro and iPad, which leverages several technologies such as Vision, CoreML, Core Graphics.
