 Plenary Speakers 
 Wolfgang Banzhaf 
 Michigan State University, USA 
 Wolfgang Banzhaf holds the first endowed chair dedicated to Evolutionary Computation in the United States, the John R. Koza Chair for Genetic Programming, in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University. Previously, he was a University Research Professor in the Department of Computer Science, Memorial University of Newfoundland, where he also served as head of department from 2003 to 2009 and from 2012 to 2016. After a PhD and postdoc in Physics, he worked as a research scientist at Mitsubishi Electric in Japan and the US before joining academia in 1993 as associate professor of Applied Computer Science at the Technical University of Dortmund in Germany. His research interests are in the field of bio-inspired computing, notably evolutionary computing and complex adaptive systems. A recurrent theme of his work is Linear Genetic Programming and neutrality in evolution (particularly Genetic Programming). He recently co-edited Springer's "Handbook on Evolutionary Machine Learning".

 Günter Rudolph 
 TU Dortmund, Germany 
 Günter Rudolph studied Computer Science at the Universities of Karlsruhe (now KIT) and Dortmund (now TU Dortmund University), Germany. He received the Diplom-Informatiker degree (equivalent to Master degree in Computer Science) and a doctoral degree (Dr. rer. nat.) at Dortmund in 1991 and 1996, respectively. After completing his studies, he worked at the Informatics Center Dortmund (ICD) until the end of 1996 and then returned to the University of Dortmund as a post-doc in the Collaborative Research Center on Computational Intelligence. From 2001 to 2005 he was hired by Parsytec AG in Aachen, Germany, where he was involved in application and software development in the field of optical inspection systems for paper and strip steel production. In 2005 Günter was appointed professor for Computational Intelligence at TU Dortmund University in the computer science department. The main research interests are the theoretical analysis and the systematic design of evolutionary algorithms. 
 Günter served as Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation from 1998 for ten years and he is currently in the Editorial Board of Evolutionary Computation Journal (MIT) and ACM Transactions on Evolutionary Learning and Optimization. He was involved in the organization of many scientific conferences as general, program and technical chair. Currently, he the Chairman of the PPSN Steering Committee. 
 He received the Best Paper Award for theoretical work at IEEE Int’l Conf. on Evolutionary Computation (ICEC) in 1996 and later several BPAs together with his students at international conferences. Moreover, he is co-author of the paper on Explorative Landscape Analysis (ELA) that received the SIGEVO Impact Award in 2021. He is the recipient for the 2025 IEEE CIS Evolutionary Computation Pioneer Award.
