 The 28th European Conference on Genetic Programming (EuroGP) 2025 conference will take place as part of EvoStar (Evo*). 
  
 EuroGP is the premier annual conference on Genetic Programming (GP), the oldest and the only meeting worldwide devoted specifically to this branch of evolutionary computation. It is always a high-quality, enjoyable, friendly event, attracting participants from all continents, and offering excellent opportunities for networking, informal contact, and exchange of ideas with fellow researchers. It will feature a mixture of oral presentations and poster sessions and invited keynote speakers. EuroGP is featured in the conference ranking databaseCORE. 
 You can consult the proceedings of previous events athref="https://link.springer.com/conference/eurogp" - EuroGP Conference Proceedings in SpringerLink
A comprehensive bibliography of genetic programming literature and links to related material is accessible at theGenetic Programming Bibliographyweb page, part of the Collection of Computer Science Bibliographies maintained and managed by William Langdon, Steven Gustafson, and John Koza.
