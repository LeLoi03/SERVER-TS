 General Information 
 Starting with CHES 2018, CHES is switching its publication model to an open-access journal/conference hybrid model. Articles can be submitted every three months and undergo a journal-style reviewing process. Accepted papers are published in Diamond Open Access (free availability from day one) by theRuhr-University of Bochumin an issue of the newly established journalIACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (TCHES)withISSN 2569-2925. 
 For any further information, please view thehref="https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/faq" - FAQ page
and thehref="https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/cfp" - Call for Papers
. 
 Aim and Scope of the Journal 
 Since 1999, the annualhref="https://ches.iacr.org/" - CHES conference
highlights new results in the design and analysis of cryptographic hardware and software implementations and builds a valuable bridge between the research and cryptographic engineering communities and attracts participants from industry, academia, and government organizations. Topics suitable for CHES include, but are not limited to cryptographic implementations, attacks against implementations and countermeasures, cryptographic tools and methodologies, cryptographic implementation issues and applications. To be considered for publication, they must provide an added value beyond prior work, such as novel insights or reasonably questioning previous assumptions.
