 The book consists of two parts I: RSL Tutorial (pages 9-250), and II: RSL Reference Description (pages 251-369). 
 Havelund wrote part I, while Havelund together with Anne Haxthausen wrote part II. The language presented in the book was designed during the period 1985-1991 by many people. Those that lastet to the end were theRAISE Language Group: Chris George, Peter Haff, Klaus Havelund Anne Haxthausen, Robert Milne, Claus Bendix Nielsen, Soeren Prehn and Kim Ritter Wagner. The RAISE project was started by Dines Bjoerner. 
  
 An early version of the book is the RSL tutorial (draft) below (April 6, 1990).

 The RAISE Project 
 The RAISE Esprit project (1984-1991), of which I was part, developed the specification language RSL (RAISE Specification Language), as well as a refinement-based method and tools such as editors, type checkers, and proof tools. I was part of the 5 year language design effort, including writing dynamic semantics. The language was supposed to be a derivative of VDM, but took a completely different turn, combining algebraic specification with model-based specification, and a process specification language inspired by CCS and CSP. The contributors to the language were many over a more than 5 year period. Those that lastet to the end were Dines Bjoerner, Chris George, Peter Haff, Klaus Havelund Anne Haxthausen, Robert Milne, Claus Bendix Nielsen, Soeren Prehn and Kim Ritter Wagner. The RAISE project was started by Dines Bjoerner. 
  
 This project was a lot of fun and we studied a lot of specification languages and semantics papers. Doing specification language design for 5 years does create a desire for experiencing/designing? the perfect programming language, a thought I have not yet given up. I claim that such a language does exist, and it is not far removed from those old specification languages. Scala is an excellent example. 
  
 The following reports are early and not quite complete versions of an RSL tutorial (which I wrote) and an RSL reference manual (which I wrote the dynamic semantics part of, while Anne Haxthausen wrote the static semantics/wellformedness part).An RSL Tutorial

 The book consists of two parts I: RSL Tutorial (pages 9-250), and II: RSL Reference Description (pages 251-369). 
 Havelund wrote part I, while Havelund together with Anne Haxthausen wrote part II. The language presented in the book was designed during the period 1985-1991 by many people. Those that lastet to the end were theRAISE Language Group: Chris George, Peter Haff, Klaus Havelund Anne Haxthausen, Robert Milne, Claus Bendix Nielsen, Soeren Prehn and Kim Ritter Wagner. The RAISE project was started by Dines Bjoerner. 
  
 An early version of the book is the RSL tutorial (draft) below (April 6, 1990).

 The RAISE Project 
 The RAISE Esprit project (1984-1991), of which I was part, developed the specification language RSL (RAISE Specification Language), as well as a refinement-based method and tools such as editors, type checkers, and proof tools. I was part of the 5 year language design effort, including writing dynamic semantics. The language was supposed to be a derivative of VDM, but took a completely different turn, combining algebraic specification with model-based specification, and a process specification language inspired by CCS and CSP. The contributors to the language were many over a more than 5 year period. Those that lastet to the end were Dines Bjoerner, Chris George, Peter Haff, Klaus Havelund Anne Haxthausen, Robert Milne, Claus Bendix Nielsen, Soeren Prehn and Kim Ritter Wagner. The RAISE project was started by Dines Bjoerner. 
  
 This project was a lot of fun and we studied a lot of specification languages and semantics papers. Doing specification language design for 5 years does create a desire for experiencing/designing? the perfect programming language, a thought I have not yet given up. I claim that such a language does exist, and it is not far removed from those old specification languages. Scala is an excellent example. 
  
 The following reports are early and not quite complete versions of an RSL tutorial (which I wrote) and an RSL reference manual (which I wrote the dynamic semantics part of, while Anne Haxthausen wrote the static semantics/wellformedness part).An RSL Tutorial

 The book consists of two parts I: RSL Tutorial (pages 9-250), and II: RSL Reference Description (pages 251-369). 
 Havelund wrote part I, while Havelund together with Anne Haxthausen wrote part II. The language presented in the book was designed during the period 1985-1991 by many people. Those that lastet to the end were theRAISE Language Group: Chris George, Peter Haff, Klaus Havelund Anne Haxthausen, Robert Milne, Claus Bendix Nielsen, Soeren Prehn and Kim Ritter Wagner. The RAISE project was started by Dines Bjoerner. 
  
 An early version of the book is the RSL tutorial (draft) below (April 6, 1990).

 The RAISE Project 
 The RAISE Esprit project (1984-1991), of which I was part, developed the specification language RSL (RAISE Specification Language), as well as a refinement-based method and tools such as editors, type checkers, and proof tools. I was part of the 5 year language design effort, including writing dynamic semantics. The language was supposed to be a derivative of VDM, but took a completely different turn, combining algebraic specification with model-based specification, and a process specification language inspired by CCS and CSP. The contributors to the language were many over a more than 5 year period. Those that lastet to the end were Dines Bjoerner, Chris George, Peter Haff, Klaus Havelund Anne Haxthausen, Robert Milne, Claus Bendix Nielsen, Soeren Prehn and Kim Ritter Wagner. The RAISE project was started by Dines Bjoerner. 
  
 This project was a lot of fun and we studied a lot of specification languages and semantics papers. Doing specification language design for 5 years does create a desire for experiencing/designing? the perfect programming language, a thought I have not yet given up. I claim that such a language does exist, and it is not far removed from those old specification languages. Scala is an excellent example. 
  
 The following reports are early and not quite complete versions of an RSL tutorial (which I wrote) and an RSL reference manual (which I wrote the dynamic semantics part of, while Anne Haxthausen wrote the static semantics/wellformedness part).An RSL Tutorial
