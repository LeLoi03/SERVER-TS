 Global Internet (GI) Symposium 2024 
 The 29thIEEE Global Internet (GI) Symposium 2024 
 Organized in conjunction with 
 IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking 2024 
 Paper submission atEDAS LINK 
 The IEEE Global Internet (GI) Symposium is the flagship event established and organized by the Internet Technical Committee (ITC), a joint committee of the IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc) and the Internet Society (ISOC). The GI Symposium provides a top forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss advances in the current and future Internet and Internet-related technologies. The focus of the GI symposium is on experimental systems over the Internet and the design of future global Internet technologies, such as Information-Centric Networking (ICN), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), network slicing, Artificial-Intelligence-based intelligent Internet, industrial Internet, and vehicular and drone networks, especially on a global Internet scale. The GI symposium also has a special focus on measurements-related aspects, besides the emerging technologies. In addition to the traditional research papers, we encourage papers with well-thought-through concepts and positions, papers that contrast proposed approaches, papers that clarify and compare inherent differences between competing technologies, and heresies. 
 The topics of interest for the GI 2024 include but are not limited to the following: 
 Routing, switching and addressing 
 Future Internet and next-generation network architectures 
 Information-centric networking, Software-defined networking, and network function virtualization 
 Wireless Internet and Internet technologies for 5G/6G 
 Datacenter network architectures and performance 
 Integration of in-network computation, cloud, and edge/fog computing 
 Next generation Internet applications in the cloud continuum 
 Machine learning, data mining, and big data analytics for intelligent Internet 
 Space-air-ground integrated network 
 Quantum Internet and quantum networking 
 Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine, sensor, and vehicular/drone networks 
 Industrial Internet and time-sensitive and deterministic networks 
 Integrating blockchain with distributed Internet edges 
 Energy-efficient green communications 
 Geo-distributed applications, consistency, and latency challenges 
 Content delivery and management 
 Internet exchanges, remote peering, and peer-to-peer networks 
 Internet structure and analysis 
 Network-aware applications 
 Real-world Measurements and deployments 
 Distributed systems and novel distributed Internet applications 
 Online social networking 
 Internet measurement, modeling, and visualization 
 Large-scale network operations, management, and performance monitoring 
 Trust, security, privacy, and blockchain for the Internet
