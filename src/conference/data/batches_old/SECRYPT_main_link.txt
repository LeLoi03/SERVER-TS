 SCOPE 
 SECRYPT is an annual international conference covering research in information and communication security. The International Conference on Security and Cryptography (SECRYPT) seeks submissions from academia, industry, and government presenting novel research on all theoretical and practical aspects of data protection, privacy, security, and applied cryptography. Note that while applied cryptography papers are welcome, pure cryptography papers are out of scope for the conference. Papers describing the application of security technology, the implementation of systems, and lessons learned are also encouraged. Papers describing new methods or technologies, advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and vision papers indicating future directions are also encouraged.CONFERENCE TOPICS

Complete papers can be submitted as a Regular Paper, representing completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, portraying a short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue discussing ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research focused on one of the conference topic areas. 
  
 Authors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics. Each paper should clearly indicate the nature of its technical/scientific contribution, and the problems, domains or environments to which it is applicable. To facilitate the double-blind paper evaluation method, authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors, including the authors’ personal details, the acknowledgments section of the paper and any other reference that may disclose the authors’ identity.
