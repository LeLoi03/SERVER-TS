 About the Conference 
 This is the conference of theSIAM Activity Group on Discrete Mathematics. 
 The SIAM Conference on Discrete Mathematics (DM24) is being held jointly with: 
 SIAM Annual Meeting (AN24) 
 SIAM Conference on Applied Mathematics Education (ED24) 
 Discrete mathematics has a wide range of challenging research problems and important applications in industry. In addition to core combinatorial problems and techniques, modern research in the field encompasses approaches from many other areas of mathematics including algebra, topology, geometry, probability, analysis and logic. Its applications span computer science, the physical, biological, and social sciences, telecommunications, information processing, and manufacturing, and it is widely used by businesses and industries to improve efficiency. This conference will highlight major theoretical advances in discrete mathematics, the development of new tools and techniques, and significant new applications to problems from industry and science. It will also bring together participants from the many different environments where discrete mathematics is developed and applied. 
 Included Themes 
 Discrete Mathematics, including: 
 Algebraic combinatorics 
 Combinatorial algorithms 
 Combinatorial number theory 
 Design theory

 The Canadian Discrete and Algorithmic Mathematics Conference (CanaDAM) is a biennial meeting, held in odd numbered years, that brings together researchers from the various disciplines with which discrete and algorithmic mathematics interact. Ideally, the meeting site will alternate between the western half and eastern half of Canada. The conference was pioneered by Derek Corneil, Daniel Panario, and Pavol Hell, who solicited the help of many discrete mathematics researchers across Canada to realize it. 
 The general topic of the conference is the theory and application of discrete structures. Its goal is to highlight the most salient trends in the field, which has close links to diverse areas such as cryptography, computer science, large-scale networks and biology. Particular areas of interest include: graphs and digraphs, hypergraphs, matroids, ordered sets, designs, coding theory, enumeration, combinatorics of words, discrete optimization, discrete and computational geometry, lattice point enumeration, combinatorial algorithms, computational complexity, and applications of discrete and algorithmic mathematics, including (but not limited to) web graphs, computational biology, telecommunication networks, and information processing. CanaDAM uses the same general format as the SIAM Conference on Discrete Mathematics, which is a biennial conference held in even numbered years. There are typically nine plenary talks and a collection of invited minisymposia on topics consistent with conference themes. Participation in the conference is by attending, submitting a contributed talk, or by proposing or participating in a minisymposium.

 We are seeking host cities for CanaDAM 2027 and other future conferences. A bid should include details about the location, including housing and travel options, available rooms on campus, and members of the local organizing committee. Information about potential for satellite events and financial support would strengthen a bid. The location must be able to accommodate 350 or more attendees for a 4 day conference in May of 2027. Please contact ec-chair@canadam.ca, or any other members of the Executive Committee for more information.
