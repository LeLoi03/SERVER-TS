 About 
 The 22nd European Conference on Multi-Agent Systems (EUMAS 2025) will be organized on September 3-5, 2025 by theFaculty of Automatic Control and ComputersatNational University of Science and Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest, Romania. 
 EUMAS 2025 is anEURAMASdesignated event which follows the tradition ofprevious editions, and aims to encourage and support activity in the research and development of multi-agent systems, in academic and industrial effort. 
 The conference aspires to be the primary European forum for researchers interested inthe theory and practice of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. EUMAS enables researchers to meet, present challenges, preliminary and mature research results in an open environment. 
 EUMAS 2025 features formal proceedings published as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series of Springer.

EUMAS 2025 welcomes original, unpublished papers including improved versions of extended abstracts or rejected papers from AAMAS, AAAI and IJCAI 2025. The submission should describe work that has not been previously published, accepted for publication nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. 
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed in a single blind fashion. Submission length depends upon the track that you submit to. Additional pages may be used for references and, if needed, a clearly marked appendix. It should be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS format. For templates and instructions for authors, seeConference proceedings guidelines.Authors must submit their papers through thehref="https://openreview.net/group?id=EUMAS/2025/Conference" - OpenReview submission site
as a single PDF file. 
 This year, EUMAS is accepting submissions across the following tracks: 
 Main Track (15 pages + references) | Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: Action and Planning Adaptation and Learning; Agent Architectures; Agent Programming Languages; Agent Development Methodologies and Tools; Agent-Based Simulations and Modeling; Agent Organizations and Institutions; Agent-oriented Software Engineering; Agents and Complex Systems; Applications of Multi-agent Systems; Argumentation; Automated negotiation; Biologically inspired approaches; Cognitive Models; Collective and Swarm Intelligence; Collective Intentionality; Communication Cooperation, and Coordination; Computational Social Choice; Deep Reinforcement Learning in Multi-Agent Domains; Economic Models; Electronic Commerce; Ethical behavior of multi-agent systems; Formal Modelling; Game-Theoretic Methods; Human-Agent Interaction; Logics for Multi-Agent Systems; Logics for Strategic Reasoning; Machine Learning for Multi-Agent Systems; Multi-Agent Learning; LLM powered AI Agents; Multi-agent architectures for XAI; Explainable planning; Explainable negotiation protocols and strategies; Explainable user/agent profiling; Multi-Robot Systems; Negotiation; Self-organization; Semantic Web Agents; Social Networks; Socio-technical Systems; Theories of Agency; Trust and Reputation; Verification; Virtual Agents; Voting and Judgment Aggregation Models for Multi-Agent Systems 
 Agent Toolkits Community Session (15 pages + reference) | This track aims to provide a forum for researchers that are involved in developing agent/MAS toolkits and platforms, or that are using them for the development of applications, to exchange ideas, make proposals, suggest challenges, reports interesting use cases and so on - any aspect that could be of interest in the engineering and using Agent Toolkits. 
 Demonstrators (5 pages + references) | This track aims to provide opportunities for participants from academia and industry to present their latest developments in agent-based systems. Demonstrations of interest include both applications of multi-agent systems and tools that support developers in the specification, design, implementation and testing of agent systems.
