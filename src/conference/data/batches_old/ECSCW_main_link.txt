 If you want to present a pointed insight from your fieldwork, have a compact argument to make, or describe an insightful experience from designing, implementing, or sustaining a system for collaboration, this publication format is the right choice for you. This could include, but is not limited to, the following: 
 A new methodology for designing or examining CSCW technologies 
 Insights from the implementation of an IT system supporting collaboration 
 First experiences and insights from the use of a new system supporting collaboration 
 A case study of collaborative technology in a domain not typically studied in CSCW research 
 A discussion or unfolding of new CSCW theory 
 We look forward to previously unpublished, concise, and insightful submissions that make substantive progress in a field of CSCW and can benefit from presentation and discussion at the EUSSET CSCW conference. If you are submitting a Conference Paper on accessibility or assistive technology, please refer to the SIGACCESS guidelines on writing about disability. If you have a provocative, challenging idea that still needs more shaping and discussion, you might want to consider Exploratory Papers instead. 
 Submission Format and Process 
 While the length of Conference Papers is flexible, we expect they will be no longer than 6,000 words without references. Longer versions should be justified (using the specific text field on EasyChair). All authors must follow the Conference Papers template available inhref="https://ecscw.eusset.eu/2025/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ECSCW-2025-Submissions-Template.zip" - Latex
