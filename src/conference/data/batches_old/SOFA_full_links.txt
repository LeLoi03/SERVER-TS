 International Workshop on Soft Computing Applications (SOFA Conferences) 
 International Workshop 
 SOFA Conferences 
 Soft computing (SC) is a collection of methodologies that are trying to cope with the main disadvantage of the conventional (hard) computing: the poor performances when working in uncertain conditions. The fundamental idea of soft computing is to emulate the human like reasoning. The classic constituents of SC are fuzzy logic, neural network theory and probabilistic reasoning, but new methods are continuously emerging: belief networks, genetic algorithms, anytime algorithms, chaos theory, some parts of learning theory, etc. Due to the large variety and complexity of the domain, the constituting methods of SC are not competing for a comprehensive ultimate solution. Instead they are complementing each other, for dedicated solutions adapted to each specific problem. Hundreds of concrete applications are already available in control, decision making, pattern recognition and robotics. The SC systems are tolerant to imprecision, uncertainty, and partial truth. Their main advantages are tractability, robustness, and low cost implementations. At the same time SC is a major developing vector of the Artificial Intelligence.

 The rapid evolution of cyber threats and the dynamic nature of the threat landscape have necessitated the development of proactive and predictive defense mechanisms. This research proposes an AI-driven framework for predictive cyber threat intelligence aimed at enhancing organizational cybersecurity by identifying and mitigating threats before they materialize. The framework integrates diverse data sources, including network logs, endpoint data, and threat intelligence feeds, to generate actionable insights using advanced machine learning algorithms such as anomaly detection, pattern recognition, and predictive analytics. A continuous feedback loop ensures the adaptability of the framework through model retraining, anomaly adjustment, and performance monitoring. By leveraging supervised and unsupervised learning models, the framework addresses both known and unknown threats, providing scalable, real-time threat detection and risk assessment capabilities. This approach shifts the cybersecurity paradigm from reactive to proactive, enabling organizations to anticipate and counteract sophisticated cyber-attacks effectively. The proposed system’s application is demonstrated through practical scenarios, highlighting its potential to transform decision-making in high-stakes cybersecurity environments.
