 Security-aware data provenance to support cybersecurity situational awareness 
 Carsten Rudolph 
 Monash University, Oceania Cyber Security Centre OCSC 
 Abstract 
 Cybersecurity in distributed processes and systems often relies on a combination of individual local security controls and security protocols to protect communication. This means that in individual steps in the process there is limited situational awareness on the current security posture of the participating entities and on the protections applied to data in the process. Thus, people interacting with the systems don't have sufficient information to estimate cybersecurity risks at real-time. Security-aware provenance data can potentially improve this situation and existing research shows that various security meta-data is, in principle, available, but currently not used. One challenge is the sheer amount of available information and it is obvious that automation and suitable visualisation would be required to enable humans to digest this data and to react on changes in risks. 
 Biography 
 Carsten Rudolph is Professor for Cybersecurity and Deputy Dean of the Faculty of IT, Monash University, and Director for Research of the Oceania Cyber Security Centre OCSC in Melbourne, Australia. Before joining Monash, he was Head of Research Department for Trust and Compliance at the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT, Darmstadt, Germany and lead several large-scale European research initiatives. His research concentrates on information security, formal methods, cryptographic protocols, security of machine learning and human aspects of security with a strong focus interdisciplinary topics. He contributes to the development of secure solutions for different areas, such as digital health or future energy networks. Further, he drives scientific exchange between cybersecurity, law and organisational informatics. Another focus of his research is on nation-level cybersecurity maturity and policy development. Dr. Rudolph has established the OCSC and oversees the OCSC’s program for national cybersecurity maturity reviews in the Pacific region, a collaboration with Oxford University. 
 VizSec 2023 Call for Papers 
 We cordially invite you to participate in the 20th IEEE Symposium on Visualization for Cyber Security (VizSec) 2023. VizSec brings together researchers and practitioners from academia, government, and industry to address the needs of the cybersecurity community through new and insightful visualization and analysis techniques. VizSec provides an excellent venue for fostering greater exchange and new collaborations on a broad range of security- and privacy-related topics. 
 VizSec will be held as an Associated Event with IEEE VIS taking place October 22 - 27 in Melbourne, Australia. As an Associated Event, the VizSec program will be anin-personevent. 
 The purpose of VizSec is to explore effective and scalable visual interfaces for security domains such as network security, computer forensics, reverse engineering, insider threat detection, cryptography, privacy, user-assisted attacks prevention, compliance management, wireless security, secure coding, penetration testing, and other related research topics. 
 We are soliciting Technical (Full), Short, Position Papers and Presentation-Only (Non Archival) submissions. 
 Technical Papers 
 Full papers describing novel contributions in security visualization are solicited. Papers may present techniques, applications, theory, analysis, experiments, or evaluations. We encourage the submission of papers on technologies and methods that promise to improve cyber security practices, including, but not limited to: 
 Situation awareness and/or understanding 
 Incident handling including triage, exploration, correlation, and response 
 Computer forensics 
 Machine learning & explainable AI for cybersecurity 
 Adversarial machine learning visualization 
 Adversarial visualization 
 Visual analytics for cybersecurity 
 Data protection & privacy 
 Blockchain performance & security 
 Cybersecurity in critical infrastructure 
 Collaborative visualization for cybersecurity & provenance 
 Decision support for security configuration and deployment 
 Reverse engineering and malware analysis 
 Vulnerability management 
 Multiple data source analysis 
 Analyzing information requirements for computer network defense 
 Evaluation and/or user testing of systems 
 Criteria for assessing the effectiveness of cyber security visualizations, for security goals or human factors 
 System modeling and network analysis 
 Usable Security and Privacy 
 Software security 
 Mobile application security 
 Social networking privacy and security 
 Training & education 
 Visualization for privacy engineering 
  
 Submissions including tests and evaluations of the proposed tools and techniques are also considered particularly desirable. If possible, making test data available will also be considered positively. If you do not have real-world data to demonstrate your visualization, you may be interested in looking at thehref="https://vizsec.org/data/" - VizSec dataset links
. Please seehref="https://vizsec.org/past/" - past years
proceedings and websites to see the quality and examples of previous submissions. Previous VizSec papers may also be found on thehref="https://vizsec.dbvis.de/" - VizSec Papers Browser
and on IEEE Xplore. 
 Short Papers 
 Short papers describing initial research results, concise research contributions, or incremental work on the above topics even including practical applications of security visualization, are solicited. We encourage the submission of papers discussing the introduction of cyber security visualizations into operational context including, but not limited to: 
 Cases where visualization made positive contributions towards meeting operational needs 
 Gaps or negative outcomes from visualization deployments 
 Situations where visualization was not utilized, but could have had a positive impact 
 Lessons learned from operational engagements 
 Insights gained from the transition process 
  
 Cyber security practitioners from industry, as well as the research community, are encouraged to submit case studies. 
 Position Papers 
 Position papers focus on topics needing or calling for discussion or reconsideration of forgotten topics relevant for the VizSec community. They should report a clear position on the target topic and should also suggest a proposal or actions regarding the target topic. They should stimulate imaginative and hypothesis-driven research. In particular, we encourage submissions both from researchers inside the visualization community and outside, such as researchers and practitioners from pure cybersecurity domains who currently do not broadly employ visualization in their work. 
 Presentation-Only 
 Presentation submissions are non-archival submissions and may describe late-breaking results, work in progress, preliminary results, demonstrations that present concrete examples of successful applications of visualization techniques in industry settings, practical challenges, insights gained from experience, best practices, future directions, and emerging trends relevant to the VizSec community. There will be a dedicated session where speakers can showcase the latest developments in the field, share their findings, present future directions and challenges, and discuss with conference participants. We encourage submissions from both academia and industry, as this will enable fruitful exchanges and foster collaboration between these two communities. Our goal is to create a forum where attendees can learn from each other, discuss emerging trends, and share insights on addressing practical challenges academia and industry face. 
 Awards 
 There will be an award for the best full paper from the accepted program. This award will be given to the paper judged to have the highest overall quality as determined by the program committee. Key elements of the selection process include whether papers include evaluation, repeatable results, and open-source data or software. We plan to recommend the best full paper in a special issue of the journal, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). 
 Paper Submissions 
 The VizSec 2023 Proceedings will be published by IEEE. Submissions must be formatted using the IEEE VGTC conference proceedings template that can be found at:https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/VizSec full papers are limited to 9 pages of content plus an additional 2 pages of references. Papers may be shorter than this but must make a similar contribution to a longer paper. Reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any pages past the maximum. Short papers must be at most 4 pages plus 1 page of references. Position papers must be at most 4 pages total including references. 
 Submissions not meeting these guidelines will be rejected without consideration of their merit. Reviews are single-blind, so authors may include names and affiliations in their submissions. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference.
