 SERVICES 2025, an in-person event with zoom support for remote presentations, will take place in Helsinki, Finland from 7-12 July, 2025. 
 Venue:University of Helsinki 
 Venue address:Yliopistonkatu 4, 00100 Helsinki, Finland 
 The 2025 IEEE World Congress on SERVICES (SERVICES 2025)is solely sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society under the auspice of the Technical Community on Services Computing (TCSVC). With six theme conferences, the scope of SERVICES 2025 covers all aspects of services computing and applications, current or emerging. 
 Centered around services computing, SERVICES 2025 covers various systems and networking research pertaining to cloud, edge and Internet-of Things (IoT), as well as technologies for intelligent computing, learning, Big Data and blockchain applications, addressing critical issues such as knowledge network, high performance, security, privacy, dependability, trustworthiness, and cost-effectiveness. 
 In addition to co-located theme-topic conferences, the Congress will also include symposia and workshops supporting deep-dive discussions on emerging important topics, and complement the SERVICES 2025 program with industry and application presentations and panels. 
 Authors are invited to prepare early and submit original papers to any of these conferences at www.easychair.org. All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. Accepted and presented papers will appear in the conference proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. 
 SERVICES 2025 is the only premier professional event for the services computing field offered by IEEE.

 CISOSE 2025 
 The IEEE International Congress on Intelligent and Service-Oriented Systems Engineering (CISOSE) is thepremier event on service-oriented systems and the practices involving these systems. 
 After a journey that began in 2005 with the IEEE International Workshop on Service-Oriented System Engineering (SOSE’05), in 2015 the conference become anIEEE International Congress on Intelligent and Service-Oriented Systems Engineering(CISOSE). 
 CISOSE is organized on an annual basis either in the Americas, in Europe, or in Asia and constitutes a platform and venue for the wider community of Service-Oriented Systems Engineering and Distributed and Mobile Systems enthusiasts. In 2025, the congress will be held inTucson, Arizona. 
 The congress will feature excellent keynote speakers and panelists in several parallel program tracks. Smart Cities and Big Data, as well as a showcase of real-world solutions in academia and industry. Chain technologies of the future. The future of AI and machine learning. In addition, there will be an exhibition of solutions for solution providers and university researchers. 
 CISOSE 2025 is represented bysevenco-located conferences, including: 
 IEEE AI TEST 2025 | - 7th IEEE International Conference On Artificial Intelligence Testing. 
 IEEE BigDataService | 2025 - 11th IEEE International Conference on Big Data Computing Service and Machine Learning Applications. 
 IEEE DAPPS 2025 | - 7th IEEE International Conference on Decentralized Applications and Infrastructures.
