 SCOPE 
 The purpose of the International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise Systems (ICORES) is to bring together researchers, engineers, faculty, and practitioners interested in both theoretical advances and practical applications in the field of operations research. Two simultaneous tracks will be held, covering on one side domain independent methodologies and technologies and on the other side practical work developed in specific application areas. 
  
 ICORES focuses on real world challenges; therefore authors should highlight the benefits of Operations Research Methodologies and Technologies for industry and services, either in general or for particular applications. Ideas on how to solve specific business problems as well as larger enterprise challenges, using operations research methodologies and technologies, will arise from the conference. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, case studies, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of ICORES. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. Both full research reports and work-in-progress reports are welcome. There will be both formal oral presentations and informal poster sessions. 
  
 Special sessions focused on case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as tutorials for technical/scientific topics and practical applications are also envisaged: companies interested in presenting their products/methodologies or researchers interested in offering a tutorial are invited to contact the conference secretariat.CONFERENCE AREAS 
 Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas:1. METHODOLOGIES AND TECHNOLOGIES
