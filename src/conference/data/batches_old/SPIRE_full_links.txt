32nd International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval 
 September 08 -11, London, UK 
  
 SCOPE 
 SPIRE 2025 covers research in all aspects of string processing, information retrieval, computational biology, and related applications. Typical topics of interest include (but are not limited to): 
 String Processing: ​ string pattern matching, text indexing, data structures for string processing, text compression, compressed data structures, compressed string processing, text mining, 2D pattern matching, automata based string processing, combinatorics on words. 
 Computational Biology: algorithms for DNA sequencing, assembly, alignments, read error correction, metagenomics, transcriptomics, gene and regulatory element recognition, motif finding, pangenomics, variants discovery, phylogenetics, genome rearrangements. 
 Information Retrieval: Retrieval models and ranking. Theoretical models and foundations of IR. Efficiency and scalability topics in IR. Knowledge acquisition in IR. Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for IR. Knowledge representation and reasoning for IR. User-centric aspects of IR. IR Evaluation. Fairness, accountability, transparency in IR. Domain-specific IR applications. Web search. 
  
 SUBMISSIONS 
 SPIRE 2025 invites submissions in two categories: 
 Long papers: Up to 12 pages, excluding references and optional appendices. 
 Short papers: Up to 6 pages, excluding references and optional appendices. 

Papers should be submitted electronically via EasyChair via the following link: 
  
 href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spire2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spire2025

As in past editions, the proceedings of SPIRE 2025 will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. The use of LNCS templates is mandatory.
