 href="https://easychair.org/smart-program/AVM25/" - AVM 2025
(17th Alpine Verification Meeting) is collocated with SYNASC 2025 
 SYNASCaims to stimulate the interaction among multiple communities focusing on defining, optimizing and executing complex algorithms in several application areas. Thefocusof the conference then ranges from symbolic and numeric computation to formal methods applied to programming, artificial intelligence, distributed computing and computing theory. The interplay between these areas, in fact, is essential in the current scenario where economy and society demand for the development of complex, data intensive, trustable and highperformantcomputational systems.

 Call for Special Sessions 
 Proposals are invited for special sessions on any topic relevant to the conference. Special sessions are intended to stimulate in-depth discussions in special areas and they are fully integrated into the main conference. The research papers and the informal presentations submitted and accepted for the special sessions follow the same rules as the papers submitted to the regular sessions. It is expected that the organizers of the special sessions appoint their own chair and program committee, which will be integrated into the conference program committee and will be supervised by the conference program chair and by the general chair. 
 The special session proposals should be sent, by March 15, tohref="mailto:contact@synasc.ro" - contact@synasc.ro
and should specify the following: 
 Special session title. 
 A brief description of the topics to be covered and a motivation of the relevance of the special session to SYNASC audience. 
 A list of organizers with email addresses and a one-paragraph bio for each organizer, describing research expertise and previous experience in organizing scientific meetings. 
 A preliminary list of the program committee. 
 Call for Workshops 
 Proposals for satellite workshops are invited. The workshops should have topics related to SYNASC but the workshop organizers manage the scientific program of each satellite workshop.The workshop proposals should be sent by March 15, tohref="mailto:contact@synasc.ro" - contact@synasc.ro
and should specify the following: 
 Workshop title. 
 A brief description of the topics to be covered, and a motivation of the relevance of the workshop to SYNASC audience. 
 A description of the history of the workshop (if it previously took place). 
 A list of organizers with email addresses and a one-paragraph bio for each organizer, describing research expertise and previous experience in organizing scientific meetings. 
 A preliminary list of the program committee. 
 Call for Tutorials 
 Proposals for tutorials are also invited. Tutorials provide fundamental exposure to topics ranging from introductory through intermediate to advanced. The number and duration of the tutorials will be decided by the tutorial chair under the supervision of the general chair. The typical duration of a tutorial session is 90 minutes. If it is necessary, a tutorial can be split into two sessions, each one of 90 minutes.The tutorial proposals should be sent, by March 15, tohref="mailto:contact@synasc.ro" - contact@synasc.ro
