 Dr. Nisar’s Lab Wins Best Paper Award at International Conference 
 Dr. Nisar’s Lab Wins Best Paper Award at International Conference 
 Mar 25, 2024 
 EngineeringA team of visiting students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), USA, under the guidance of Prof. Sajid Nisar, won the Best Paper Award at the 29th International Symposium on Artificial Life and Robotics (AROB 2024). Held in Beppu, Oita – Japan, from January 24-26, 2024, AROB is a premier forum in the realm of artificial life and robotics, drawing researchers and students globally! 
 The student team received the coveted Best Paper Award for their outstanding paper titled “Design and Kinematic Evaluation of a 5-DoF Robotic Surgical Instrument”, which was the result of their collaborative effort to develop a cutting-edge prototype of a cable-driven robotic surgical instrument. The team consisted of Cameron Crane, Nicholas Johannessen, Joshua Kleiman, and Calvin Page. It was co-advised by WPI Professors Adam Powell, Yihao Zheng, and Sharon Johnson. 
 Speaking on the occasion, Prof. Nisar lauded the students for their exceptional performance, highlighting the significance of their collaborative efforts in advancing the frontiers of surgical robotics. He commended their interdisciplinary approach and emphasized the invaluable learning experiences gained through this transformative journey. He also thanked the WPI faculty for their co-supervision and support!
