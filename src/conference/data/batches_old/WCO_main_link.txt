 Computational Optimization 
 (CO) 
 Image 
 Kraków, Poland, 14-17 September, 2025 
 In the real world, Intelligence Systems address numerous problems in the fields of engineering, economics, medicine, and other domains. Many of these problems can be formulated as optimization tasks, in particular, we may consider challenges that are frequently characterized by non-convex, non-differentiable, discontinuous, noisy, or dynamic objective functions and constraints that ask for adequate computational methods. 
 The aim of this Thematic Session is to stimulate communication between researchers working on different fields of optimization and practitioners who need reliable and efficient computational optimization methods. 
 We invite original contributions related to both theoretical and practical aspects of optimization methods. 
 Topics 
 The list of topics includes, but is not limited to: 
 combinatorial and continuous global optimization 
 unconstrained and constrained optimization 
 multiobjective and robust optimization 
 optimization in dynamic and/or noisy environments 
 optimization on graphs 
 large-scale optimization, in parallel and distributed computational environments 
 meta-heuristics for optimization, nature-inspired approaches and any other derivative-free methods 
 exact/heuristic hybrid methods, involving natural computing techniques and other global and local optimization methods 
 numerical and heuristic methods for modeling 
 The applications of interest are included in the list below, but are not limited to: 
 classical operational research problems (knapsack, traveling salesman, etc) 
 computational biology and distance geometry 
 data mining and knowledge discovery 
 human motion simulations; crowd simulations 
 industrial applications 
 optimization in statistics, econometrics, finance, physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering 
 environment modeling and optimization 
 In the past, a number of Best Paper awards was granted to participants of this Thematic SessionBest Paper Award – past winners.
