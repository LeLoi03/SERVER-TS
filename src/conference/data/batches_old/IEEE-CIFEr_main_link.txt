Scope 
 Principles of finance combined with advanced mathematical structures form financial models, strategies and products that are tested and implemented with the use of advanced quantitative techniques. The use of computing technology through advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, is pervasive throughout this process and combined with high performance computers has enabled Computational Finance (CF) to grow steadily in the last decade. CF has influenced the marketplace extensively with enormous impact on wealth building, employment opportunities, and tremendous economic growth. This field forms an ever-expanding part of the financial sector, in many ways today.The symposium on CI for Financial Engineering and Economics, has provided a forum for advanced research since 1995, bringing together researchers who design and develop intelligent algorithms for various problems in finance. It is essential to continue bringing researchers to exchange their ideas, models, and results, providing fundamental threads to discussions and arguments. 
 Some of the major issues facing academics and practitioner alike include creating financial models (for pricing derivatives, or risk management strategies etc.), formulating them as computational problems and applying advanced computing technologies. 
 The symposium will focus on fundamentals of finance, introduce the computational issues therein and report latest findings and understanding of financial modeling using computational intelligence techniques that would benefit academic and practitioners alike. 
 Topicsof interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Finance Modeling and Analysis 
 Financial data analytics 
 Intelligent trading agents 
 Trading room simulation 
 Time series analysis 
 Probabilistic modeling/inference 
 Non-linear dynamics 
 Digital financial reporting 
 Stocks and derivative pricing 
 Cryptocurrencies and risks 
 Business Modeling and Analysis 
 IT Infrastructure and data management 
 Business data analytics 
 Customer service analytics 
 Hyper automation 
 Deep analytics 
 Advertising and sales 
 Demand forecasting 
 Economic agents 
 Disruptive technologies in business

 IEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations. 
 The 2025 event marks a significant milestone in the evolution of IEEE SSCI, launching the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia: 
 href="?ui=ci-for-energy-transport-environmental-sustainability" - 2025 IEEE Symposia on CI for Energy, Transport and Environmental Sustainability  (IEEE CIETES) 
 href="?ui=ci-in-engineering-cyber-physical-systems" - 2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Engineering / Cyber Physical Systems (IEEE CIES) 
 href="?ui=ci-in-image-signal-processing-and-synthetic-media" - 2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Image, Signal Processing and Synthetic Media (IEEE CISM) 
 href="?ui=ci-in-artificial-life-and-cooperative-intelligent-systems" - 2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Artificial Life and Cooperative Intelligent Systems  (IEEE ALIFE-CIS) 
 href="?ui=ci-in-security-defence-and-biometrics" - 2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Security, Defence and Biometrics (IEEE CISDB) 
 href="?ui=ci-in-health-and-medicine" - 2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Health and Medicine  (IEEE CIHM) 
 href="?ui=ci-for-financial-engineering-and-economics" - 2025 IEEE Symposia on CI for Financial Engineering and Economics (IEEE CiFer) 
 href="?ui=ci-in-natural-language-processing-and-social-media" - 2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Natural Language Processing and Social Media (IEEE CI-NLPSoMe) 
 href="?ui=trustworthy-explainable-and-responsible-ci" - 2025 IEEE Symposia on Trustworthy, Explainable and Responsible CI (IEEE CITREx)

 IEEE SSCI 2025, hosted in Trondheim, Norway - a city seamlessly blending historical richness with innovative progress - brings IEEE SSCI to a stunning winter location, for skiers and non-skiers alike. Longer days and milder winter weather, together with the chance to see the Northern Lights., provides the perfect timing for a visit to Norway. Trondheim's small downtown area provides easy walking distance from the Venue to attractions, shopping, restaurants - from fast food to Michelin star - and sport activities. 
 Late Submission Opportunities 
 IEEE SSCI 2025 offers several submission options for late-breaking research: 
 Late-Breaking Papers: | Submit an extended abstract of up to 2 pages to share preliminary research, ideas, or critiques, fostering interactive discussions. 
 Poster-Only Submissions: | Submit a short abstract (up to 250 words) to present early-stage concepts or challenges for constructive feedback. 
 Journal to Conference (J2C) Submissions: | Provide a summary (up to 1 page) of recent journal articles relevant to SSCI themes, promoting broader engagement with your research.
