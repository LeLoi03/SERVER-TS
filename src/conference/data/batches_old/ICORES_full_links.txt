 Abstract 
 Closed-loop supply chains are at the forefront of sustainable industrial practices since they promote the reuse of products through remanufacturing, recycling, and repair operations. Within this framework, repair centers are increasingly considered an alternative source of spare parts. This creates a need to enhance repair operations to balance the reliability of repaired parts with sustainability. This paper, developed in collaboration with GE Healthcare, presents a multi-objective framework incorporating spare part reliability post-repair estimation into opportunistic maintenance decisions. This research uses real-world data and advanced modeling techniques to refine maintenance strategies and provide a comprehensive solution that acknowledges component interdependencies. By employing NSGA-III, the paper seeks to develop a decision-support mechanism that recommends the proactive replacement of components, thereby enhancing the quality of repaired spare parts.
