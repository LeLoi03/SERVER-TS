 11th Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science 
 CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science. It is a high-level bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations ofCMCS(the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science), andWADT(the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques).

 Scope 
 Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer science. From data types to development techniques and specification formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from the large body of research proposed and implemented since the pioneering works of the 1960s. CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in both foundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science, traditional as well as emerging ones. CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques). Previous CALCO editions took place in Bloomington, Indiana (US, 2023), Salzburg (Austria, 2021), London (UK, 2019), Ljubljana (Slovenia,2017), Nijmegen (the Netherlands, 2015), Warsaw (Poland, 2013), Winchester (UK, 2011), Udine (Italy, 2009), Bergen (Norway, 2007), Swansea (Wales, 2005). The 11th edition will be held in Glasgow, UK, co-located with MFPS XLI. It is planned as a physical, in-person event. It is expected that at least one author of each accepted paper will attend and give the presentation is person; exceptions can be made in case of unexpected travel/visa problems. 
 Submission Categories 
 CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four categories of submissions. 
 Regular papers that report 
 results on theoretical foundations, 
 novel methods and techniques for software development, 
 experiences with technology transfer to industry. 
 (Co)Algebraic Pearls papers that 
 present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way. 
 Early ideas abstracts that lead to 
 presentations of work in progress, 
 proposals for original venues of research. 
 Tool presentation papers that 
 report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools. 
 Topics of Interest 
 All topics relating to algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications are of interest for CALCO, and among them 
 Models and logics | Automata and languages 
 Graph transformations and term rewriting 
 Modal logics 
 Proof systems 
 Relational systems

 System specification and verification | Formal testing and quality assurance 
 Generative programming and model-driven development 
 Integration of formal specification techniques 
 Model-driven development 
 Specification languages, methods, and environments 
 Tools supporting algebraic and coalgebraic methods for | Advances in automated verification 
 Model checking 
 Theorem proving 
 Testing 
 String diagrams and network theory | Theory of PROPs and operads 
 Rewriting problems and higher-dimensional approaches 
 Automated reasoning with string diagrams 
 Applications of string diagrams 
 Quantum computing | Categorical semantics for quantum computing 
 Quantum calculi and programming languages 
 Foundational structures for quantum computing 
 Applications of quantum algebra 
 Submission Guidelines 
 All submissions will be handled via EasyChair:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco25" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco25
The format for all submissions is specified by LIPIcs. Please use the latest version of the style:href="http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/" - http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors/
It is recommended that submissions adhere to that format and length. Submissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. Proceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics series. 
 A special issue of the open access journalLogical Methods in Computer Science, containing extended versions of selected papers, is planned. 
 Regular papers 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit full papers in English presenting original research. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Regular papers should be maximum 15 pages long, excluding references. Proofs omitted due to space limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix. 
 (Co)algebraic pearls 
 This is a recent submission category. Explaining a known idea in a new way may make as strong a contribution as inventing a new idea. We encourage the submission of pearls: elegant essays that illustrate an idea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing an application. Pearls are typically short and concise and so should not be longer than regular papers in the format specified by LIPIcs. Authors who feel they need a bit more space should consult the PC co-chairs. The accepted papers will be included in the final proceedings of the conference. 
 Early ideas abstracts 
 Submissions should not exceed 2 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. The volume of selected abstracts will be made available on arXiv and on the CALCO pages. Authors will retain copyright, and are also encouraged to disseminate the results by subsequent publication elsewhere. 
 Tool papers 
 Submissions should not exceed 5 pages in the format specified by LIPIcs. The accepted tool papers will be included in the final proceedings of the conference. The tools should be made available on the web at the time of submission for download and evaluation. 
 Best Paper and Best Presentation Awards 
 This edition of CALCO will feature two awards: a Best Paper Award whose recipients will be selected by the PC before the conference and a Best Presentation Award, elected by the participants.
