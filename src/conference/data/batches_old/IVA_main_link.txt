 Calls for Papers / Posters / Workshops / Demos / Doctoral Consortium are now online! 
 The annual conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA) is the premier international event for interdisciplinary research on the design, application, and evaluation of Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVAs) with a specific focus on the ability to socially interact. IVAs are interactive characters that exhibit human-like qualities including communicating using natural human modalities such as facial expressions, speech, and gesture. They are capable of real-time perception, cognition, emotion and action that allow them to participate in dynamic social environments. 
 Aesthetics and Culture:This year‚Äôs theme explores how aesthetic principles and cultural nuances for Socially Interactive Agents promote user trust, comfort, and willingness to engage. It also includes how culturally informed design cues reduce barriers and promote more intuitive, socially meaningful human-machine collaboration. Last but not least, art and culture are predestined to provide impulses for critical reflection and societal discourse on Socially Interactive Agents. Such contributions are also widely welcomed and appreciated. 
 IVA 2025 will take place in Berlin at the beautiful campus site ofHTWdirectly at the river Spree. Look forward to this amazing experience!

 Motivation 
 Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA) Annual Conference is the premier international event for interdisciplinary research on the design, application, and evaluation of Virtual Agents with social interaction capabilities.. 
 IVA 2025, the 25th Annual Conference, will be held in Berlin, Germany, September 16-19, 2025. 
 IVAs are interactive characters that exhibit human-like capabilities, including communicating using natural human modalities such as facial expressions, speech, and gestures. IVAs are also capable of real-time perception, cognition, emotion, and action that allow them to participate in dynamic social interactions. 
 IVA 2025 aims to showcase cutting-edge research on the design, application, and evaluation of IVAs, as well as the basic research underlying the technology that supports human-agent interaction, such as social perception, dialog modeling, and social behavior planning. We also welcome submissions on central theoretical issues, uses of virtual agents in psychological research and showcases of working applications. 
 Aesthetics and Culture:This year‚Äôs theme explores how aesthetic principles and cultural nuances for Socially Interactive Agents promote user trust, comfort, and willingness to engage. It also includes how culturally informed design cues reduce barriers and promote more intuitive, socially meaningful human-machine collaboration. Last but not least, art and culture are predestined to provide impulses for critical reflection and societal discourse on Socially Interactive Agents. Such contributions are also widely welcomed and appreciated. 
 IVA 2025 offers the following submission tracks: 
 Full papers: 4 to 8 pages (not including references): | href="https://iva.acm.org/2025/call-for-papers" - https://iva.acm.org/2025/call-for-papers 
 Posters: 2 to 3 pages (not including references): | href="https://iva.acm.org/2025/call-for-scientific-and-artistic-posters-submissions-2/" - https://iva.acm.org/2025/call-for-posters 
 Demo & Artwork: 2 pages + visuals: | href="https://iva.acm.org/2025/call-for-demos/" - https://iva.acm.org/2025/call-for-demos 
 All submissions will be double-blind peer-reviewed by expert reviewers. All accepted full-paper submissions will be presented orally and published in the proceedings. 
 Interdisciplinary Format 
 IVA is a highly interdisciplinary conference that recognizes varying publication norms across disciplines. For instance, conference publications are standard in Computer Science, while journal publications prevail in Psychology. To promote trans-disciplinary interaction, authors can decide whether their accepted full paper with the supplemental material will be included in the ACM Digital Library or not. 
 SCOPE AND LIST OF TOPICS 
 IVA invites submissions on a broad range of topics, including but not limited to: 
 Agent design and modeling of: 
 Cognition 
 Emotion (including personality and cultural differences) 
 Socially communicative behavior (e.g., of emotions, personality traits) 
 Conversational behavior 
 Social perception 
 Machine learning approaches to agent modeling 
 Approaches to realizing adaptive behavior 
 Models informed by theoretical and empirical research in psychology 
 Multimodal interaction: 
 Verbal and nonverbal behavior coordination 
 Face-to-face communication skills 
 Engagement 
 Managing co-presence and interpersonal relation 
 Multi-party interaction 
 Data-driven multimodal modeling 
 Social agent architectures: 
 Design criteria and design methodologies 
 Engineering of real-time human-agent interaction 
 Standards / measures to support interoperability 
 Portability and reuse 
 Specialized tools, toolkits and toolchains 
 Evaluation methods and studies: 
 Evaluation methodologies and user studies 
 Ethical considerations and societal impact 
 Applicable lessons across fields (e.g. between robotics and virtual agents) 
 Social agents as a means to study and model human behavior 
 Applications 
 Applications in education, skills training, health, counseling, games, art, etc. 
 Virtual agents in games and simulations 
 Social agents as tools in psychology 
 Migration of agents between platforms 
 Note: IVA 2025 will as usual have workshops/tutorials and a doctoral consortium. Details on submissions can be found at the web site:href="https://iva.acm.org/2025/" - https://iva.acm.org/2025/
