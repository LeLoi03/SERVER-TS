 28th International Conference on Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures 
 General Information 
 FoSSaCS seeks original papers on foundational research with a clear significance for software science. 
 The conference invites submissions on theories and methods to support the analysis, integration, synthesis transformation, and verification of programs and software systems. The specific topics covered by the conference include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 categorical models and logics; 
 language theory, automata, and games; 
 modal, spatial, and temporal logics; 
 type theory and proof theory; 
 concurrency theory and process calculi; 
 rewriting theory; 
 semantics of programming languages; 
 program analysis, correctness, transformation, and verification; 
 logics of programming; 
 software specification and refinement; 
 models of concurrent, reactive, stochastic, distributed, hybrid, and mobile systems; 
 emerging models of computation; 
 logical aspects of computational complexity; 
 models of software security; 
 logical foundations of data bases 
 Paper Submission 
 href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fossacs2025" - Submit paper
FoSSaCS solicits just a single paper category—research papers. The page limit is 18 ppexcluding references, respecting the Springer’s LNCS format at the submission time. Additional material (no page limit) can be placed in a clearly marked appendix, at the end of the paper. 
 PC submissions are not allowed. 
 The important dates are available in thehref="/2025/cfp" - Joint Call for Papers
. 
 The papers can be submittedhref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fossacs2025" - here
. 
 Artifact Evaluation 
 FoSSaCS 2025 will have a post-paper-acceptance voluntary artifact evaluation. Authors will be encouraged to submit artifacts for evaluation after paper notification. The outcome will not alter the paper’s acceptance decision. 
 For more information about FoSSaCS artifact evaluation, please contactOndřej Lengál.
