 INTRODUCTION 
 In Bologna you will find themost ancient University of the world, founded in 1088, and nowadays ranked amongst the most important and influencing European academic institutions. 
 In this charming medieval city you will also find athriving scientific environment, where research on AI is conducted side by side to public bodies (CINECA Consortium hosts the largest Italian computing center for Big Data; the EU chose the data center of the European Center for Weather Forecast), and to the private initiative (the region has the largest number of startup companies per inhabitant in Italy). 
 Many researchers are already exploiting AI to solve a plethora of sustainability-related issues. 
 We strongly believe that AI will be the key to also understand the sustainability theme in a holistic manner, helping us to reach some awareness over the complexities of our planet, our ecosystems, and our societies. 
 The conference will be supported by theEuropean Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI)and theItalian Association for Artificial Intelligence (AIxIA). 
 We are eager to meet you in Bologna, to know your ideas and views over AI, to share knowledge and to enjoy together some unforgettable moments.

 Call for Papers 
 CALL FOR MAIN TRACK PAPERS 
 We invite all members of the international AI research community to submit their best work to the 28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2025), which will take place in the historic city of Bologna from October 25 to 30, 2025. 
 We welcome submissions on all aspects of AI. Submissions will be subject to double-blind peer review by the programme committee. They will be evaluated based on relevance, clarity, significance, originality, soundness, reproducibility, scholarship, and quality of presentation. 
 The conference is planned as an in-person event. Each accepted paper will get assigned either an oral presentation slot or a combined poster/spotlight presentation slot. The presentation modality is not intended to reflect perceived scientific quality of the paper, so this assignment will be made in a randomised fashion (subject to programme constraints). 
 TOPICS 
 Submissions on all aspects of AI are welcome. This includes in particular: 
 Computer Vision 
 Constraints and Satisfiability 
 Data Mining 
 Fairness, Ethics, and Trust 
 Game Theory and Economic Paradigms 
 Humans and AI 
 Intelligent Robotics 
 Knowledge Representation and Reasoning 
 Machine Learning 
 Multiagent Systems 
 Natural Language Processing 
 Planning and Search 
 Uncertainty in AI 
 Multidisciplinary Topics 
 IMPORTANT DATES 
 Submission site opening: | Thursday, 10 April 2025 
 Abstract deadline: | Tuesday, 29 April 2025 
 Paper deadline: | Tuesday, 6 May 2025 
 Rebuttal period: | Monday-Wednesday 23-25 June 2025 (72 hours) 
 Author notification: | Thursday, 10 July 2025 
 Early registration deadline: | TBC 
 Camera-ready deadline: | Tuesday, 26 August 2025 
 All deadlines are at the end of the day specified, anywhere on Earth (UTC-12). 
 Author requests to formally withdraw a paper from review might take up to one week to process and might not be honoured at all if received after 25 June 2025. 
 ETHICS STATEMENT 
 Research reported at ECAI should avoid harm, be honest and trustworthy, fair and non-discriminatory, and respect privacy and intellectual property. Where relevant, authors can include in the main body of their paper, or on the reference page, a short ethics statement that addresses ethical issues regarding the research being reported and the broader ethical impact of the work. 
 Reviewers will be asked to flag possible violations of relevant ethical principles. Such flagged submissions will be reviewed by a senior member of the programme committee. 
 Authors may be required to revise their paper to include a discussion of possible ethical concerns and their mitigation. 
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS 
 Papers must be written in English, be prepared for double-blind review using the ECAI LaTeX template, and not exceed 7 pages (plus at most 1 extra page for references). 
 href="https://ecai2025.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ecai-template.zip" - ECAI LaTeX Template
Update on April 1, 2025: The README file in the LaTex package has been updated to include the current contact details in case there are issues. All other files (in particular, theecai.clsfile) remain the same. 
 Excessive use of typesetting tricks to make things fit is not permitted. Please do not modify the style files or layout parameters. 
 Registering an abstract of your paper (of around 100-300 words in plain text) is required in advance of the paper submission deadline and you will be asked to provide additional information (such as keywords) at that time. Please do not leave things to the very last moment; you can resubmit any number of times until the submission deadline. 
 The submission website is:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecai20250" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecai20250
. 
 SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL 
 You have the option to accompany your submission with supplementary material, such as a technical appendix or code and data (up to 50MB). 
 Reviewers will consult supplementary material at their own discretion, and you should not assume that they necessarily will. Make sure that any supplementary material you submit really is supplementary in nature: any information that is essential for understanding or evaluating your paper must be included in the paper itself. You of course must ensure that your supplementary material does not compromise the anonymity of your submission. 
 We will not publish your supplementary material. Nevertheless, if your paper gets accepted, then the readers of your published paper should have access to the same information as the reviewers of your submission. So you should make your (suitably revised) supplementary material openly available in archival form at the time of publication of your paper, and you should include a reference to the supplementary material in the camera-ready copy of your paper. For code or data you may wish to use a service such asZenodo. For a technical appendix you may wish to use an archival preprint server such asarXiv. 
 RESUBMISSION FROM OTHER CONFERENCES 
 If an earlier version of your paper was rejected from another conference with archival proceedings and double-blind reviewing during the 12 months preceding the submission deadline (such as ECAI-2024, AAAI-2025, or IJCAI-2025), you can supplement your submission with a document detailing how you have taken the reviews received into account to improve your paper. 
 This document must be a single PDF consisting of the following three parts: 
 A cover letter, of at most one page, in which you summarise your response to the reviews received and how you have changed your paper since then. 
 All reviews, including the metareview (if any), in anonymised form (but otherwise unedited). A screenshot from the submission system will usually work best. 
 An unedited copy of the earlier submission. 
 This is entirely voluntary. Do it if you feel it would help reviewers to better appreciate your work. You can include documentation for at most one conference. The document you provide will be shared with your reviewers at the start of the reviewing process. 
 POLICIES 
 ECAI subscribes to thehref="https://allea.org/code-of-conduct/" - European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity
. By submitting to ECAI you confirm that you are aware of and accept the following specific policies: 
 Originality: | Submissions must not have substantial overlap in either contribution or text with work previously accepted for publication as a full paper in another archival forum. Papers at workshops without archival proceedings and preprints are fine. 
 Concurrent submission: | We recognise the significant strain on the scientific community caused by the needs of peer review. Therefore, the work you submit must not be under review elsewhere at any time between submission and notification. 
 Anonymity: | Reviewing for ECAI is double-blind, meaning that reviewers should not be aware of the identity of the authors of the papers they review. As an author you must make a reasonable effort to ensure that this is possible. Specifically, use the “doubleblind” option of the LaTeX template and do not include any acknowledgements in your submission. Cite your own prior work where appropriate, but do so in the third rather than the first person (that is, write, for instance, “Turing et al. [42] have shown …” rather than “We have shown … [42]”). 
 Links: | Papers must not include pointers to supplementary material on the web, not even when that supplementary material has been fully anonymised, as we would be unable to ensure that it remains unaltered throughout the reviewing period. 
 Social media: | Actively promoting a paper on social media channels while it is undergoing double-blind review is discouraged. 
 Reproducibility: | Reviewers will be instructed to pay close attention to reproducibility of results where appropriate and you should submit relevant code and data as supplementary material whenever feasible. 
 Information sharing: | Submissions will be treated confidentially. However, papers, author information, and reviews may be shared with the organisers of other AI conferences to identify duplicate submissions and to limit duplicate reviewing efforts. 
 Abstracts: | Abstracts are central for the assignment of reviewers. Therefore, they must not be altered in any significant way after the abstract submission deadline. In particular, submitting “placeholder abstracts” is not admissible. 
 Authorship: | All individuals, and only those, who have made significant contributions to a paper should be listed as authors in the submission system. We will not permit adding or removing authors to a paper after the submission deadline. Please also ensure that the order of authors is correct at submission time. 
 Submission limit: | No individual may be listed as an author for more than 8 separate submissions to ECAI. 
 Generative AI: | The use of AI systems to generate text for inclusion in an ECAI submission is only allowed if its role is properly documented in the manuscript (e.g., when reporting on experiments on such systems). However, the use of AI-powered systems to assist with the polishing of human-authored text is permissible. 
 Attendance: | At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference by the early registration deadline with the intention of presenting the paper at the conference. This is a prerequisite for inclusion in the proceedings. 
 Reviewing: | Authors may be called upon to help with reviewing papers for ECAI. This does not apply to individuals who already are serving on the PC or who are not yet qualified to serve on the PC (such as students). Waivers will be granted in exceptional circumstances (such as parental leave).
