 The International Conference on the Theory and Application of Diagrams 
 Diagrams is a biannual, international and interdisciplinary conference series, covering all aspects of research on the theory and application of diagrams. 
 Recent technological advances have enabled the large-scale adoption of diagrams in a diverse range of areas. Increasingly sophisticated visual representations are emerging and, to enable effective communication, insight is required into how diagrams are used and when they are appropriate for use. The pervasive, everyday use of diagrams for communicating information and ideas serves to illustrate the importance of providing a sound understanding of the role that diagrams can, and do, play. Research in the field of diagrams aims to improve our understanding of the role of diagrams, sketches and other visualisations in communication, computation, cognition, creative thought, and problem solving. These concerns have triggered a surge of interest in the study of diagrams. 
 The study of diagrammatic communication as a whole must be pursued as an interdisciplinary endeavour. Diagrams attracts a large number of researchers from virtually all related fields, placing the conference as a major international event in the area. 
 Diagrams is the only conference that provides a united forum for all areas that are concerned with the study of diagrams: for example, architecture, artificial intelligence, cartography, cognitive science, computer science, education, graphic design, history of science, human-computer interaction, linguistics, logic, mathematics, philosophy, psychology, and software modelling.

 NewsletterDonateLearn about Bowen Theory 
 Dr. Murray Bowen, a psychiatrist, originated his theory and its eight interlocking concepts. He formulated the theory by using systems thinking to integrate knowledge of the human as a product of evolution with knowledge from family research. A core assumption is that an emotional system that evolved over several billion years governs human relationship systems. People have a “thinking brain,” language, a complex psychology and culture, but they still do all the ordinary things that other forms of life do. The emotional system affects most human activity and is the principal driving force in the development of clinical problems. Knowledge of how the emotional system operates in one’s family, work, and social systems offers new, more effective options for solving problems in each of these areas. 
 On this page are resources to help you learn more about Bowen theory. InThe Eight Concepts of Bowen Theory, Michael E. Kerr, Director Emeritus of the Bowen Center, uses the experiences of a fictional family to illustrate and explain each concept. The contents of these pages are also available for sale ashard-copyorPDF publications, under the titleOne Family’s Story, For translations in other languages, please go to thePublicationspage.

 Bowen Theory Videos 
 Below are introductory videos describing the basic theoretical concepts of Bowen theory. These materials have recently been made available for free to make it easier for both new and old students to develop a basic conceptual foundation for what it means to see the family as an emotional unit.

 Tool: Family Diagram 
 Murray Bowen, MD, developed and usedhref="/family-diagram" - family diagrams
in his own research, in clinical practice, and in training other professionals. A family diagram is a graphic depiction of facts of functioning over several generations. It is a tool for seeing the family as an emotional system, for recognizing patterns of reactivity that govern the lives of family members, and for observing the family as it adapts to circumstances of life.

 Solid Self and a Gay Man's Identity 
 Kent Webb, LCSW, PCC 
 This presentation and the clinical cases shown will identify and illustrate the process of a gay man’s identity formation. Specifically, the process will be viewed from evolutionary, ecological, and Bowen theory perspectives. A description of how one lives life with a gay identity that automatically is impacted by the concept of differentiation and the corresponding construct of solid self—pseudo-self formation is provided.
