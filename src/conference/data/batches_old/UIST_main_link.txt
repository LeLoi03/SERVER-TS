Submission Formatting Guidelines for UIST 2025 
 We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format, but will accept papers for review as either 1- or 2-column paper format if you are authoring in Word. The rationale for strongly recommending a 2-column format is that reviewers have generally expressed a strong preference for printing and reading PDFs in a two-column format. Additionally, the PDFs that appear in the digital library are ultimately two-column. However, as we do use the TAPS workflow, we understand that Word users may want to utilize the single-column template. 
 Your submission must be original. UIST only accepts original submissions. This means that your submission cannot have been published in another peer-reviewed venue or be under concurrent review at another peer-reviewed venue. Similarly, if you make multiple submissions to UIST 2025 Papers, their contributions must be distinct & self-contained from each other. Please refer to thehref="/2025/author-guide/" - author guide
for details. Additionally, authors should avoid generating content using AI-agents (e.g., LLMs such as ChatGPT or similar), but the usage of these tools isallowed for editing and checking the author’s own text.Revised Papers from Prior Submissions:To ensure consistency of the review process, we encourage authors of previously rejected papers to upload the prior version of the paper, corresponding reviews, and summary of changes from the last round of submission as part of the UIST 2025 paper submission process. 
 Submission Information 
 Submission Platform 
 All required materials must be submitted electronically to | PCS | by the abstract and paper deadline. 
 In PCS, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select “SIGCHI”, “UIST 2025” and “UIST 2025 Papers”, respectively, and press “Go.” This track will be opened a few weeks before the submission deadline. 
 Submission Format and Length 
 Required Paper PDF and source files 
 We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow | . 
 For | LaTeX authors | , submissions are strongly recommended to be in the | double-column format | ( | href="/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf" - example PDF | ) using | \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} | . (please use the | downloadable LaTex template | or the | Overleaf template | ). 
 For | Word authors | , submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( | href="/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx" - submission template | , | href="/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf" - example PDF | ) or the single-column template ( | href="/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.docx" - submission template | , | href="/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.pdf" - example PDF | ). 
 UIST papers are of variable length. Paper length must be based on the weight of the contribution. A new idea presented in a compact format is more likely to be accepted than the same idea in a long format, and shorter, more focused papers are encouraged. As a guideline, consider | Short Papers | being submissions of 5,000 words or less. 
 Standard Length Papers | being submissions between 5,000 and 12,000 words are considered standard length (about 7,000-8,000 words on average). 
 References | and | appendices | are excluded from the word count. 
 Size: < | 20 MB | (compressed PDF files are encouraged during submission) 
 Please make | appendices as separate PDF files | and upload them as supplementary materials instead of including them as a subsection at the end of the original paper manuscript. 
 Accompanying Video 
 Optional, but highly encouraged 
 Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec 
 No more than 5 minutes long 
 Size: < 250 MB 
 Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
 Maximum File Size 
 Maximum total size for all files < 300 MB 
 Anonymity 
 Anonymous, i.e. authors must remove their names and affiliations throughout all submission materials (paper, videos, supplementary material) | href="/2025/author-guide/#anonymity" - (anonymity policy ) 
 Discuss your own prior work in 3rd person and include a full reference with names. 
 Selection Process 
 Refereed, i.e. the program committee and two external reviewers will review submitted papers 
 Publication 
 Archival, i.e. accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed in digital form to conference attendees 
 Quick rejection / Desk rejection policy 
 Papers, where the length is incommensurate with contribution or the stated length of the submission (i.e., short paper vs. standard length papers), will be desk rejected. | Submissions of more than 5,000 words for short papers or 12,000 words for standard papers will be desk rejected if their length is not justified. In very exceptional cases, such submissions may be considered for full review, but authors must provide clear and strong justification for why submissions are required to be longer than the word limit. 
 Anonymization Policy. | Authors are expected to anonymize their identities in the body of the paper but leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. Authors are required to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], …” and use instead “As described by Chetty et al. [10], …”. Papers that violate the anonymization policy by | explicitly and unequivocally identifying the authors | (i.e., beyond allowing the reviewers to simply "guess"), including within the supplemental materials or external links to datasets, code repositories, etc., will be desk rejected. Any supplementary material (including the video) should also adhere to the anonymity rule. 
 Your submission must be original; it cannot be published or under concurrent review elsewhere. | If you have any concurrent submissions to UIST or other venues that are closely related | – i.e., are based on the same study, artifact, or dataset – | you must include an anonymized version of that submission to the concurrent submissions field. | Failure to do so will result in desk rejection. Please see | href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions" - ACM guide on prior and simultaneous submissions | . 
 Research Quality and Lack of Relevant Context: | Papers must include sufficient detail for reviewers to evaluate research quality according to the norms and expectations of the UIST community. Papers should demonstrate clear connections to existing research literature in HCI and related fields, showing how the work builds upon or relates to prior work. | Papers that lack adequate methodological details for proper evaluation, or that fail to engage with relevant prior research, may be desk rejected. 
 Your paper must be stand alone. Authors are encouraged to provide supplementary materials to support practices around research reproducibility as much as possible, however all important information to understand the contributions of your work must be in the main paper PDF. | Heavy reliance on appendices and/or supplementary materials can be a ground for rejection including desk rejection. 
 Please ensure that you use the correct template and correct formatting of references. | We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format, but will accept papers for review in either 1- or 2-column paper format if you are authoring in Word. Use of other templates or formats, including different citation styles, may result in desk rejection. 
 Final Publication Format 
 As required by the TAPS workflow, camera-ready manuscripts of all papers that have been accepted must be submitted in the formats listed below for final publication in the ACM Digital Library. 
 For | LaTeX authors | , your source files will be used to auto-generate (1) a double-column PDF ( | href="/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf" - example PDF | ), and (2) an accessible and responsive webpage ( | example HTML | ) that will be placed in the Digital Library. 
 For | Word authors | , you will need to submit your paper in | single-column format | to correctly auto-generate (1) a double-column PDF ( | href="/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf" - example PDF | ), and (2) an accessible and responsive webpage ( | example HTML | ) in the Digital Library. 
 Presentation Format 
 Talk at the conference delivered by one or more authors of the paper 
 Video Preview 
 Video previews are mandatory. 
 Recommended resolution: 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec 
 Length: 30 seconds 
 Size: < 150 MB 
 Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file 
 Please see the | href="/2025/video-guide" - video guide | for more information on producing a video preview. 
 We strongly recommend that authors make their videos accessible through following the guidelines under | href="/2025/accessibility" - Making Video Figures Accessible | . 
 Demo Fast Track 
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to participate in the UIST demo session. Details about this special/fast track of demos will be found on the | demo | page. 
 Please note that a | DOI will not be provided for invited demo papers. | Authors interested in having a DOI for their demo paper should consider submitting to the regular demo track. 
 Additional Notes 
 Accessibility: | Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. To this end, we allow 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline to provide alt-text for all figures and tables and upload video subtitles to make your optional video accessible. Allowing additional time for your paper and video submissions to be accessible will help increase the quality of the conference overall and enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. If the authors have difficulties with making their submission materials accessible, they are encouraged to contact the UIST 2025 Accessibility Chairs by emailing | href="mailto:accessibility2025@uist.org" - accessibility2025@uist.org | and volunteers with questions or for assistance to ensure that all accessible materials are submitted by the deadline. We strongly recommend that authors read the | href="https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/" - SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission | which describes the process to make a paper submission accessible, as well as the | href="https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/videos/" - SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos | , which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning. 
 The | author list | must be complete by the abstract submission deadline. Late author changes (i.e., additions or changes of order) require approval from program chairs and may be declined or might require paper withdrawal. Ensure all authors are listed in the correct order by the abstract deadline. 
 We will continue to put the papers up | publicly | on the ACM DL a week in advance of the conference. 
 Authors may submit a | rebuttal | after the reviews are released. Though the ACs may indicate if the rebuttal is likely to help the paper being accepted (based on reviews and internal discussions), any author may choose to respond. A rebuttal response by Associate Chairs and external reviewers will be enforced by the Program Chairs as much as possible. 
 The | video | has traditionally been due the same day as paper submissions and this has always been stressful. We will allow for 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline for uploading your optional video. 
 Open source | : Our community welcomes open source and encourages the practice of creating software/hardware and sharing it through open-source and public repositories. However, open source is | not | a requirement or prerequisite for acceptance. Open source, as well as many other types of artifacts (e.g., videos, datasets, raw data, appendices), is recommended but completely optional, and will not be used for evaluation criteria. The paper should be evaluated on its own merits, not depending on supporting artifacts that are not submitted by the authors. 
 ACM’s Publication Policies 
 By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to allACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy. 
 Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

 We do not have a strong page limit, but we recommend that authors prepare a manuscript of ~1,500-2,000 words to equate to the double column 2-page length, often 4-5 pages in the single column (plus references). Submissions could be both single-column or double-column format in PDF. | We strongly encourage to use the double-column format. 
  
 Floor Plan 
 The demo submission should include a PDF document describing the envisioned setup and interaction (demo hardware components, tables, chairs, lights, and other equipment) so that organizers get a good understanding of your setup. 
 This will also allow the organizers to better consider your requirements when organizing the demonstration space at the venue.

 Demo abstracts will be included in the ACM digital library as adjunct proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees 
 Presentation Format 
 At least one author is required to be physically present at the conference and present their demo during demo sessions 
 Lab Demos 
 If the authors have multiple demo submissions from the same lab/company, we can group these demos together at the venue. Please indicate the submission IDs of all demos from the same lab on the PCS submission page. 
 Concurrent UIST Poster Submission 
 The same work | cannot | be submitted to both the UIST demo and poster tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as a demo submission and will be rejected from the poster track

 Demos of Accepted UIST 2025 Papers 
 Authors of accepted full papers who also want to present a demomustsubmit an entry into the demos track. They have two choices: | Demos that accompany accepted papers will follow afast-track processwith an abbreviated submission. Although no demo abstract is required, authors are still required to submit a video preview and other relevant data (e.g., title, abstract, floorplan). Demos accompanying full papers will not receive a separate DOI. Note that unlike in previous years, there will be no option for a fast-track submission with a DOI. Authors who wish to have their demo abstract published with a DOI in the proceedings are welcome to submit a full demo submission by the demo track deadline.
