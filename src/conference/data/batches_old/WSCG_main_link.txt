 Workshops and Special Sessions 
 Session: Research Activities and Research Funding 
 The session aims to put together people interested in common research activities leading to the submission of grant proposals to the European Union and NSF (US) or other granting bodies. It would be reasonable to know where to apply and what project profile would suit, including a suggestion of the submitting (main leader) institution. 
 Propose your workshop / special session 
 Send proposal to: WSCGconf@gmail.com Subj. WSCG workshop 
 Submission should contain: Proposer(s) name, affiliation(s), Workshop/Session title, short abstract (max. 250 words) with the motivation and list of related fields (max. 5 keywords), estimated number (but not overestimated) of papers. 
 Organizers (together) can have up to 3 papers within the workshop or 2 papers within the session submissions, but the IPC might require their independent evaluation. 
 The workshop/session organizer is responsible for collecting papers and papers reviewing and accepting decisions. The IPC will have the right to decide whether to accept the final version of the publication. The minimum number of presented papers in a session is 5, for a workshop, the minimum number of presented papers is 8 up to 10.
