 Interconnect Software: You can't touch it but you need itThe latest advancements in photonics, chips, parallel paths, and other cutting-edge interconnect technologies are dazzling. However, the picture is incomplete without the system software needed to exploit their full potential. This edition of Hot Interconnects will explore the underlying software ecosystems that empower interconnect fabrics to support a wide array of applications.

IEEE Hot Interconnects is the premier international forum for researchers and developers of state of the art hardware and software architectures and implementations for interconnection networks of all scales, ranging from multi-core on-chip interconnects to those within systems, clusters, and data centers. Leaders in industry and academia attend the conference to interact with individuals at the forefront of this field. 
 Our objective is to address the data center networking and the supercomputing communities. We hope you can join us and benefit not only by the content but also by the prime networking opportunities this event always offers.

 Paper FormatPermalink 
 This year we invite papers to be submitted either as regular (long) papers (up to 10 pages) or as hot topic papers (up to 4 pages). Hot topic papers could be positional papers, industry papers, or papers describing hot-off-the-press breaking research results and will be judged accordingly and independently from the regular papers. 
 Papers need sufficient technical detail to judge quality and suitability for presentation. Submissions must conform to | href="https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/author-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-policies/" - [IEEE ethics standards] 
 Submissions should include title, author, abstract, and paper in double-column, see | [IEEE format] | for details. 
 Papers will be submitted electronically through | href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=hoti2025" - [EasyChair] | and will undergo a single-blind review process. 
 Regular papers: up to 10 pages (including technical content and figures), excluding references and any appendices. Appendices (if any) are limited to 5 pages (the limit might be extended upon committee approval in advance). Reproducibility appendices are encouraged but no official verification is provided by the HotI program committee. 
 Hot topic papers: up to 4 pages (including technical content and figures) excluding references. Appendices are not allowed for hot topic papers. 
 Materials other than the abstract, main paper body, and references will be read at the committee’s discretion. 
 Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. We plan to invite the best papers for an | [IEEE Micro] | Special issue submission. 
 After a paper is accepted, the authors must follow the conference and | [IEEE CPS guidelines] | in publishing the paper. 
 Safety and Well-beingPermalink 
 Given the success of previous year’s online format, Hot Interconnects 2025 will continue to be an online conference.
