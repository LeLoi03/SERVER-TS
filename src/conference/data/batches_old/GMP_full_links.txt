 International Conference on Geometric Modeling and Processing (GMP 2025) 
 Washington University in St. Louis, May 28-30, 2025 
 GMP is an annual international conference series on geometric modeling, simulation, and computing. The modeling and processing of geometric data is fundamental to many computer applications, including computer graphics, computer vision, CAD/CAM, medical imaging, engineering analysis, robotics, additive manufacturing, and scientific computing. The GMP conference series provides researchers and practitioners with a forum for exchanging new ideas, discussing new applications, and presenting new solutions. GMP is one of the three flagship conferences held byhref="http://www.asiagraphics.org/gmp/" - ASIAGRAPHICS
. 
 GMP 2025 will be held in-person on the beautiful campus ofWashington University in St. Louis. The meeting venue will be located in theMcKelvey School of Engineering.

GMP 2025 will take place in St. Louis, USA, from May 28 to 30, 2025. 
 The organizers of GMP 2025 invite submissions of full-length papers on topics including, but not limited, to: 
 Computational design, manufacturing and 3D printing 
 Computational geometry and topology

All papers will be rigorously peer-reviewed by members of the international program committee of GMP. The review process will be double-blind. Pleasehref="https://sites.wustl.edu/gmp2025/files/2024/09/GMP2025template.zip" - use our LaTeX template
for your submission (expected length is 10 to 15 pages). 
 Submission link:href="https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/GMP_2025" - https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/GMP_2025
Publications 
 The conference proceedings will be published in a special issue of Computer-Aided Geometric Design (CAGD, Elsevier). To meet the high standards of this journal, papers will undergo a two-stage review process. Authors of papers that are determined to be acceptable with minor revisions during the first review cycle will be invited to submit a revised version for the second review cycle. Submissions with strong potential but requiring major revisions will be recommended to Computer-Aided Geometric Design for a fast-track submission process with optional reviewer continuity.

 Winner of the Computer Graphics Forum 2024 Cover Image Contest 
 This image shows the inside of the teaser figure 'fertility' from Polygon Laplacian Made Robust. It visualizes the condition numbers of individual polygon stiffness matrices. The mesh transitions from the input mesh to our result from left to right. The original mesh features disfigured polygons with alarming (yellow) or terrible (magenta) condition numbers. With our tailored smoothing algorithm, polygons become very regular and, combined with our improved polygon Laplacian, result in better condition numbers (blue) and improved robustness in computational simulation. Blender was used to stylize the geometry and render the image.
