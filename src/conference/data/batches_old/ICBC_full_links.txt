The workshop aims to bring researchers and practitioners from across the world together to advance the field of cross-chain technology. 
 Call for Papers 
 We are excited to announce a call for papers for the IEEE ICBC Cross-Chain Workshop 2025. This workshop seeks to gather insights, research, and innovations from experts, academics, and practitioners in the blockchain interoperability domain. We encourage submissions of technical papers (both full and short), that explore the latest developments, challenges, and opportunities in cross-chain technology, including but not limited to the following: 
 Topics of Interest: 
 Cross-chain protocols and mechanisms 
 Cross-chain applications protocols 
 Cross-chain bridges 
 Cross-chain digital asset, cryptocurrency, NFT protocols 
 Cross-chain crypto-economic design 
 Cross-chain function call protocols 
 Cross-chain CBDC protocols 
 Cross-chain MEV design 
 Cross-chain rollups design 
 Cross-chain communication protocols 
 Empirical analysis of cross-chain protocols 
 Modular design and cross-chain architectures 
 Privacy in cross-chain mechanisms 
 Vulnerability, attacks, and mitigation in cross-chain mechanisms 
 Cross-chain organization/information systems requirements 
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS 
 For papers incurring ethical issues, e.g. those involving human participants, personal data, or security/privacy attacks, the Programme Committee expects the ethical considerations to be discussed in the paper and any required ethical approval from an institutional ethical committee to have been in place before submission. 
 Authors are invited to submit original papers, written in English, that have not been published or submitted for publication elsewhere. Technical papers must be formatted using the IEEE 2-column format and not exceeding 8 pages for full papers, 4 pages for short papers, 2 pages for poster papers, or 16 pages for systematisation of knowledge (SoK) papers (all excluding references). The paper submission templates are available on IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings. All papers must be submitted through EDAS via the URLhttps://edas.info/N33471. Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process. 
 All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed using a double-blind review process with a rebuttal period. The paper should be anonymised, such that all identifying information (either explicit or implied – for example, names, affiliations, acknowledge and funding sources) should be removed from the initial submission. The detailed schedule of the procedure is as follows. 
 Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE ICBC proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore.
