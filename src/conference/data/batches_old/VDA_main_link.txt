 Destination 
 Vienna, Austria 
 Vienna impresses with its excellent (meeting) infrastructure, short distances, reliable standards, high service quality and an outstanding range of art and culture. The city combines tradition and modernity - historical flair in a smart and livable city that is constantly evolving. 
 The Austrian capital regularly leads the international livable city rankings - including the Global Liveability Index published by the United Kingdom’s Economist Group, which it topped once again in 2024. In its latest report, the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) awarded the city fourth place in the 2023 ICCA Ranking - Destination Performance Index (DPI), while the Union of International Associations (UIA) ranked Vienna second. 
 There are many more factors that highlight Vienna’s advantages as a meeting destination 
 Getting There 
 Thanks to its central location in the heart of Europe, the city is a hub that offers optimal transport connections to and from destinations all over the world. 
 By Plane 
 TheVienna International Airportis Austria’s largest international airport and very well connected to many international destinations. Vienna Airport serves about 170 destinations in 66 countries through around 60 airlines. The majority of European capitals are two to three hours away by plane. 
 By Train 
 Vienna is fully integrated into the Europeanrail network. Visitors can travel to Vienna from 14 European countries by rail without having to change. There are a total of 20 direct services from all major cities in neighboring Germany alone. The Vienna main train station is connected to the city center by subway. 
 By Bus/Car 
 The international Eurolines long-distance bus routes connect all of Europe to Vienna. The long-distance bus company Flixbus offers bus routes throughout Europe. You will also have a safe journey to Vienna by car on Austria’s excellent network of motorways, expressways and federal highways. As tolls are compulsory on all motorways and expressways in Austria, you will also need a vignette to use Vienna’s city motorways. Parking fees in the short-stay parking zone apply to almost the entire Vienna metropolitan area. 
 Austria Center Vienna 
 VIS 2025 will take place in theAustria Center Vienna, Austria’s largest congress centre. 
 Bruno-Kreisky-Platz 1, 1220 Vienna, Austria

 Onsite Car Parking 
 If driving to the convention center, parking is available but needs to be paid extra. 
 Taxi and Ride Share 
 Taxi and ride shares are generally available. 
 Things to Do in Vienna 
 Vienna scores like no other city worldwide for its exceptional music and cultural offers in concert halls, museums and on the stage - from the Golden Hall at the Musikverein to the renowned Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna, to the Vienna State Opera. Vienna is also known for its love and culture of enjoyment, one that has been developed and sustained in traditional coffee houses and wine taverns over centuries. 
 Walking through Vienna is like traveling back in time to the imperial past - and so it comes as no surprise that the city center has been selected as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In Vienna alone, there are about 30 castles and over 160 palaces. You can discover places of cultural significance on every corner, or you can daydream about the golden imperial age while in a café. 
 Vienna offers an impressive range of art & cultural venues for meetings and events. From historical palaces to modern cultural centers to esteemed concert halls, the vast scope of locations provides an inspiring backdrop to enjoy this fascinating city.
