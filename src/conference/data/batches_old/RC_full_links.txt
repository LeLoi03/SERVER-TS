 Welcome to the 
 17th Conference on Reversible Computation 
 July 3 - July 4, 2025, Odense, Denmark 
 The Conference on Reversible Computation will bring together researchers from computer science, mathematics, engineering, and physics to discuss new developments and directions for future research in the emerging area of Reversible Computation. This particularly includes applications of reversibility in quantum computation. Research papers, tool demonstrations and work-in-progress reports are within the scope of the conference. 
 Previous editions of this event took place as workshops in York (2009), Bremen (2010), Gent (2011), Copenhagen (2012), and as conference in Victoria (2013), Kyoto (2014), Grenoble (2015), Bologna (2016), Kolkata (2017), Leicester (2018), Lausanne (2019), Oslo (2020), Nagoya (2021), Urbino (2022), Giessen (2023), and Toruń (2024).

 Research interests 
 I am mainly interested in formal methods and programming languages for distributed and mobile systems, such as service oriented systems (including microservices and serverless), and for quantum systems. I aim at providing languages, analysis techniques and tools to support the programming of correct concurrent and distributed applications. I am currently active inreversible computing(see also ouroverview book), and in particularreversible debugging of Erlang programs,choreographic programming, and quantum computing.Upcoming events I am involved in
