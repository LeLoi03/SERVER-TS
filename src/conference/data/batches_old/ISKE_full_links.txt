 Welcome to ISKE 2025 
 It is our great pleasure to invite you to submit papers and attend the 20thInternational Conference on Intelligent Systems and Knowledge Engineering (ISKE 2025), which will be held in Shunde, China during November 21-23, 2025. ISKE 2025 is the 20th in a series following the successful previous ISKE Conferences since 2006. ISKE 2025 is organized by Shunde Polytechnic, China. 
 This conference aims to provide a platform for technical and scientific professionals from academia, research and industries in the fields of intelligent systems and knowledge engineering to exchange knowledge and distribute the emerging state-of-the-art technologies. ISKE 2025 accepts submissions that have not been published or submitted in any form elsewhere. Besides technical and research papers, submissions reporting on industrial case studies are also welcome. Accepted papers will be published in a conference proceeding. The proceedings will be submitted for indexing by EI Compendex and Scopus after the conference. Special issues of several SCI indexed journals will be devoted to a strict refereed selection of extended papers.

 Abstract 
 The ubiquity of internet-enabled devices has led to a rapid increase in the use of connected cameras for real-time monitoring, creating a high demand for (automated) visual data analytics across various industries. The prospect of automating visual data analysis to drive positive change involves extracting actionable insights from data that will inform decision-making processes, improving efficiency, and contributing to evidence-based strategies across diverse applications and industries. This research explores and compares well-known semantic segmentation models such as DeepLabV3+ and UNet, determining the best-suited for use in a visual analytics and scene understanding, culminating in a proof of concept program capable of automating video analysis, plotting detections, average trajectories, and identifying outliers.
