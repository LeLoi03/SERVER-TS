 Welcome to HAI 2025 
 The Thirteenth International Conference on 
 Human-Agent Interaction. 
 Yokohama, Japan, November 10-13, 2025. 
 Call for Papers 
 The 13th International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction (HAI 2025) aims to be a major interdisciplinary forum for discussing and disseminating the latest research and results that have an impact beyond the boundaries of conventional interaction, including robots, software agents, and human-to-human communication via digital media. HAI brings together researchers from fields such as engineering, computer science, psychology, and sociology, and covers a wide range of topics, including human-robot interaction, affective computing, computer-supported cooperative work, games and serious games, and artificial intelligence, among others. This conference is held in cooperation with ACM. 
 The theme of HAI 2025 is “Interaction and Imagination”. With the development of generative AI, many agent systems have been proposed, and the methodology of human-agent interaction is at the stage of being implemented in society. At this stage, we believe it is necessary to re-examine the new future of human society that human-agent interaction will bring, from interaction to imagination. We welcome all submissions related to HAI, but especially encourage submissions that align with the theme of HAI 2025. The HAI conference welcomes submissions from a wide range of fields, including engineering, computer science, psychology, sociology, cognitive science, business, marketing, and design. 
 Topics include, but are not limited to: 
 studies of Human-Agent Interaction, with quantitative/qualitative results 
 theoretical models 
 technological advances 
 experimental methods 
 impacts of embodiment 
 character and avatar design 
 agents in applications, e.g. self-driving cars, social networks 
 agents in business and marking 
 experience design 
 Autonomous and adaptive agents/systems 
 Important Dates

 Submission Instruction 
 Format 
 HAI 2025 will accept only online submissions of PDF files (no MS Word, Latex, etc.). All submissions will be reviewed by three reviewers and will receive a meta review for quality assurance. The paper will be evaluated on the basis of research originality, excellence, and significance, and relevance to HAI. We also invite position papers, preliminary (but high impact) studies, and concept papers. 
 All papers need to be in the ACM SIGCHI format. Please visit the submission page at the HAI 2025 Web site to prepare and submit your papers. All accepted papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library. 
 Anonymization 
 All submissions should be anonymized. Please remove all author information, including references to your own work and institutions. If references must be made, make them in the third person. If a person appears in an image who may be recognized as an author, please blur their face. If possible, please list your paper number (assigned by the submission system) in your paper instead of your name. 
 HAI2025 uses double-blind review, which means that the reviewers cannot identify the authors of the assigned papers, and the authors cannot identify the reviewers. 
 Details 
 HAI2025 does not allow duplicate submission. These papers will be automatically rejected without further review. 
 Authors may upload their papers to preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before submission. It will not result in rejection. However, the authors should anonymize their submission because HAI2025 uses a double-blind review. We instruct reviewers not actively to find such preprint servers, but encountering them will not constitute a reason for rejection. 
 Posters 
 We invite researchers to submit posters to be displayed during the poster session of the HAI 2025 conference, which will be held in Yokohama, Japan from 10 to 13 November. We seek contributions from a broad range of disciplines such as engineering, computer science, psychology, sociology, cognitive science, business, advertising/marketing and design. 
 Please submit an anonymised version of your work; all references to the authors, the research institute, and other identifying information should be removed for the first submission. Paper Length: up to 2 pages (excluding references). All papers MUST be in the ACM Conference Paper format; be sure to leave the ACM copyright area blank. This area will be changed in accordance with the ACM publication process (including conference name, ISSN, etc.). 
 Please note that in submitting their work, authors automatically commit to be a reviewer for the poster submissions. Authors will be asked to indicate their area(s) of expertise when submitting their work and may be asked to serve as a reviewer for posters that fall into their area. 
 All poster submissions will be reviewed by at least two reviewers, who will be composed of other authors and PC members, for quality assurance. Posters will be evaluated based on research originality, significance, and relevance to HAI. 
 Authors of accepted posters are required to show their work as a poster during the poster session (either virtual or in person). Please note that your poster must be no larger than an A0. 
 Workshops/Tutorials Submission Guidelines 
 We invite proposals for workshops and tutorials to be held at the HAI 2025 Conference in Yokohama, Japan, Nov. 10-13, 2025. The workshop and tutorial sessions aim to provide an opportunity to discuss current and emergent topics on Human-Agent Interaction. The HAI conference seeks relevant proposals from a broad range of disciplines such as engineering, computer science, psychology, sociology, cognitive science, business, advertising/marketing and design. 
 Topics of workshops/tutorials include, but are not limited to: 
 specific application areas for HAI 
 technological advances in HAI 
 experimental methods for the evaluation of HAI 
 impacts of embodiment 
 character and avatar design 
 agents in social networks 
 agents in computer games 
 affective computing 
 specific applications for agents in retail, business and marketing 
 experience design 
 We welcome both full and half day workshops and tutorials that bridge the gap between theoretical advances and innovative applications of Human-Agent Interaction. 
 Please note:Tutorials are conceptually different to workshops. Tutorials are given by expert instructors, typically with established reputations, teaching people new to a topic. Workshops are meetings of experts exploring new knowledge. 
 Submission Guidelines and Format 
 Workshop and tutorial proposals will be reviewed by the track chairs and will be assessed based on their relevance, quality, and interests to the community. Each proposals should outline the following in their proposals: 
 Title 
 Overview 
 Goals and Objectives 
 Workshop/Tutorial Structure 
 Expected Outcomes 
 Expected Audience and Call for Papers plan 
 Any special requirements needed regarding the logistics (e.g. poster stands, more than one projector), if applicable.
