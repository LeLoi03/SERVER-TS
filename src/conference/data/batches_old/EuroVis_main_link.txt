 ABOUT LUXEMBOURG 
 Welcome to EuroVis 2025 
 The 27th edition of EuroVis will take place in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, and will be hosted by the Visualization and Interaction Group (VISINT) of theLuxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST). 
 EuroVis is the premier annual conference organized by theEurographics Working Group on Data Visualization. 
 Since its inception in 1999 as a symposium, and its elevation to a full conference in 2012, EuroVis has grown to become one of the leading platforms for advancing visualization research and applications across Europe. 
 As a dynamic and rapidly evolving field, visualization plays a critical role in addressing one of today’s most pressing challenges: transforming vast amounts of raw data into meaningful insights. While data collection and storage capabilities have advanced exponentially, our capacity to derive actionable knowledge from this information lags behind. Visualization bridges this gap by utilizing the power of the human visual system, combined with advanced computer graphics, to offer intuitive exploration, analysis, and communication of complex data. 
 EuroVis 2025 aims to foster collaboration between visualization researchers and practitioners from across disciplines. The conference provides a unique platform for sharing groundbreaking research, building networks, and inspiring new research directions. With its broadened scope to encompass all areas of data visualization, EuroVis continues to expand its impact both within Europe and globally. 
 The main conference will be preceded by a series of co-located workshops and events, which will be held on June 2, 2025, at the same venue. 
 Join us for an enriching and inspiring experience in the heart of Luxembourg City!

 USEFULL INFORMATIONS & GUIDELINES 
 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS 
 The maximum length for submitted papers to the full papers track is 10 pages (in Computer Graphics Forum (CGF) style, including all images and acknowledgements, but excluding references). 
 References should not exceed 2 pages. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content. Papers exceeding the maximum allowed number of pages will be automatically rejected. 
 Submissions must be made using the Computer Graphics Forum style, using the conference LaTeX template for full papershref="https://www.eurovis2025.lu/fileadmin/files/egPublStyle-EuroVis_full-short-stars-posters-edu_2025.zip" - https://www.eurovis2025.lu/fileadmin/files/egPublStyle-EuroVis_full-short-stars-posters-edu_2025.zip
) which includes a sample document explaining the required format LaTeX2e Style template. 
 Authors have the option to submit their papers anonymously. In contrast to previous years, double-blind reviewing is optional, not required: authors may choose to disclose their identities to the reviewers. The reviewing process does not consider anonymity as a factor. The process will attempt to preserve anonymity of authors of anonymized submissions. However, the program committee, which is responsible for half of the reviews, will know the authors of submissions reviewed by them. This is required for selecting reviewers without conflict of interests. Please take note that submissions may be checked for plagiarism. 
 Authors have the option of submitting additional material with their submissions. Supplementary materials, such as videos and supporting data, are encouraged. For papers that have previously been reviewed for other venues and have been rejected or withdrawn, the authors are strongly encouraged to provide the original submission with a cover letter describing the changes they have made to comply with reviewers' comments and requests. 
 All full papers accepted to EuroVis appear in a special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, containing the conference proceedings, and will appear at the same time in the Eurographics digital library. 
 EuroVis submissions and papers are subject to the pre-print and self-archiving policies of the Computer Graphics Forum journal. Details are available from the journal web site: 
 href="https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/preprints-policy.html" - https://authorservices.wiley.com/author-resources/Journal-Authors/open-access/preprints-policy.html
PLAN S COMPLIANCE 
 EuroVis publishes all its material in the Eurographics Digital Library, and some material also in cooperation with Wiley Computer Graphics Forum (Full Papers, STAR Reports). The Eurographics Publication Board, Eurovis Steering Committee, and Eurovis Full Paper Chairs are aware of these questions, and state the following: 
 Publishing in the Eurographics Digital Library is Plan-S compliant. 
 Publishing with Wiley Computer Graphics Forum is Plan-S compliant in many cases, due to so-called transformational agreements between Wiley and national funding agencies and/or universities. In case of questions for clarification, please contact plan-S@eurovis.org and we will help to find a solution. We look forward very much to receiving your work for EuroVis 
 USAGE OF AI 
 The use of generative AI tools is prohibited for authors to generate their text. The only use is allowed for grammar/English corrections or rephrasing.

 Submission of an abstract is mandatory by the abstract deadline, with completed papers due on by the full paper deadline. Submissions will not be accepted if an abstract is not submitted by the abstract deadline. Abstract submissions require the title, authors, paper type, abstract, and keywords in the form. The paper title and authors may not be changed after the abstract deadline. The remaining fields (the document, additional material) are submitted by the full paper deadline.
