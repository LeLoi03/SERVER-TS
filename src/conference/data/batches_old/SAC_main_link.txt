 ACM's Key Policies | Privacy Policy 
 Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct 
 Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities | In participating SAC 2025, you acknowledge ACM's Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities and agree that behavior such as the following will constitute grounds for actions against you: | Abusive action directed at an individual, such as threats, intimidation, or bullying 
 Racism, homophobia, or other behavior that discriminates against a group or class of people 
 Sexual harassment of any kind, such as unwelcome sexual advances or words/actions of a sexual nature | If you are involved in or witness any such incident, please inform the event organizers. 
 SAC No-Show Policy | Paper registration is mandatory to include papers and posters in the conference proceedings. An author or a proxy attending SAC MUST present the paper. This requirement applies to all accepted papers, posters, and invited SRC submissions for inclusion in the ACM digital library. In case of personal circumstances preventing physical attendance, online presentation is allowed, ensuring the paper's inclusion in the ACM digital library. 
 Copyright Notice | As instructed in the author kit authors will receive an email from ACM that contains info on how to complete and submit the copyright. The email from ACM contains a link to the copyright webpage where authors will need to check the title and author names of their paper, correct them if wrong and then submit the completed copyright form to the ACM system by clicking a submit button. Authors need to upload the final camera-ready copies (papers, posters, and SRC abstracts) to the submission system so that they are verified for inclusion in the proceedings.

CALL FOR PAPERS 
 
https://www.sigapp.org/sac/sac2025/ 
 
 
 
The  ACM  Symposium  on  Applied  Computing  (SAC)  has  been  a  primary  gathering  forum  for  applied  computer  scientists, 
computer  engineers,  software  engineers,  and  application  developers from around  the  world. The  technical  track  on  Intelligent 
Robotics and Multi-Agent Systems (IRMAS) will be organized for the eleventh time in SAC 2025, exploiting the inherent synergy 
between Robotics and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), thus aiming to bring together these highly related and exciting research fields. 
Robotics  is  a  multidisciplinary research area  that  presents  an  enormous  potential. It  concerns  developing  intelligent  robotic 
systems  that  are  capable  of  making  decisions  and  acting  autonomously  in  real  and  unpredictable  environments to  accomplish 
tasks  and  assist  humans  in  relevant  application  domains  for  society.  Several  complex  problems  require  the  use  of  teams  of 
cooperative robots that share the same challenges studied in MAS. 
MAS are groups of intelligent agents that can perceive and act in a given environment to achieve their individual and collective 
goals. MAS enable solving problems that are beyond the individual capabilities and knowledge of single agents, not suffering from 
resource limitations, performance bottlenecks, or critical failures usually found in centralized problem solvers. Multi-robot systems 
are often used to evaluate and validate MAS with physical robot platforms. 
For  many  years,  Robotics  and  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI) researchers  have  worked  separately  in  these  fields,  both  fields  have 
matured enormously, and there has been a growing interest in getting the two fields together. Many in Robotics believe that the 
focus in the near future should be adding capabilities to robots that lie at the core of AI research. Reciprocally, AI researchers aim 
at  embedding  their  techniques  in  physical  robots  that  can  perceive,  reason  and  act  in  real,  dynamic  physical  environments. 
Despite this mutual interest, although there are many conferences focusing either on Robotics or AI separately, there is still a lack 
of scientific venues where both communities can meet. The purpose of the IRMAS track is therefore to provide a venue to exploit 
synergies  between Robotics  and  AI,  more  precisely  between Intelligent Robotics  and  MAS, bringing  together  researchers  from 
both  fields to  share  experiences,  expose  issues,  and  discuss  about  these  exciting  fields. Papers  that make  fundamental 
contributions in either of these two areas are welcome, and research that spans both areas is especially encouraged. Accepted 
papers will be included in the ACM SAC 2025 proceedings and published in the ACM digital library, being indexed by Thomson 
ISI Web of Knowledge and Scopus. Top-quality papers will be possibly invited after the conference for submission, in extended 
form, to a special issue of an ISI indexed journal.

Important Dates 
October 13, 2024 : Paper submission    (deadline extended – final deadline) 
November 20, 2024 : Author notification 
November 29, 2024 : Camera-ready copies 
 
Original papers addressing any of the listed topics of interest (or related topics) will be considered. Each submitted paper will be 
fully  refereed  and  undergo  a  blind  review  process  by  at  least  three  referees.  Paper  size  is  limited  to 8 pages.  A  maximum  of  2 
additional pages may be included for an additional fee. The reviews will be double-blind: authors’ names and affiliations must not 
appear in the paper, self-citations should be in the third person, and authors must avoid disclosing their identity by any means. 
For accepted papers, registration for the conference is required by at least one of the authors or a proxy, who must attend SAC 
and present the paper in person. This is a strict requirement for the paper to be included in the ACM SAC 2025 proceedings. 
Graduate students are invited to submit research abstracts (maximum 4 pages) to the Student Research Competition (SRC).
