 UbiComp / ISWC 2025 
 UbiComp / ISWC goes north! The conference will be held during October, 2025 in Espoo, Finland. 
 UbiComp / ISWC is a premier interdisciplinary venue in which leading international researchers, designers, developers, and practitioners in the field present and discuss novel results in all aspects of ubiquitous, pervasive and wearable computing. This includes the design, development, and deployment of ubiquitous, pervasive and wearable computing technologies and the understanding of human experiences and social impacts that these technologies facilitate. 
 The conference will be held duringOctober, 2025 atAalto University, Espoo, Finland. Aalto University is a public research university located in Espoo, Finland, within the Greater Helsinki metropolitan area. It was established in 2010 as a merger of three major Finnish universities: the Helsinki University of Technology, the Helsinki School of Economics and the University of Art and Design Helsinki. The close collaboration between the scientific, business and arts communities is intended to foster multi-disciplinary education and research. 
 Papers published by the Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT) are invited to present at the main technical tracks of the conference. UbiComp / ISWC also features a separate track for ISWC Briefs and Notes, as well as Workshops, Tutorials, Posters & Demos, Student Challenges, a Doctoral Symposium, and an array of Keynotes. 
 Join us for UbiComp/ISWC 2025 in-person! 
  
 We are excited to host the community in Alto University School of Electrical Engineering. 
 Sponsors 
 We would like to thank our awesome sponsors for supporting the 2025 UbiComp/ISWC community. Your help shapes the conference and will benefit students, researchers, and practitioners to advance our knowledge.

 Past Conferences 
 The ACM international joint conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) is the result of a merger of the two most renowned conferences in the field: Pervasive and UbiComp. While it retains the name of the latter in recognition of the visionary work of Mark Weiser, its long name reflects the dual history of the new event. 
 The ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computing (ISWC) discusses novel results in all aspects of wearable computing, and has been colocated with UbiComp and Pervasive since 2013. 
 A complete list of UbiComp, Pervasive, and ISWC past conferences is provided below.
