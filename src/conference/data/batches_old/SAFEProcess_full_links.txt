 SAFEPROCESS Symposium 2022: The 11th IFAC Symposium on Fault Detection, Supervision and Safety for Technical Processes 
 February 22, 2022 
 The KIOS Research and Innovation Center of Excellence at the University of Cyprus is organizing the11th IFAC Symposium on Fault Detection, Supervision and Safety for Technical Processes(SAFEPROCESS 2022). The conference will take place in Pafos, on the 7th-10th of June 2022, under the auspices of IFAC, the International Federation of Automated Control. 
 The SAFEPROCESS symposium is a triennial meeting of IFAC and a major international gathering of leading experts in the academia and industry from all over the world. It aims at strengthening the contact between the academia and industry to build up new networks and cultivate existing relations. High-level speakers will give talks on a wide spectrum of topics related to fault diagnosis, process supervision, safety monitoring and fault-tolerant control as well as state-of-the-art applications and emerging research directions. The symposium is also meant as a forum for young researchers, with the opportunity to present their scientific ambitions and work to an audience of international communities of technical diagnostics and control. 
 Fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control have developed into a major research area at the intersection of system and control engineering, applied mathematics and statistics or soft computing as well as application fields such as mechanical, electrical, chemical and aerospace engineering. IFAC is recognized as playing a crucial role in this aspect by launching a triennial symposium dedicated to this subject. 
 SAFEPROCESS 2022 will be held as a hybrid conference allowing registrants the choice to participate physically or to connect remotely.
