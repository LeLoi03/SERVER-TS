 Call For Papers 
 Recent years witnessed significant interest in the use of Machine Learning and AI-based techniques to support large data analysis, with research and implementation of systems specifically focused on supporting different phases of the data processing lifecycle. These have ranged from in-memory systems and distributed environments (e.g., MapReduce/Hadoop, Spark) to specialist environments for stream processing of data and events (e.g., Flink, Kinesis) and Serverless (e.g., OpenWhisk, AWS Lambda). On the other hand, we also realise the importance of computational systems required to process small data volumes, but which involve interdependencies and relationships that are hard to capture and derive. 
 The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT) is a premier annual conference series aiming to provide a platform for researchers from both academia and industry to present new discoveries in the broad area of big data computing and applications. Previous events were held in London, UK (BDCAT 2014), Limassol, Cyprus (BDCAT 2015), Shanghai, China (BDCAT 2016), Austin, USA (BDCAT 2017), Zurich, Switzerland (BDCAT 2018), Auckland, New Zealand (BDCAT 2019), Leicester, UK (BDCAT 2020), Leicester, UK (BDCAT 2021), Vancouver, USA (BDCAT 2022), and Taormina, Italy (BDCAT 2023). The BDCAT 2024 will be held in conjunction with the 17th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC 2024) in Sharjah, UAE. 
  
 Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research manuscripts in all areas of Big Data computing, applications and technologies, as well as on related scaling data analysis. 
  
 Topics of interest include (but not limited to): 
 1. Scaling Machine Learning and Data Mining 
 - Data Science Models and Approaches

PAPER SUBMISSION 
  
 Submitted manuscripts must represent original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other conference or journal. Manuscripts are submitted in PDF format and may not exceed ten (10) ACM-formatted *double-column* pages, including figures, tables, and references. All manuscripts undergo a double-blind peer-review process and will be reviewed and judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, rigor in analysis, quality of results, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference attendees. Your submission is subject to a determination that you are not under any sanctions by ACM. Accepted papers will later be converted into single-column format through the ACM TAPS process and therefore need to use the new templates that are single-column by default. Switch them to double-column for authoring your paper. This is possible in both the Word and the LaTeX templates. 
  
 At least one author of each paper must be registered for the conference in order for the paper to be published in the proceedings. The conference proceedings will be published by the ACM and made available online via the IEEE Xplore Digital Library and ACM Digital Library. 
  
 IMPORTANT DATES 
 Time zone: Anywhere in the world! 
 Paper Submissions Due: 10 August 2024 
 Acceptance Notification: 7 October 2024 
 Camera Ready Papers Due: 20 October 2024 
 AWARDS AND SPECIAL ISSUES 
 A selection commission chaired by the BDCAT 2024 technical programme committee will select and acknowledge the best paper to receive an award during the conference. 
  
 Authors of highly rated papers from BDCAT 2024 will be invited to submit an extended version to special issues of prestigious journals.

 Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research manuscripts in all areas of Cloud-Edge Continuum for utility computing and related computing paradigms such as Serverless, Distributed Computing and Function as a Service. The theme of this year is Self-adaptive and Autonomic Cloud, Edge, and Utility Computing in the Era of Large Language Models (LLM). The theme will explore new synergies between self-* and autonomous management of cloud, edge and their computing utilities and LLM approaches and solutions. We invite novel contributions with excellent balance between sound and rigorous foundational research and experimental results that relate to this year’s theme and to the general UCC topics, as below.

IEEE/ACM Int’l Conf. on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT) 
 We are pleased to inform you that the “11th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT 2024)” will be held in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates between 16 and and 19 December, 2024. 
 Recent years witnessed significant interest in the use of Machine Learning and AI-based techniques to support large data analysis, with research and implementation of systems specifically focused on supporting different phases of the data processing lifecycle. These have ranged from in-memory systems and distributed environments (e.g., MapReduce/Hadoop, Spark) to specialist environments for stream processing of data and events (e.g., Flink, Kinesis) and Serverless (e.g., OpenWhisk, AWS Lambda). On the other hand, we also realise the importance of computational systems required to process small data volumes, but which involve interdependencies and relationships that are hard to capture and derive. 
 The IEEE/ACM International Conference on Big Data Computing, Applications, and Technologies (BDCAT) is a premier annual conference series aiming to provide a platform for researchers from both academia and industry to present new discoveries in the broad area of big data computing and applications. Previous events were held in London, UK (BDCAT 2014), Limassol, Cyprus (BDCAT 2015), Shanghai, China (BDCAT 2016), Austin, USA (BDCAT 2017), Zurich, Switzerland (BDCAT 2018), Auckland, New Zealand (BDCAT 2019), Leicester, UK (BDCAT 2020), Leicester, UK (BDCAT 2021), Vancouver, USA (BDCAT 2022), and Taormina, Italy (BDCAT 2023). The BDCAT 2024 will be held in conjunction with the 17th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC 2024) in Sharjah, UAE.
