Lisa Frye, PhD | Professor, Dept. Chair 
 In a completely rational society, the best of us would aspire to be teachers and the rest of us would have to settle for something less, because passing civilization along from one generation to the next ought to be the highest honor and the highest responsibility anyone could have."

 My background is in Systems Administration and Networking. I spent 8 years as a Unix system administrator, primarily Sun systems. I was the Systems Manager of all University servers for several years, logging many hours doing system planning and integration. I have system administration experience in Unix, Windows and Novell. I have also worked in Networking as assistant network manager. I have performed tasks in all OSI layers, from physical (running cables and terminating ethernet and fiber cables) to supporting many network server applications (i.e. DNS, DHCP, web server, SNMP clients).
