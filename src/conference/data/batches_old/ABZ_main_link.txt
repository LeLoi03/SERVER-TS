 ABZ 2025 – 11th International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods 
 Düsseldorf (Germany) - Jun 10, 2025 — Jun 13, 2025 
  
 The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods. 
 The 11th instalment of the ABZ conference will be held at theTribe hotel, located in the centre of Düsseldorf with easy access to the airport and central rail station. 
 Authors interested in contributing to ABZ 2025 in Open Access or Open Choice should refer to the correspondingSpringer webpage.

 ABZ 2025 – 11th International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods 
 Call for papers 
 The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of state-based and machine-based formal methods, like Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, TLA, VDM and Z, that share a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware and software systems. The conference aims for a vital exchange of knowledge and experience among the research communities around different formal methods. 
 The name ABZ goes back to the first conference in London in 2008, where the ASM, B and Z conference series were merged into a joint event. In the following years other formal methods were added, e.g. Alloy in 2010 (Orford, Canada), VDM in 2012 (Pisa, Italy), and TLA+ in 2014 (Toulouse, France). After the also successful 2016 conferences in Linz, Austria, and 2018 in Southampton, UK, it was decided to name the conference “ABZ: International Conference on Rigorous State Based Methods”, to stress the openness for further state-based formal methods. We hope to continue many fruitful discussions between representatives of the individual methods in the past, which will bring us closer to the common goal of this research community: the creation of reliable and safe software and systems. 
 ABZ 2025 will have a main conference track, a case study track, a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops.
