 About The Event 
 About 
 The 15thInternational Conference on Pattern Recognition Systems (ICPRS) is an annual international event that follows ICPRS-24, ICPRS-23, ICPRS-22, ICPRS-21, ICPRS-19, ICPRS-18, ICPRS-17 and ICPRS-16, a continuation of the successful Chilean Conference on Pattern Recognition that reached its 6th edition in 2014. In 2025 it is organised by theUniversity Adolfo Ibáñez (Viña del Mar, Chile)and theChilean Association for Pattern Recognition(ACHiRP, a member of the IAPR), endorsed by theIAPRand expected to be endorsed by theIEEE Chile Section. As per previous years, papers deemed to be of the required standard AND presented at the conference are expected to be published by the IEEE and indexed in IEEE Xplore. Please note that the publishers might reject papers which are too similar to previous publications, even if the work is presented at the conference. All papers need to be submitted via Conftool to be peer-reviewed (double-blind) by an international panel of experts. 
  
 There will be prizes (first and runner up) for the best paper overall and for the best student paper (where the first author is a student), that will be invited to submit extended versions for consideration for a Special Section in thePattern Recognition Letters journal. 
  
 The International Conference on Pattern Recognition Systems (ICPRS-25) aims to create an important networking forum in which participants can discuss the present and future of pattern recognition systems. 
  
 Its predecessors ICPRS-24, ICPRS-23, ICPRS-22, ICPRS-21, ICPRS-19, ICPRS-18, ICPRS-17, ICPRS-16, CWPR and CCPR, have traditionally been a meeting point of different disciplines (computer science, engineering, mathematics, machine learning, etc.) and an opportunity for a wide range of researchers and practitioners to discuss the many different aspects of the application of pattern recognition technologies.

 To be announced after paper acceptance.Registration 
 All authors of accepted papers and all other attendees, will need to register through EventBrite* (tbc, the link will be provided after the acceptance notification date)For an accepted paper to be presented and published, it needs to be associated to an"Author Full Fee"registration (and notto a Student or an Other registration). If only a student author is attending the conference and presenting their paper, then they need to pay an "Author full fee" (andnotthe student fee). We have to operate like this to cover conference and publishing costs. Also, if one of the authors registers as "Author Full Fee", additional authors of the same paper who also want to attend the conference only need to pay a lower fee e.g. as Student or Other, as appropriate to their status. Following IAPR policy, each author full fee registration will cover the presentation of up to three papersby the registered person who also needs to be a co-author of those papers. Presentation of additional papers beyond those three,by the same conference delegatewill require the payment ofan additional full author fee. In all cases there are reductions for members of the sponsoring organisations. 
  
 The fee structure will be announced later in the year. 
 (*) please note that there is an extra charge by EventBrite of about 8%-10%Accommodation

 Frequently Asked Questions 
 I have a paper accepted but require an invitation to arrange my trip to London | Please contact the conference Local Chairhref="mailto:romina.torres.t@uai.cl?cc=sebastian.moreno@uai.cl&subject=ICPRS25 Invitation Letter" - (Dr Romina Torres)
so that she can arrange to send you an invitation letter. 
 Will the event will be online? | No. We expect this to be a full in-person event. We invite researchers worldwide to submit their novel articles. 
 Is there any facility for students to submit articles? | Students are encouraged to submit papers. If they are the first author they can be submitted as "Regular Student Paper" and would be considered for a special prize. The paper would still need to be associated to a registration as an Author Full Fee. For details about the registration fees, please check theRegistrationsection 
 Do I have to pay extra if I have more than one paper accepted? | Please refer to theRegistrationsection for the detailed fee conditions. 
 href="#faq6" - Will all accepted papers be indexed in Scopus and others? | As in previous versions of the conference, we expect that the papers will be indexed in Scopus, Xplore and others. Please note that only papers that are accepted AND presented AND associated to a delegate fee, will be sent to the publisher. It is very important that the papers are in the correct format and have been proof-read by a competent English speaker, as the publisher may reject poorly written papers or those that overlap significantly with previously published work. 
 Does a paper discussing the application of pattern recognition in the manufacturing industry (as a black-box, and not so much about which specific methods) fit your conference? | Yes! We welcome papers describing real-world applications of pattern recognition systems.

 Frequently Asked Questions 
 I have a paper accepted but require an invitation to arrange my trip to London | Please contact the conference Local Chairhref="mailto:romina.torres.t@uai.cl?cc=sebastian.moreno@uai.cl&subject=ICPRS25 Invitation Letter" - (Dr Romina Torres)
so that she can arrange to send you an invitation letter. 
 Will the event will be online? | No. We expect this to be a full in-person event. We invite researchers worldwide to submit their novel articles. 
 Is there any facility for students to submit articles? | Students are encouraged to submit papers. If they are the first author they can be submitted as "Regular Student Paper" and would be considered for a special prize. The paper would still need to be associated to a registration as an Author Full Fee. For details about the registration fees, please check theRegistrationsection 
 Do I have to pay extra if I have more than one paper accepted? | Please refer to theRegistrationsection for the detailed fee conditions. 
 href="#faq6" - Will all accepted papers be indexed in Scopus and others? | As in previous versions of the conference, we expect that the papers will be indexed in Scopus, Xplore and others. Please note that only papers that are accepted AND presented AND associated to a delegate fee, will be sent to the publisher. It is very important that the papers are in the correct format and have been proof-read by a competent English speaker, as the publisher may reject poorly written papers or those that overlap significantly with previously published work. 
 Does a paper discussing the application of pattern recognition in the manufacturing industry (as a black-box, and not so much about which specific methods) fit your conference? | Yes! We welcome papers describing real-world applications of pattern recognition systems.
