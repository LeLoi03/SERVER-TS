 SCOPE: 
 The 12 th International Conference on Wireless Networks and Mobile Communications (WINCOM 2025) is scheduled to be hosted in the city of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, at the Arab Open University from November 25-27, 2025. This conference stands as a premier platform for the exchange of innovative ideas in-depth discussions on solutions, and the sharing of invaluable experiences among esteemed researchers and professionals hailing from both academia and industry, all deeply invested in the realms of wireless networks and mobile communications. WINCOM, as the flagship conference of the MobiTic Association will be thematically anchored in "Global smart connectivity" for its upcoming edition. The scholarly contributions presented at WINCOM 2025 will undergo rigorous scrutiny for submission to IEEExplore, with the aim of securing indexation within the esteemed digital library. Furthermore, these submissions will be presented to renowned indexing services such as SCOPUS, ISI, DBLP, and other leading platforms. Papers demonstrating outstanding merit may be singled out for recommendation towards inclusion in a special issue of select international journals. Ongoing discussions are actively pursued with various international journals for the prospective publication of the selected papers. 
 Demo-Hackathon: 
 WINCOM 2025 will consider this year proposals for demonstrations of research prototypes and novel applications. The conference will provide forum for PhD students and early career researchers to showcase their prototypes. We will also encourage submission of ideas for running hackathons collocated with event. Best demo and hackathon winner will also be presented in the WINCOM'2025 in closing ceremony.
