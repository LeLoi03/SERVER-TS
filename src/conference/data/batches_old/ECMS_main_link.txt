Join the leading scientific forum for European simulation expertsThehref="http://www.scs-europe.net/" - ECMS International Conference on Modelling and Simulation
is the annual conference of the European Council for Modelling and Simulation, an independent forum of academics and practitioners from around the world dedicated to research, development, and applications of modelling and simulation.href="https://scs-europe.net/conf/ecms2025/" - ECMS 2025
is organized by theUniversity of Messina, Italy in cooperation with theUniversity of Catania, Italy. 
 Theme: 
 The human capacity to abstract complex systems and phenomena into simplified models has played a critical role in the rapid evolution of our modern industrial processes, and scientific research that recently have heavily affected AI applications and techniques. As a science and an art, Modelling and Simulation have been one of the core enablers of this remarkable human trace and have become a topic of great importance for researchers and practitioners. The increasing availability of massive computational resources and interconnectivity has helped fuel tremendous advances in the field, collapsing previous barriers and redefining new horizons for its capabilities and applications. 
 Call for contributions:The ECMS International Conference on Modelling and Simulation is dedicated to help define the state of the art in different fields involved in creating, defining, and building innovative simulation systems, simulation and modelling tools and techniques, and novel applications for modelling and simulation. Prospective authors are invited to submit high-quality papers representing original results in all related areas of modelling and simulation. Published papers will be sent for indexation to DBLP, SCOPUS, ISI, INSPEC and DOI. High quality selected papers will be considered for publication in a focused issue with some international journals. An author of each accepted paper must register and present the paper at the conference. Detailed instructions for submission are available on thehref="https://www.scs-europe.net/conf/ecms2025" - ECMS 2025 conference website
. 
 Best paper awards:All submitted papers will be evaluated for the Best Conference Paper Award and Best Student Paper Award.
