 Review process 
 Submissions must not substantially duplicate published work or work that has been submitted in parallel to any other journal or conference/workshop with published proceedings. Additionally submissions may not be submitted to any other venue unless notified of rejection or withdrawn by the authors. Accepted submissions may not appear in any other conference or workshop that has proceedings. 
 The review process will consist of two rounds with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee will reject some submissions; the rest will proceed to the second round. At the end of the first round, the authors will be either notified of rejection, or invited to submit a response to questions from the program committee (if any). The authors' response will be used to make the final decision in the second round. 
 The double-blind review process will follow theIACR Conflict of Interest Policy. The authors will be asked, at submission time, to help identify program committee members with potential conflicts of interest. 
 Awards 
 The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall Best Paper Award. The Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper(s) authored exclusively by students and postdocs (at the time of submission). As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified. 
 Stipends 
 Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. A limited number of stipends will be available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Application instructions will be posted together with other registration information.
