 MSST Conference 
 International Conference onMassive Storage Systemsand Technology 
 June 3-7, 2024, Santa Clara University 
 href="https://www.msstconference.org/" - Go to MSST 2024 Site
Since the conference was founded, in 1974, by the leading national laboratories, MSST has been a venue for massive-scale storage system designers and implementers, storage architects, researchers, and vendors to share best practices and discuss building and securing the world's largest storage systems for high-performance computing, web-scale systems, and enterprises. 
 Since 2014, MSST, which is the longest-running storage systems conference, has been hosted by the School of Engineering at Santa Clara University, which itself is not just the Jesuit university of Silicon Valley, and therefore a part of a five-century-long educational tradition, but is also the longest-operating institution of higher education in California.
