ISCO (Integer Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization) is a biannual symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, stochastic optimization, graphs and combinatorics. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited. 
 Each ISCO conference is preceded or followed by a Spring School lectured by international Combinatorial Optimization searches. This school is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also opened to older colleagues.

 A bit of history 
 Thefirstissue of ISCO was held in Hammamet, Tunisia inMarch 2010. This first attempt gathered more than 200 participants in a beautiful mediterranean country. The plenary sessions as well as all the talks have shown the large spectrum of our Combinatorial Optimization domain. Pierre Bonami from University of Méditerranée, Gerard Cornuéjols from Carnegie Mellon University and Andrea Lodi from University of Bologna have given a Spring School on "Cutting plane methods for integer and combinatorial optimization". 
  
 A selection of short papers presented at ISCO 2012 has been published by Springer-Verlag in the Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics (ENDM):href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/15710653/36/supp/C" - ISCO2010 ENDM volume
. 
  
 A special issue in2010 DAM special issuehas been published. 
  
 Thesecondissue has been moved to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea in Athens, Greece inApril 2012. This second conference has been organized with colleagues from the Athens University Of Economics & Business in the deep center of the famous town. From this conference, ISCO topics has been extended to Theoretical Computer Science aspects of Combinatorial Optimization. A Spring School was organized around "Mathematical Programming and Design of Approximation Algorithms" with lectures by David Shmoys and David Williamson from Cornell University, USA. 
  
 A selection of short papers presented at ISCO 2012 has been published by Elsevier in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS):href="http://www.springer.com/fr/book/9783642321467" - ISCO2012 LNCS volume

 Three special issues was dedicated to ISCO2012: 
 - a2012 Mathematical Programming special issue, 
 - a2012 Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) special issue, 
 - and ahref="http://www.rairo-ro.org/articles/ro/abs/2014/02/contents/contents.html" - 2012 RAIRO Operation Research special issue
have been published. 

Thethirdissue has been organized on the side of the Atlantic Ocean in Lisbon, Portugal inMarch 2014with colleagues from the university of Lisbon around Luis Gouveia. A Spring School on "Stochastic Programming" will be organized before the conference by Rüdiger Schultz (University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany) and Jonas Schweiger (Zuse Institute Berlin, Germany).

 Top of page | href="" - What is ISCO?
ISCO (Integer Symposium on Combinatorial Optimization) is a biannual symposium whose aim is to bring together researchers from all the communities related to combinatorial optimization, including algorithms and complexity, mathematical programming, operations research, stochastic optimization, graphs and combinatorics. Quality papers on all aspects of combinatorial optimization, from mathematical foundations and theory of algorithms to computational studies and practical applications, are solicited. 
 Each ISCO conference is preceded or followed by a Spring School lectured by international Combinatorial Optimization searches. This school is dedicated to PhD students but the lectures are also opened to older colleagues.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Approximation algorithms 
 Branch-and-bound algorithms 
 Branch-and-cut-and price algorithms 
 Computational biology 
 Computational complexity 
 Computational geometry

 A bit of history 
 Thefirstissue of ISCO was held in Hammamet, Tunisia inMarch 2010. This first attempt gathered more than 200 participants in a beautiful mediterranean country. The plenary sessions as well as all the talks have shown the large spectrum of our Combinatorial Optimization domain. Pierre Bonami from University of Méditerranée, Gerard Cornuéjols from Carnegie Mellon University and Andrea Lodi from University of Bologna have given a Spring School on "Cutting plane methods for integer and combinatorial optimization". 
  
 A selection of short papers presented at ISCO 2012 has been published by Springer-Verlag in the Electronic Notes in Discrete Mathematics (ENDM):href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/15710653/36/supp/C" - ISCO2010 ENDM volume

 A special issue in2010 DAM special issuehas been published. 
  
 Thesecondissue has been moved to the other side of the Mediterranean Sea in Athens, Greece inApril 2012. This second conference has been organized with colleagues from the Athens University Of Economics & Business in the deep center of the famous town. From this conference, ISCO topics has been extended to Theoretical Computer Science aspects of Combinatorial Optimization. A Spring School was organized around "Mathematical Programming and Design of Approximation Algorithms" with lectures by David Shmoys and David Williamson from Cornell University, USA.
