 GECCO 2025 @ Málaga (hybrid) 
 The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference 
 July 14 - 18, 2025 
 Why GECCO? 
 The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO) presents the latest high-quality results in genetic and evolutionary computation since 1999. Topics include: genetic algorithms, genetic programming, swarm intelligence, complex systems, evolutionary combinatorial optimization and metaheuristics, evolutionary machine learning, learning for evolutionary computation, evolutionary multiobjective optimization, evolutionary numerical optimization, neuroevolution, real world applications, search-based software engineering, theory, benchmarking, reproducibility, hybrids and more.

Málaga 
 Málaga is a thriving and dynamic city in Southern Spain. Bathed by the Mediterranean Sea and surrounded by Málaga Mountains, the city enjoys a warm climate tempered by the proximity of the sea. This has contributed to make Málaga one of the main touristic destinations in Europe. The city has however much more to offer than sun and beaches. 
 Indeed, Málaga is a city of Art & Culture: having been founded by the Phoenicians in 7th century BC and subsequently ruled by Romans, Moors, and Castilian Kings, the city comprises numerous monuments (the Roman Theater, the Moorish Fortress and Castle, the Cathedral, etc.), churches, palaces, and noteworthy buildings that illustrate this historical past. 
 Málaga was also the home town of Pablo Ruiz Picasso, and not surprisingly it is also known as the City of Museums with +30 museums devoted to Painting, Sculpture, Music, Jewellery, Sports, just to name a few. 
 All of the above can be complemented by letting oneself be embedded in Malagueño life style, enjoying the local gastronomy, the warm weather, and the hospitality of the people. And if you need more, Málaga is an excellent base for exploring nearby places, thanks to its exceptional transport infrastructure.

 The front matter of each GECCO proceeding 
 Note 
 This table provides statistics of two-page poster papers, not full papers. Unlike other conferences in the field of evolutionary computation (e.g., CEC, EMO, and Evo*), poster papers and full papers are published individually in GECCO. While full papers are published in the main volume, poster papers are published in the companion volume (href="https://dblp1.uni-trier.de/db/conf/gecco/" - dblp
). 
 It is not obvious how to calculate the acceptance rates of GECCO poster papers. I calculated the acceptance rate for each year as follows: (x + y) / z, where x is the number of full paper acceptances, y is the number of poster paper acceptances, and z is the number of submissions. I believe that the acceptance rate obtained in this way is inexact, but a good approximation.
