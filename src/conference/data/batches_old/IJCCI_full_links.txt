Considered a subfield of computational intelligence focused on global optimisation problems, evolutionary computation is associated with systems that use computational models of evolutionary processes as the key elements in design and implementation, i.e. computational techniques which are based to some degree on the evolution of biological life in the natural world. A number of evolutionary computational models have been proposed, including evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, evolutionary programming and swarm intelligence. These techniques form the basis of several disciplines such as artificial life and evolutionary robotics. 
 This conference intends to be a major forum for scientists, engineers and practitioners interested in the study, analysis, design, modeling and implementation of evolvable systems, both theoretically and in a broad range of application fields.

Neural computation and artificial neural networks, especially in relation to deep learning, have seen an explosion of interest over the recent decades, and are being successfully applied across an extraordinary range of problem domains, in areas as diverse as finance, medicine, engineering, geology and physics, in problems of complex dynamics and complex behavior prediction, classification or control. Several architectures, learning strategies and algorithms have been introduced in this highly dynamic field in the last couple of decades. Nowadays, having reached notable scientific and applicative maturity, neural computation and related techniques are considered as major basis toward the completion of intelligent artificial systems. This conference intends to be a major forum for scientists, engineers and practitioners interested in the study, analysis, design, modeling and implementation of neural computing systems, both theoretically and in a broad range of application fields.
