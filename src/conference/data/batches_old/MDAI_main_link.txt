 DEADLINE EXTENDED LNCS: April 12th, 2025 
  
 CFP: | A printable version of the CFP is availablehref="mdai_2025.pdf" - here 
 Springer: | This is Springer's Book Authors' Code of Conduct (href="https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct" - Book of conduct
). Take it into account for submission to MDAI. 
 Aims and goals: | In MDAI we are particularly interested in the different facets of decision processes in a broad sense. This includes model building and all kind of mathematical tools for data aggregation, information fusion, and decision making; tools to help decision in data science problems (including e.g., statistical and machine learning algorithms as well as data visualization tools); and algorithms for data privacy and transparency-aware methods so that data processing processes and decisions made from them are fair, transparent, explainable and avoid unnecessary disclosure of sensitive information. 
 The MDAI conference includes tracks on the topics of (i) data science and machine learning, (ii) data privacy, (iii) aggregation funcions, (iv) human decision making, (v) graphs and (social) networks, and (vi) information security. The conference has been since 2004 a forum for researchers to discuss last results into these areas of research.

22st Modeling Decisions for AI
València, September 15-18, 2025
AIMS AND GOALS
In MDAI we are particularly interested in the different facets of
decision processes in a broad sense. This includes model building
and all kind of mathematical tools for data aggregation, informa-
tion fusion, and decision making; tools to help decision in data
science problems (including e.g., statistical and machine learning
algorithms as well as data visualization tools); and algorithms for
data privacy and transparency-aware methods so that data pro-
cessing processes and decisions made from them are fair, trans-
parent, explainable and avoid unnecessary disclosure of sensitive
information.
The MDAI conference includes the following tracks:
•Human decision making,
•Aggregation functions,
•Data science and machine learning,
•Data privacy,
•Graphs and (social) networks,
•Information security
The conference has been since 2004 a forum for researchers to
discuss last results into these areas of research. MDAI is rated as
a CORE B conference by the Computing Research and Education
Association of Australasia - CORE.
SUBMISSION AND PUBLICATION
Original technical contributions are sought. Contributions will be
selected on the basis of their quality. Papers should not exceed
12 pages in total (using LNCS/LNAI style).
Proceedings with accepted papers will be published in the
LNAI/LNCS series (Springer-Verlag) and distributed at the confer-
ence, as done in previous MDAI conferences.
Besides, papers that according to the evaluation of the referees,
are not suitable for the LNAI but that have some merits will
be published in some additional proceedings (with ISBN) and
scheduled in the MDAI program.  Direct submission to these
other proceedings is also possible (deadline: May 15th).
