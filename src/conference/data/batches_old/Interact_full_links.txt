 INTERACT 2025 
 20th IFIP TC13 International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction 
  
 8 - 12 September 2025 
 Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil 
 Blending Experiences in Interaction Design 
 INTERACT 2025 will be hosted at Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais in Brazil. The state of Minas Gerais has a rich diversity with the blending of experiences encompassing a hot pot of cultures and ancestries from around the world, mixing heritage and modern, hand-made traditional artefacts and high-tech industry. 
 This context provides inspiration to bring research challenges to designing blending experiences with virtual and physical, different cultures, and a growing blending of human-created and artefacts generated by artificial intelligence.
