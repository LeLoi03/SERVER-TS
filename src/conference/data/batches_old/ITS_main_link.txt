ITS2025 
 ITS2025 is the upcoming Conference of the series of Intelligent Tutoring Systems Conferences on Computer and Cognitive Sciences, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning in Tutoring and Education. ITS2025 will be held in Alexandroupolis, Greece, from June 02 to June 06, 2025, and will be co-hosted by Democritus University of Thrace. The conference will be hybrid and it will allow participants to attend itonline too.

Acceptance notification will be sent to authors by March 31, 2025. Papersubmission should be made through thehref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=its20250" - Easy Chair platform.
NEWS 
 Dear authors, theAcceptance Notificationhas been postponed. Thenewdate isApril 7. 
 Dear Conference participants, please check below the information about thehref="https://iis-international.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RAMADA-PLAZA-by-WYNDHAM-THRAKI-Presentation-2025-new.pdf" - conference venue
. 
 Dear ITS2025 authors,the call for submissions of WORKSHOP Breaking barriers: Generative intelligence workshop is now OPEN.Please make sure to follow the submission instructions and deadlines on the conference webpage. 
 THEME OF THE CONFERENCE 
 The ITS2025 Conference is about“Generative Systems”. 
 ITS is evolving to a new concept of Artificial Intelligence which can be found in various disciplines and can serve human education and well-being. This new concept is named: GENERATIVE INTELLIGENCE. Generative Intelligence concerns various AI systems, techniques, architectures, methods, or tools based on deep and machine learning which can be used to generate texts, images, solutions, and environments, able to enhance HUMAN intelligence, cognitive capacities, memory, and learning. Instead of trying to reproduce human behavior or recognize human traits using artificial intelligence techniques or learning analytics, Generative Intelligence provides means to increase human cognitive potential. 
 The conference is supported by the following tracks in which the concepts mentioned above contribute to the increase of intelligence. Each track includes (but is not limimted to) a list of topics of interest which can be found below. Submitted papers should refer to one of the corresponding tracks. 
 Conference tracks 
 T1: Generative Tutoring Systems 
 T2: Generative Systems in Healthcare Informatics 
 T3: Generative Systems in Human Interaction, Games and Virtual Reality 
 T4: Neural Networks and Data Mining 
 T5: Generative Systems and Metaverse 
 T6: Security, Privacy, and Ethics in Generative Systems 
 T7: Generative Systems for Applied Natural Language Processing 
 T8: Generative Systems and Cognitive Robots

 WORKSHOPSITS2025serves as a significant platform for both research and practitioners, providinga workshop program tailored to the diverse interests of its audience. 
  
 We welcome submissions of workshop proposals covering various subjects within the general scope of ITS2025, as well as proposals that introduce fresh perspectives or address emerging challenges within these areas, in particular, Generative AI and Intelligent Tutoring Systems. Workshops may include panel discussions, lightning talks, networking sessions, hands-on activities, hackathons, and other interactive formats where applicable. They may be either half or full-day long and take place on E the day beforethe main ITS2025 conference, which is on June 04, 2025. 
  
 Workshops at ITS2025 allow your organization or project to advance and promote your topics and enjoy high visibility. Workshops will be announced on the ITS2025 website and will be seen by all conference participants. They can be incubators for scientific communities that form and share a particular research and development agenda and they will provide a forum for presenting contributions and findings to a diverse and knowledgeable community. They can constitute a dissemination activity in the scope of large research projects. 
  
 Workshop proposals must include the following information: 
  
 * Outline the themes and goals of the event, including a title and abrief abstract (less than 200 words) intended for the ITS2025 website. 
 * A statement addressing why the event is important, why the event is timely, and how it is relevant to ITS2025. 
 * Related workshops and conferences, i.e., specifying if this is a continuation of a workshop series or a new workshop including any relevant information about past versions (in any) and other related workshops 
 * A statement addressing the quality assurance criteria that will be used by the event organizers to select the papers for the workshops (e.g., peer review or review/evaluation by event organizers). If a peer review process is chosen as a quality assurance criterion for the workshops, the organizers will be responsible for their reviewing process. 
 * Structure of the event and plans for generating/stimulating discussion; how will the interaction be organized in case of a hybrid event. 
 * Expected number of event participants 
 * A description of the intended audience and the expected learning outcomes. 
 * Desired prerequisite knowledge of the audience. 
 * Proposed duration of the event (half or full day) (final time slot will be assigned in accordance with the ITS2025 program).
