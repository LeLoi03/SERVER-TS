Conference FPL:

Welcome to FPL 2025 
 35th International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications 
 1 - 5 September 2025, Leiden, The NetherlandsThe International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL) was the first and remains the largest conference covering the rapidly growing field-programmable logic and reconfigurable computing area. During the past 34 years, many of the advances in reconfigurable system architectures, applications embedded processors, design automation methods, and tools were first published in the proceedings of the FPL conference series. The conference's objective is to bring together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and worldwide. 
 The 35th edition of the International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL 2025) will be held in Leiden from the 1st to the 5th of September 2025. Workshops and tutorials will take place on the 1st and 2nd of September. The main conference will be held from the 3rd to the 5th of September. 
 The 2025 edition of the conference is organized byLeiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science (LIACS), Leiden University, The Netherlands.

 The International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL) was the first and remains the largest conference dedicated to the rapidly growing field-programmable logic and reconfigurable computing area. Over the past 34 years, many key advances in reconfigurable system architectures, applications, embedded processors, design automation methods, and tools have been first published in the FPL conference proceedings. The conference brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry worldwide. 
 We welcome contributions on (but not limited to) the following topics related to FPL: 
 Architectures and Technology 
 Design Methods and Tools 
 Application Acceleration 
 Safety-Critical Applications 
 Programming Models and Languages 
 High-Performance Computing 
 System Software and Environment Support 
 Security of Reconfigurable Systems 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit original, unpublished papers in IEEE double-column format. 
 Long papers | may include up to | eight | pages plus up to two pages for references. 
 Short papers | are limited to | four | pages plus, at most, one additional page for references. 
 These limits are strict; submissions exceeding them will be automatically rejected. The conference proceedings will be published in IEEE Xplore. The submission link ishref="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fpl2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fpl2025

 Submission Information 
 We encourage two types of submissions: 
 Long papers: | limited to eight pages plus two pages of references (i.e., the references do not count in the eight pages, and references must not exceed two pages). 
 Short papers: | limited to four pages plus one page of references (i.e., the references do not count in the four pages, and references must not exceed one page). Please use the subtitle | Short Paper | in the submission. 
 We also accept survey papers, prepared as long papers (limited to eight pages plus two pages of references), with the subtitleSurvey paper. 
 Page limits are strict, and papers exceeding this limit will be rejected automatically. For both types of submissions, the abstract is limited to 300 words. After the abstract submission deadline, the author list and order entered in the system cannot be changed anymore. 
 All contributions must be submitted electronically in PDF format and follow the IEEE double-column format. Templates are available directly from IEEE (https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). The submission link ishref="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fpl2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fpl2025
. Accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings. 
 FPL 2025 uses adouble-blindreviewing system. Manuscripts must not identify authors or their affiliations; those that do will not be considered. References to the authors' prior work should be made in the third person in the same way one would reference work by others, with adequate anonymisation to preserve double-blind reviewing. Authors can utilize tools like Anonymous GitHub to anonymize repositories if needed. 
 Authors guarantee that submitted papers areoriginal and unpublished. Submissions cannot be under review or accepted elsewhere nor substantially similar to papers being considered for other conferences, journals, or workshops unless previously presented at venues without archived proceedings. 
 All potential conflicts of interest must be disclosed during submission, including all authors and program committee members. Conflicts include, but are not limited to, instances within the last five years where you co-authored a publication, shared funding, or had an overlapping institutional affiliation. Failure to disclose conflicts or falsely declaring conflicts to manipulate the review process may result in rejecting the submission.
