 COMPUTER GRAPHICS INTERNATIONAL2025 
 The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong 
 July 14-18, 2025 
 CGI 2025 
 CGI is one of the oldest annual international conferences on Computer Graphics in the world. Half centuries of influence, we are dedicated to making CGI as a top conference on graphics and media. Researchers are invited to share their experiences and novel achievements in various fields of Computer Graphics, Media, and Virtual Reality. Previous recent CGI conferences have been held in Sydney, Australia (2014), Strasbourg, France (2015), Heraklion, Greece (2016), Yokohama, Japan (2017), Bintan, Indonesia (2018), Calgary, Canada (2019), and Shanghai, China (2023). CGI has been virtual between 2020 and 2022 due to the COVID pandemic, and has been held last year in Geneva, Switzerland (2024). 
 This year, CGI 2025 is organized by The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and supported by the Computer Graphics Society (CGS). The Visual Computer Journal, published by Springer Nature, is the official journal of the Computer Graphics Society. 
 You are invited to submit your full papers to CGI 2025 viahref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cgi2025" - EasyChair
. As in previous years, CGI 2025 papers can be submitted either for possible publication inThe Visual Computerjournal, or in theCAVW,VRIHjournals, andCGI Conference Proceedings(LNCS-Springer).

 Winner of the Computer Graphics Forum 2024 Cover Image Contest 
 This image shows the inside of the teaser figure 'fertility' from Polygon Laplacian Made Robust. It visualizes the condition numbers of individual polygon stiffness matrices. The mesh transitions from the input mesh to our result from left to right. The original mesh features disfigured polygons with alarming (yellow) or terrible (magenta) condition numbers. With our tailored smoothing algorithm, polygons become very regular and, combined with our improved polygon Laplacian, result in better condition numbers (blue) and improved robustness in computational simulation. Blender was used to stylize the geometry and render the image.
