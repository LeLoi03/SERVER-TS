 ICSOC Conference OverviewICSOC, the International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing, is the premier international forum for academics, industry researchers, developers, and practitioners to report and share groundbreaking work in service-oriented computing. ICSOC fosters cross-community scientific excellence by gathering experts from various disciplines, such as services science, data science, management science, business-process management, distributed systems, wireless and mobile computing, cloud and edge computing, cyber-physical systems, Internet-of-Things (IoT), scientific workflows, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and services and software engineering. 
  
 ICSOCprovides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further our knowledge and understanding of the various aspects (e.g. application and system aspects) related to Service Computing with particular focus on artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, IoT, and emerging technologies including quantum computing. 
  
 The23rd editionof the ICSOC conference series will be hosted by thehref="https://cs.hit.edu.cn/2018/1126/c11289a218422/page.htm" - Research Center of Intelligent Computing for Enterprises and Services (ICES)

 ICSOC provides a premier international forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further our knowledge and understanding of the various aspects (e.g., application and system aspects) related to Service Computing and identify research challenges in new research areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, IoT, and emerging technologies including quantum computing. 
 ICSOC, the International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing, is the premier international forum for academics, industry researchers, developers, and practitioners to report and share groundbreaking work in service-oriented computing. ICSOC 2025, the 23rd event in this series, will take place in Shenzhen, China, from 1 to 4 December 2025. 
  
 Submissions / Review Model 
 Early submissions: Authors are invited to consider early submissions (deadlineMay 9, 2025). In the early submission round, only papers submitted as full/regular papers will be considered, and they will go through a full peer-review process. An early submitted paper that is accepted will be included in the proceedings. An early submitted paper that is rejected can be still revised and submitted to the normal submission round by the given deadline. If the authors of an early submitted paper that is rejected decide to resubmit their paper to the normal submission round, they will have to include an appendix (maximum 2 pages) describing how they have addressed the comments received by the reviewers from the early submission. 
 Regular submissions: Authors are welcome to submit papers to the regular submission round by the given deadline. To do so,they needto submit an abstract by 1 July 2025. After the regular submission deadline, the papers resubmitted from the early submission round and those submitted only to the regular submission round will undergo the same review process as other submissions. The decisions made from this regular review procedure will be final, and no resubmission will be permitted afterwards. 
 Anonymous submissions: ICSOC implements a double-blind reviewing process. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper. Authors' prior work should be referred to in the third person. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected without review. The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs. 
 It should be noted that unformatted papers and papers beyond the page limit will be desk rejected without reviewing. 
 The submission procedure is initiated through the following URL:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsoc2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsoc2025

 Areas of interest 
 ICSOC is the premier international forum for presenting the most recent and significant research contributions in service-oriented computing. These are organized in four focus areas: 
 Focus Area 1: Service-Oriented Technology Basics and Trends 
 Focus Area 2: AI for Services and as-a-Service 
 Focus Area 3: Novel Service Frameworks for Cloud Continuum and Smart Environments 
 Focus Area 4: Emerging Technologies 
 Topics of interest include but are not limited to: 
 ▪️Service design, specification, discovery, customization, composition, and deployment 
 ▪️Service change management 
 ▪️Theoretical foundations of Service Science and Engineering 
 ▪️Service monitoring and adaptive management 
 ▪️Secure service lifecycle development 
 ▪️Privacy management aspects for services 
 ▪️Secure service lifecycle development 
 ▪️Privacy management aspects for services 
 ▪️Trust management for services 
 ▪️Service mining and analytics 
 ▪️Data-provisioning services 
 ▪️Cloud service management 
 ▪️Cloud and fog computing 
 ▪️Cloud Edge continuum 
 ▪️Edge service orchestration 
 ▪️AI as service 
 ▪️AI tools for service science and engineering 
 ▪️Green ICT and Sustainability of Service Systems 
 ▪️Metaverse services 
 ▪️IoT services 
 ▪️Lightweight service deployment and management 
 ▪️Social networks and services 
 ▪️Innovative service business models 
 ▪️Service-based business process management 
 We invite high-quality submissions of research papers describing original contributions that are unpublished and not under review elsewhere. The research papers will focus on traditional areas or in a specific focus area mentioned above. Research in each area will be considered strictly in the context of service-oriented computing. No papers would be accepted unless they clearly illustrate the contribution to the ICSOC areas of interest. Failure to provide such information can result in desk rejection. 
  
 Reproducibility Certification 
 Research reproducibility is essential for scientific integrity and further scientific discovery. At ICSOC, we promote rigorous evaluation and sharing of data, code, and methodologies to enhance the credibility and impact of scientific contributions. Authors are urged to publicly share all research artifacts such as datasets, source code, and supplementary materials as part of their submission. To encourage reproducibility, ICSOC incorporates formal verification into its review process and introduces the respective badges. During paper submission, authors are requested to provide the Artifact Availability and Reproducibility Statement, which will be taken into account by the reviewers. Moreover, all accepted papers will be invited to be considered under the Artifact Evaluation track, to undergo a rigorous formal process of verifying the reproducibility of the results. Participating papers that successfully pass this process will get either Open Artifacts or Verified Artifacts badge. 
  
 Paper Submission 
 Papers should be formatted according toSpringer's LNCS Formatting Guidelines. Submissions must be in English and must not exceed 15 pages. All papers must be submitted electronically to the Conference Submission System. Each paper must be submitted on or before the provided deadlines. Authors are kindly invited to respect the abstract submission deadline, which is set one week before the paper submission. The limit length of accepted papers should be 15 pages (including abstract, figures and references). The final submission should be formatted according to Springer's LNCS Camera-ready instructions. 
 For each accepted paper, at least one author must attend the conference and present the paper. The deadline for identifying and registering this individual author is together with the camera-ready submission. 
 All accepted papers will be included in the Conference Proceedings published by Springer Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.
