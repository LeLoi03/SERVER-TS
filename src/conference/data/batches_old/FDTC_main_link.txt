Fault injection is one of the most exploited means for extracting confidential in-
formation from embedded devices and for compromising their intended operation.
Therefore, research on established as well as upcoming methodologies, and tech-
niques for fault injection,  architectures and design tools for the design of robust
and protected cryptographic systems and embedded devices (both hardware and
software), are essential.  Fault injection case studies on popular categories of em-
bedded devices like mobile phones, industrial control devices, hardware wallets for
cryptocurrencies, security tokens, etc., are of high interest to improve the under-
standing of the implications on realistic applications.  FDTC is the reference event
in the field of fault injection appliances, fault attacks and countermeasures.
Topics of interest include but are not limited to:
•Fault injection setups and praxis:
– novel and improved mechanisms for fault injection, e.g., using lasers, elec-
tromagnetic induction, or clock / power supply manipulation
– practical issues in fault injection setups and validation results
– practical limitations of attacks and implications for security
– fault injection in emerging technologies, e.g., memristor, carbon nanotubes,
etc.
•Case studies:
– attacks on cryptographic implementations including post-quantum cryptog-
raphy and lightweight cryptography
– attacks on embedded devices like mobile phones, industrial control devices,
hardware wallets for cryptocurrencies, security tokens, smartcards, TEEs,
secure enclaves, etc.
– attacks on machine learning architectures and validation of results
– attacks on privacy-preserving technologies, e.g., homomorphic encryption,
zero-knowledge proofs and multi-party computation
– attacks on remote targets, e.g., fpgas in the cloud
•Related highly-invasive attacks on device security:
– setups and practical results from invasive attacks, such as photonic emission
analysis, laser thermal imaging, laser-voltage imaging, etc.
– practical issues, limitations and potential
•Countermeasures (detection, resistance and tolerance):
– countermeasures for cryptographic implementations
– countermeasures for firmware of embedded devices, e.g., for bootloaders
– detection countermeasures, e.g., control flow integrity
– HW/SW co-design countermeasures for CPU architectures
•Design tools for analysis of fault attacks and countermeasures:
– early estimation of fault attack robustness
– automatic applications of fault countermeasures
– formal methods and techniques for the verification of fault resiliency
Instructions for authors
Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors pub-
lished elsewhere or that was submitted in parallel to any other conference or work-
shop.  Submissions should be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, ac-
knowledgments or obvious references.  Papers should be up to 12 pages (including
bibliography and appendices), and formatted according to the provided template.
FDTC encourages the submission of short papers, which will also be subject to peer
review.  Authors are encouraged to introduce work in progress, novel applications
and corporate/industrial experiences.  Short papers will be evaluated with a focus
on novelty and potential for sparking the interest of the participants and future
research avenues.  Short paper submissions are limited to 6 pages, formatted as the
regular ones, and their title must include the text ”Short Paper:”.
All accepted papers (regular and short) will be published in an archival proceedings
volume by CPS and will be distributed at the time of the workshop. The submission
of final papers is managed by Conference Publishing Services (CPS), which directly
contacts the authors with instructions for finalizing and uploading the manuscripts.
At  least  one  author  of  each  accepted  paper  must  register  for  the  workshop  and
present the paper in order to be included in the proceedings. Additional submission
instructions and further information can be found at:fdtc-workshop.eu
