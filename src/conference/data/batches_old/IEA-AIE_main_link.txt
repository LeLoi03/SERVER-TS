Overview In the industry revolution 4.0, many Intelligent Systems and e-applications have been created to better serve the increasing needs of the people. They bring much benefits for working in industrial and social development. E-applications are electronically/network based applications for the social development of communities such as e-learning, e-commerce, e-governance, e-health and so forth. Those applications use electronic media and information and communication technologies to do their works. They are effective and feasible methods of systems to manage and process via the Internet. They also work on information and data of social networks. E-applications are one of the information technology solutions and become popular method worldwide. They provide highly effective management, reduces the time effort and money of individuals and organizations. Besides, the intelligent systems based on intelligent computing technology are the useful methods to solve problems for e-applications. They include a range of techniques, such as Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, Evolutionary Computing, Neuroscience & Bioscience, Soft Computing, IoT, Big Data. This special session at IEA/AIE aims to bring together professionals, engineers, academics and industrial people worldwide to discuss and exchange new ideas and the latest achievements in developing Intelligent Systems and e-applications Scope Relevant topics include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Intelligent tutoring system 
 Intelligent Problem Solver 
 Intelligent Agent for management systems 
 Intelligent Information Systems 
 Tools and Technology for Knowledge Management

*Announcement: For those who cannot obtain a visa in time or are unable to attend for any reason, virtual video presentations will be considered and allowed for presenters. 
 Authors are invited to submit their papers in English of up to 12 single spaced pages including references, and presenting the results of original research or innovative practical applications relevant to the conference. Practical experiences with state-of-the-art AI methodologies are also acceptable when they reflect lessons of unique value to the conference attendees. Shorter works, up to 6 pages may be submitted as short papers representing work in progress or suggesting possible research directions. 
 Submitted papers must be formatted using the Springer LNCS/LNAI style and will be done electronically using the submission button above. The use of the LaTeX2e style file available from Springer is required. Papers submitted to IEA/AIE 2025 must not have already been published, or accepted for publication, or be under review for a journal or another conference. Submissions will go through a double blind review process by Program Committee members for originality, significance, technical merit, and clarity of presentation. In this regard, authors should not include any information that would identify them or their affiliations. Such information can however be added to the camera-ready version, if the paper is accepted. 
 The "best student paper award will be given to the best student submissions based on quality and novelty. Free registration fee and possible travel (if traveling is allowed) to the awarded winner will be offered by ACM SIGAI. Besides, there is other category for "best Technical paper" award and "best theory paper award; offered by Springer. The conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNCS/LNAI) series. A paper will be accepted either as a long or as a short paper. Long papers will be allocated 12 pages while short papers will be allocated 6 pages in the proceedings. 
 The conference will publish a Special issue in Applied Intelligence , after the conference selecting the best papers in terms of quality, reviews, and presentation. The selection will be done after the conference through emails sent to the corresponding authors with detailed instructions. Therefore we advise all authors to do their best in good presentation. More details will be explained in the conference sessions. 
 Authors of accepted papers will be allocated time for an oral presentation at the conference and will have the opportunity to present their work in a poster session. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to attend the conference to present the work. Authors must agree to this requirement prior to submitting their paper for review. 
 The conference proceedings will be published bySpringer in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNCS/LNAI)series. A paper will be accepted either as a long or as a short paper. Long papers will be allocated 12 pages while short papers will be allocated 6 pages in the proceedings.
