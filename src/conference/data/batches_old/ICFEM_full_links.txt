 Title:Formal Specification of Autonomy Features with ARE and KnowLang 
 Abstract: 
 Autonomous systems, such as autonomous vehicles, extend upstream the regular software-intensive systems with special autonomy features. The identification of such features is not necessarily an easy task. Sometimes, those can be explicitly stated by stakeholders or in preliminary material available to requirements engineers. Often though, they are implicit, so a process of formal specification intended to capture the autonomy features has to be undertaken. This paper elaborates on a methodology for capturing and specification of autonomy features where autonomy requirements are captured with ARE (Autonomy Requirements Engineering) and then are specified with KnowLang. a framework for knowledge representation and reasoning. In this approach, autonomy features are detected as special self-* objectives backed up by different capabilities and quality characteristics. The self-* objectives provide the system’s ability to autonomously discover, diagnose, and cope with various problems. The captured autonomy requirements are formally specified with the KnowLang notation and then compiled to a knowledge base that is to be used by the KnowLang Reasoner.

 Title:Synthesizing (Differential) Invariants by Reduction Non-Convex Programming to SDP 
 Abstract: 
 Invariant Generation plays a central role in the verification of programs and hybrid systems. As the constraint solving techniques advance rapidly in recent years, particularly optimization-based constraint solving, optimization based invariant generation becomes more and more promising and has been successfully applied to verification of programs and hybrid systems. However, how to deal with non-convex programming derived from invariant generation is still challenging. In this talk, I report our recent work on efficient invariant generation by reduction non-convex programming to SDP. 
 Mark Lawfordis Chair and Professor of the Department of Computing and Software at McMaster University (Canada). He is a Co-Founder and a past Director of McMaster Centre for Software Certification (McSCert), the 2024 IEEE TCSE Synergy award recipient. He joined McMaster University in 1998, where he helped to develop the software engineering and mechatronics engineering programs. Throughout his career he has work with industry on the practical application of formal methods and model based software engineering to safety critical real-time software. After working with industry partners in the nuclear and medical domains earlier in his career, over the past decade he has increasingly focused on working with OEMs on assurance of automotive systems. 
 Title:Challenges and Opportunities in Assurance of Software Defined Vehicle 
 Abstract: 
 Automotive innovation is increasingly software driven. As a result of the competitive environment requiring a yearly release of new automotive models featuring the latest driver assistance features and innovation in electrification, safety critical software is being developed at an unprecedented scale on extremely tight deadlines. To be competitive automotive manufacturers and parts suppliers need to change how they develop and assure software intensive systems. This presents a tremendous opportunity for researchers in the application of formal methods and model based software engineering to have a significant impact on industry practice. In this talk we highlight our recent work on model based software engineering, incremental assurance and the potential for applications of formal methods to help the automotive industry make the transition to the Software Defined vehicle.

 Keynote Speakers 
 Graeme Smithis an Associate Professor of Computer Science at The University of Queensland and Principal Scientist of the Defence Science and Technology Group (Australia). Prior to his current position he held research positions with the Software Verification Research Centre (Australia), GMD First (Germany), the Technical University of Berlin, and the Centre de Recherche en Informatique de Nancy (France). His research interests are in the application of formal techniques to functional correctness and security of concurrent systems. His most recent work focuses on how the effects of compiler and hardware optimisations on concurrent programs interact with information flow security. 
 Title:Compositional reasoning at the software/hardware interface 
 Abstract: 
 Rely/guarantee reasoning provides a compositional approach to reasoning about multi-threaded programs. It is sound under the assumption that the individual threads execute in a sequentially consistent manner. However, this is not the case on modern multicore processors which routinely employ out-of-order execution for efficiency gains. This loss of sequential consistency has no effects on the functionality of high-level programs that are data-race free, and for those programs rely/guarantee reasoning remains sound. However, this is not the case for code developed to include data races for efficiency, such as operating system routines and programming library data structures - the code on which much of our software depends. 
 In this talk, I will explain the effects of out-of-order execution on such code and how soundness of rely/guarantee reasoning can be restored by using additional checks. I will also look at how these checks apply to reasoning about low-level security vulnerabilities, such as Spectre. 
 Yuxi Fuis a professor of the Department of Computer Science, Shanghai Jiao Tong University. His research interest is in theoretical computer science. His publications cover topics in type theory, semantics, concurrency theory, theory of interaction, equivalence checking. He developed theory of interaction as a general theory that gives a uniform account of both computation models and interaction models. The theory is based on Thesis on Interaction, which is an interactive version of Thesis on Computation (Church-Turing Thesis). The overall goal of the general model theory is to provide a model independent foundation for both the programming theory and the computing theory. In the area of equivalence checking, he has solved a number of open problems, including the decidability of branching bisimilarity for BPA, the decidability of the branching bisimilarity of the epsilon-pushing PDA and epsilon-popping PDA. Currently his main focus is on the complexity of VASS reachability. 
 Title:A Theory for Interaction 
 Abstract: 
 A general theory for interaction is outlined. The theory features a model independent appraoch to concurrency and process models. Within the framework equality theory, expressiveness theory are studied. And a Thesis for Interaction is proposed as the foundation for interaction theory. 
 Yamine AIT AMEURis Full Professor since 2000. Since Sept 2011, he is at Toulouse INP (National Polytechnique Institute) in Toulouse (France) and member of the Toulouse research institute in computing (IRIT-CNRS). Two main important aspects characterize his research activities. On the one hand the fundamental aspects through the development and use of state based formal modelling techniques based on refinement and proofs, in particular Event-B and explicit formalisation of the semantics of domain knowledge using formalised ontology models. On the other, hand, practical aspects, through the development of operational applications, allowing to validate the proposed approaches. Embedded systems in avionics, engineering, interactive systems, CO2 capture are some of the application domains targeted by this work 
 Title:Separation of Concerns for Complexity Mitigation in System and Domain Formal Modelling – A Dive into Algebraic Event-B Theories 
 Abstract: 
 Formal methods have shown their ability and efficiency in the design, analysis and verification of safety critical complex software systems. A crucial challenge for formal methods nowadays is to make them reasonably accessible, as to foster a wider adoption across system engineering, and make their implementation and deployment more operational for non-expert engineers and researchers alike. From our point of view, promoting the reuse and sharing of explicitly formalised elements such as models, theories, proofs, etc. contributes, undoubtedly, to the dissemination of these methods. As a result, reuse mechanisms must be defined and integrated into development processes such as refinement, abstraction, composition/decomposition, etc. 
 In this talk, we will discuss state -based formal methods, namely the Event-B method. We report on our findings about the definition of algebraic theories that are utilised within Event-B model refinement chains. In our method, Event-B models borrow operators, axioms, theorems, proof and rewrite rules from these theories. Relying on their well-definedness, these operators, axioms, theorems and proof and rewrite rules are useful to discharge the proof obligations generated for these models, and contribute to reducing development efforts, as theorems of the theories are proved once and for all. The approach is illustrated on the generation of new proof obligations and on system models conformance to engineering standards.

Journal-First Presentations 
 ICFEM 2023 is inviting journal-first presentations of papers published recently in the following journals: 
 ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems 
 ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology 
 Formal Aspects of Computing 
 Formal Methods in System Design 
 IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 
 Theoretical Computer Science 
 The presentations will offer the authors an opportunity to speak directly to their peers in the community, and also enrich the ICFEM program. The journal-first presentation will be listed in the conference program, yet the corresponding papers will not be part of the ICFEM proceedings as they have been published through the journals. At least one author of each accepted journal-first presentation must register for and attend the ICFEM conference to present the paper. 
 Evaluation and Selection 
 A journal-first presentation submitted to ICFEM must adhere to the following criteria: 
 The journal paper is in the scope of ICFEM 2023. 
 The paper was accepted by one of the participating journals no earlier than January 1, 2022. 
 The paper reports completely new research results or presents novel contributions that were not previously reported in prior work. 
 The paper does not extend prior work solely with additional proofs or algorithms, additional empirical results, or minor enhancements or variants of the results presented in the prior work. 
 The paper has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, journal-first programs of other conferences. 
 Each submission will be evaluated according to these criteria. In case that the number of submissions is higher than expected, eligible submissions may be selected to be presented at the conference, and priority will be given to the papers that best fit the conference program. 
 How to Submit 
 Interested authors should submit a short presentation proposal consisting of the paper title, abstract, a short statement on how the work satisfies the above criteria, and the PDF of the original journal paper. Please submit a single PDF file and list all authors of the original journal paper as authors in EasyChair. No special formatting is required.

Doctoral Symposium Paper Submission 
 The ICFEM Doctoral Symposium is an international forum for PhD students studying all areas related to formal methods for software, hardware and system development. This forum is an excellent opportunity bringing together PhD students and well-known established researchers from the formal methods community. It will also provide PhD students with fruitful feedback and advice on their research approach and enable them to interact with other PhD students in order to stimulate the exchange of ideas and the sharing of experiences among participants. In summary, the PhD forum will provide PhD students with an ideal opportunity to present, share and discuss their research in a constructive and critical scientific atmosphere. 
 We seek submissions from PhD students who have either determined the direction of their thesis research (probably with some preliminary results already published), but who still have substantial work to complete; or PhD student participants who are in the early stages of their dissertations. It is not required to have a paper accepted at the main conference in order to participate in the ICFEM Doctoral Symposium. 
 Submissions to the Doctoral Symposium should include: Title of the research, the author name (single name) and affiliation; Context and motivation; Problem statement and related work; Proposed solutions and current research efforts, their significance, methodology, results and analysis, and future work. The paper should be prepared using theLNCS formatand submitted in PDF format via EasyChair. 
 We accept two types of submissions:(a)2-page extended abstracts which will not be included in the ICFEM proceedings; and(b)6-page papers which will be published in the LNCS volume of Springer as part of the main ICFEM proceedings. 
 Authors with accepted submissions are expected to attend the Doctoral Symposium in person to present their work. A discounted registration fee for Doctoral Symposium participants will be announced later.

 Historically, formal methods academic research and practical software development have had limited mutual interactions — except possibly in specialized domains such as safety-critical software. In recent times, the outlook has considerably improved: on the one hand, formal methods research has delivered more flexible techniques and tools that can support various aspects of the software development process — from user requirements elicitation, to design, implementation, verification and validation, as well as the creation of documentation. On the other hand, software engineering has developed a growing interest in rigorous techniques applied at scale. 
 The FormaliSE conference series promotes work at the intersection of the formal methods and software engineering communities, providing a venue to exchange ideas, experiences, techniques, and results. We believe more collaboration between these two communities can be mutually beneficial by fostering the creation of formal methods that are practically useful and by helping develop higher-quality software. 
 Originally a workshop event, since 2018 FormaliSE has been organized as a conference co-located with ICSE. The 13th edition of FormaliSE will also take place as a co-located conference of ICSE 2025. 
 Area of interest include: 
 requirements formalization and formal specification; 
 approaches, methods and tools for verification and validation; 
 formal approaches to safety and security related issues; 
 analysis of performance and other non-functional properties based on formal approaches; 
 scalability of formal method applications 
 integration of formal methods within the software development lifecycle (e.g., change -management, continuous integration, regression testing, and deployment) 
 model-based engineering approaches; 
 correctness-by-construction approaches for software and systems engineering; 
 application of formal methods to specific domains, e.g., autonomous, cyber-physical, intelligent, and IoT systems; 
 formal methods for AI-based systems (FM4AI), and AI applied in formal method approaches (AI4FM); 
 formal methods in a certification context 
 case studies developed/analyzed with formal approaches 
 experience reports on the application of formal methods to real-world problems; 
 guidelines to use formal methods in practice; 
 usability of formal methods.

 The Ready Room will be available throughout the week. There will be some tables with computers where people can edit presentations (bring on a USB stick) and upload presentations to the presentation rooms through the Contact 1 website. There will also be AV technicians to help if needed. 
 You do not need to use the Ready Room: You have several choices: You can upload your presentation from your own computer in advance of your session (days in advance even) at the Contact 1 website (you will be sent a link). Or you can plug your computer in using an HDMI cable when you are starting your presentation. This last option is available but not recommended, since it increases the chance of delays. 
 There will be some tables and couches in the Ready Room where you can get work done, or have small get-togethers with people. 
 This room will not be ‘quiet’. If you want a quiet place to work or chill out (library quiet, no talking) then Room 209 will be available much of the time. 
 The Ready Room will also have some poster boards.

 This room will not be ‘quiet’. If you want a quiet place to work or chill out (library quiet, no talking) then Room 209 will be available much of the time. 
 The Ready Room will also have some poster boards.

 Call for Papers 
 We accept papers in three categories: 
 Full research papers | describing original research work and results. We encourage authors to include validation of their contributions by means of a case study or experiments. We also welcome research papers focusing on tools and tool development. 
 Case study papers | discussing a significant application that suggests general lessons learned and motivates further research, or empirically validates theoretical results (such as a technique’s scalability). 
 Research ideas papers | describing new ideas in preliminary form, in a way that can stimulate interesting discussions at the conference, and suggest future work. 
 All papers submitted to the FormaliSE 2025 conference must be written in English, must be unpublished original work, and must not be under review or submitted elsewhere at the time of submission. Submissions must comply with the FormaliSE’s lightweight double-anonymous review process (see below). 
 Full research papers and case study papers can take up to 10 pages including all text, figures, tables and appendices, but excluding references. Research ideas papers can take up to 4 pages, plus up to 1 additional page solely for references. 
 To avoid that authors waste time fitting their papers into the stated limit at the expense of presentation clarity, paper lengths slightly exceeding the stated limit will still be considered, provided that the reviewers find that the presentation is of high quality. 
 All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to theIEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (i.e., title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type). In LaTeX, use\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}without including thecompsocorcompsocconfoptions. Note that IEEE format is being used this year, whereas last year it was ACM format, hence the appearance will differ from year to year. 
 To submit a paper to FormaliSE 2025 usethe following HotCRP link. 
 href="#lightweight-double-anonymous-review-process-for-papers" - Lightweight Double-Anonymous Review Process for Papers
As in recent editions, FormaliSE 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous process. Authors must omit their names and institutions from the title page, cite their own work in the third person, and omit acknowledgments that may reveal their identity or affiliation. The purpose is reducing chances of reviewer bias influenced by the authors’ identities. The double-anonymous process is, however, lightweight, which means that it should not pose a heavy burden for authors, nor should make a paper’s presentation weaker or more difficult to review. Also, advertising the paper as part of your usual research activities (for example, on your personal web-page, in a pre-print archive, by email, in talks or discussions with colleagues) is permitted without penalties. 
 PAPER SELECTION 
 Each paper will be reviewed by at least three program committee members that will judge its overall quality in terms of its soundness, significance, novelty, verifiability, and presentation clarity. 
 FormaliSE 2025 will adopt a lightweight response process: if all the reviewers of a given paper agree that a clarification from the authors regarding a specific question could move the paper from “borderline” to “accept”, the chairs will relay the reviewers’ questions to the authors by email, and then share their reply with the reviewers in HotCRP. The goal of lightweight responses is reducing the chance of random decisions on borderline papers. Hence, they will only be used for a minority of submissions; most papers will not require such an author response. Nevertheless, we would ask the corresponding authors of all submissions to make sure that they are available to answer questions by email upon request. 
 PUBLICATION 
 All accepted papers are published as part of the ICSE 2025 Proceedings in the ACM and IEEE Digital Libraries. 
 At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference and present the paper at the conference — physically or, if the circumstances do not allow so, virtually. Failure to register an author will result in a paper being removed from the proceedings. 
 Keynotes 
 Adversarial Perturbations and Self-Defenses for Large Language Models on Coding Task 
 Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for coding tasks including writing and reasoning about code. They improve upon previous neural network models of code that already demonstrated competitive results when performing tasks such as code summarization and identifying code vulnerabilities . However, it is known that these pre-LLM code models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, i.e. small syntactic perturbations that do not change the program’s semantics, such as the inclusion of “dead code” through false conditions, the addition of inconsequential print statements, or change in control flow, designed to “fool” the models. LLMs can also be vulnerable to the same adversarial perturbations. In this talk we discuss the effect of adversarial perturbations on coding tasks with LLMs and propose effective defenses against such adversaries. The coding tasks we’ll consider include both classification (e.g., use LLMs for summarization, vulnerability detection) and code generation (e.g., use LLMs for code completion, based on prompts plus code snippets).

Assuring AI in Autonomous Driving: Challenges and Emerging Approaches 
 Abstract:Artificial intelligence plays a critical role in autonomous driving, yet it introduces significant assurance challenges. Unlike traditional software, AI lacks explicit specifications and is applied to inherently uncertain, complex, and open problems such as road environment perception. Furthermore, modern AI systems are often opaque, making interpretability and verification difficult. These issues complicate the development of assurance methods that can ensure safety and reliability. 
 In this talk, I will review current approaches and industry standards for AI assurance in autonomous driving, including scenario-based testing and uncertainty estimation. I will discuss assurance methods for both hybrid systems — where AI functions as a component within a classical software stack — and end-to-end AI-driven systems. Finally, I will explore emerging directions for handling edge-case scenarios, including the use of foundation models and dual-processing architectures as potential solutions for enhancing the safety and robustness of end-to-end AI systems.

 As in previous years, the proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. 
 Papers should be written in English and should not exceed 16 pages (excluding references and appendix) in the Springer's LNCS format. Each submission will undergo a rigoroussingle-blind pear-review process by at least three experts. Extended versions of selected papers will berecommended to special issues of Formal Aspects of Computing after the conference proceedings. Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting can be found at the Springer website (more detailshere). 
 We suggest, though it is not obligatory, that authors include line numbers in their submissions to facilitate the review process. Additionally, authors are encouraged to mention if there are any available artifacts related to their research, such as datasets, software, or supplementary materials, which could enhance the understanding and reproducibility of their work. 
 Journal-First Presentations 
 ICFEM 2025 is inviting journal-first presentations of papers published recently in the following journals: 
 ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems 
 ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology 
 Formal Aspects of Computing 
 Formal Methods in System Design 
 IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering 
 Theoretical Computer Science 
 The presentations will offer the authors an opportunity to speak directly to their peers in the community and also enrich the ICFEM program. The journal-first presentation will be listed in the conference program yet the corresponding papers will not be part of the ICFEM proceedings as they have been published through the journals. At least one author of each accepted journal-first presentation must register for and attend the ICFEM conference to present the paper. 
 Evaluation and Selection 
 Detailed criteria on journal-first presentation submitted to ICFEM is TBD. 
 How to Submit 
 Interested authors should submit a short presentation proposal consisting of the paper title, abstract, a short statement on how the work satisfies the above criteria, and the PDF of the original journal paper. Please submit a single PDF file and list all authors of the original journal paper as authors in EasyChair. No special formatting is required. 
 Doctoral Symposium Paper Submission 
 The ICFEM Doctoral Symposium is an international forum for PhD students studying all areas related to formal methods for software, hardware and system development. This forum is an excellent opportunity bringing together PhD students and well-known established researchers from the formal methods community. It will also provide PhD students with fruitful feedback and advice on their research approach and enable them to interact with other PhD students in order to stimulate the exchange of ideas and the sharing of experiences among participants. In summary, the PhD forum will provide PhD students with an ideal opportunity to present, share and discuss their research in a constructive and critical scientific atmosphere. 
 We seek submissions from PhD students who have either determined the direction of their thesis research (probably with some preliminary results already published), but who still have substantial work to complete; or PhD student participants who are in the early stages of their dissertations. It is not required to have a paper accepted at the main conference in order to participate in the ICFEM Doctoral Symposium. 
 Submissions to the Doctoral Symposium should include: Title of the research, the author name (single name) and affiliation; Context and motivation; Problem statement and related work; Proposed solutions and current research efforts, their significance, methodology, results and analysis, and future work. The paper should be prepared using theLNCS formatand submitted in PDF format via EasyChair. 
 We accept two types of submissions:(a)2-page extended abstracts which will not be included in the ICFEM proceedings; and(b)6-page papers which will be published in the LNCS volume of Springer as part of the main ICFEM proceedings. 
 Authors with accepted submissions are expected to attend the Doctoral Symposium in person to present their work. A discounted registration fee for Doctoral Symposium participants will be announced later.
