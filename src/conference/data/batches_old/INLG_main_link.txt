 Submissions & Format 
 Three kinds of papers can be submitted: 
 Long papersare most appropriate for presenting substantial research results and must not exceed eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages of ethical considerations, supplementary material statements, and references. The supplementary material statement provides detailed descriptions to support the reproduction of the results presented in the paper (see below for details). The final versions of long papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account. 
 Short papersare more appropriate for presenting an ongoing research effort and must not exceed four (4) pages, plus unlimited pages of ethical considerations, supplementary material statements, and references. The final versions of short papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account. 
 Demo papersshould be no more than two (2) pages, including references, and should describe implemented systems relevant to the NLG community. It also should include a link to a short screencast of the working software. In addition, authors of demo papers must be willing to present a demo of their system during INLG 2025. 
 Submissions should followhref="https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines" - ACL Author Guidelines
and policies for submission, review and citation, and be anonymised for double blind reviewing. Please use ACL style files; LaTeX style files and Microsoft Word templates are available athttps://acl-org.github.io/ACLPUB/formatting.html. 
 Authors must honor the ethical code set out in theACL Code of Ethics. If your work raises any ethical issues, you should include an explicit discussion of those issues. This will also be taken into account in the review process. You may findhref="https://aclrollingreview.org/responsibleNLPresearch/" - this checklist
of use. 
 Authors are strongly encouraged to ensure that their work is reproducible; see, e.g., the followinghref="https://2021.aclweb.org/calls/reproducibility-checklist/" - reproducibility checklist
. Papers involving any kind of experimental results (human judgments, system outputs, etc) should incorporate a data availability statement into their paper. Authors are asked to indicate whether the data is made publicly available. If the data is not made available, authors should provide a brief explanation why. (E.g. because the data contains proprietary information.) Astatement guideis available on thehref="https://inlg2025.github.io/" - INLG 2025 website
. 
 To submit a long or short paper to INLG 2025, authors can either submit directly or commit a paper previously reviewed by ARR via thehref="https://softconf.com/p/inlg2025/" - same paper submission site
. For direct submissions, the deadline for submitting papers isJuly 14, 2025, 11:59:59 AOE. If committing an ARR paper to INLG, the submission is also made through the INLG 2025 paper submission site, indicating the link of the paper on OpenReview. The deadline for committing an ARR paper to INLG isAugust 7, 2025, 11:59:59 AOE, and the last eligible ARR paper submission deadline for INLG 2025 isMay 19, 2025. It is important to note that when committing an ARR paper to INLG, it should be submitted through the INLG 2025 paper submission site, just like a direct submission paper, with the only difference being the need to provide the OpenReview link to the paper and to provide an optional author response to reviews. 
 Demo papers should be submitted directly through the INLG 2025href="https://softconf.com/p/inlg2025/" - paper submission site
byJuly 24, 2025, 11:59:59 PM AOE. 
 All accepted papers will be published in the INLG 2025 proceedings and included in the ACL anthology. A paper accepted for presentation at INLG 2025 must not have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings. Dual submission to other conferences is permitted, provided that authors clearly indicate this in the submission form. If the paper is accepted at both venues, the authors will need to choose which venue to present at, since they can not present the same paper twice. Submitted papers for review at INLG 2025 must not be published elsewhere until after the notification of acceptance. Finally, at least one of the authors of an accepted paper must register to attend the conference.
