Málaga 
 Málaga is a thriving and dynamic city in Southern Spain. Bathed by the Mediterranean Sea and surrounded by Málaga Mountains, the city enjoys a warm climate tempered by the proximity of the sea. This has contributed to make Málaga one of the main touristic destinations in Europe. The city has however much more to offer than sun and beaches. 
 Indeed, Málaga is a city of Art & Culture: having been founded by the Phoenicians in 7th century BC and subsequently ruled by Romans, Moors, and Castilian Kings, the city comprises numerous monuments (the Roman Theater, the Moorish Fortress and Castle, the Cathedral, etc.), churches, palaces, and noteworthy buildings that illustrate this historical past. 
 Málaga was also the home town of Pablo Ruiz Picasso, and not surprisingly it is also known as the City of Museums with +30 museums devoted to Painting, Sculpture, Music, Jewellery, Sports, just to name a few. 
 All of the above can be complemented by letting oneself be embedded in Malagueño life style, enjoying the local gastronomy, the warm weather, and the hospitality of the people. And if you need more, Málaga is an excellent base for exploring nearby places, thanks to its exceptional transport infrastructure.

 General InformationThe Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025) will present the latest high-quality results in genetic and evolutionary computation. Topics include genetic algorithms, genetic programming, ant colony optimization and swarm intelligence, complex systems, evolutionary combinatorial optimization and metaheuristics, evolutionary machine learning, evolutionary multiobjective optimization, evolutionary numerical optimization, neuroevolution, real-world applications, theory, hybrids and more. Thehref="Tracks" - full list of tracks
is available. 
 The GECCO 2025 Program Committee invites the submission of technical papers describing your best work in genetic and evolutionary computation. Full papers of at most 8 pages (excluding references) should present original work that meets the high-quality standards of GECCO. Accepted full papers appear in the ACM digital library as part of theMain Proceedingsof GECCO. Any content/appendix beyond the 8 pages limit (excluding references) should be submitted as supplementary material. Accepted full papers appear in the ACM digital library as part of the Main Proceedings of GECCO. For full papers, a separate abstract needs to be submitted first byJanuary 22, 2025. Full papers are due by thenon-extensibledeadline ofJanuary 29, 2025. 
 Each paper submitted to GECCO will be rigorously evaluated in a double-blind review process. Evaluation is done on a per-track basis, ensuring high interest and high expertise of the reviewers. Review criteria include the significance of the work, technical soundness, novelty, clarity, writing quality, relevance and, if applicable, sufficiency of information to permit replication. 
 Besides full papers, poster-only papers of at most 4 pages (including references) may be submitted. Poster-only papers should present original work that has not yet reached the maturity and completeness of research results that are published as full papers at GECCO. The review of poster-only papers follows the same double-blind process mentioned above. Accepted poster-only papers will appear in the ACM digital library as part of theCompanion Proceedingsof GECCO. Poster-only papers are due by the non-extensible deadline ofJanuary 29, 2025, and no abstract needs to be submitted first. 
 By submitting a paper, the author(s) agree that, if their paper is accepted, they will: 
 Submit a final, revised, camera-ready version to the publisher on or before the camera-ready deadline 
 Register at least one author before | May 8, 2025 | to attend the conference | (that is, register as an in-person or online PRESENTER) 
 Attend the conference (at least one author) 
 Present the accepted paper at the conference 
 Each paper accepted needs to have at least one author registered. If an author is presenting more than one paper at the conference, she/he does not pay any additional registration fees.

 Paper CategoriesFull papers 
 Papers in this category concern the traditional full papers of at most8 pages (excluding references), that are aimed to present original new work in genetic and evolutionary computation that meets the high-quality standards of GECCO. Accepted full papers appear in the ACM digital library as part of the main proceedings of GECCO. 
 Mandatory abstract submissions of at most 200 words for full papers are due by the non-extensible deadline ofJanuary 22 2025; submissions of the full papers themselves are due by the non-extensible deadline ofJanuary 29, 2025.Poster-only papers 
 Submissions are allowed that are targeted at being a poster-only paper of at most4 pages (including references). Such papers should still present work in genetic and evolutionary computation that is original and new, but has not yet reached the stage of the more mature, complete research results that are typically published in full papers at GECCO. Accepted poster-only papers appear in the ACM digital library as part of the companion proceedings of GECCO. Poster-only papers are due by thenon-extensibledeadline ofJanuary 29, 2025. All conditions for the submission of full papers also apply to poster-only papers. 
 Paper Acceptance Regulations (New)For each track at GECCO, at most CEILING(40% * N_submitted_to_track) papers shall be accepted as a full paper, where N_submitted_to_track is the number of full papers submitted to that track. Track chairs are encouraged to only accept papers that they feel adhere to the standards of GECCO. I.e., the acceptance rate of a track should be lower than 40% if there is not a sufficient number of good submitted papers according to the track chairs. 
 There is no maximum acceptance rate on poster papers submitted as poster paper nor on poster papers submitted originally as full paper. It is up to the track chairs to decide the minimum poster-paper quality. Papers that are deemed by the track chairs and/or the EiC to not be a proper fit within the track they were submitted to nor any other track in the conference, will be desk rejected. 
 Papers that are deemed by the track chairs and/or the EiC to not be a proper fit within the track they were submitted to, but are a good fit within another track according to all involved track chairs and/or EiC, will be moved to another track before the reviewing process starts unless the authors decide to retract the paper. To this end, upon signalling said misfit, the EiC will reach out to the authors to inform them of their options (be moved or retracted). This holds both for the primary and the secondary track choice for a paper. 
 Best Paper Regulations (New)Any paper that was submitted to a track, but was moved to another track by the GECCO organization, counts toward the track it was moved to, not the one it was originally submitted to. A track for which there are less than 10 full-length submitted papers is fully excluded from the Best Paper Award (BPA) procedure. A track is allowed to have a track-specific BPA if at least 30 full-length papers were submitted to that track (i.e., poster papers do not qualify). 
 Two or more tracks are allowed to have a joint-track BPA if at least 30 full-length papers were submitted to those tracks combined (i.e., poster papers do not qualify) and there is at least one paper nominated for each of the constituent tracks. The EiC decides upon such groupings in agreement with the involved track chairs. In case no consensus can be reached, the EiC decides. 
 No track may be in more than one group of tracks with which a joint-track BPA is associated. For any track, there can be at most one BPA. For any group of tracks with which a joint-track BPA is associated, there can be at most one BPA. For any BPA, there may not be less than 2 nominated papers. For any track-specific BPA, there may not be more than 3 nominated papers. For any group of tracks with which a joint-track BPA is associated, there may not be more than 4 nominated papers. 
 Best paper nominations are decided upon per track and by the track chairs. Any paper for which a secondary track has been assigned shall only be considered for nomination in its primary track. Track chairs may decide not to nominate any paper for their track, even if there are at least 15 unique full-length submitted papers for that track. If any track chair has any conflict of interest (including, but not limited to, co-authorship) with regard to any paper being nominated, that track chair shall be excluded from making the decision for paper nomination and be replaced by the EiC. If the EiC also has a conflict of interest with that paper, the GC shall replace the EiC in this matter. If the GC also has a conflict of interest with that paper, the SIGEVO Officers will take the final decision. Any paper for which the EiC or the GC is a co-author cannot be nominated for a BPA. 
 Double-Blind Review ProcessEach paper submitted to GECCO will be rigorously reviewed in a double-blind review process. In other words, authors should not know who the reviewers of their work are and reviewers should not know who the authors are. To this end, the following information is very important: 
 Submitted papers should be ANONYMIZED. This means that they should NOT contain any element that may reveal the identity of their authors. This includes author names, affiliations, and acknowledgments. Moreover, any references to any of the author's own work should be made as if the work belonged to someone else. 
  
 If you are using LaTeX, consider using the following header to remove author listing and to remove sections marked as containing identifying information (e.g. Acknowledgements): 
 \documentclass[dvipsnames,format=sigconf,anonymous=true,review=true]{acmart}Publication PolicyAll accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Simultaneously submitting work to another conference or journal that is substantially similar to work also submitted to GECCO, isNOT ALLOWED. Material may later be revised and submitted to a journal, if this is permitted by the journal. 
 It is alsoNOT ALLOWEDto submit work to GECCO that is substantially similar to work already accepted or published in other conferences or journals. GECCO is however still interested in such related publications. For this reason, researchers are invited to submit abstracts of their work recently published in top-tier conferences and journals to the Hot Off the Press track. Contributions will be selected to be presented at GECCO based on quality and interest to the GECCO community. 
 A notable exception to the above is the simultaneous submission of work to arXiv. Reviewers will be asked not to actively look for such submissions, but if they are aware of them, this will not constitute a conflict of interest. 
 The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date will be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. 
 The submitted contributions will be checked using anti-plagiarism systems. Those papers or posters with a high percentage of plagiarism, exceeding the page limit, simultaneously submitted to another conference or journal, or falling out of the scope of the conference will be rejected without review. 
 As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to allACM Publications Policies, including ACM's newhref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" - Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects
. 
 Supplementary MaterialIt is possible to submit supplementary material (e.g., videos, a PDF appendix, source code, data, mathematical proofs) in addition to the PDF of the paper. In particular, we encourage authors to submit source code to support replication of experiments as described in their paper. At the time of submission, all the supplementary material must also be anonymized. 
 You can upload supplementary material as a PDF, ZIP archive (.zip) or a compressed tarball (.tgz or .tar.gz). Please use informative filenames and do not upload more than 10MB. Consider making the code available in a publicly accessible repository with a declared plan to enable permanent accessibility (e.g. zenodo). 
 The supplementary material may or may not be considered when evaluating the paper, at the discretion of the reviewers.
