 About 
 18th International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Security for Information Systems 
 CISIS’25 Proceedings will be published by Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems (TENTATIVE) 
 CISIS aims to offer a meeting opportunity for academic and industry-related researchers belonging to the various, vast communities of Computational Intelligence, Information Security, and Data Mining. The need for intelligent, flexible behaviour by large, complex systems, especially in mission-critical domains, is intended to be the catalyst and the aggregation stimulus for the overall event. In conjunction with: 20th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems HAIS 2025, 16th International Conference on EUropean Transnational Educational ICEUTE 2025 and 20th International Conference on Soft Computing Models in Industrial and Environmental Applications SOCO 2025.

 haisconference.eu | The 20th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2025)combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem-solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real-world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness, high dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both our knowledge and raw data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way. HAIS series of conferences provides an interesting opportunity to present and discuss the latest theoretical advances and real-world applications in this multidisciplinary research field.
