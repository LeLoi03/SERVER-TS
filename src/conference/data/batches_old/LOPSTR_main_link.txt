 35th International Symposium on 
 Logic-Based Program Synthesis and Transformation 
  
 LOPSTR 2025 
 University of Calabria, Rende, Italy | September 9-10, 2025 
 Co-located withhref="https://ppdp25.github.io/site/" - PPDP 2025

 Overview 
 The aim of thehref="http://lopstr.webs.upv.es/" - LOPSTR series
is to stimulate and promote international research and collaboration on logic-based program development. LOPSTR is open to contributions in logic-based program development in any language paradigm. LOPSTR has a reputation for being a lively, friendly forum for presenting and discussing work in progress. 
 LOPSTR 2025 will be held in-person atUniversity of Calabriain Rende, Italy and will be co-located withhref="https://ppdp25.github.io/site/" - PPDP 2025
andhref="https://iclp25.demacs.unical.it/" - ICLP 2025
. At least one of the authors of an accepted paper is required to attend the conference and present the paper. Information about venue and travel will be made available later. 
 Topics of interest cover all aspects of logic-based program development, all stages of the software life cycle, and issues of both programming-in-the-small and programming-in-the-large, including, but not limited to: 
 synthesis 
 transformation 
 specialization 
 inversion 
 composition 
 optimisation 
 specification 
 analysis and verification 
 testing and certification 
 program and model manipulation 
 AI-methods for program development 
 verification and testing of AI-based systems 
 transformational techniques in software engineering 
 logic-based methods for security 
 logic-based methods for cyber-physical and distributed system 
 applications, tools and industrial practice 
 Survey papers that present some aspects of the above topics from a new perspective and papers that describe experience with industrial applications and case studies are also welcome. 
 History 
 LOPSTR is a renowned symposium that has been held for more than 30 years. The first meeting was held in Manchester, UK in 1991. Information about previous symposia can be foundhref="http://lopstr.webs.upv.es" - here

 Call for papers 
 TBAPAPER SUBMISSION 
 Submissions can be made in two categories: 
 Regular Papers (15 pages max.) 
 Short Papers (8 pages max.) 
 References will NOT count towards the page limit. Additional pages may be used for appendices not intended for publication. Reviewers are not required to read the appendices, and thus papers should be intelligible without them. All submissions must be written in English. 
 Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers/tools that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal conference, or workshop with refereed proceedings. 
 Submissions of Regular Papers must describe original work. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshop proceedings may be submitted (please contact the PC Chairs in case of questions). 
 Submissions of Short Papers may include presentations of exciting if not fully polished research or tool demonstrations that are of academic and industrial interest. Tool demonstrations should describe the relevant system, usability, and implementation aspects of a tool. 
 All accepted papers will be included in the conference proceedings and published by Springer as a Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) volume. 
 After the symposium, a selection of a few best papers will be invited for submission to rapid publication in the Journal of Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP). Authors of selected papers will be invited to revise and/or extend their submissions to be considered for publication. The papers submitted to TPLP will be subject to the journal's standard reviewing process. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 Authors should submit an electronic copy of the paper (written in English) in PDF, formatted in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science style. Each submission must include on its first page the paper title; authors and their affiliations; contact author's email; abstract; and three to four keywords which will be used to assist the PC in selecting appropriate reviewers for the paper.Authors should consult Springer's author instructions at thehref="https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines" - author's page
, and use their proceedings templates, eitherfor LaTeX(available also inOverleaf) orhref="https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/conference-proceedings/editors/word-template/19338734" - for Word
, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include theirORCID identifiersin their papers.In addition, upon acceptance, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign aConsent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. 
 Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their report. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use: 
 \pagestyle{plain} 
 \usepackage{lineno} 
 \linenumbers 
  
 Papers should be submitted via EasyChair:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lopstr2025
