 The 28th European Conference on Genetic Programming (EuroGP) 2025 conference will take place as part of EvoStar (Evo*). 
  
 EuroGP is the premier annual conference on Genetic Programming (GP), the oldest and the only meeting worldwide devoted specifically to this branch of evolutionary computation. It is always a high-quality, enjoyable, friendly event, attracting participants from all continents, and offering excellent opportunities for networking, informal contact, and exchange of ideas with fellow researchers. It will feature a mixture of oral presentations and poster sessions and invited keynote speakers. EuroGP is featured in the conference ranking databaseCORE.
