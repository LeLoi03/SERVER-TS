 About IWSM Mensura 
 TheIWSM Mensuraconference is the result of the joining of forces of theInternational Workshop on Software Measurementand theInternational Conference on Software Process and Product Measurement. Together they form the conference where new ideas from the world of academic research meet practical improvements from industry on topics of measuring software. 
 Each year practitioners and researchers from all over the world gather together to learn about new developments, test new ideas and exchange possible new solutions and applications.more
