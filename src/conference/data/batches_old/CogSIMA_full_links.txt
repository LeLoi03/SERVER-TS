 Duisburg at theRhineis the westernmost city in the Ruhr region, part of the Rhein-Ruhr metropole, thelargest contiguous conurbation in Germanyand the fifth largest in Europe (Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region). 
 In Germany, Duisburg stands for coal and steel (until the middle of the last century), but for the last 30 years it has been undergoing structural change towards new industrial fields (continuing high tech steel manufacturing) and regional and national tasks. The Port of Duisburg is thelargest inland port in the worldand one of the most central logistical hubs in Europe. 
 The entire region with the central cities of Duisburg, Essen, Bochum and Dortmund as well as 54 smaller local cities was chosen as one of theEuropean Capitals of Culture in 2010, highlighting in particular thecoexistenceofindustry,cultureand itscenturies-old social diversity. 
 The University of Duisburg-Essen is conveniently situated near several renowned destinations, including theUNESCO World Heritage sitesinCologneandAachen(cathedrals),Essen (Zeche Zollverein), and theRoman limes wallinXanten.

 How to Submit 
 We invite two types of submissions, regular papers and poster presentations, which will undergo a competitive review process. All papers must present original and unpublished work that is not currently under review elsewhere. Each paper will be reviewed by at least three independent referees. Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the conference. 
 Quantitative and/or qualitative methods and results are welcome, as well as hypotheses-driven or more open-ended exploratory work. Submissions must clearly outline the methodology (manipulations, measurements, environment and context, etc.) and technologies used, for both replicability and enabling in-depth review. In addition, research providing novel system designs, algorithms, interface technologies, and computational methods supporting elements of situation management are encouraged. Submitted papers should address issues related to the general domain of situation management. 
 Regular Papers (5-8 pages): describe new results that advance the state-of-the-art. Each accepted paper will be allocated approximately 25 minutes for the oral presentation during the conference. 
 Poster Presentations (3-5 pages): describe work in progress. Each accepted poster will be presented in a 5 min. talk in the poster session, and will be included in the final conference proceedings submitted to the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. 
 At least one author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference, unless the TPC grants permission for a substitute presenter arranged in advance of the event who is qualified both to present and answer questions. All paper submissions will be handled electronically in EDAS. Authors should prepare a Portable Document Format (PDF) version of their paper using thestylesheet templates provided by IEEE. 
 Papers must have been presented on-site at the conference in Duisburg to be included in thefinal conference proceedings submitted to the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. 
 Call for special session proposals 
 The CogSIMA 2025 Organizing Committee is welcoming proposals for Special Sessions on complex heterogeneous dynamical systems - of interacting humans, machines, and computer agents - whose collective behavior depends on their cognitive capabilities to comprehend, explain, predict, and act upon the surrounding operational situations. 
 The purpose of special sessions is to stimulate a focused discussion on new or innovative topics. Of particular interest are proposals that address “breaking news” research or topics different from traditional situation understanding and management related topics. Organizers of accepted special sessions will be asked to chair the session and will be consulted when finalizing the list of papers in the session. 
 Proposal Requirements 
 Each special session proposal should include an overview of the topic that identifies its relevance and introduces the papers to be presented. This description will be made available in the proceedings. Each proposal should also include a list of committed papers. 
 The following information must be included in a special session proposal: 
 Title of the proposed special session 
 Names and affiliations of the organizers | including brief bio and contact information 
 Session abstract (less than 250 words) | including the significance of the topic and the rationale for the proposed session 
 List of committed papers | including a tentative title, author list, and a short abstract for each paper. At least 5 papers are expected. 
 Evaluation Criteria 
 Special session proposals will be evaluated based on the importance of the topic, relevance to the cognitive and computational aspects of situation management, number of potential papers (assessed from the list of committed papers), and the qualification of the organizers. Once the proposal has been approved, it will be included among the sessions available for authors to submit their papers to. All papers submitted to a special session will be reviewed through the same review process as the regular papers of the conference to ensure that contributions are of high quality. If a special session has more papers accepted than the schedule can accommodate, some papers might be moved to other relevant sessions.

 Cognitive Situation Management 
 Obituary 
 We are very saddened by the passing of our Technical Committee’s Co-Chair Dr. Melita Hadzagic, who bravely fought lung cancer since 2021 and died peacefully in her sleep on the 22nd of July, at home, surrounded by her family. She served as Chief Scientist at OODA Technologies, Inc. in Canada, as Research Scientist at NATO STO CMRE, La Spezia, Italy, and as Research Scientist at CNRS UMR5218, Laboratoire de l’IMS, Université de Bordeaux, France. Melita will be remembered for the rigor and love of her work in the field of Information Analysis and Fusion. She will remembered for her contribution to the success of the IEEE SMC Technical Committee on Cognitive Situation Management and its CogSIMA conference series, as well as her involvement at other international conferences, her devotion to her family and friends around the world, her positivity and joy of life, and finally, her resilience and courage in the face of illness. Her warm and generous spirit will be fondly remembered by all who knew her. 
 Mission 
 The Technical Committee on Cognitive Situation Management sees its mission in the following: 
 Creating a rich, diverse and comprehensive scientific research environment for advancing the science, applications, and education in the field of cognitive situation management by fostering inter-disciplinary approaches from computer science, human-centered artificial intelligence, cognitive science, human factors research and other related fields; 
 Organizing scientific conferences, workshops and technical sessions to provide researchers, practitioners and government personnel effective forums for exchanging ideas and result to promote advancements in the field of cognitive situation management; 
 Promoting and supporting publications of research and application papers, dedicated special issues and reports in journals, magazines and in electronic media; 
 Encouraging, advising and educating young researchers in the field of cognitive situation management; 
 Promoting and facilitating inter-disciplinary scientific cooperation with other professional societies and events within IEEE and other international organizations, esp. exploring synergies with other SMCS Technical Committees focusing related research fields or enabling technologies and application areas for Cognitive Situation Management. 
 Background 
 In many of today’s dynamic, data-rich domains, characterized by complex interactions between multiple agents (such as traffic control, infrastructure and cybersecurity monitoring, disaster response and crisis management, communications and defense), maintaining situation awareness becomes increasingly challenging for both human and non-human actors. Yet, an agent’s situation awareness represents the foundation for its informed decision making to take the appropriate actions for reaching its goals, whereas undesirable outcomes can often be traced back to a lack of situation awareness prompting the wrong course of action. Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, such as Large Language Models (e.g., ChatGPT), driver assistance systems or autopilots, offer unprecedented technical capabilities of augmenting their human users’ capabilities and assisting their decision making. Yet, these have already revealed their intricacies when being deployed in complex socio-technical systems, triggering novel problems like the generation of mis- and disinformation or AI overreliance, thereby potentially rather impairing the overall system’s situation awareness and thus performance if these effects are not appropriately considered. 
 Therefore, the research field of cognitive situation management promotes a holistic, inherently interdisciplinary approach to addressing these challenges, incorporating the complex interactions within socio-technical-cyber systems and treating situations as first-class citizens in information processing. This involves tackling the questions of how computational systems can assess and reason upon situations and exchange this information with their human users, how to improve and measure shared situation awareness of human-machine systems, and further challenges in this realm. 
 Often situations involve a large number of inter-dependent dynamic entities that change their states in time and space, and engage with each other into fairly complex relations. For effectively managing situations, it is crucial to understand the situations in which these entities participate, to recognize emerging trends and potential threats, and to undertake required actions. Understanding of dynamic situations involves complex cognitive modeling of situations, building situation ontologies, and continuous sensing, perception, and comprehension of signal and human intelligence events and reports, and integrating these data into suitable presentations for supporting human and/or computational understanding of the situations. Entities participating in Situation Management need to have efficient ways of exchanging descriptions of situations. 
 Cognitive Situation Management thus covers analysis, modeling, and control of cyber-physical-social systems within the context of tactical and strategic goals of stakeholders, and it is based on theories and technologies of computer science, human-centered artificial intelligence, autonomous control, cognitive science and human factors research, among others. The research interests of cognitive situation management in human-centric systems as well as artificial systems built from autonomous smart software-intensive components include studies in situation awareness, situation modeling, ontologies and semantics; situation sensing, fusion, perception, comprehension, and projection; situated reasoning, situation learning and discovery, situation monitoring and control, situation management architectures and applications, situated HCI, distributing, sharing, and merging knowledge about situations; assessing truthfulness and accuracy of situation awareness, the design of systems to support human situation awareness, the development of effective approaches for integrating humans and autonomous systems.
