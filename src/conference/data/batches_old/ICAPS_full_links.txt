 Thehref="https://www.icaps-conference.org" - International Conference on Automated Planning and
Scheduling
(ICAPS) is the premier forum for exchanging news and research results on the theory and applications of intelligent and automated planning and scheduling technology. 
 Planning and Scheduling are optimisation problems which require finding a set of actions to complete a task, to achieve a goal, or to optimise one or more objectives. Effective solutions to planning and scheduling problems are critical for a variety of important application areas, including Industry 4.0, aerospace systems, supply chain management, software engineering, robotics, education, digital entertainment and more. 
 ICAPS 2025is the 35th edition of the ICAPS conference series and will take place in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in November 2025. The conference will be co-located with the following events: 
 href="https://kr.org//KR2025/" - KR-2025 | : The 22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. 
 href="https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2025" - CPAIOR-2025 | : The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research.

“Planning is the art and practice of thinking before acting.” 
 P@trik Haslum 
 The primary objectives of ICAPS are to further the field of automated planning and scheduling through the organization of technical meetings, including the annual ICAPS conference, through the organization of summer schools, tutorials and training activities at various events, through the organization of planning and scheduling competitions, benchmarking and other means of advancing and assessing the state of the art in the field, by promoting the involvement of young scientists in the field through scholarships and other means, and by promoting and disseminating publications, planning and scheduling systems, domains, simulators, software tools and technical material. 
 “Probably the biggest problem I had was I didn’t understand the importance of scheduling.” 
 Anne Donovan 
 ICAPS’s greatest strengths come from the people who make up our community. ICAPS is committed to fostering an inclusive community with opportunities for all participants without regard to age, religion, race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, or disability. We strive to remove barriers and obstacles that limit participation, and we work to uncover biases that create unfair practices. Every ICAPS participant is encouraged to engage in civil discourse when opinions and points of view differ. We value and respect one another, and we will hold one another accountable when we falter. Differences are welcomed and celebrated. Join us.

 ICAPS 2024, the 34th International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling, was held in Banaff, Alberta, Canada, from June 1-6, 2024. 
 For 2024, ICAPS invited paper submissions related to the theory and applications of intelligent planning and scheduling technology.Traditionally, ICAPS has had both a main track and a set of specialized tracks (e.g., Robotics, Applications, etc.) that authors could submit to, all mutually exclusive. This year, there was a single main track, with former track themes replaced by a set of optional primary keywords that distinguish papers for differential review within the main track. Relevant contributions include but are not limited to theoretical foundations of planning and scheduling, classical planning techniques and analysis, knowledge representation for planning and scheduling, multi-agent and distributed planning, and human-aware planning and scheduling.
