 THEME OF THE CONFERENCE 
 The ITS2025 Conference is about“Generative Systems”. 
 ITS is evolving to a new concept of Artificial Intelligence which can be found in various disciplines and can serve human education and well-being. This new concept is named: GENERATIVE INTELLIGENCE. Generative Intelligence concerns various AI systems, techniques, architectures, methods, or tools based on deep and machine learning which can be used to generate texts, images, solutions, and environments, able to enhance HUMAN intelligence, cognitive capacities, memory, and learning. Instead of trying to reproduce human behavior or recognize human traits using artificial intelligence techniques or learning analytics, Generative Intelligence provides means to increase human cognitive potential. 
 The conference is supported by the following tracks in which the concepts mentioned above contribute to the increase of intelligence. Each track includes (but is not limimted to) a list of topics of interest which can be found below. Submitted papers should refer to one of the corresponding tracks. 
 Conference tracks 
 T1: Generative Tutoring Systems 
 T2: Generative Systems in Healthcare Informatics

 THEME OF THE CONFERENCE 
 The ITS2024 Conferenceis about“Generative Intelligence and ITS”.ITS is evolving to a new concept of Artificial Intelligence which can be found in various disciplines and can serve human education and well-being. This new concept is named: GENERATIVE INTELLIGENCE. Generative Intelligence concerns various AI systems, techniques, architectures, methods, or tools based on deep and machine learning which can be used to generate texts, images, solutions, and environments, able to enhance HUMAN intelligence, cognitive capacities, memory, and learning. Instead of trying to reproduce human behavior or recognize human traits using artificial intelligence techniques or learning analytics, Generative Intelligence provides means to increase human cognitive potential. 
 The conference is supported by the following tracks in which the concepts mentioned above contribute to the increase of intelligence. Each track includes (but is not limimted to) a list of topics of interest which can be found below. Submitted papers should refer to one of the corresponding tracks.
