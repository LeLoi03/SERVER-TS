 APPROX CONFERENCE 
 International Conference on Approximation Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization Problems 
 APPROX 2025 
 The conference will take place at | UC Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA | , on | August 11-13, 2025 | together with | href="https://randomconference.com/" - RANDOM 2025 | . 
 href="https://approxconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/approx-random-2025-cfp-1.pdf" - Call for papers 
 Important Deadlines 
 Submissions: | May 8, 2025, AoE Time Zone 
 Notifications: | July 1, 2025 
 Camera ready: | July 15, 2025 
 Submission Format 
 Submissions, in PDF, should start with a title page containing the title of the paper, each author’s name, affiliation, and e-mail address, and a 1-2 paragraph abstract summarizing the paper’s contributions. The title page should be followed by a technical exposition on single-spaced, single-column pages, letter-size paper, using page numbers, at least 1-inch margins all around, and at least 11-point font. The first 10 pages, following the title page, should contain a clear presentation of the main technical and conceptual ideas underlying the results, including the motivation behind the paper and a clear comparison with related work (not including the references). The submission should be accessible to a wide variety of researchers in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics. There is no page limit, but any material beyond the title page and the following 10 pages will be read at the sole discretion of the program committee. 
 Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which will be published before the end of the conference, will not be considered for acceptance. Simultaneous submission of the same (or an overlapping) paper to RANDOM/APPROX and to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed.
