 Call for Papers 
 The symposium seeks original algorithmic contributions for problems with relevant theoretical and/or practical applications. Papers with a strong emphasis on the theoretical analysis of algorithms should be submitted toTrack A, while papers reporting the results of extensive experimental evaluations and/or providing original contributions to the engineering of algorithms for practical applications should be submitted toTrack B. Submissions that prove or explain results, possibly already known, in a particularly clear, simple or elegant way should be submitted toTrack S. 
 There will be a Best Student Paper Award as well as a Best Paper Award, both sponsored by EATCS. In order for a paper to be considered for the Best Student Paper Award, all of its authors are required to be students at the time of submission. 
 Paper submission and proceedings 
 Papers should be submitted electronically via thehref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esa2025" - EasyChair submission system
. The ESA 2025 proceedings will be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series. 
 üÜï Submission Guidelines 
 Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper.Submissions must be formatted in accordance with the LIPIcs proceedings guidelines and may not exceed500 lines of text.Authors must use the LaTeX class filesocg-lipics-v2021.cls; for a quick start, duplicate thisOverleaf project. 
 Proofs omitted due to the line constraint must be placed in an appendix. This appendix can even comprise an entire full version of the paper. The appendix will be read by the program committee members at their discretion. In particular, appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper‚Äôs importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. 
 These guidelines are strict: submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk being rejected without consideration of their merits. Papers must be submitted electronically via the EasyChair submission system. Results previously published (or scheduled for publication) in another conference proceedings or journal should not be submitted to ESA. Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings, journals, or to multiple tracks of ESA 2025, is also not permitted. By submitting a paper the authors acknowledge that in case of acceptance, at least one of the authors must register at ALGO 2025, attend the conference on-site and present the paper. Papers with no author fulfilling this requirement may risk being removed from the final conference proceedings (unless there are extenuating circumstances). 
 Precise format definitions 
 Submissions must not exceed500 lines, excluding front matter (title, authors, and affiliations), references, and a clearly marked appendix (further described below), but including all other lines (in abstract, algorithms, tables, captions, etc.). 
 The class files provide line counting which should be accurate in most cases. Authors should refrain from putting excessive amounts of text in parts in which lines are not counted automatically. If authors need constructs that contain uncounted lines of text, they should compensate for this by reducing the final line count accordingly. It is the sole responsibility of the authors to not exceed 500 lines even if some lines are not counted automatically. In case of doubt (such as substantial amounts of text appearing as part of a graphic), the actual text content as judged by the program committee will replace the automated line count in deciding conformity. 
 TeXnical details 
 Authors must use thesocg-lipics-v2021.clsclass, which is a lightweight wrapper for the standard LIPIcs document classlipics-v2021. The LIPIcs document class is available from the publisherhref="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/series/LIPIcs" - here (under Author Instructions)
. Usesocg-lipics-v2021version 0.9 (updated in 2022) andlipics-v2021version 3.1.3 (updated 2023-05-12). 
 Further instructions on how to usesocg-lipics-v2021are availablehere. 
 The first page describes everything needed for the ‚Äústandard use case‚Äù; the rest of the document goes into detail on how to manually correct the line counting in custom environments, should you desire to do so. 
 Thesocg-lipics-v2021document class and its documentation have originally been developed for the International Symposium on Computational Geometry, SoCG, (hence the name of the document class), but it is a generic template for LIPIcs papers with line counts. 
 ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve always merrily counted pages; why bother with counting lines now?‚Äù 
 Counting lines is the attempt to make authoring submissions for ESA more efficient for everyone involved. 
 To enable a timely reviewing process, most conferences have a (sometimes soft) page limit beyond which submissions are read at the Program Committee‚Äôs discretion only. Counting lines fulfills that same purpose, but is a much more fine-grained function of the input text size than the page count, whose often chaotic behavior in the LaTeX typesetting process has been a perennial frustration for authors and editors alike. 500 lines are similar to 12 pages of text. 
 Double-Blind Reviewing 
 The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias. 
 Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors. In particular, authors‚Äô names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not ‚ÄúWe build on our previous work ‚Ä¶‚Äù but rather ‚ÄúWe build on the work of ‚Ä¶‚Äù). 
 Double-blind reviewing is intended to help PC members and reviewers to counter bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them toarXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. In case there exist publicly available versions of the submission online, the authors might mention this in their submission (without providing references/links), and briefly explain the differences if any. Alternatively, they might communicate the details to the chairs, who will keep them confidential unless revealing them to the PC is needed for a fair judgement. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC chairs. 
 When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members. A CoI is limited to the following categories: 
 Family member or close friend. 
 Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years. 
 Person with the same affiliation. 
 Involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.) 
 Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter). 
 Frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.
