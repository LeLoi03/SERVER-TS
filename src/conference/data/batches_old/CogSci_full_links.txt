Keynotes 
 Theme 1:The Future of Foundational Ideas of Cognitive ScienceCognitive Science was born from a revolution that centered the mind as the object of study, resulting in new fields that study the nature of mental representations, consciousness, the origins of knowledge, and how the brain carries out mental computations.Which of the foundational ideas and debates that emerged from the Cognitive Revolution remain important to current discourse in our field? 
 Keynote: Susan Carey 
 Harvard University 
 Carey investigates the origins of human conceptual representation and has conducted work on core systems of knowledge, word learning, the construction of intuitive theories, and case studies of conceptual change including number, causal reasoning, and the language of thought. Among her most important contributions is the argument that human knowledge emanates from rich innate structures that are enriched through processes of conceptual change. 
 Theme 2: The Role of AI in Theories of the Future 
 The rapid emergence of AIs and their success in modeling diverse aspects of human language and cognition raises important questions about the future of theory building in our field. Do the engineering successes of AI suggest a new theoretical path forward for Cognitive Science? What role should foundational ideas in Cognitive Science play in theory making as we look to the future? 
 Keynote: Josh Tenenbaum 
 MIT 
 Tenenbaum’s work investigates the computational structure of human cognition, and includes studies of concept learning, similarity judgment, causal inference, and the formation of perceptual representations. A key focus is the nature and origin of common-sense theories, and how humans construct concepts, theories and skills from minimal examples. 
 Theme 3: New Theoretical Horizons in Cognitive Science 
 What is the future of theory in the Cognitive Sciences? In this transitional moment in Cognitive Science, what questions are most central to understanding human cognition? Which of the foundational theoretical constructs of our field deserve to be preserved in the coming years? What changes are required? What paths are most likely to lead to innovation and discovery? 
 Keynote: Lauren Ross 
 UC Irvine 
 Ross specializes in the philosophy of science, focusing on explanation and causation within biology, neuroscience, and medicine. Her research includes projects that explore the nature of scientific explanation, the variety of causal structures and types of explanation used in these fields, and the underlying rationale for specific forms of causal reasoning. By investigating how scientists explain phenomena and infer causal relationships, her work addresses the conceptual foundations of empirical research in the life sciences and medicine. 
 2025 Recipient of the Rumelhart Prize 
 Nora Newcombe 
 Temple University 
 Nora S. Newcombe (Ph.D., Harvard), is Laura H. Carnell Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Temple University. Her research in cognition and cognitive development centers on spatial cognition and episodic memory, along with translational work on STEM education. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Society of Experimental Psychologists. Past honors include the Distinguished Scientific Contributions Award from SRCD, the William James Fellow Award from APS, the Howard Crosby Warren Medal from SEP, and the Award for Distinguished Service to Psychological Science from APA. 
 The Cognitive Science Society is pleased to announce the establishment of the CogSci Grove which aims to mobilise cognitive scientists to offset carbon emissions associated with their professional activities.

 Future Conferences 
 Cogsci 2026 
 Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 
 July 22 – 25, 2026 
 Sheraton Grand Rio Hotel & Resort 
 Format Cycle 
 The Cognitive Science Society plans to host a fully synchronous hybrid conference every 3 years, starting in 2025. In the other years, the conference will be in-person. The Governing Board, with guidance from the Conference Committee and the Hybridisation Committee, approved this plan after a great deal of discussion, briefly described below: 
 Rationale: 
 Since COVID in 2020, the Cognitive Science Society has been discussing how best to run its annual conference. The conference landscape has also been altered by changes in technology, shifting conference norms, visa issues, several major world events, and greater attention to accessibility and the climate crisis. The pandemic allowed the Society to experiment with various types of virtual conference offerings, from being online in 2020 and 2021, to being fully hybrid conference in 2022, and streaming from only the main conference room in 2023. 
 Throughout this process, we have gotten feedback from our members about their conference experiences, including very positive feedback on our 2022 synchronous hybrid conference in Toronto. We have also examined logistic constraints, our finances and conference budget. While conference expenses have allowed us to break even in the past, our hybrid conference in 2022 and semi-hybrid conference in 2023 resulted in a substantial financial loss for the society. 
 The three-year cycle will allow us to financially and logistically sustain conferences into the future, while offering a fully hybrid experience on a regular basis. 
 Location cycle 
 The three-year location cycle for the annual conference is: 
 1: Western Europe 
 2: US or Canada 
 3: Anywhere else in the world, with a preference for locations that would serve emerging cognitive science communities and that have not previously had a CogSci conference in the vicinity. Possible destinations include Africa, the Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, Mexico, Central America, South America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East. 
 The Cognitive Science Society is pleased to announce the establishment of the CogSci Grove which aims to mobilise cognitive scientists to offset carbon emissions associated with their professional activities.
