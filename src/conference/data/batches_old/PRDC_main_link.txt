 IEEE PRDC 2024 is the twenty-nine event in the series of symposia started in 1989 that are devoted to dependable and fault-tolerant computing. PRDC is recognized as the main event in the Pacific area that covers many dimensions of dependability and fault tolerance, encompassing fundamental theoretical approaches, practical experimental projects, and commercial components and systems. As applications of computing systems have permeated into all aspects of daily life, the dependability of computing system has become increasingly critical. This symposium provides a forum for countries around the Pacific Rim and other areas of the world to exchange ideas for improving the dependability of computing systems.

 PRDC 2024 is the 29th event in a series of symposia started in 1989 devoted to dependable and fault-tolerant computing; it encompasses fundamental theoretical approaches, practical experimental projects, and commercial components and systems. This symposium is recognized as the main event in the Pacific Rim area, and it provides a forum for countries around the world to exchange ideas for improving the dependability of computing systems. 
 Topics of interest include (but not limited to): 
 Software and hardware reliability, resilience, safety, security, testing, verification, and validation 
 Dependability measurement, modeling, evaluation, and tools 
 Self-healing, self-protecting, and fault-tolerant systems 
 Architecture and system design for dependability 
 Prognostics in Complex Systems 
 Reliability analysis of Complex Systems 
 Fault-tolerant algorithms and protocols 
 Cloud computing resiliency, security and privacy 
 Software defined networks architectures and protocols 
 Dependability issues in computing systems (e.g. computer networks and communications, high performance computing, real-time systems, storage and databases systems, cyber-physical systems, socio-technical systems, and blockchain and smart contracts). 
 Emerging technologies (autonomous systems including autonomous vehicles, human machine teaming, smart devices/Internet of Things) 
 Submission and Publication Information 
 Manuscripts should use theIEEE double-column formatin 10 pages for full papers and 6 pages for short papers. The references are not included in the page limit. Appendixes beyond the page limit are allowed in submission, but they are not expected to be reviewed. Regardless of full or short papers, the authors can choose either one of the following two submission categories: (i) Regular Research Papers and (ii) Practical Experience Reports. 
 Regular Research Papersshould describe original research (not submitted or published elsewhere). 
 Practical Experience Reportsshould describe an experience or a case study, such as the design and deployment of a system or actual failure and recovery field data. 
 All submissions must be made electronically (in PDF format) on the submission website. Please note that all submissions will undergo a double-blind review. Please ensure that you have removed any references that could lead to identifying the authors of the paper. Failure to do so may result in the rejection of the paper regardless of the paper's contributions. Papers will be reviewed internationally and selected based on their originality, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation. All accepted papers will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press (EI Indexed). 
 The submission website ishref="https://prdc24.hotcrp.com/" - HotCRP site
. 
 Paper Award 
 One outstanding paper will be selected to receive the Best Paper Award, and one outstanding paper first-authored by a student will receive the Best Student Paper Award. A few excellent papers will be recommended to have their extended versions submitted to an international journal. The name of the Journal will be announced later. 
 Special Issue 
 A few excellent papers will be recommended to have their extended versions submitted to the special issue of the Practice and Experience (SPE). This special issue also seeks submissions of papers that present novel and innovative ideas. 
 Dependable AI-Driven Software Systems
