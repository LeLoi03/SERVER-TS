 Theme 
 Sustainable and Trustworthy Visual Communications in the Age of AI 
 In the Age of AI, the rapid evolution of visual technologies presents both incredible opportunities and pressing challenges for communication. Sustainable and trustworthy visual communications have become critical, as we navigate a world increasingly dominated by generative AI, deepfakes, and synthetic media. As AI systems grow more capable of creating hyper-realistic images and videos, the need for transparency, ethical standards, and responsible design has never been greater. How can we ensure that the visuals we rely on for education, journalism, and social interaction are authentic and free from manipulation? Moreover, how can we create visual content that minimizes environmental impact while remaining accessible and inclusive? This intersection of sustainability and trust in visual communications calls for innovative solutions—ones that preserve the integrity of information, protect privacy, and empower users to discern reality from illusion. By harnessing the potential of AI responsibly, we can redefine how visuals shape our perceptions of the world, ensuring they contribute to a more informed, ethical, and sustainable digital future
