 Privacy in statistical databases is about finding tradeoffs to the tension between the increasing societal and economic demand for accurate information and the legal and ethical obligation to protect the privacy of individuals and enterprises which are the respondents providing the statistical data. In the case of statistical databases, the motivation for respondent privacy is one of survival: data collectors cannot expect to collect accurate information from individual or corporate respondents unless these feel the privacy of their responses is guaranteed. 
 Beyond respondent privacy, there are two additional privacy dimensions to be considered: privacy for the data owners (organizations owning or gathering the data, who would not like to share the data they have collected at great expense) and privacy for the users (those who submit queries to the database and would like their analyses to stay private). 
 "Privacy in Statistical Databases 2024" (PSD 2024) is a conference organized by thehref="https://crises-deim.urv.cat" - CRISES research group
atUniversitat Rovira i Virgiliwith proceedings published by Springer-Verlag in Lecture Notes in Computer Science. The purpose of PSD 2024 is to attract world-wide, high-level research in statistical database privacy.

Those ten PSD conferences follow a tradition of high-quality technical conferences on SDC which started with "Statistical Data Protection-SDP'98", held in Lisbon in 1998 and with proceedings published by OPOCE, and continued with the AMRADS project SDC Workshop, held in Luxemburg in 2001 and with proceedings published in Springer LNCS 2316. 
 Like the aforementioned preceding conferences, PSD 2024 originates in Europe, but wishes to stay a worldwide event in database privacy and SDC. Thus, contributions and attendees from overseas are welcome.

 Presented at theInternational Conference, PSD 2024(September 2024), Antibus Juan-les-Pins, FranceThis paper presents a case study focused on synthesizing relational datasets within Official Statistics for software and technology testing purposes. Specifically, the focus is on generating synthetic data for testing and validating software code. Our study conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of various synthesis approaches tailored for a multi-table relational database featuring a one-to-one relationship versus a single table. We leverage state-of-the-art single and multi-table synthesis methods to evaluate their potential to maintain the analytical validity of the data, ensure data utility, and mitigate risks associated with disclosure. The evaluation of analytical validity includes assessing how well synthetic data replicates the structure and characteristics of real datasets. First, we compare synthesis methods based on their ability to maintain constraints and conditional dependencies found in real data. Second, we evaluate the utility of synthetic data by training linear regression models on both real and synthetic datasets. Lastly, we measure the privacy risks associated with synthetic data by conducting attribute inference attacks to measure the disclosure risk of sensitive attributes. Our experimental results indicate that the single-table data synthesis method demonstrates superior performance in terms of analytical validity, utility, and privacy preservation compared to the multi-table synthesis method. However, we find promise in the premise of multi-table data synthesis in protecting against attribute disclosure, albeit calling for future exploration to improve the utility of the data.
