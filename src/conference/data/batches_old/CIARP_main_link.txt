 ABOUT 
 The Iberoamerican Congress on Pattern Recognition (CIARP)is one of the most relevant scientific events focusing on all aspects of pattern recognition, computer vision, artificial intelligence, data mining, and related areas. Every year it brings a networking forum for sharing scientific results and experiences on new knowledge and applications on related topics, as well as for increasing cooperation between research groups. 
 CIARP 2024will be hosted by theUniversidad Católica del Maule (Talca, Chile), supported by theChilean Association of Pattern Recognition (ACHIRP), and expected to be endorsed by theInternational Association for Pattern Recognition (IAPR). As in previous editions, proceedings are expected to be published bySpringer as LNCSand three conference awards will be given (including IAPR Best Paper and Best Student Paper Awards). 
 The program will include renowned keynote speakers, special sessions on cooperation between industry and academia, as well as workshops and hands-on tutorials on cutting-edge technologies. This conference will be a100% in-person event. 
 Talca is a city in central Chile's Maule region known for its wineries. A city in constant transformation and development, only three hours from Santiago, with amazing natural landscapes and different tourist options: enotourism, gastronomy, culture, history, and trekking, among others.We look forward to welcoming you to Talca!

 All papers will be reviewed according to thedouble-blind peerreview model by at least two members of the CIARP Program Committee. Please do not include author names and affiliations in your paper (also do not cite your previous work as "in our previous paper [x]", etc.). Please note thatall papers will be checked by plagiarism-detecting softwareso that papers exceeding a coincidence threshold will not be passed on for review. 
 As in previous editions, all accepted and presented papers are expected to be published bySpringer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Please note that the publishers might reject papers too similar to previous publications, even if the work is presented at the conference. Thus, in order to guarantee the quality and originality of the accepted papers and to ensure that they are published properly,it will use the Compilatio anti-plagiarism detection tool.

The aim of these awards is to acknowledge and encourage excellence, originality, and innovativeness of new models, methods, and techniques with an outstanding theoretical contribution and/or practical contribution to the field of pattern recognition and related areas. The selection of the winners will be based on the evaluation and recommendations from members of the Programme Committee and the evaluation of the CIARP Award Committee. The awards will be announced during the conference. 
  
 We welcome nominations for the Aurora Pons Porrata Award (APPA).This Iberoamerican annual prize is given to a living woman in recognition of an outstanding technical contribution to the field of pattern recognition and related areas. It consists of a cash amount, a suitably inscribed certificate, and a medal. Any woman from the Iberoamerican region is eligible to be nominated, except for the current members of the APP Award Committee. 
  
 To initiate the nominations, Local Committees should evaluate and select candidates to be postulated for the APPA.After that, the CVs of the final candidates will be submitted to the APP Award Coordinator. Each nomination could be endorsed by at least one endorsement letter from a member of an Iberoamerican Pattern Recognition Society different from the nominator. All proposals received from Local Committees will be evaluated by an Awarding Committee that selects the winner. This committee will be composed of three prestigious female researchers from all over the world. 
  
 Electronic CVs and endorsement letters should be submitted by 15th June 2024.The winning candidate will be announced in the CIARP 2024.

 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 
 Will the event will be online? 
 No. We expect this to be a full in-peron event. We invite researchers worldwide to submit their novel articles. 
 Is there any facility for students to submit articles? 
 Students are encouraged to submit papers. If they are the first author they can be submitted as "Student Papers" and would be considered for a special prize. For details about the registration fees, please check theRegistrationsection. 
 Do I have to pay extra if I have more than one paper accepted? 
 Please refer to theRegistrationsection for the detailed fee conditions. 
 Will all accepted papers be indexed in Scopus and others? 
 As in previous versions of the conference, we expect that the papers will be indexed in Scopus and others. Please note that only papers that are accepted AND presented AND associated to a delegate fee, will be sent to the publisher. It is very important that the papers are in the correct format and have been proof-read by a competent English speaker, as the publisher may reject poorly written papers or those that overlap significantly with previously published work. 
 Does a paper discussing the application of pattern recognition in the manufacturing industry (as a black-box, and not so much about which specific methods) fit your conference? 
 Yes! We welcome papers describing real-world applications of pattern recognition systems.
