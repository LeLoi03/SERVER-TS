 About JELIA 2025 
 Welcome to JELIA 2025, the 19th edition of the European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence, to be held in Kutaisi, Georgia. 
 Logics have, for many years, laid claim to providing a formal basis for the study and development of applications and systems in Artificial Intelligence. With the depth and maturity of formalisms, methodologies, and logic-based systems today, this claim is stronger than ever. 
 Thehref="http://www.jelia.eu/" - European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence
(or Journées Européennes sur la Logique en Intelligence Artificielle - JELIA) began back in 1988, as a workshop, in response to the need for a European forum for the discussion of emerging work in this field. Since then, JELIA has been organised biennially, with proceedings published in the Springer-Verlag seriesLecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. Previous meetings took place in Roscoff, France (1988), Amsterdam, Netherlands (1990), Berlin, Germany (1992), York, UK (1994), Évora, Portugal (1996), Dagstuhl, Germany (1998), Málaga, Spain (2000), Cosenza, Italy (2002), Lisbon, Portugal (2004), Liverpool, UK (2006), Dresden, Germany (2008), Helsinki, Finland (2010), Toulouse, France (2012), Madeira, Portugal (2014), Larnaca, Cyprus (2016), Rende, Italy (2019), Klagenfurt, Austria (2021), Dresden, Germany (2023). 
 The increasing interest in this forum, its international level with growing participation from researchers outside Europe, and the overall technical quality, has turned JELIA into a major biennial forum for the discussion of logic-based approaches to artificial intelligence.

 JELIA 2025 
 Call For Papers 
 The Program Committee of the 19th European Conference on Logics in Artificial Intelligence (JELIA 2025) invites the submission of technical papers for the conference that will be held in Kutaisi, Georgia, from the 1st to the 5th of September of 2025. 
 Aim and Scope 
 The aim of JELIA 2025 is to bring together active researchers interested in the use of logics in Artificial Intelligence, in order to discuss current research, results, problems, and applications of both theoretical and practical nature. JELIA strives to foster links and facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers from various disciplines, among researchers from academia and industry, and between theoreticians and practitioners. 
 Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished research in all areas related to the use of logics in Artificial Intelligence, including, but not limited to: 
 Abductive and inductive reasoning 
 Applications of logic-based AI systems 
 Argumentation 
 Automated reasoning including satisfiability checking and its extensions 
 Causality and logics 
 Computational complexity and expressiveness 
 Deontic logic and normative systems 
 Description logics and other logical approaches to ontologies 
 Knowledge representation, reasoning, and compilation 
 Learning and reasoning 
 Logic programming, answer set programming, constraint logic programming 
 Logics for uncertain and probabilistic reasoning 
 Logics in machine learning 
 Logics in multi-agent systems, games, and social choice 
 Neural networks and logic rules 
 Non-classical logics, such as modal, temporal, epistemic, dynamic, spatial, paraconsistent, and hybrid logics 
 Nonmonotonic logics, default logics, conditional logics 
 Planning and diagnosis based on logic 
 Preferences and optimization 
 Reasoning about actions 
 Updates, belief revision and nonmonotonic reasoning 
 Submissions describing implemented systems/applications and their application area(s) are also welcome. 
 Special Track 
 Also this year we will include a Special Track onLogics for Explainable and Trustworthy AI. We welcome contributions that describe logic-based approaches to making AI more transparent, safer, or more trustable. The track aims to draw attention to this timely topic and create a space for discussing the role of logic. The papers accepted for the special track will be presented in dedicated sessions at the conference. 
 Awards 
 JELIA 2025 is happy to announce that there will be Best Paper and Best Student Paper Prizes sponsored by Springer, each is a cash prize amounting to EUR 500. The Program Committee will select for this honor the contribution of the highest technical excellence and scientific merit. In the case of the latter award, the primary author of the paper must be a student at the time of submission. 
 The authors of selected contributions of outstanding quality will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to the TPLP journal and will enjoy fast-track reviewing and publication. 
 Submission Details 
 href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=jelia2025" - JELIA 2025 Submission on EasyChair
JELIA 2025 welcomes submissions of long or short papers. All submissions should contain original research, and sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution. Submissions must not have been previously published or be simultaneously submitted for publication elsewhere; see also the note below. 
 All submissions should not exceed 13 pages for long papers and 6 pages for short papers (excluding references and acknowledgments, including everything else, for example figures), and should be written in English. Papers must be self-contained; appendices with additional material (such as proofs) will only be considered at the reviewers' discretion and will not be published. Submissions must be formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style (seehttps://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines), and are not anonymous. The conference proceedings of JELIA 2025 will be published by Springer Verlag in the series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, a sub-series of Lecture Notes in Computer Science (important note: Springer will require all the LaTeX source files of all accepted submissions). 
 Important Dates 
 Abstract submission: | 2 May 2025 
 Paper submission: | 9 May 2025 
 Notification of acceptance: | 1 July 2025 
 Policy on multiple Submissions 
 JELIA 2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Authors are also required not to submit their papers elsewhere during JELIA's review period. However, these restrictions do not apply to previous workshops with a limited audience and without archival proceedings. 
 Any additional questions can be directed towards the JELIA Chairs:href="mailto:jelia2025@easychair.org" - jelia2025@easychair.org
