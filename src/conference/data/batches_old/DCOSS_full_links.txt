 DCOSS-IoT 2025 
 Tuscany (Lucca), Italy, June 9-11, 2025 
 The 21st Annual International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT 2025) will take place in Tuscany (Lucca), Italy. The conference intended since its creation to cover several aspects of distributed computing in smartsystems such as high level abstractions and models, systematic design methodologies, signal and information processing, algorithms, analysis and applications. Starting from the 2023 event, DCOSS is broadening its scope beyond sensor networks to smart systems in general as well as the Internet of Things (IoT).

INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING IN SMART SYSTEMS AND THE INTERNET OF THINGS 
 Menu 
 The 21stAnnual International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT 2025) 
 Tuscany (Lucca), Italy 
 June 9 to 11, 2025 
 * The DCOSS-IoT series of events are always technically co-sponsored by IEEE, and Proceedings are published by IEEE Xplore. 
 The 21stInternational Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT 2025) will be held in Tuscany (Lucca), Italy. The conference is always co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and by the IEEE Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP). 
 The conference was previously known as DCOSS.Starting in 2023, the event is broadening its scope beyond sensor networks to include smart systems in general and the Internet of Things (IoT). The updated name is “Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things” (DCOSS-IoT). 
 In the last few years, we have witnessed significant growth in the use of IoT and distributed sensor systems in several application areas, including smart transportation, smart energy systems, smart homes and buildings, smart healthcare, and environmental monitoring. For smart sensor systems to truly become useful and pervasive, we need to address several research challenges, including the tight integration of sensing and machine intelligence, reliable and efficient networking, interoperability and scalability, the need for dependable autonomy, interaction with humans, and important aspects of security, privacy and trust. DCOSS-IoT focuses on issues arising in the entire IoT and networked sensor systems stack, covering aspects of high-level abstractions, models and languages, communication technologies, novel algorithms and applications, system design approaches and architectures, and tools for simulated and real deployments. Potential authors are invited to submit original, unpublished manuscripts demonstrating recent advances in theoretical and experimental research. 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 Artificial Intelligence for IoT 
 Machine learning and data mining for IoT and Smart Systems 
 Smart healthcare to combat epidemics 
 Edge and fog computing: distributed computing models from sensor to cloud 
 Machine intelligence in distributed sensor systems and real-time analytics 
 Novel communication paradigms (e.g., 5G/6G, VLC, DSA) for IoT and Smart Systems 
 Cyber-Physical Systems 
 IoT and Smart Systems for Smart and Connected Communities 
 Autonomous systems: closing the loop between sensing and actuation 
 Time and location management 
 Robustness, resilience, and dependability of IoT and smart systems 
 Security and privacy in IoT and Smart Systems 
 Performance analysis: complexity, correctness, scalability 
 Mobile and human-centric sensing 
 IoT and Smart Systems for social computing 
 Interoperability, heterogeneity and scalability 
 Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based sensing/communications/networking 
 Social sensing and crowd sensing techniques, applications, and systems 
 Complex systems comprising wearable, robotic and/or fixed sensor systems 
 IoT and Smart Systems for emerging and developing economies 
 Green and environmentally friendly IoT (low power, harvesting, energy management) 
 Sensors and Robots for Internet of Intelligent Things 
 Design and implementation of real-world applications and systems 
 Approaches, tools, and experience of deployment and operation 
 Interdisciplinary applications of IoT and Smart Systems 
 Smart healthcare and digital epidemiology 
 Smart agriculture 
 Smart infrastructures 
 Smart cities 
 Smart energy, transportation, and water distribution systems 
 Smart factories 
 Smart workspace 
 Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished manuscripts demonstrating current research on distributed smart systems and IoT related to thehref="" - aforementioned topics
of interest. Please use the US letter size (8.5 X 11 in) standard IEEE conference LaTeX format or Microsoft Word template available on:http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html. 
 All submissions should be written in English and have a maximum of eight (8) printed pages, including figures and references. Two (2) additional pages at 100$/page for supplementary material only (such as theorems, proofs, implementation details) are allowed. Starting 2023, DCOSS-IoT follows a double-blind review process. As a result, authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Although submission is double-blind, the existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to look for such preprints actively but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the EDAS submission system. 
 *** Special Issue and Best Paper Awards *** 
 DCOSS-IoT 2025 will announce a best paper award and a best poster/demo award. 
 Extended versions of selected best papers from DCOSS-IoT 2025 will be included in a Special Issue of the Computer Networks (COMNET) Journal.
