 Introduction 
 The 22nd IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications (IEEE ISPA 2024) is a forum for presenting leading work on parallel and distributed computing and networking, including architecture, compilers, runtime systems, applications, reliability, security, parallel programming models and much more. During the symposium, scientists and engineers in both academia and industry are invited to present their work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multithreaded, heterogeneous, clustered systems, distributed systems, grids, clouds, edge, and large scale machines). 
  
 The 22nd IEEE ISPA 2024 will be hosted in Kaifeng, China. IEEE ISPA follows the tradition of previous successful IEEE ISPA conferences in the years from 2003 to 2023 in Asia, Europe, Australia and North America. It will feature sessions of regular presentations, workshops, tutorials and keynote speeches. IEEE ISPA 2024 is particularly interested in research addressing heterogeneous computing with the use of accelerators, mobile computing, approximate computing, tools and methodologies to improve the quality of parallel programming and applying generic computing approaches to networks.
