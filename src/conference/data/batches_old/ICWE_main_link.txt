 ICWE 2025 
 25th International Conference on Web Engineering 
 Delft, Netherlands | 30 June – 03 July 2025 
 ICWE 2025 – AT A GLANCE 
 TheInternational Conference on Web Engineering (ICWE)is the premier annual conference on Web Engineering and associated technologies. It covers different aspects of Web Engineering, including the design, creation, maintenance, operation, and usage of Web applications. 
 ICWE aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from various disciplines in academia and industry to tackle the emerging challenges in the engineering of Web applications, the problems and opportunities of its associated technologies, and the impact of those technologies on society and culture. 
 Following the general debate on the need for human-centric, responsible, and inclusive web technologies, the25th edition of ICWEin particular invites contributions under the following general theme: 
 The Inclusive Web: Realizing Safe, Accessible, Inclusive, and Sustainable Web Engineering 
 We indeed solicit contributions on diverse aspects related to designing innovative Web technology that however results in being fair, ethical, transparent, privacy-preserving, trustworthy, and inclusive for all. Contributions on any other topic related to Web Engineering are also welcome. 
 Accepted contributions will be included in theICWE 2025 Springer LNCS proceedings. The best papers will be selected to be proposed, in extended form, as part of a special issue of the Journal of Web Engineering. 
 href="https://icwe2025.webengineering.org/registration-details/" - Registration is open.

 In addition to the research track, ICWE 2025 also seeks contributions of industrial papers, demos and posters, student papers at the PhD Symposium, tutorials, and workshops, which will be the subject of individual calls. 
 SUBMISSIONS TO THE RESEARCH TRACK 
 This call addresses research contributions in one of the following two categories: 
 – Full papers (15 pages, Springer LNCS format):mature, original research contributions. Reported results must be supported by some type of evaluation, and also include a justification about the choice/suitability of the evaluation method. In addition, evidence of use in practice and/or demonstration of scalability is regarded as a plus. 
 – Short papers (8 pages, Springer LNCS format):short papers presenting a discussion – analysis, criticism, proposal, vision, etc. – about relevant aspects of Web engineering topics. These papers are intended to generate discussions that promise potential for research that will impact Web Engineering in the coming years. 
 Papers must be formatted according to theSpringer LNCSauthors instructions available athttps://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines, and must be submitted in PDF format through theICWE 2025 EasyChairweb page:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icwe2025" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icwe2025
. 
 Papers submitted to ICWE 2025 must not be under review elsewhere while under consideration for ICWE 2025, nor may have been already previously published elsewhere. Manuscripts that are not in compliance with the required submission format, stated page limits, or that are out of the scope of the conference will be desk rejected without review. 
 We strongly encourage authors to facilitate replication of their research in order to increase visibility, reproducibility, and impact by making relevant artifacts (data, source code, etc.) available for reviewers and readers. 
 Upon acceptance, one corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign aConsent-to-Publishform, through which the copyright for their paper is transferred to Springer. Then,at least one author of each accepted submission must register for the conference and present the work during the corresponding session in person. 
 Accepted contributions will be included in the ICWE 2025 Springer LNCS proceedings.Selected papers, including the best papers, will be invited to submit extended versions to a special issue of the Journal of Web Engineering (https://journals.riverpublishers.com/index.php/JWE/). 
 USE OF GENERATIVE AI 
 Authors should explicitly disclose the use of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in their manuscripts when these tools are employed for more than just editing the author’s text. This disclosure can be made through a statement placed at the end of the manuscript, preceding the References section. 
 If it comes to our notice that a submission utilizes large language models (LLMs) without clear disclosure, such papers will be subject to immediate desk rejection. However, if there is no usage of such technologies, no disclosure statement is required. 
 SPRINGER BEST-PAPER AWARD SPONSORSHIP 
 Springer will sponsor the ICWE 2025 Best Paper Award which will be announced during the ICWE 2025 Banquet.

 All dates are according to the time zone “Anywhere on Earth”, i.e., UTC-12.
