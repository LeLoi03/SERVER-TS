 TheInternational Symposium on Spatial and Temporal Data (SSTD)has a long and distinguished history as a premier forum for researchers, practitioners, and industry leaders to present and discuss spatial and temporal data management innovations. Since its inception in 1989, SSTD has been at the forefront of advancing foundational theories, systems, and applications that address the challenges of handling spatial and temporal information. Over the years, the symposium has played a pivotal role in fostering research that has shaped the evolution of spatial databases, geospatial computing, and spatio-temporal analytics.
