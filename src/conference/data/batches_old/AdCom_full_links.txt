The Advanced Computing and Communication Society (ACCS) in association with The International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIITB) announces the 29th annual International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM 2024) at Bangalore during 18th - 20th December 2024. 
 ADCOM, the flagship Systems Conference of the ACCS, is a major annual international meeting that draws leading scientists and researchers in computational and communications engineering from across industry and academia. ADCOM highlights the growing importance of Large-Scale Systems Engineering and provides the platform to share, discuss and witness leading edge research and trends. 
 ADCOM 2024 seeks to share insights for a ‘Responsible AI’ framework to develop Artificial Intelligence safely and ethically based on the five core principles of fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy and safety. Sustainable, reliable, effective, and human-centered AI systems require responsible AI principles and perspectives not only from technological but also from ethical, legal, and socio-economic domains. This edition of ADCOM will also explore as a sub theme the democratization of access to AI with a need for Trust, Risk and Security Management (TRiSM) to enhance positive performance and societal gains that AI enables. 
 ADCOM 2024 calls for original, high impact research papers on Responsible AI Frameworks and related technologies while seeking novel contributions that help define Trust and Security Management in large AI systems. 
 Submission Guidelines 
 All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. Submissions have to be made only through EasyChair site for the conference:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adcom2024" - https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=adcom2024
