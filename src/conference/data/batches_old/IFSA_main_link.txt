Aims and Scope 
 As a truly unique and international conference in the areas of fuzzy sets and soft computing, 2025 IFSA-NAFIPS Joint Congress will bring together scientists, engineers, students, and practitioners working in fuzzy logic and related areas to present their recent research accomplishments. The Congress offers a unique platform for the exchange of ideas, fostering interaction and building multidisciplinary research linkages. 
 Topics 
 The topics cover all aspects of fuzzy systems and their applications including, but not limited tofuzzy sets and fuzzy logic 
 mathematical foundations of fuzzy sets and fuzzy systems 
 approximate reasoning, fuzzy inference models, and soft computing 
 fuzzy decision analysis, decision making, optimization, and design 
 fuzzy system architectures and hardware 
 fuzzy methods in data analysis, statistics and imprecise probability 
 fuzzy databases and information retrieval 
 fuzzy pattern recognition and image processing 
 fuzzy sets in management science 
 fuzzy control and robotics 
 possibility theory 
 fuzzy sets and logic in ontology, web, and social networks 
 fuzzy preference modelling 
 fuzzy sets in operations research and manufacturing 
 fuzzy database mining and financial forecasting 
 fuzzy neural networks 
 evolutionary and hybrid systems 
 intelligent agents and ambient intelligence 
 learning, adaptive, and evolvable fuzzy systems
