 Since its first happening in 1993, the European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks has become the reference for researchers on fundamentals and theoretical aspects of artificial neural networks, computational intelligence, machine learning and related topics. Each year, around 100 specialists attend ESANN, in order to present their latest results and comprehensive surveys, and to discuss the future developments in this field. 
  
 The ESANN 2021 conference will follow this tradition, while adapting its scope to the recent developments in the field. The ESANN conferences cover artificial neural networks, machine learning, statistical information processing and computational intelligence. Mathematical foundations, algorithms and tools, and applications are covered. 
  
 Papers will be presented orally (single track) and in poster sessions; all posters will be complemented by a short oral presentation during a plenary session. The selection of papers will differentiate between oral and posters presentations according to the topics, and not to the level of quality. 
 Overview 
 Top Research Topics at The European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks? 
 Artificial intelligence (57.88%) 
 Pattern recognition (22.95%) 
 Machine learning (21.58%) 
 The conference focuses on Artificial intelligence, Pattern recognition, Machine learning, Artificial neural network and Algorithm. While Artificial intelligence is the focus of the event, it also provided insights into the studies of Data mining and Computer vision. The event concentrated on Pattern recognition research, specifically Feature selection and Classifier (UML). 
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference? 
 A public domain dataset for human activity recognition using smartphones (892 citations) 
 Support vector machines for multi-class pattern recognition. (725 citations) 
 Long Short Term Memory Networks for Anomaly Detection in Time Series. (614 citations) 
 Research areas of the most cited articles at The European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks: 
 The published articles primarily tackle Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Pattern recognition, Artificial neural network and Data mining. The conference articles with studies in Artificial intelligence featured incorporate elements of Algorithm and Nonlinear system. The published papers focus on Pattern recognition but the discussions also offer insight into other areas such as Perceptron and Metric (mathematics). 
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for? 
 Artificial intelligence 
 Statistics 
 Machine learning 
 The previous edition focused in particular on these issues: 
 The main points discussed in The European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks deals with Artificial intelligence, Pattern recognition, Machine learning, Algorithm and Artificial neural network. The study on Artificial intelligence featured in the event expounds on the topic of Convolutional neural network in particular. The European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks connects research in Pattern recognition with the related topic of Cluster analysis. 
 It facilitates discussions on Machine learning that incorporate concepts from other fields like Graph (abstract data type) and Task (project management). The European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks dives deep in exploring the relationship between the study of Algorithm and Cluster (physics). 
 The most cited articles from the last conference are: 
 Real-time Convolutional Neural Networks for Emotion and Gender Classification (83 citations) 
 Randomized Machine Learning Approaches: Recent Developments and Challenges (27 citations) 
 Predicting Time Series with Space-Time Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks. (15 citations) 
 Papers citation over time 
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue. 
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 Publication chance based on affiliation 
 The publication chance index shows the ratio of articles published by the best research institutions at the conference edition to all articles published within that conference. The best research institutions were selected based on the largest number of articles published during all editions of the conference. 
 The chart below presents the percentage ratio of articles from top institutions (based on their ranking of total papers).Top affiliations were grouped by their rank into the following tiers: top 1-10, top 11-20, top 21-50, and top 51+. Only articles with a recognized affiliation are considered. 
 Research.com 
 During the most recent 2017 edition,9.80%of publications had an unrecognized affiliation. Out of the publications with recognized affiliations,25.00%were posted by at least one author from the top 10 institutions publishing at the conference. Another17.39%included authors affiliated with research institutions from the top 11-20 affiliations. Institutions from the 21-50 range included19.57%of all publications and38.04%were from other institutions. 
 Returning Authors Index 
 A very common phenomenon observed among researchers publishing scientific articles is the intentional selection of conferences they have already attended in the past. In particular, it is worth analyzing the case when the authors participate in the same conference from year to year. 
 The Returning Authors Index presented below illustrates the ratio of authors who participated in both a given as well as the previous edition of the conference in relation to all participants in a given year.

 Returning Institution Index 
 The graph below shows the Returning Institution Index, illustrating the ratio of institutions that participated in both a given and the previous edition of the conference in relation to all affiliations present in a given year.

 The experience to innovation index 
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at thelast edition of a conference, grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C). 
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups: 
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
 Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
 Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
 Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
 Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500). 
 The chart below illustrates experience levels of first authors in cases of publications with multiple authors.

 Abstract 
 Among many other difficulties of imbalanced classification, evaluation of classifiers is rarely trivial. Fβ-score is often recommended as one of the go-to evaluation measures in imbalanced classification, but researchers have voiced their concerns on whether Fβ-score in fact is an appropriate measure. In this paper, we introduce a framework of cost-consistency, i.e., whether an evaluation measure is consistent with total classification cost at least for some cost and class imbalance ratio, and show that, with a simple cost structure, Fβ-score is not cost-consistent.

 N2 - Among many other difficulties of imbalanced classification, evaluation of classifiers is rarely trivial. Fβ-score is often recommended as one of the go-to evaluation measures in imbalanced classification, but researchers have voiced their concerns on whether Fβ-score in fact is an appropriate measure. In this paper, we introduce a framework of cost-consistency, i.e., whether an evaluation measure is consistent with total classification cost at least for some cost and class imbalance ratio, and show that, with a simple cost structure, Fβ-score is not cost-consistent.
