 This paper presents a new automated assessment system tailored for programming courses, addressing the challenge of evaluating a large number of students in extensive courses at the Technical University of Košice. The primary issue with current systems is their inability to handle massive course loads while ensuring objective evaluation and timely feedback. Our proposed system enhances the scalability of the assessment process, allowing for the simultaneous handling of a greater volume of assignments. It is designed to provide regular and systematic feedback to students, supporting their continuous learning and improvement. To ensure the objectivity of evaluations, the system utilizes a variety of unit test suites, selecting them randomly in each assessment to discourage students from hardcoding solutions. This approach not only supports fair and precise assessments but also significantly reduces the administrative burden on educators, enabling them to meet a wide range of educational demands.Subject Classification
