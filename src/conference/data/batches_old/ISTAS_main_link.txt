 The ISTAS 2025 theme is “AI Evolution and Revolution” and it is focused on the upheaval AI is causing in the world. SSIT invites participation from practitioners in academia, industry, and government who contemplate the future societal impact of AI as it evolves: how should we guide and manage this revolution to ensure we leverage benefits and minimize risks? 
 We also invite individuals involved in technology policy who would like to better understand the social implications that will arise with the use of AI. The conference seeks to foster multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and trans-disciplinary interactions about legal, security, and economic issues of AI.
