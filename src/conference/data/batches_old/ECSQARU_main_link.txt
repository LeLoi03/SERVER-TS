 The 18th European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches to Reasoning with Uncertainty (ECSQARU 2025) will be held in Hagen (Germany), on September 23-26, 2025. 
 About ECSQARU 
 The biennial ECSQARU conferences (href="http://www.ecsqaru.org/" - www.ecsqaru.org/
) constitute a major forum for advances in the theory and practice of reasoning under uncertainty, with a focus on bringing symbolic and quantitative aspects together. Contributions come from researchers interested in advancing the scientific knowledge and from practitioners using uncertainty techniques in real-world applications. The scope of the ECSQARU conferences encompasses fundamental issues, representation, inference, learning, and decision making in qualitative and numeric uncertainty paradigms. 
 Previous ECSQARU events have been held in Arras (2023), Prague (2021), Belgrade (2019), Lugano (2017), Compiegne (2015), Utrecht (2013), Belfast (2011), Verona (2009), Hammamet (2007), Barcelona (2005), Aalborg (2003), Toulouse (2001), London (1999), Bonn (1997), Fribourg (1995), Granada (1993), and Marseille (1991).

 Submitted papers must be original and not under review in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. They will be evaluated by peer reviews based on originality, significance technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. The reviewing process is single blind. 
 Authors of accepted papers are expected to attend the conference to present their work, at least one author of each paper must register for the conference. 
 Submitted papers must be at most 12 pages (excluding references) in the Springer LNCS/LNAI format: 
 https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines 
 Paper submission, in PDF format, will be managed through OpenReview at 
 href="https://openreview.net/group?id=ECSQARU.org/2025/Conference" - https://openreview.net/group?id=ECSQARU.org/2025/Conference
and will be opened on January 1, 2025. It is mendatory to register an abstract beforehand. The abstract submission deadline is May 8, 2025; and the submission deadline for papers is May 15, 2025. 
 Accepted papers will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series, which is a LNCS subseries.
