Welcome to PAKDD 2025 
 Founded in 1997, the Pacific-Asia Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (PAKDD) has been one of the premier and leading international conferences for data science, data mining, and knowledge discovery. The 29th edition of PAKDD will be held in Sydney, Australia, from June 10–13, 2025. 
 PAKDD 2025 Features 
 PAKDD 2025 technical program features a Survey Track, and a Special Track on Large Language Models for Data Science. In the new era of generative AI, PAKDD 2025 expects to see substantial submissions on generative AI, large language models, human-like AI, and data science for robotics including humanoid robots, and metaverse technologies. Other typical topics include data cleaning and preparation, data transformation, mining, inference, learning, explainability, data privacy, dissemination of results, theoretical foundations for novel models and algorithms for data science problems in science, business, medicine, and engineering, along with an emphasis on practical yet principled novel models of search and data mining, algorithm design and analysis, economic implications, and in-depth experimental analysis of accuracy and performance. We also invite paper submissions at the intersection of data science and society as part of the main track. 
 About PAKDD 
 PAKDD is a prestigious and highly selective conference that includes high-profile keynote and invited talks as well as refereed full research papers. It provides an international peer-reviewed forum for researchers and industry practitioners who are addressing the problems to share their new ideas, original research results, and practical development experiences from all KDD-related areas, including data science, data mining, data warehousing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, databases, statistics, knowledge engineering, visualization, decision-making systems, and emerging applications. Everyone new to the field has many opportunities to learn about cutting-edge research by attending visionary keynote speeches, paper presentations, tutorials, and workshops.
