 EAI ArtsIT 2025 
 November, 2025 
 Dubai, UAE 
 “Event Update: 
 This event is being relocated. 
 More details coming soon.” 
 ArtsITbrings together a diverse international community of researchers, practitioners, artists, and academics from various disciplines to explore the dynamic relationship between art and information technology across a range of distinct domains. Since its inception in 2009, ArtsIT has been established as a prominent scientific platform for sharing cutting-edge research findings at the convergence of art, science, culture, performing arts, media, and technology. Artistic practice utilizing digital media serves not only as a means of analyzing and critically reflecting on the influence of technology on our lives, culture, and society but also as a tool for fostering discussions on sustainability, responsibility, and human dignity. In addition to the main track that includes topics such digital artworks and cultural heritage, audio art, games and gamification, immersive technologies and interactive art installations, the event dedicates attention to recent advancements that have made significant contributions to the field in recent years, such as virtualization, artificial intelligence and big data, virtual reality and the metaverse, with dedicated sessions. In an attempt to bridge the gap between research in art and technology, this interdisciplinary conference aims to enrich both fields and contribute to the development of new ideas, experiences, and global societal advancements. The convergence of Art and Tech can cultivate innovation and stimulate imaginative thought. 
 The conference aims to bring together artists and technologists to join forces to challenge the limitations within their respective domains, while through the merging artistic expression with technological progress, novel concepts, methodologies, and modes of creative expression can arise.

Welcome to ArtsIT 2025! 
 We are excited to have you join us for the 2025 edition of the International Conference on Arts and Technology (ArtsIT 2025), where we continue to explore the dynamic intersection of arts, technology, and innovation. As the Steering Chair, and an international artist in this contemporary field, I am proud to guide this year’s conference, which promises to bring together groundbreaking research, inspiring talks, and transformative collaborations. This year we have increased special track offerings (under “Calls”) and authors are recommended to browse these initially to see if fitting your topic as the track chair and committee members are experts in their fields, thus act as expert reviewers for submissions and offering special session presentations to raise authors’ profile. 
 Reflecting on last year’s event, also hosted in UAE at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), we were delighted by the enthusiasm and impactful discussions shared by our many participants. High quality paper presentations by attending delegates were cojoined by six luminary keynote speaker talks, workshops, performances, demonstrations, posters, and a panel discussion chaired by the Australian Network for Art and Technology (ANAT). As one attendee shared, “ArtsIT 2024 was a remarkable experience, fostering a deep exchange of ideas that will resonate for years.” We look forward to building on this momentum and seeing what new insights this year will bring as we again evolve the growing ArtsIT global community.

 EAI ArtsIT 2025 
 November, 2025 
 Dubai, UAE 
 “Event Update: 
 This event is being relocated. 
 More details coming soon.” 
 ArtsITbrings together a diverse international community of researchers, practitioners, artists, and academics from various disciplines to explore the dynamic relationship between art and information technology across a range of distinct domains. Since its inception in 2009, ArtsIT has been established as a prominent scientific platform for sharing cutting-edge research findings at the convergence of art, science, culture, performing arts, media, and technology. Artistic practice utilizing digital media serves not only as a means of analyzing and critically reflecting on the influence of technology on our lives, culture, and society but also as a tool for fostering discussions on sustainability, responsibility, and human dignity. In addition to the main track that includes topics such digital artworks and cultural heritage, audio art, games and gamification, immersive technologies and interactive art installations, the event dedicates attention to recent advancements that have made significant contributions to the field in recent years, such as virtualization, artificial intelligence and big data, virtual reality and the metaverse, with dedicated sessions. In an attempt to bridge the gap between research in art and technology, this interdisciplinary conference aims to enrich both fields and contribute to the development of new ideas, experiences, and global societal advancements. The convergence of Art and Tech can cultivate innovation and stimulate imaginative thought. 
 The conference aims to bring together artists and technologists to join forces to challenge the limitations within their respective domains, while through the merging artistic expression with technological progress, novel concepts, methodologies, and modes of creative expression can arise.

Each track is managed by a chair and committee who handle submission reviews, ensuring unbiased, blinded evaluations by expert reviewers. By running as mini-conferences under the main conference umbrella, Special Tracks enhance the quality of reviews and reduce the burden on the main tracks, offering higher quality content and more specialized discussions. We encourage you to submit your Special Track proposals and contribute to the conference’s mission of fostering specialized, impactful discussions.

Welcome to ArtsIT 2025! 
 We are excited to have you join us for the 2025 edition of the International Conference on Arts and Technology (ArtsIT 2025), where we continue to explore the dynamic intersection of arts, technology, and innovation. As the Steering Chair, and an international artist in this contemporary field, I am proud to guide this year’s conference, which promises to bring together groundbreaking research, inspiring talks, and transformative collaborations. This year we have increased special track offerings (under “Calls”) and authors are recommended to browse these initially to see if fitting your topic as the track chair and committee members are experts in their fields, thus act as expert reviewers for submissions and offering special session presentations to raise authors’ profile. 
 Reflecting on last year’s event, also hosted in UAE at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), we were delighted by the enthusiasm and impactful discussions shared by our many participants. High quality paper presentations by attending delegates were cojoined by six luminary keynote speaker talks, workshops, performances, demonstrations, posters, and a panel discussion chaired by the Australian Network for Art and Technology (ANAT). As one attendee shared, “ArtsIT 2024 was a remarkable experience, fostering a deep exchange of ideas that will resonate for years.” We look forward to building on this momentum and seeing what new insights this year will bring as we again evolve the growing ArtsIT global community.
