 The 15th International Conference on Risks and Security of Internet and Systems

 «SeCoIIA Kickoff Meeting 
 H2020 SeCoIIA – Webinar SeCoIIA Results» 
 The International Conference on Risks and Security of Internet and Systems 2020 will be the 15th in a series dedicated to security issues in Internet-related applications, networks and systems. Internet has become essential for the exchange of information between user groups and organizations from different backgrounds and with different needs and objectives. These users are exposed to increasing risks regarding security and privacy, due to the development of more and more sophisticated online attacks, the growth of Cyber Crime, etc. Attackers nowadays do not lack motivation and they are more and more experienced. To make matters worse, for performing attacks have become easily accessible. Moreover, the increasing complexity as well as the immaturity of new technologies such as pervasive, mobile and wireless devices and networks, raise new security challenges. 
 In this context, new security mechanisms and techniques should be deployed to achieve an assurance level acceptable for critical domains such as energy, transportation, health, defense, banking, critical infrastructures, embedded systems and networks, avionics systems, etc. The CRiSIS conference offers a remarkable forum for computer and network security actors from industry, academia and government to meet, exchange ideas and present recent advances on Internet-related security threats and vulnerabilities, and on the solutions that are needed to counter them.

 The following papers have been accepted at the 19th International Conference on Risks and Security of Internet and Systems (href="https://crisis2024.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr" - CRiSIS 2024
):Title | : Modeling and Assessing Coercion Threats in Electronic Voting 
 Author | : Riccardo Longo, Majid Mollaeefar, Umberto Morelli, Chiara Spadafora, Alessandro Tomasi, Silvio Ranise 
 Abstract | : Electronic voting holds the potential to increase voter participation and streamline election processes, but its broad use is limited by many challenges, e.g., ensuring system security and usability. One of the most difficult threats to counter is coercion; i.e., the ability to monitor and force voters’ actions. This paper proposes a methodology to assess an e-voting system’s resistance to coercion by gathering the security properties that an e-voting solution should offer from both academia and regulation, and adapting the Microsoft STRIDE and LINDDUN threats and the OWASP Risk Rating Technologies to the e-voting scenario. 
 Title | : Protecting Digital Identity Wallet: A Threat Model in the Age of eIDAS 2.0 
 Author | : Amir Sharif, Zahra Ebadi Ansaroudi, Giada Sciarretta, Daniela Pöhn, Majid Mollaeefar, Wolfgang Hommel, Silvio Ranise 
 Abstract | : The revised eIDAS regulation (eIDAS 2.0) advocates a shift from federated identity management systems (such as SAML and OpenID Connect) to user-centric identity-based systems. It defines the European Digital Identity Wallet as a key component. The main goal is to enhance privacy by empowering citizens to selectively disclose personal data in a controlled way. To facilitate the implementation of an interoperable Wallet solution, the EU Commission published a reference architecture and identified a high-level set of requirements. However, comprehensive security and privacy guidelines to ensure a secure and privacy-preserving solution are still missing. To address this gap, we provide threat modeling explicitly designed for the Digital Identity Wallet context. This allows for identifying potential threats and a set of effective controls to secure the implementations.
