 40th International Conference on Logic Programming 
 Dallas, Texas | 11-17 October, 2024 
 Colocated withLPNMR’24 
 The 40th International Conference on Logic Programming will be held on the campus of the University of Texas at Dallas in October 2024. It will be colocated with the 17th International Conference on Logic Programming and Nonmonotonic Reasoning(LPNMR’24)Dallas, part of the Dallas/Fort-Worth metroplex, is a dynamic city with great tourist attractions. Renowned for its unique blend of modernity and rich cultural heritage, Dallas offers an array of attractions for visitors: from diverse range of museums, such as the Dallas Museum of Art and the Perot Museum of Nature and Science, to the Fort Worth Stockyards that feature the Cattle Drive (twice daily). Dallas boasts a thriving culinary scene, from sizzling steakhouses to trendy food trucks, to authentic Tex-Mex cuisine. With a wealth of entertainment options, including shopping districts, live music venues, and sports events, a visit to Dallas is a memorable experience.href="https://www.iclp24.utdallas.edu/accepted-papers/" - ICLP’24 Conference Program
