 About the Conference 
 Eurocomb, the European Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Applications, is an academic conference in the mathematical field of combinatorics. 
 Topics include algebraic combinatorics, combinatorial geometry, combinatorial number theory, combinatorial optimization, designs and configurations, enumerative combinatorics, extremal combinatorics, graph theory, ordered sets, random methods, and topological combinatorics.

 Submissions 
 Contributions should be submitted as pdf files through the EasyChair interface using the link below. Each submission should consist of the title, the list of authors with affiliations, the abstract and the main body describing recent original theoretical results or applications of Combinatorics and Graph Theory. The length of the submission is limited to 5 pages of A4 (excluding references). The results presented in a submission should not have been published (on-line or in print) in a journal or in peer-reviewed conference proceedings in 2024 or earlier. The extended abstracts of accepted submissions will be published in the proceedings of EUROCOMB'25.

After the paper acceptance, the authors will be kindly asked to format the paper according to the following style (href="https://iuuk.mff.cuni.cz/events/conferences/eurocomb23/template.zip" - LaTeX template
). 
 Call for Papers 
 As the previous 12 conferences of the Eurocomb series, EUROCOMB'25 covers the full range of combinatorics and graph theory including applications in other areas of mathematics, computer science and engineering. The scope includes but is not limited to: 
 Algebraic combinatorics 
 Combinatorial algorithms 
 Combinatorial geometry 
 Combinatorial number theory 
 Combinatorial optimization 
 Designs and configurations 
 Enumerative combinatorics 
 Extremal combinatorics 
 Graph theory 
 Matroid theory 
 Ordered sets 
 Random methods 
 Topological combinatorics 
  
 We expect to accept about the same number of submissions for oral presentation as in the recent years. Since the number of slots for oral presentations is limited, submissions of good quality that cannot be accepted for full presentation due to capacity constraints will be invited to be presented during the poster session.
