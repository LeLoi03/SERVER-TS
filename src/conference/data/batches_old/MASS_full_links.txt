 The 22nd IEEE International Conference on 
 Mobile Ad-Hoc and Smart Systems 
 (MASS 2025) 
 October 6-8, 2025 
  
 Chicago, USAABOUT IEEE MASS 2025 
 IEEE MASS is a premier annual forum for sharing original, novel ideas in mobile ad-hoc networks and smart systems, defined broadly. As wireless ad-hoc networks continue to evolve and specialize into a number of application scenarios and environments, and sensor-based systems and technologies increasingly permeate our everyday life and become the inner fabric of the Internet of Things and cyber-physical systems, the unfolding of smart environments such as smart cities, smart farming, smart healthcare, and smart manufacturing, to name a few, demand integrated solutions that can make intelligent use of both cloud and edge systems, while applying machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to handle their growing complexity and to leverage the vast amount of available data created. 
 Sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Computer Society's TCDP, the 22nd edition of the IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Smart Systems (MASS) will be held in Chicago in October 2025, and it aims at bringing together researchers, developers, and practitioners to address recent advances in mobile ad-hoc and smart systems, covering algorithms, theory, protocols, systems & applications, experimental evaluations and testbeds, security/privacy, as well as AI/ML-based smart design. 
 Accepted papers for IEEE MASS 2025 will be included in IEEE Xplore Digital Library after they are presented at the conference. For each accepted paper to be published in the IEEE MASS 2025 Proceedings and IEEE Xplore, at least one author is required to register and attend the conference. The paper must be presented by an author listed on the paper. Substitute presenters, due to unforeseen circumstances or verifiable excuses, must be authorized in advance by the TPC Chairs. Unauthorized substitute presentations will result in the paper not being added to the IEEE digital archive of the conference proceedings. We also strongly encourage the authors to apply for a visa, if needed, at their earliest convenience. 
 The organizing committee and the program committee will endeavor to ensure the high quality of the conference program and the excellent experience of conference authors and attendees. Thank you for your understanding and support!
