 Short Papers | – These are mostly composed of work in progress reports or fresh developments and have 4 pages at maximum (2,500 words). 
 Reflection Papers | – These might review recent research literature pertaining to a particular problem or approach, indicate what the findings suggest, and/or provide a suggestion – with rationale and justification – for a different approach or perspective on that problem. Reflection papers might also analyze general trends or discuss important issues in topics related to Applied Computing. These have two pages at maximum (1500 words). 
 Posters / Demonstrations | – These have one page at the maximum (625 words) besides the poster itself (or demonstration) that will be exposed at the conference.

 Invited Talks | – These will be made of contributions from well-known scholars and company representatives. An abstract will be included in the conference proceedings. 
 Doctoral Consortium | – The Doctoral Consortium will discuss on going work of PhD students in an informal and formative atmosphere. Contributions to the consortium should take the form of either: | a critical literature review of the research topic providing the rationale for the relevance and interest of the research topic; or | a short paper discussing the research question(s), research objectives, research methodology and work done so far. | Doctoral Consortium Contributions should have a maximum 2,500 words (4 pages). 
 Corporate Showcases & Exhibitions | – The former enables Companies to present recent developments and applications, inform a large and qualified audience of your future directions and showcase company’s noteworthy products and services.
