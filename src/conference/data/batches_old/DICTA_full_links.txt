 Overview 
 Top Research Topics at Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications? 
 Artificial intelligence (77.28%) 
 Computer vision (50.67%) 
 Pattern recognition (34.59%) 
 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications mainly deals with areas of study such as Artificial intelligence, Computer vision, Pattern recognition, Feature extraction and Image segmentation. The event features Artificial intelligence research that overlaps with concepts in Machine learning. Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications explores topics in Computer vision which can be helpful for research in disciplines like Algorithm and Robustness (computer science). 
 It holds forums on Pattern recognition that merges themes from other disciplines such as Contextual image classification, Facial recognition system, Artificial neural network and Feature (computer vision). Research in Facial recognition system discussed is concerned with the study of Face (geometry) as a whole. The research on Feature extraction tackled can also make contributions to studies in the areas of Visualization and Support vector machine. 
 Presentations on Image segmentation include those discussing Scale-space segmentation and Image texture. The conference is focused mainly on Scale-space segmentation, particularly Segmentation-based object categorization. The research on Convolutional neural network discussed in it draws on the closely related field of Deep learning. 
 What are the most cited papers published at the conference? 
 Understanding Data Augmentation for Classification: When to Warp? (318 citations) 
 Phase Congruency Detects Corners and Edges (313 citations) 
 Crowd Counting Using Multiple Local Features (240 citations) 
 Research areas of the most cited articles at Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications: 
 The main points discussed in the most cited articles deal with Artificial intelligence, Computer vision, Pattern recognition, Feature extraction and Image segmentation. Many of the studies tackled in the most cited papers connect Artificial intelligence with a similar field of study like Machine learning. The most cited publications address concerns in Pattern recognition which are intertwined with other disciplines, such as Facial recognition system and Feature (computer vision). 
 What topics the last edition of the conference is best known for? 
 Artificial intelligence 
 Computer vision 
 Statistics 
 The previous edition focused in particular on these issues: 
 Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications investigates areas of study like Artificial intelligence, Pattern recognition, Computer vision, Convolutional neural network and Deep learning. The studies tackled, which mainly focus on Artificial intelligence, apply to Machine learning as well. The conference dives deep in exploring the relationship between the study of Pattern recognition and Cluster analysis. 
 It focuses on Computer vision but sometimes tackles the closely related topic of Initialization which is concerned with Video tracking. Class (biology), Object (computer science), Contextual image classification, Discriminative model and Remote sensing are some topics wherein Convolutional neural network research discussed in Digital Image Computing: Techniques and Applications have an impact. The event explores research in Deep learning alongside concepts in Object detection and other areas of study in Benchmark (computing). 
 The most cited articles from the last conference are: 
 Prediction and Localization of Student Engagement in the Wild (29 citations) 
 Table Detection in Document Images using Foreground and Background Features (21 citations) 
 Strided U-Net Model: Retinal Vessels Segmentation using Dice Loss (16 citations) 
 Papers citation over time 
 A key indicator for each conference is its effectiveness in reaching other researchers with the papers published at that venue. 
 The chart below presents the interquartile range (first quartile 25%, median 50% and third quartile 75%) of the number of citations of articles over time.

 The experience to innovation index 
 Our experience to innovation index was created to show a cross-section of the experience level of authors publishing at a conference. The index includes the authors publishing at thelast edition of a conference, grouped by total number of publications throughout their academic career (P) and the total number of citations of these publications ever received (C). 
 The group intervals were selected empirically to best show the diversity of the authors' experiences, their labels were selected as a convenience, not as judgment. The authors were divided into the following groups: 
 Novice - P < 5 or C < 25 (the number of publications less than 5 or the number of citations less than 25), 
 Competent - P < 10 or C < 100 (the number of publications less than 10 or the number of citations less than 100), 
 Experienced - P < 25 or C < 625 (the number of publications less than 25 or the number of citations less than 625), 
 Master - P < 50 or C < 2500 (the number of publications less than 50 or the number of citations less than 2500), 
 Star - P ≥ 50 and C ≥ 2500 (both the number of publications greater than 50 and the number of citations greater than 2500).
