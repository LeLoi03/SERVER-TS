 About 
 18th International Conference on Computational Intelligence in Security for Information Systems 
 CISIS’25 Proceedings will be published by Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems (TENTATIVE) 
 CISIS aims to offer a meeting opportunity for academic and industry-related researchers belonging to the various, vast communities of Computational Intelligence, Information Security, and Data Mining. The need for intelligent, flexible behaviour by large, complex systems, especially in mission-critical domains, is intended to be the catalyst and the aggregation stimulus for the overall event. In conjunction with: 20th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems HAIS 2025, 16th International Conference on EUropean Transnational Educational ICEUTE 2025 and 20th International Conference on Soft Computing Models in Industrial and Environmental Applications SOCO 2025.

 Abstract 
 This paper presents a multi-level adaptive network modelling approach to analyse and predict the behaviour of employees during phishing training simulations. The presented adaptive network model is based on elements of the COM-B framework for behavioural change which takes into account factors related to the capability, opportunity and motivation to determine employees reactions to phishing emails. In addition to this the cyber security risks within hospitals associated with phishing are highlighted. The study demonstrates that through feedback learning processes the behaviour of employees changes over time leading to more secure behaviour.

 haisconference.eu | The 20th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2025)combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness, high-dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both our knowledge and row data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way. HAIS series of conferences provides an interesting opportunity to present and discuss the latest theoretical advances and real-world applications in this multidisciplinary research field.

Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness, high-dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both our knowledge and row data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way. HAIS series of conferences provides an interesting opportunity to present and discuss the latest theoretical advances and real-world applications in this multidisciplinary research field.

 Ensure the final versions of the papers are uploaded before the deadline. 
 Attend the conference and chair the session. 
 Disseminate widely a call for papers for the special session. 
 Researchers who would like to organise one or more Invited Special Sessions on topics falling within the scope of the conference are invited to submit a proposal for consideration. If so, please send an e-mail tohector.quintian@udc.esincluding the following information, once you have fulfill the form below:
