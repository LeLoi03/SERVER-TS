 The 8th International Conference on Machine Vision and Applications 
 (ICMVA 2025) 
 We are pleased to announce that The 8th International Conference on Machine Vision and Applications (ICMVA 2025)is to be held inMelbourne, Australia during June 12-14, 2025.The conference is sponsored by Swinburne University, University of Stuttgart, University of Tartu, supported by Okayama University,University of Ãvora, Gifu Shotoku Gakuen University, and National Taiwan University of Science and Technology. 
 The field of machine vision and application, has been growing at a fast pace.As in most fast-developing fields, not all aspects of machine vision that are of interest to active researchers are useful to the designers and users of a vision system for a specific application. This conference is intended to provide a balanced introduction to machine vision. Basic concepts and application are introduced and discussed with various essential mathematical elements etc onsite. The details to allow implementation and use of vision algorithm in practical application are provided, and engineering aspects of techniques are emphasized. The problems to apply machine vision are going to be solved. 
 What's more, the aim of this conference is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry, and to stimulate the exchange of knowledge through intensive discussions on the cutting-edge research topics listed below:Image Acquisition, Image Processing, Depth Estimation and Reconstruction, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Neural Networks, etc. 
 We hope that the conference results constituted significant contribution to the knowledge in these up to date scientific field.The organizing committee of conference is pleased to invite prospective authors to submit their original manuscripts to ICMVA 2025. 
 Conference Proceedings 
 Any paper submitted for the conference is reviewed by at least two international reviewers with expertise in the relevant subject area. 
 Based on the reviewerâs comments, papers are accepted, rejected or accepted with revision. Accepted and registered Papers can be published inSPIEConference Proceedings, which can be indexed byEI Compendex, SCOPUS, etc.
