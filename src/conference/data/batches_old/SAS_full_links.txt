 About 
 href="#Call-for-Papers" - Call for Papers 
 Welcome to the website of the 32nd Static Analysis Symposium (SAS 2025). Static analysis is widely recognized as a fundamental tool for program verification, bug detection, compiler optimization, program understanding, and software maintenance. The series ofStatic Analysis Symposiahas served for more than 30 years as the primary venue for the presentation of theoretical, practical, and application advances in the area. 
 The Symposium will be held from October 13-15 at the Marina Bay Sands Convention Centre. 
 Call for Papers 
 Static Analysis is widely recognized as a fundamental tool for program verification, bug detection, compiler optimization, program understanding, and software maintenance. The series of Static Analysis Symposia has served for over 30 years as the primary venue for the presentation of theoretical, practical, and application advances in the area. 
 href="#topics" - Topics
The technical program for SAS 2025 will consist of invited lectures and presentations of refereed papers. Contributions are welcomed on all aspects of program analysis analysis, including, but not limited to: 
 Abstract interpretation 
 Automated deduction 
 Data flow analysis 
 Debugging techniques 
 Deductive methods 
 Emerging applications 
 Model-checking 
 Data science 
 Program optimizations and transformations 
 Program synthesis 
 Program verification 
 Machine learning and verification 
 Security analysis 
 Tool environments and architectures 
 Theoretical frameworks 
 Type checking 
 Distributed or networked systems 
 LLM for static analysis and static analysis for LLM 
 All paper submissions will be evaluated on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. 
 We welcome regular papers as well as papers focusing on any of the following in the NEAT (New questions/areas, Experience, Announcement, Tool) category: 
 Well-motivated discussion of new questions or new areas. 
 Experience with static analysis tools, Industrial Reports, and Case Studies 
 Brief announcements of work in progress 
 Tool papers 
 Submissions can address any programming paradigm, including concurrent, constraint, functional, imperative, logic, object-oriented, aspect, multi-core, distributed, and GPU programming. We do not impose a page limit for submitted papers but we encourage brevity as reviewers have a limited time that they can spend on each paper. With the exception of NEAT papers, all papers will follow a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. The identity of the authors for the NEAT papers will be therefore known to the reviewers. 
 Papers must be written and presented in English. A submitted paper must describe original work and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed proceedings. 
 All submitted papers will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. The review process will include a rebuttal period where authors have the opportunity to respond to preliminary reviews on the paper. 
 Radhia Cousot Award 
 The program committee will select an accepted regular paper for the Radhia Cousot Young Researcher Best Paper Award in memory of Radhia Cousot and her fundamental contributions to static analysis, as well as being one of the main promoters and organizers of the SAS series of conferences. 
 Artifacts 
 As in previous years, we encourage authors to submit a virtual machine image containing any artifacts and evaluations presented in the paper. Artifact submission is optional. Artifact evaluation will be concurrent with paper review. For more details, please visit the SAS 2025 Artifacts page. 
 href="#submission-details" - Submission Details
Double-Blind Requirement 
 All regular papers will follow a double-blind process, where author names and affiliations are hidden for the review. To facilitate this process, submitted regular papers must adhere to the following: (1) Author names and affiliations must be omitted and (2) References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission, makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult, or interferes with the process of disseminating new ideas. For example, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized, even if they are written by the same authors and share common ideas, techniques, or infrastructure. 
 href="#neat-papers-content" - NEAT Papers Content
New problems papers are an opportunity to discuss visions, challenges, experiences, problems, and impactful solutions in the field of static analysis from both a research and applications perspective. Such papers are encouraged to take assertive positions and be forward-looking and aim for lively and insightful discussions that are influential to future research directions in static analysis. NEAT papers will be handled in singe-blind way. User experience & Industrial reports & Case studies papers describe the use of static analysis in industrial settings or in any chosen application domains. Papers in this category do not necessarily need to present original research results but are expected to contain applications of static analysis as well as a comprehensive evaluation in the chosen application domain. Such papers are encouraged to discuss the unique challenges of transferring research ideas to a real-world setting, reflect on any lessons learned from this technology transfer experience, and compare experiences with different analyzers highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Brief announcements of work in progress papers may describe work in progress. A submission that is not selected for regular presentation may be invited for a brief announcement. 
 href="#submission-guidelines" - Submission Guidelines
The SAS 2025 proceedings will be published by Springer in their LNCS series. Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, for LaTeX, Overleaf, or Word, for the preparation of their papers. The corresponding author of each accepted paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. 
 Special Issue Invitation 
 Accepted papers will be invited to submit to a special issue of theScience of Computer Programming (SCP). A SCP publication will require substantial additional material over the conference publication and will undergo a separate review process.

 About 
 href="#Call-for-Papers" - Call for Papers 
 Welcome to the website of the 32nd Static Analysis Symposium (SAS 2025). Static analysis is widely recognized as a fundamental tool for program verification, bug detection, compiler optimization, program understanding, and software maintenance. The series ofStatic Analysis Symposiahas served for more than 30 years as the primary venue for the presentation of theoretical, practical, and application advances in the area. 
 The Symposium will be held from October 13-15 at the Marina Bay Sands Convention Centre. 
 Call for Papers 
 Static Analysis is widely recognized as a fundamental tool for program verification, bug detection, compiler optimization, program understanding, and software maintenance. The series of Static Analysis Symposia has served for over 30 years as the primary venue for the presentation of theoretical, practical, and application advances in the area. 
 href="#topics" - Topics
The technical program for SAS 2025 will consist of invited lectures and presentations of refereed papers. Contributions are welcomed on all aspects of program analysis analysis, including, but not limited to: 
 Abstract interpretation 
 Automated deduction 
 Data flow analysis 
 Debugging techniques 
 Deductive methods 
 Emerging applications 
 Model-checking 
 Data science 
 Program optimizations and transformations 
 Program synthesis 
 Program verification 
 Machine learning and verification 
 Security analysis 
 Tool environments and architectures 
 Theoretical frameworks 
 Type checking 
 Distributed or networked systems 
 LLM for static analysis and static analysis for LLM 
 All paper submissions will be evaluated on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. 
 We welcome regular papers as well as papers focusing on any of the following in the NEAT (New questions/areas, Experience, Announcement, Tool) category: 
 Well-motivated discussion of new questions or new areas. 
 Experience with static analysis tools, Industrial Reports, and Case Studies 
 Brief announcements of work in progress 
 Tool papers 
 Submissions can address any programming paradigm, including concurrent, constraint, functional, imperative, logic, object-oriented, aspect, multi-core, distributed, and GPU programming. We do not impose a page limit for submitted papers but we encourage brevity as reviewers have a limited time that they can spend on each paper. With the exception of NEAT papers, all papers will follow a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. The identity of the authors for the NEAT papers will be therefore known to the reviewers. 
 Papers must be written and presented in English. A submitted paper must describe original work and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed proceedings. 
 All submitted papers will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. The review process will include a rebuttal period where authors have the opportunity to respond to preliminary reviews on the paper. 
 Radhia Cousot Award 
 The program committee will select an accepted regular paper for the Radhia Cousot Young Researcher Best Paper Award in memory of Radhia Cousot and her fundamental contributions to static analysis, as well as being one of the main promoters and organizers of the SAS series of conferences. 
 Artifacts 
 As in previous years, we encourage authors to submit a virtual machine image containing any artifacts and evaluations presented in the paper. Artifact submission is optional. Artifact evaluation will be concurrent with paper review. For more details, please visit the SAS 2025 Artifacts page. 
 href="#submission-details" - Submission Details
Double-Blind Requirement 
 All regular papers will follow a double-blind process, where author names and affiliations are hidden for the review. To facilitate this process, submitted regular papers must adhere to the following: (1) Author names and affiliations must be omitted and (2) References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission, makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult, or interferes with the process of disseminating new ideas. For example, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized, even if they are written by the same authors and share common ideas, techniques, or infrastructure. 
 href="#neat-papers-content" - NEAT Papers Content
New problems papers are an opportunity to discuss visions, challenges, experiences, problems, and impactful solutions in the field of static analysis from both a research and applications perspective. Such papers are encouraged to take assertive positions and be forward-looking and aim for lively and insightful discussions that are influential to future research directions in static analysis. NEAT papers will be handled in singe-blind way. User experience & Industrial reports & Case studies papers describe the use of static analysis in industrial settings or in any chosen application domains. Papers in this category do not necessarily need to present original research results but are expected to contain applications of static analysis as well as a comprehensive evaluation in the chosen application domain. Such papers are encouraged to discuss the unique challenges of transferring research ideas to a real-world setting, reflect on any lessons learned from this technology transfer experience, and compare experiences with different analyzers highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Brief announcements of work in progress papers may describe work in progress. A submission that is not selected for regular presentation may be invited for a brief announcement. 
 href="#submission-guidelines" - Submission Guidelines
The SAS 2025 proceedings will be published by Springer in their LNCS series. Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, for LaTeX, Overleaf, or Word, for the preparation of their papers. The corresponding author of each accepted paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. 
 Special Issue Invitation 
 Accepted papers will be invited to submit to a special issue of theScience of Computer Programming (SCP). A SCP publication will require substantial additional material over the conference publication and will undergo a separate review process.

 The Static Analysis Symposia 
  
 Description 
 Static Analysis is increasingly recognized as a fundamental tool for program verification, bug detection, compiler optimization, program understanding, and software maintenance. The series of International Static Analysis Symposia (SAS) serves as the primary venue for presentation of theoretical, practical, and application advances in the area. 
 Topics 
 Contributions to the technical program for Static Analysis Symposia typically consist of invited lectures and presentations of refereed papers. While each edition is independent, traditionally contributions are welcome on all aspects of static analysis, including, but not limited to: 
  
 abstract domains | abstract interpretation 
 abstract testing | bug detection 
 data flow analysis | model checking 
 new applications | program transformation 
 program verification | security analysis 
 theoretical frameworks | type checking 
 Submissions can address any programming paradigm, including concurrent, constraint, functional, imperative, logic object-oriented, aspect, multi-core, distributed, GPU programming, etc. Survey papers, that present some aspect of the above topics with a new coherence, and application papers that describe experience with industrial applications, are also welcome. 
 Papers must describe original work, be written and presented in English, and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed proceedings. Submitted papers will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance correctness, originality, and clarity. They should clearly identify what has been accomplished and why it is significant. 
 Artifacts 
 Since 2013 SAS is encouraging authors to submit a virtual machine image containing any artifacts and evaluations presented in papers. The goal of the artifact submissions is to strengthen adherence to the scientific approach in the evaluations and reproducibility of results in our field.Artifact submission isoptionalat the SAS conferences. The submitted artifacts are used by the program committee as a secondary evaluation criteria that will provide additional positive arguments for the paper's acceptance. Submissions without artifacts are still welcome and are not penalized. Some SAS editions publish artifacts of accepted papers. 
 Radhia Cousot Award 
 Starting in 2014, the program committee of each SAS conference selects a paper for theRadhia Cousot Young Researcher Best Paper Award, in memory ofRadhia Cousot, and her fundamental contributions to static analysis, as well as being one of the main promoters and organizers of the SAS series of conferences.

Moreover, to preserve the historical memory of the SC, the founding chair of the SC, Patrick Cousot, is included as an honorary senior member. The SAS SC for year X is in charge of: 
 Selecting the location and the Program Committee Chair and Organizing Chair of the next SAS (i.e., for year X+1). 
 Giving feedback to the PC chairs on the composition of the PC for year X+1. 
 Managing the financial resources of the SAS conferences. 
 Managing the connections with publishers and related conferences and events. 
 Managing the communication via social media and the web. 
 Proposing to the community any actions that may improve the scientific strength and status of SAS.
