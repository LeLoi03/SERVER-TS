 Conference InformationMiddleware 2025 will be a physical conference in Nashville scheduled for December 2025. All presentations for all tracks are expected to be in person. For special inquiries, please contact the general chair. 
 ACM/IFIP Middleware 
 The annual ACM/IFIP Middleware conference is a major forum for discussing innovations and recent scientific advances in middleware systems with a focus on the design, implementation deployment, and evaluation of distributed systems, platforms, and architectures for computing storage, and communication. 
 The conference will include a high-quality single-track technical program, invited speakers, an industrial track, panel discussions involving academic and industry leaders, poster and demonstration presentations, a doctoral symposium, tutorials, and workshops. 
 TOPICS OF INTEREST 
 The Middleware conference seeks original submissions of research papers on a diverse range of topics, particularly those identifying new research directions. The topics of interest for the conference include, but are not limited to: 
 Middleware Applications 
 Middleware for cyber-physical and real-time systems 
 Middleware support for security and privacy 
 Middleware for AI and machine learning systems 
 Middleware for data science pipelines 
 Middleware techniques for internet-of-things and smart cities 
 Middleware for multimedia systems 
 Middleware Systems 
 Fault tolerance and consistency 
 Distributed and parallel systems 
 Distributed ledgers and blockchains 
 Event-based, publish/subscribe, streaming, and peer-to-peer systems 
 Serverless and Function-as-a-Service computing 
 Data-intensive systems (big data) 
 Cloud, fog, edge computing, and data centers 
 Networking, network function virtualization, and software-defined networking 
 Mobile and pervasive systems and services 
 Emerging hardware technologies 
 Middleware Design Principles and Programming Models 
 Programming abstractions and paradigms for middleware 
 Reconfigurable, adaptable, and reflective middleware 
 Critical reviews of middleware paradigms, e.g., object models, aspect orientation 
 Methodologies and tools for middleware systems design, implementation, verification, and evaluation 
 Monitoring, resource management, and analysis 
 Virtualization, auto-scaling, provisioning, and scheduling 
 Energy and power-aware techniques

 Welcome to the website of the MIDDLEWARE series of conferences! 
 The Middleware conference is a forum for the discussion of important innovations and recent advances in the design, construction and uses of middleware. Middleware is a distributed-system software that resides between applications and underlying platforms (operating systems; databases; hardware), and/or ties together distributed applications, databases or devices. Its primary role is to coordinate and enable communication between different layers or components while isolating much of the complexity of distribution into a single, well tested and well understood system abstraction. 
 The scope of the conference is the design, implementation, deployment, and evaluation of distributed system platforms and architectures for future computing and communication environments.
