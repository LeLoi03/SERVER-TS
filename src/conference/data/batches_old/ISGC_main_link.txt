 AI and Hybrid Quantum - Shaping Tomorrow’s Scientific Breakthroughs 
 The rapid evolution of AI is reshaping scientific discovery across a wide range of research fields. At ISGC 2025, the focus will be on the practical deployment of AI technologies, particularly how they have been successfully integrated to accelerate research and address complex challenges. From machine learning models to large language models (LLMs), AI’s transformative impact is undeniable, and the conference will showcase real-world use cases and share valuable lessons learned in deploying these technologies. By showcasing the practical uses, ISGC 2025 aims to provide participants with actionable insights into how AI can be applied to enhance their own research and drive innovation in their fields. 
  
 In parallel, hybrid quantum computing is emerging as a promising game changer, similar to the rise of AI in recent years. As quantum computing continues to complement traditional supercomputers, it holds the potential to solve problems that were previously thought intractable. ISGC 2025 will explore the current state of hybrid quantum systems, discussing their deployment and the challenges in integrating these cutting-edge technologies. Together, AI and quantum computing represent the future of computational science, offering unprecedented opportunities for innovation. 
 ISGC 2025 will foster an environment for sharing ideas and solutions, helping participants refine their approaches and collaborate to overcome the challenges of deploying these transformative technologies.
