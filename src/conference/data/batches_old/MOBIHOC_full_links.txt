 Welcome to MobiHoc 2025 
 MobiHoc 2025, the 26th International Symposium on Theory, Algorithmic Foundations, and Protocol Design for Mobile Networks and Mobile Computing will be held in Houston, USA, October 27-30, 2025. MobiHoc is a premier international symposium dedicated to addressing challenges in dynamic networks and computing. 
 This year we significantly expand the conference’s scope to include theory, algorithms, and systems research on next-generation networking, communications, and related applications. We want to bring together the top researchers to one venue to build more bridges across different wireless subcommunities. 
 MobiHoc 2025 will feature a highly selective technical program, multiple distinguished keynote addresses, and an exciting panel. In addition, it includes workshops that are focused on areas of emerging interest.
