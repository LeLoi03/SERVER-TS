 The 1st Annual IEEE Communications Society Demonstration Conference 
 Conference Registration Now Live!We are excited to announce the launch of our conference registration site 
 WELCOME MESSAGE FROM THE CCNC 2025 GENERAL CHAIR 
 It is my great pleasure to welcome each and every one of you to the IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC) here in the vibrant city of Las Vegas. As many of you know, CCNC has long been recognized as a premier platform within the consumer electronics research community, offering a dynamic convergence of industrial and academic insights into cutting-edge visions and trends. I hope these conference days serve as a valuable opportunity for you to reconnect with colleagues, build new collaborations, engage in stimulating discussions, and explore groundbreaking research findings. To facilitate this, we have curated a diverse and exceptional technical program. Highlights include keynote speeches from renowned experts, thought-provoking panels, hands-on workshops, in-depth tutorials, engaging demonstrations, and interactive poster sessions. Additionally, our forty technical sessions will delve into emerging topics such as next-generation consumer electronics, edge/cloud computing and networking, beyond 5G/6G wireless technologies, IoT sensors and applications, security and privacy, AI/ML-driven communications, digital twins, non-terrestrial networks, and much more. We are eager to witness the lively exchange of ideas, spontaneous discussions in the hallways, and meaningful connections formed over coffee breaks and social events. 
 It is truly impossible to overstate my gratitude to Prof. Zhangyu Guan and Prof. Howon Lee for their exceptional contributions as TPC Chair and TPC Vice Chair, respectively. Their tireless efforts, strategic vision, and unwavering dedication were the driving forces behind the success of this conference. From managing the overwhelming volume of submissions to ensuring the highest standards of review and selection, they have exemplified outstanding leadership and professionalism. Their ability to coordinate a diverse team of track chairs, reviewers, and contributors with precision and care has not only guaranteed a robust technical program but also set a high standard for future conferences. On behalf of everyone involved, I extend my heartfelt thanks to both of them for their extraordinary commitment and invaluable support. I would also like to sincerely thank the twenty main track chairs, six selected-topic track chairs, and three work-in-progress track chairs. Their dedicated efforts were instrumental in managing the numerous submitted manuscripts with exceptional professionalism and attention to detail, contributing significantly to the success of this conference. Prof. Priyangshu Sen, the EDAS Chair, is equally deserving of recognition, whose outstanding technical support was invaluable. In addition to expertly configuring the system, he provided ongoing assistance to authors throughout the process. 
 In addition to the main tracks, we are delighted to present seven workshops, providing a platform for more focused and in-depth discussions on specialized topics. I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to Prof. Thorsten Herfet and Prof. Won-Yong Shin for their invaluable efforts in selecting and guiding these workshops to success. This year, we have seen unprecedented interest in our poster and demo tracks. These tracks offer presenters a unique opportunity to gain early exposure and receive valuable feedback from the community, with many returning in subsequent years with main track submissions. I would like to commend our Demo Chairs, Prof. Giovanni Delnevo and Prof. Koji Ishibashi, as well as our Poster Chairs, Prof. Kazuki Maruta and Prof. Angelo Trotta, for managing this substantial workload with remarkable efficiency and dedication. To enrich the diversity of ideas and discussions, our distinguished panelists, thoughtfully selected by Panel Chair Prof. Mingyue Ji, will share their unique insights and perspectives. Additionally, opportunities to explore innovative concepts and embark on new research frontiers in consumer communications will be provided through nine expertly curated tutorials, organized by Profs. Xuyu Wang and Enrico Natalizio. The success of an international conference like CCNC hinges on a well-executed and comprehensive publicity strategy. I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the Web Chair, Mr. Sidharth Santhi Nivas, the Media Chair, Dr. Manuela Montangero, the Publicity and Publication Chairs, Profs. Gokhan Secinit, Debashri Roy, and Jie Tian, the Local Arrangements Chair, Ebrahim Saberinia, and the Patron/Industry Chairs, Profs. Jae-Hyun Kim and Ranga Rao Venkatesha Prasad. Their dedication and coordinated efforts were instrumental in managing these critical aspects of the conference with precision and excellence. I would like to extend my personal gratitude to Profs. Marco Di Felice (Awards Chair) and Silvia Mirri (Keynotes Chair), both of whom have previously served as Chairs for past editions of the CCNC conference. Their experience and thoughtful guidance have played a significant role in shaping the success of this year’s conference, and I sincerely appreciate their continued support and advice. 
 Last but certainly not least, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to our patrons—Keysight, Chungnam National University, and Yonsei University—for their generous support of this conference. I also owe a special thanks to Ms. Melissa Torres from IEEE for her unwavering assistance at every stage of the conference organization, graciously and patiently responding to countless emails. Finally, my heartfelt appreciation goes to the CCNC Steering Committee members, Dr. Alan Kaplan, Mr. Doug Zuckerman, and Dr. Alexander Gelman, for their exceptional guidance and for entrusting me with the honor of chairing such a prestigious and distinctive event.

 The IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference (CCNC), sponsored by the IEEE Communications Society, is a major annual international conference. Taking advantage of its co-location with the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), which is the world's largest tradeshow on consumer technology, CCNC is organized with the objective of bringing together researchers, developers, and practitioners from academia and industry working in all areas of consumer communications and networking technologies. CCNC 2025 will feature high-quality keynotes, plenary talks, technical and industry papers, panels, tutorials, and demonstrations. In addition, the CCNC 2025 Organization Committee invites members of the research, development, and practitioner communities to submit Workshop and Special Session proposals. Workshops provide a forum for people to discuss areas of special interest with like-minded researchers and practitioners. Special Sessions complement the main program with new or emerging topics that are of particular interest to the consumer communications and networking community and may also cut across and beyond disciplines traditionally represented at CCNC. Research contributions are welcome in all areas pertinent to consumer communications and networking, including: 
 Edge/Cloud Computing and Networking 
 Networking Solutions for Metaverse, Social Applications, Multimedia, and Games 
 Testbeds, Experimentation and Datasets for Communications and Networking 
 Wireless Communications: Fundamentals, PHY and Above 
 Beyond 5G and Towards 6G
