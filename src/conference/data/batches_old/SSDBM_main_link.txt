 Welcome to SSDBM 2025 
  
 The International Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Management 2025 is aimed to bring together domain experts, data management researchers, practitioners, and developers for the presentation and exchange of the latest research results on concepts, tools, and techniques for scalable and scientific data management. Previous editions of SSDBM focused on scientific statistical databases. In 2025, the scope of the 37th edition of SSDBM will be expanded to all scalable and scientific data management fields. The name of the conference is changed toInternational Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Managementfrom the International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management, while keeping the acronym SSDBM. 
 The new SSDBM conference will provide a forum for original research contributions and practical system design, implementation and evaluation of latest advances in scalable and scientific data management. The conference program typically consists of a single track to facilitate discussion, and contains presentations of invited talks, panel sessions, and demonstrations of research prototypes and industrial systems. 
 SSDBM 2025 will be hosted by The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. The conference will be held on June 23 - 25, 2025, in the Ideation Zone of the Translational Data Analytics Institute. SSDBM 2025 will continue the tradition of past SSDBM meetings in providing a stimulating environment to encourage discussion, fellowship and exchange of ideas in all aspects of research related to scientific and statistical data management, and high-performance data analysis tools and techniques for distributed datasets.

 Call for Papers 
 TheInternational Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Management 2025aims to bring together domain experts, data management researchers, practitioners, and developers to present and exchange the latest research findings on concepts, tools, and techniques for scalable scientific data management. While previous editions of SSDBM primarily focused on scientific statistical databases, the 37th edition in 2025 will broaden its scope to encompass all areas of scalable and scientific data management. Reflecting this expanded focus, the conference has been renamed from the International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management to theInternational Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Management, while retaining the well-known acronym, SSDBM. 
 The new SSDBM conference will serve as a forum for original research contributions, as well as practical system design, implementation, and evaluation of the latest advances in scalable and scientific data management. The program typically features a single-track format to foster active discussion and includes invited talks, panel sessions, and demonstrations of research prototypes and industrial systems. 
 SSDBM 2025 will be hosted by The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, from June 23 to June 25, 2025. Continuing the tradition of past SSDBM meetings, SSDBM 2025 will offer a stimulating environment designed to foster discussion, collaboration, and the exchange of ideas on all aspects of scientific and statistical data management research, as well as high-performance data analysis tools and techniques for distributed datasets. 
 The Proceedings of SSDBM 2025 will be published by Association of Computing Machinery (ACM)International Conference Proceeding Series (ICPS)and will appear inthe ACM Digital Libraryand manyhref="https://authors.acm.org/journals/journals-indexing-list" - indexing providers

 Submission site:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ssdbm2025" - EasyChair
The program committee may decide to accept some papers as short papers or posters. Regular papers will be given a presentation slot in the conference, while short papers will be given a short presentation slot in the conference. Regular papers (up to 12 pages including references) and Short papers (up to 6 pages including references) will be included as part of the conference proceedings. Posters with a single page abstract and electronic poster presentation will be published on the conference website, without proceedings. 
 If your paper is selected, at least one author must register for the Technical Program in order to attend the conference and present the paper. Each author registration can be applied to only one accepted submission. For an accepted paper to be included in the proceedings, the author has to present the paper at the conference in person.
