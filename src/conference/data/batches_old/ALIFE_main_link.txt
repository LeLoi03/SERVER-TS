 ABOUT THE CONFERENCE 
 The annual conference on Artificial Life - ALIFE 2025 - will take place in the heart of Kyoto, Japan from 6-10 October 2025. 
  
 This year’s theme is Ciphers of Life, encouraging participants to explore the many ways that life encodes information, creates internal languages, and interacts in encrypted ways with its environment. 
  
 Artificial life research focuses on understanding, replicating, and extending the fundamental principles of life. Much of this research involves creating artificial systems that exhibit life-like behaviors.

Call for Special Sessions 
 CALL FOR SPECIAL SESSIONS 
 Extended Deadline: 28 February 2025— PASSED 
 ‍ 
 Original Deadline: 21 February 2025 
 Special sessions will be specially-themed tracks in the main conference. The idea is to attract high-quality submissions on topics of particular interest to our community. We are particularly interested in sessions that will set new directions for future research and bring new voices into our community. These sessions will be part of the main conference and will run alongside other conference sessions. 
  
 Organizing a special session provides an opportunity to explore in depth a particular topic within the main conference, and to bring new ideas and new people into the ALife community. We are open to any ideas you might have that might create a buzz around your topic or the conference in general, such as advertising the session outside of the usual ALife community or holding panel or group discussions as part of the session. 
  
 Submissions to your session will go through the main conference review system. As a session organizer, you would set the topic of the session, attract submissions through whatever means you wish, and chair the session at the conference. 
  
 Please note that special sessions are different from workshops. The main difference is that special sessions are part of the main conference - they share its review process and accepted submissions will appear in the proceedings. There will also be workshop sessions at ALIFE 2025, and a call for workshop proposals will be sent out separately. 
 ‍ 
 We welcome session proposals on any topic. 
 Submission Process 
 Every special session proposal should include: 
 Title of the special session 
 Name(s) and affiliation(s) of the organizer(s) with contact details 
 Short bio or CV of the organizer(s) 
 Description of the session theme, including why tis session theme deserves special attention from the ALife community (about 250 words) 
 What you propose to do to support the session, such as advertising it or in terms of organisation (about 150 words) 
 List of 3-5 senior reviewers suggestions relevant for your session 
 All proposals must should be submitted through followingform 
 Call for Workshop & Tutorial Proposals 
 CALL FOR WORKSHOPS AND TUTORIALS 
 Deadline:7 March 2025— PASSED 
 Workshops aim to promote and discuss new ideas and topics in the field of artificial life in a more informal context. Workshops might be organised as invited talks, panel discussions, or contributed talks. Each workshop slot will be 1.5 hours long. 
  
 ALIFE will provide the on-site logistics and links from the main conference website. The tutorial and workshop organisers are responsible for all other organisational issues. 
 Submission Process 
 Every workshop proposal should include: 
 Title of the workshop 
 Name(s) and affiliation(s) of the organizer(s) with contact details 
 Short bio or CV of the organizer(s) 
 A proposal describing the content and its importance for the ALIFE community (150-250 words)) 
 Roughly approximated number of participants 
 Planned duration: one or two 90-minutes slots.
