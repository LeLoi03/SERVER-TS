 ACM SenSys 2025 
 6 - 9 MayIrvine, USA 
 The 23rd ACM Conference on 
 Embedded Networked Sensor Systems 
 In transition to Conference on 
 Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems 
 Announcement from the Joint 
 SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI Steering Committee 
 We are excited to announcethe plans of merging threeleading conferences — SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI — into a single premier event under the new nameSenSys: Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems. This unified conference will focus on advancing research at the intersection of sensing systems and embedded artificial intelligence. Originating from distinct yet complementary research areas, these three conferences have driven innovation across multiple disciplines, including sensor networks, embedded systems, mobile computing, wireless communication, signal processing, data science, and AI-driven applications. As intelligent sensing systems continue to permeate diverse research domains, the necessity for a unified, high-impact forum has become apparent. The newly expanded SenSys conference will provide a comprehensive platform where researchers and industry professionals can converge to present state-of-the-art research, exchange novel ideas, address key challenges, and shape the future of the field. 
 SenSys'25 will continue as a SenSys event (Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems), while the merger with IPSN and IoTDI is pending final approvals ofthe ACM and the IEEE. SenSys'25 will bring the three communities together and mark an important milestone in the transition toward a fully unified conference. The merger will be finalized as soon as the necessary approvals and structure are in place. SenSys 2025 will be collocated with CPS-IoT Week 2025, providing a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary exchange. All accepted papers in 2025 will be published in the ACM SenSys proceedings. In addition, we are exploring the possibility of introducing multiple submission deadlines in the future.

 2025 ACM SenSys Call for Papers 
 ACM SenSys 2025 will mark the inaugural combined event, merging SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI, forming the single premier conference in the area of Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems. Due to time required for institutional approvals, this year’s SenSys will retain the current name (Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems) and will be collocated with CPS-IoT Week 2025. All accepted papers this year will be published in the ACM SenSys proceedings. 
 SenSys 2025 invites groundbreaking research contributions on networked sensor systems, embedded systems, mobile computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless communications, signal processing, machine learning, cyber-physical systems, and AI-driven applications. This newly merged premier conference unifies the strengths of SenSys, IoTDI, and IPSN, bringing together researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and government to discuss innovative advances in sensing, artificial intelligence, and systems that enable future embedded computing environments. 
 Topics of Interest: 
 We invite submissions on a broad range of topics that have been covered by SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI, and new emerging topics of interest. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 8. Visions, Experiences, Tools, Datasets, and Benchmarks (Optional Short Paper Format)Visions, grand challenges, or new directions 
 Experiences, insights, challenges, and lessons learned from real-world deployments 
 Benchmarks for evaluating systems, models, algorithms, or tools 
 Tools, toolkits, or frameworks that advance research in embedded AI and sensing systems 
 Datasets that support research in embedded AI and sensing systems 
 Authors submitting papers in the 8th category (Visions, Experiences, Tools, Datasets, and Benchmarks) may choose to submit either as a full paper (12 pages) or a short paper (6 pages). Short papers will be evaluated based on the originality of their ideas, potential impact, and clarity of presentation, even without extensive evaluations. Similar to full papers, accepted short papers will be presented orally at the conference. 
 Submission Guidelines: 
 Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication. Submissions must be at most12 (full papers) or 6 (short papers) single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pageswith10-pt font size (override default font of 9-pt) in two-column format, including figures and tables.As for references, submissions may include as many pages as needed. All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles foundhere. LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (sigconf option), with the 10-pt font (override default font of 9-pt). Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Although submission is double-blind, existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the conference submission system. 
  
 Papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze nonpublic data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), should briefly describe how the research protocol addresses ethical considerations and whether their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects. Accepted submissions will be available on the ACM digital library and presented in person at the conference. 
 Camera-ready Manuscript Details: 
 Please note that ACM uses 9-pt fonts in all conference proceedings, and the style (both LaTeX and Word) implicitly define the font size to be 9-pt. Please refer to the publication chair's earlierNoteas well as theUser Guideof the new class. We hope that the authors will adhere, as much as possible, to the original 12 + reference pages limits as in the original submissions. We will try our best to make sure that the accepted papers are available on the ACM digital library on the first day of the conference.
