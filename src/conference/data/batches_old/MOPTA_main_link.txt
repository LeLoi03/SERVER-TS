 href="#" - AIMMS-MOPTA Competition Deadline
Extended toTuesday, April 1, 2025 

Modeling and Optimization: Theory and Applications (MOPTA)aims at bringing together a diverse group of people from both discrete and continuous optimization, working on both theoretical and applied aspects. There will be a small number of invited talks from distinguished speakers and contributed talks, spread over three days. Our target is to present a diverse set of exciting new developments from different optimization areas while at the same time providing a setting which will allow increased interaction among the participants. We aim to bring together researchers from both the theoretical and applied communities who do not usually have the chance to interact in the framework of a medium-scale event.
