 Welcome to the25th IEEE International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks (WoWMoM), the conference for researchers and practitioners interested in all aspects of wireless, mobile, and multimedia pervasive communications. 
  
 WoWMoM 2024 will be a four-day event with a technical programme including paper presentations, keynote speeches, hot-topic panel sessions, workshops, and a postgraduate forum. All papers (regular, workshops, demo, postgraduate forum) will be included and indexed in the IEEE Digital Library (IEEE Xplore), showing their affiliation with IEEE WoWMoM. 
  
 The conference technical programme focuses on wireless networking technologies and their key role in future Internet scenarios. The symposium addresses the increasing wealth of opportunities for distributing multimedia content over wireless networks, enabling the dissemination of professional content to mobile users and sharing user-generated content among them. Users will be able to retrieve, publish, and manage information, communicate with other users or devices, access, and author services, and create and exploit context awareness. Papers that present original work, validated by experimentation, simulation or analysis, are solicited. Practical experiences and experimental efforts from both industry and academia, duly documenting the lessons learned from testbeds, field trials, or real deployments, are also welcome.
