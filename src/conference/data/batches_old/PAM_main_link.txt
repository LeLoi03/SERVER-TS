 Passive and Active Measurement PAM 2025 
 ThePassive and Active Measurement (PAM)conference brings together researchers and operators to discuss novel and emerging work in the area of network measurement and analysis. 
 PAM is inclusive of all areas of network measurement, but focuses on systems-based research and real-world data. Indeed, measurement technology is needed at all layers of the network stack, ranging from power profiling of hardware components to virtualization in data centers, to application profiling, and even user experience. 
 Work with operational impact or relevance to the broader network research community is especially welcomed, as are early and promising measurement techniques and replications or reproductions of existing studies.

 Call for Papers 
 Original contributions that advance the state-of-the-art in the following areas are invited: 
 Applications (e.g., web, streaming, games) 
 Data centers and cloud computing 
 Energy 
 IoT (e.g., smart home, SCADA, ICS, embedded systems) 
 Measurement tools and software 
 Network security 
 User privacy 
 Overlays (e.g., P2P, CDNs) 
 Physical Layer 
 Routing 
 Social networks 
 Topology 
 Transport/congestion control 
 User behavior and experience, QoE 
 Virtualization (e.g., SDN, NFV) 
 Visualization 
 Wireless, cellular, and mobile 
 Replicability and reproducibility track (see below) 
 Although PAM traditionally attracts early stage contributions, works that are a reappraisal or independent validation of previous results, or which enhance the reproducibility of network measurement research, for instance by publishing new datasets on an existing topic, are explicitly included in PAM’s scope. PAM 2025 will be held virtually.

 Submission Guidelines 
 Authors should only submit original work that has not been published before and is not under 
 submission to any other venue. 
 PAM welcomes both short and long submissions. This includes early-stage contributions of work that is less mature but shows exciting promise, articulates a high-level vision, and describes challenging future directions for the community or validates, verifies important results, or presents new ideas that challenge existing assumptions. 
 Submissions should describe original research, with succinctness appropriate to the topics and themes they discuss. We will consider paper submissions that extend previously published short, or preliminary papers (including PAM short papers), following the model of the ACM SIGCOMM policy. 
 Replicability and Reproducibility Track 
 PAM 2025 will trial a new Replicability and Reproducibility Track for submissions that aim to reproduce or replicate results that have been previously published at PAM, TMA, IMC or the measurements track at SIGCOMM, CoNEXT, SIGMETRICS or other networking conferences. For the definitions of replicability and reproducibility, please seeACM’s site. 
 It is expected that a paper in this track explicitly explains the following: 
 Which paper the authors aim to replicate/reproduce. 
 Whether the paper will be replicated or reproduced. 
 What the PAM community stands to learn from the replication or reproduction. 
 Authors must clearly mark a replicability/reproducibility paper in HotCRP as such and must include a full citation of the work(s) the paper aims to replicate or reproduce. 
 Papers in this track should offer comparisons and analysis to the systems, settings, and data used in the work they replicate. 
 As described in similar replication tracks (e.g., USENIX SOUPS), replication papers: 
 Will be held to the same technical standards as other submissions, 
 Should use up to date methodologies and avoid using outdated techniques only because they appeared in previous studies, 
 May repeat procedures of existing studies, or explore their extensibility, 
 And should provide an explanation of the value of performing a replication study. 
 Submissions will be assessed by the PAM TPC and must conform to the same criteria and rules as full submissions on the main track. 
 Submission Requirements 
 All submissions must satisfy the following requirements 
 Follow | Springer LNCS | format 
 Short papers: Up to 11 pages for technical content (up to 5 pages for appendices and references) 
 Long papers: Up to 24 pages for technical content (up to 5 pages for appendices and references) 
 Note that reviewers are not required to read appendices. Everything needed to evaluate the paper should appear in the first 11 pages for short and 24 pages for long papers. 
 Anonymization: Reviewing will be double-blind 
 Do not include names or affiliations of authors in the submission. 
 Refer to your prior work in the third person. 
 Make a best effort to anonymize system names that would give you away. 
 If you have any concerns about how to anonymize your paper while maintaining its integrity, contact the PC chairs. 
 href="https://hotcrp.dacs.utwente.nl/pam2025/" - Submit via HotCRP
Ethical Considerations 
 Ethics will be considered during the review process. Each paper must include a statement detailing the ethical considerations of the work. If the authors believe the submission does not raise ethical concerns, authors must indicate so in a short statement that is clearly marked in the paper. The ethical considerations sections should either be included as a clearly marked appendix (entitled “Ethical considerations”) or a clearly marked section in the main body of the paper. 
 Papers describing experiments with users or sensitive user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information) must follow basic precepts of ethical research and subscribe to community norms. These include: respect for privacy, secure storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent if users are placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential, beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), and risk mitigation. 
 Authors may want to consult theMenlo Reportfor further information on ethical principles andhref="https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2007/papers/imc80.pdf" - the Allman/Paxson IMC 2007
paper for guidance on ethical data 
 sharing. 
 Note that submitting research for approval by each author’s institutional ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient – in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will consider the ethical soundness and justification of any paper, just as it does its technical soundness. Authors unsure about ethical issues are welcome to contact the program committee co-chairs. If work has been submitted to an IRB or ethics committee, the ethical considerations section or appendix should clearly indicate this and - if available - must include the reference number of the IRB/ethics committee approval. 
 Awards 
 There will be two awards for papers of exceptional merit. The Best Paper Award will recognize the paper that is deemed by the committee to have the highest merit of all the submissions. 
 The Community Contribution Award will be given to the best paper that makes relevant datasets, source code, or platforms available to the public by the time the camera-ready is submitted. 
 These artifacts must be sufficiently documented such that any researcher can use them to repeat the results or procedures described in the paper, and they must be placed in a sufficiently long-lived archival repository (e.g.,Github, Bitbucket, or CRAWDAD).
