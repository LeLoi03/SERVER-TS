 EvoApplications, the International Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation -formerly known as EvoWorkshops- brings together researchers in applications of Evolutionary Computation and other Nature-inspired techniques. 
 EvoApplications invites high quality contributions for its 28th edition, which will be held as part of the EvoStar 2025 event and co-located within EvoStar with three related conferences: EuroGP, EvoCOP and EvoMUSART. 
 The aim of EvoApplications is to create a friendly environment that can lead to the establishment or strengthening of scientific collaborations and exchanges among attendees. 
 Therefore, EvoApplications solicits high-quality original research papers (including significant work-in-progress) on any aspect of applications of Evolutionary Computation, both to real-world or methodological contexts in which Evolutionary Computation can contribute to pushing the limits of the state of the art beyond the present ones. 
 We encourage you to submit papers focused on interesting, relevant and original works that are related to all kinds of applications of Evolutionary Computation.

 The front matter of each GECCO proceeding 
 Note 
 This table provides statistics of two-page poster papers, not full papers. Unlike other conferences in the field of evolutionary computation (e.g., CEC, EMO, and Evo*), poster papers and full papers are published individually in GECCO. While full papers are published in the main volume, poster papers are published in the companion volume (dblp). 
 It is not obvious how to calculate the acceptance rates of GECCO poster papers. I calculated the acceptance rate for each year as follows: (x + y) / z, where x is the number of full paper acceptances, y is the number of poster paper acceptances, and z is the number of submissions. I believe that the acceptance rate obtained in this way is inexact, but a good approximation.

 Abstract 
 As robot swarms move to real-world deployment, safety will be a key factor in improving adoption and trust. Robot swarms are composed of many robots: during real-world operation each individual may be susceptible to failure resulting in potentially degraded performance of the swarm overall. A necessary component for safety is then the ability to detect and mitigate faults in the swarm. In this paper, we present a novel approach to learning dynamic fault mitigation via neuroevolution, where mitigation actions are implemented by both faulty and non-faulty robots in a collective transport scenario. In particular, there is no explicit fault detection step and the evolved "mitigation module" maps between a set of locally observed metrics as input and mitigation actions as output. Our approach is able to learn effective mitigation for six types of fault independently. We show that by allowing robots of any state to freely apply actions, "loosely-coordinated" mitigation emerges improving on the baseline where no mitigation is applied.
