 href="" - CURRENT CONFERENCECAADRIA 202626 APRIL – 02 MAY 2026Hsinchu City, Taiwan
The Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA) promotes teaching and research in CAAD in Asia, and has members on six continents. 
 It organizes an annual conference, the first of which was held in 1996 in Hong Kong. Since then, 20 conferences have been held in Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand. The conferences provide an opportunity for teachers, students, researchers, and practitioners to meet each other and learn about the latest research in the field. The proceedings of the conferences are available both online and in research libraries around the world. 
 CAADRIA was founded with the following objectives: 
 To facilitate the dissemination of information about CAAD among Asian schools of architecture, planning, engineering, and building sciences. 
 To encourage the exchange of staff, students, experience, courseware, and software among schools. 
 To identify research and develop needs in CAAD education and to initiate collaboration to satisfy them. 
 To promote research and teaching in CAAD that enhances creativity rather than production. 
 CAADRIA is one of the four founding organizations of the International Journal of Architectural Computing (IJAC), and supervises one issue each year. IJAC is published by Multi-Science in both paper and electronic versions.

 ARCHITECTURAL INFORMATICS 
 30th International Conference of the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia 
 href="https://caadria2025.org/" - https://caadria2025.org
The concepts of architecture and cities are historically intrinsic to human civilization, as a consciousness of mankind’s need to construct artificial environments. However, decades after the advent of computers, we are now reconsidering their existence against the backdrop of the rapid expansion and evolution of information technology and its profound impact on industry, the economy, daily life, and society. 
 The quantum acceleration of information processing and communication has had a profound impact on the design of all kinds of artifacts, production techniques, management systems, and usage patterns, and has already surpassed the traditional concept of design and its support methods. By considering social activities and human organizations as forms of information processing, we can reconsider architecture and cities as information systems that have been constructed, accumulated and acted upon. Viewing architecture and cities through this lens suggests that real and virtual spaces should not be seen as opposing entities, but rather as complementary components within a unified system. 
 In other words, information may be architecture. With “Architectural Informatics” as the theme of CAADRIA’s 30th anniversary, we would like to reexamine the fundamental existence of architecture in the age of information technology.
