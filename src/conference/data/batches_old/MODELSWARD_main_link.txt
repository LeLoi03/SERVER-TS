 The International Conference on Model-Based Software and Systems Engineering provides a platform for participants from all over the world to present research results and application experience in using model-based techniques for developing all sorts of systems. Model-based software engineering has emerged over many years as an approach for developing IT systems in which models take a central role, not only for the analysis of these systems but also for their construction. More recently, a similar approach has become increasingly widely used not only for software systems, but also for physical, cyber-physical and business systems. This model-based software and systems engineering approach relies on an increasingly rich ecosystem of techniques, languages and tools. MODELSWARD is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners alike to come together and discuss, moving this ecosystem forward.

 SCOPE 
 The International Conference on Model-Based Software and Systems Engineering provides a platform for participants from all over the world to present research results and application experience in using model-based techniques for developing all sorts of systems. Model-based software engineering has emerged over many years as an approach for developing IT systems in which models take a central role, not only for the analysis of these systems but also for their construction. More recently, a similar approach has become increasingly widely used not only for software systems, but also for physical, cyber-physical and business systems. This model-based software and systems engineering approach relies on an increasingly rich ecosystem of techniques, languages and tools. MODELSWARD is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners alike to come together and discuss, moving this ecosystem forward. 
  
 This conference aims at fostering the further development and application of model-based techniques for the construction and analysis of software and systems. Papers reporting on original work in any of the areas listed below are welcome. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors will be published in the MODELSWARD proceedings. The submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three experts in this area, and acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. The conference is open to full research and (short) work-in-progress papers. Sessions are planned for both oral and poster presentations.CONFERENCE AREAS 
 Each of these topic areas is expanded below but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas:1. METHODOLOGIES, PROCESSES AND PLATFORMS 
 2. APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT

 PAPER SUBMISSION 
 Authors can submit their work in the form of a complete paper or an abstract, but please note that accepted abstracts are presented but not published in the proceedings of the conference. Complete papers can be submitted as a Regular Paper, representing completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, portraying a short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue discussing ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research focused on one of the conference topic areas. 
  
 Authors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics. Each paper should clearly indicate the nature of its technical/scientific contribution, and the problems, domains or environments to which it is applicable. To facilitate the double-blind paper evaluation method, authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors, including the authors’ personal details, the acknowledgments section of the paper and any other reference that may disclose the authors’ identity. 
  
 When submitting a complete paper please note that only original papers should be submitted. Authors are advised to readINSTICC's ethical norms regarding plagiarism and self-plagiarismthoroughly before submitting and must make sure that their submissions do not substantially overlap work which has been published elsewhere or simultaneously submitted to a journal or another conference with proceedings. Papers that contain any form of plagiarism will be rejected without reviews. Authors should also avoid using an excessive number of self-citations. 
  
 All papers must be submitted through the online submission platformPRIMORISand should follow the instructions and templates that can be found underGuidelines and Templates. After the paper submission has been successfully completed, authors will receive an automatic confirmation e-mail. 
  
 PUBLICATIONS 
 All accepted complete papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and on digital support. 
 SCITEPRESS is a member of CrossRef (http://www.crossref.org/) and every paper on our digital library is given a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).
