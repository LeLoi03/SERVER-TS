Intelligence and security informatics (ISI) is an interdisciplinary field involving academic researchers in information technology, social and behavioral sciences, computer science, law, and public policy, as well as industry consultants, practitioners, security managers, and chief information security officers who support physical and cyber security missions at the individual, organizational, national, and international levels. Over the past two decades, the IEEE ISI Conference has evolved from its traditional orientation towards the intelligence and security domain to a more integrated alignment of multiple domains, including technology, humans, organizations, and security, aiming to advance our understanding of the interrelationships between these different components, and by integrating recent advances from different domains. 
 The ISI 2025 conference invites academic researchers in the field of ISI and related areas, as well as IT, security, and analytics professionals, and industry consultants and practitioners in the field, to submit papers and workshop proposals. Research relevant toartificial intelligence security,LLM security, and human behavior in security contexts is strongly encouraged.All accepted papers will be included in the proceedings at IEEE Xplore.

2024-07-17T11:23:46-04:00The IEEE Intelligent Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI), sponsored by the IEEE ITS Society, is the leading international scientific conference on interdisciplinary research on information technology for intelligence, safety, and security. Over the years, the conference has evolved from its traditional orientation of intelligence and security domain towards a more integrated alignment of multiple domains, including technology, humans, organization, and security. The scientific community has increasingly recognized the need to address intelligence and security threats by understanding the interrelationships between these different components, and by integrating recent advances from different domains. 
 All accepted papers will be included in the proceedings atIEEE Xplore.

 Submission Guidelines 
 All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. Each manuscript must clearly articulate their data (e.g., key metadata, statistical properties, etc.), analytical procedures (e.g., representations, algorithm details, etc.), and evaluation set up and results (e.g., performance metrics, statistical tests, case studies, etc.). Making data, code, and processes publicly available to facilitate scientific reproducibility is not required, but is strongly encouraged. 
 The expected length of the manuscript is 6 pages. A page charge needs to be paid if your final paper is over this page limit. A maximum of 2 additional pages is allowed, but at an extra cost per page. The submission format is PDF that follows IEEE publication format (see the template atIEEE – Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings).Papers should be submitted through the Papercept submission and review system (go to Papercepthttps://its.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pland find ISI 2025 in the 2025 conference list). To upload the final manuscript, at least one of the authors listed on the paper must register for the conference. 
 Each accepted paper must be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper must register the conference as an IEEE member before the early registration deadline. Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements.
