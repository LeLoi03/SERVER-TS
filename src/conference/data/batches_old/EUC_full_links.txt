 Introduction 
 Embedded and ubiquitous computing represent a paradigm designed to deliver continuous computing and communication services to end users universally and perpetually. These systems are currently permeating every aspect of our daily lives, poised to revolutionize our existence in a way much more profound than even the introduction of electric motors or personal computers. The inception of this technology stems from the intersection of research and technological advancements across a spectrum of disciplines, encompassing embedded systems, pervasive computing, communication technologies, wireless networks, mobile computing, distributed computing, and agent technologies. Embedded and pervasive computing have evolved into pivotal technologies shaping the trajectory of future research and development efforts in various academic and industrial sectors. 
  
 Among a series of highly successful International Conferences on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC), the EUC 2024 conference is the 22nd edition of a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to address the profound challenges that arise and to present and discuss their new ideas, research results, applications, and experiences on all aspects of embedded and ubiquitous computing. IEEE EUC 2024 is sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, and IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC). 
  
 The 2024 Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC 2024) will offer a prominent and cutting-edge platform for researchers, engineers, and practitioners to showcase state-of-the-art advancements and innovations in theoretical foundations, systems, infrastructure, tools, testbeds, and applications within the field of EUC. Additionally, the conference aims to identify emerging research topics and delineate the future trajectory of the discipline. 
  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to EUC 2024. Accepted papers will be submitted for possible inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.

 My research interests intersect the systems and data science domains, focusing on effective and efficient ways to collect and analyze sensor data at scale. At FIU, I lead theMOSAIC (MObile Sensing and AnalytICs) Lab, where we build, deploy, and investigate sensing and analysis challenges in areas such as healthcare, the Internet-of-Things, smart cities, wireless communications, and transportation. Some specific research questions being investigated in our lab include: how to efficiently and effectively utilize the rich sensing capabilities of commercial mobile and wearable devices, how to fuse different sensing modalities and perform multi-sensor time-series data analysis for a variety of applications, how to build context-aware sensing systems, how to perform sensor analysis on resource-constrained devices in real time and how to translate the insights obtained from the sensor data into new applications or interventions. In the healthcare domain, my recent work has focused on topics such as: development of digital biomarkers for neurodegenerative conditions, speech-based digital biomarkers, traumatic brain injuries, detection of autism using voice analysis, Quality of Life assessments of individuals with spinal injuries or recovering from stroke, mental health of students, first responders, and the elderly, assessment of motor disorders, assessment of the late effects of cancer treatment (such as cardiovascular, respiratory, and autonomous nervous system disorders), cancer treatment recommender systems, among others. 
  
 I am currently a professor in theKnight Foundation School of Computing and Information SciencesatFlorida International University. I also serve as the Interim Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies in the College of Engineering and Computing at FIU. Prior to joining FIU, I was a professor at theUniversity of Notre Dame, where I led the Mobile Computing Lab (M-Lab) and served as Associate Director of theLucy Family Institute for Data and Societyand Founding Director of thehref="https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/research/applied-analytics-emerging-technology/" - Applied
Analytics and Emerging Technologies Lab (AeTL)
. I have strong interest in economic, startup, and other commercialization efforts and I am also a strong advocate of early inclusion of undergraduate and high school students in research projects, many of whom have decided to pursue graduate school or form/join startup businesses.
