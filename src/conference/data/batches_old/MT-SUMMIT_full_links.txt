 *** Submission information *** 
 The European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT) invites proposals for tutorials & workshops to be held in conjunction with the MT Summit 2025 conference, taking place in Geneva, Switzerland. Workshops and tutorials will take place before the main conference, on 23 and 24 June 2025. 
 We seek proposals in all areas of machine translation, LLMs applied to translation, computer-assisted translation technologies, spoken language translation and related topics. 
 Please visit our official website for more information:href="https://mtsummit2025.unige.ch/" - https://mtsummit2025.unige.ch/
***Call for Workshop Proposals*** 
 Workshops will be held on June 23-24, 2025. We invite proposals for half-day or full-day workshops (up to 8 hours, including breaks). Workshops should provide an opportunity for MT-related communities to advance the state of thinking or practice in their area of interest. 
 MT Summit workshops are intended to provide the opportunity for MT­related communities of interest to spend focused time together advancing the state of thinking or the state of practice in their area of interest or endeavour. 
 Workshops may be scheduled as half-day or full-day events (up to 8 hours, including coffee and lunch breaks). Proponents need to explicitly state the duration of the workshop. 
 ***Call for Tutorial Proposals*** 
 The aim of a tutorial is primarily to help the audience to develop understanding of specific technical, applied, and business matters related to research, development, and use of MT and translation technology. 
 Presentations of specific technological solutions or systems are welcome, provided that they serve as illustrations of broader scientific considerations. 
 We recommend that the tutorial covers work by the presenters as well as by other researchers. The submission should explain that this breadth is ensured. Tutorials should not be “self-invited talks”. 
 Tutorials are generally scheduled as half-day events (up to 3.5 hours, including coffee break).
