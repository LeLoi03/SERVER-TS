 View PDFHTML (experimental)Abstract:This paper investigates various methods of representing 3D rotations and their impact on the learning process of deep neural networks. We evaluated the performance of ResNet18 networks for 3D rotation estimation using several rotation representations and loss functions on both synthetic and real data. The real datasets contained 3D scans of industrial bins, while the synthetic datasets included views of a simple asymmetric object rendered under different rotations. On synthetic data, we also assessed the effects of different rotation distributions within the training and test sets, as well as the impact of the object's texture. In line with previous research, we found that networks using the continuous 5D and 6D representations performed better than the discontinuous ones.

 Welcome to ICCGV 2025 
 Following the success of previous seven years' event in Tokyo(2018), Jeju Island(2019), online conferences from 2020-2022, Chengdu(2023), Hangzhou(2024) respectively, the Eighth International Conference on Computer Graphics and Virtuality(ICCGV 2025) will take place inChengdu, China,duringhref="tour.html" - February 21-23, 2025
. Conference consists of keynote lectures, oral presentation, poster presentation, online presentation on all aspects of computer graphics and virtuality. All professors, researchers and university students in related fields are cordially invited to participate in the conference. You're welcome to contribute a paper to ICCGV 2025. It's advised that you read thehref="sub.html" - Submission Guidelines
before submission. 
 继前七届会议分别在日本东京(2018)、韩国济州岛(2019)举办、以及由于疫情期间在线上开会(2020-2022), 2023年开始重新开启线下线上模式, 分别在成都(2023)、杭州(2024), 第八届计算机图形和虚拟国际会议(ICCGV2025)计划于2025年2月21-23日在四川成都举行。 会议诚挚邀请国内外学者提交计算机图形和虚拟等领域的论文, 请大家认真阅读投稿须知并踊跃投稿。 
 Publication 
 After a careful reviewing process, all accepted papers after proper registration and presentation will be published in the ICCGV 2025 Conference Proceedings by SPIE, which will be included in SPIE Digital Library and indexed byEi Compendex, Scopus, and CPCI (Web of Science).
