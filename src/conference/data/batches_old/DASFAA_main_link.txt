 Paper Submission 
 Paper submission must be in English. All papers will be double-blind reviewed by the Program Committee based on technical quality, relevance to DASFAA, originality, significance, and clarity. All paper submissions will be handled electronically. Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be rejected without review. Each submitted paper should include an abstract up to 200 words and be no longer than 16 pages (including references, appendices, etc.) in LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) format. We encourage authors to cite related work comprehensively. When citing conference papers, please also consider citing their extended journal versions if applicable. All papers must be submitted electronically through the paper submission system in PDF only. 
 The submitted papers must not be previously published in a refereed journal or conference and must not be under consideration by any other conference or journal during the DASFAA review process. If the paper is accepted, at least one author must complete the regular registration and attend the conference to present the paper. For no-show authors, their papers will not be included in the proceedings. Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings. 
 Double-Blind Review 
 DASFAA-2025 will employ a double-blind reviewing process, i.e., the PC members and referees who review the paper will not know the identity of the authors. To ensure the anonymity of authorship, authors must prepare their manuscript as follows: 
 Author’s names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper 
 Funding sources must not be acknowledged on the title page or elsewhere in the paper 
 Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper 
 Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the author’s names in the paper’s associated metadata. For example, if your name is Jane Smith and you submit a PDF file generated from a .dvi file called Jane-Smith.dvi, your authorship could be inferred by looking into the PDF file. Submissions must have all details identifying the author(s) removed from the original manuscript (including the supplementary files, if any), and the author(s) should refer to their prior work in the third person and include all relevant citations 
 Submissions having unrefereed pre-prints such as arXiv are allowed. Authors should make every effort to anonymize their work and, hence, cannot cite their own arXiv work. 
 Reviewers will be requested to not try and break the anonymity. Papers that do not follow the guidelines mentioned above, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection. Because of the double-blind review policy, the submission of an extended version of a short paper that has been published elsewhere is strongly discouraged in DASFAA-2025. 
 Conflicts of Interest 
 We use CMT’s conflict management system, through which authors should flag conflicts with members of the Program Committee. X and Y have a conflict of interest if any of the following applies: 
 X and Y have worked in the same university or company in the past two years, or will be doing so in the next six months on account of an accepted job offer. Different campuses within the same university system do not count as the same university for this purpose - UC Berkeley does not have a conflict with UC Santa Barbara. 
 X has been a co-author of a paper with Y in the last three years. 
 X has been a collaborator within the past two years, as evidenced in a joint publication (subsumed by the stricter rule on co-authorship above), joint research project, or co-organizing events (e.g., co-chairs of conferences), or are collaborating now (including co-authorship on papers not resulted in final publication yet). 
 X is the master’s/PhD thesis advisor of Y or vice versa, irrespective of how long ago this was. 
 X is a relative or close personal friend of Y. 
 It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify and declare all COIs with members of the Program Committee (reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs) prior to the submission deadline. Submissions with undeclared conflicts or spurious conflicts will be desk-rejected. 
 Paper Acceptance 
 A paper can be accepted as either a full research paper or a short research paper. The authors of full research papers are given the opportunity to present their work in oral sessions, and they also have the option to present in poster sessions. On the other hand, the authors of short research papers exclusively present their work in poster sessions. Additionally, the accepted short research papers should be revised to a maximum of 10 pages in the camera-ready version.
