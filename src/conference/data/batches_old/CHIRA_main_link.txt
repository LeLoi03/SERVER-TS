 SCOPE 
 The purpose of the International Conference on Computer-Human Interaction Research and Applications (CHIRA) is to bring together professionals, academics and students who are interested in the advancement of research and practical applications of interaction design & human-computer interaction. Four parallel tracks will be held, covering different aspects of Computer-Human Interaction, including Human Factors and Information Systems, Interactive Devices, Interaction Design and Adaptive and Intelligent Systems. 
 Papers describing original work on advanced methods, prototypes, systems, tools and techniques as well as general survey papers indicating future directions are encouraged. Accepted papers will be presented at the conference by one of the authors and published in the Proceedings of CHIRA, which will be placed on at least one Digital Library and sent for indexation by the major international indexes.
