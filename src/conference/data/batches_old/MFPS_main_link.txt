 About 
 41st Conference on Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics MFPS XLI (MFPS 2025) 
 href="https://mfpsconf.org" - MFPS conferences
are dedicated to the areas of mathematics, logic, and computer science that are related to models of computation in general, and to semantics of programming languages in particular. This is a forum where researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and exchange ideas. The participation of researchers in neighbouring areas is strongly encouraged. 
 Topics include, but are not limited to, the following: bio-computation; concurrent qualitative and quantitative distributed systems; process calculi; probabilistic systems; constructive mathematics; domain theory and categorical models; formal languages; formal methods; game semantics; lambda calculus; programming-language theory; quantum computation; security; topological models; logic; type systems; type theory. 
 Participation in the meeting is expected to be in person; one author of every accepted paper has to attend the meeting and give the presentation. Exceptions might be in case there are unexpected problems with travel/visa.

 We are delighted to announce the 41st Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics (MFPS 2025). It will take place at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland. 
 MFPS conferences are dedicated to the areas of mathematics, logic, and computer science that are related to models of computation in general, and to semantics of programming languages in particular. This is a forum where researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and exchange ideas. The participation of researchers in neighbouring areas is strongly encouraged. 
 Topics include, but are not limited to, the following: bio-computation; concurrent qualitative and quantitative distributed systems; process calculi; probabilistic systems; constructive mathematics; domain theory and categorical models; formal languages; formal methods; game semantics; lambda calculus; programming language theory; quantum computation; security; topological models; logic; type systems; type theory; denotational and operational semantics; rewrite theory; proof theory. We also welcome contributions that address applications of semantics to novel areas. 
 Participation in the meeting is expected to be in person; one author of every accepted paper has to attend the meeting and give the presentation. Exceptions might be in case there are unexpected problems with travel/visa.

 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS 
 Submissions are made through EasyChair (https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mfps2025) Papers can be at most15 pageslong, excluding bibliography, and should be prepared using the MFPS macros (https://mfpsconf.org/submissions-to-mfps/). 
 Proofs omitted due to space limitations may be included in a clearly marked appendix, to be consulted at the discretion of program committee members. 
 PROCEEDINGS 
 A preliminary version will be distributed at the meeting. Final proceedings will be published in Electronic Notes in Theoretical Informatics and Computer Science (ENTICS). This new open-access series is hosted by Episciences.org as an overlay for papers published by the CORR arXiv or HAL.
