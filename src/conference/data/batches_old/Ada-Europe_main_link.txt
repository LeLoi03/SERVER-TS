 General Information 
 The29th Ada-Europe International Conference on Reliable Software Technologies (AEiC 2025), will take place in Paris, France 
 The conference is a leading international forum for providers, practitioners, and researchers in reliable software technologies. The conference presentations will illustrate current work in the theory and practice of the design, development, and maintenance of long-lived, high-quality software systems for a challenging variety of application domains. 
 The topics of interest for the conference include but are not limited to: 
 Formal and model-based engineering of critical systems 
 High-Integrity Systems and Reliability 
 AI for High-Integrity Systems Engineering 
 Real-Time Systems 
 Ada Language 
 Applications in relevant domains 
 Please seehref="https://www.ada-europe.org/conference2025/index.html#A2" - Scope and Topics
for the a non-exclusive list of relevant topics to the conference. 
 The conference schedule comprises a journal track, an industrial track a work-in-progress track, a vendor exhibition, parallel tutorials, and satellite workshops. 
 Journal track papers | present research advances supported by solid theoretical foundation and thorough evaluation. 
 Industrial track contributions | highlight industrial open challenges and/or the practitioners' side of a relevant case study or industrial project. 
 Work-in-progress track papers | illustrate novel research ideas that are still at an initial stage, between conception and first prototype. 
 Tutorials | guide attenders through a hands-on familiarization with innovative developments or with useful features related to reliable software. 
 Workshops | provide discussion forums on themes related to the conference topics. 
 Vendor presentations and exhibitions | allow for companies to showcase their latest products and services. 
 Call for Journal Track Submissions 
 Following ajournal-first model, this edition of the conference again includes a "Journal Track" which seeks original and high-quality papers that describe mature research work on the conference topics. Accepted journal track papers will be published in thehref="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-systems-architecture/about/call-for-papers#reliable-software-technologies-aeic2025" - Reliable Software Technologies (AEiC2025) Special Issue of JSA
-- the Journal of Systems Architecture (Q1 ranked, CiteScore 8.7, impact factor 3.8). Accordingly, the conference is listed as “Journal Published” in the latest update of the CORE Conference Ranking released in August 2023. 
 Although JSA does not enforce any page limitation for its articles, AEiC recommends conference-style submissions around 14 pages long and discourages submissions beyond 20 pages. An effort to synthesize and keep only necessary contents is asked for. 
 Please note that the Ada-Europe organization will waive the Open Access fees for the first four accepted papers which do not already enjoy OA from other agreements with the Publisher.Subsequent papers will follow JSA regular publishing track.

 Practical hands-on sharing of knowledge gained in the practice of building reliable software. 
 Usage of Reliable Software Technologies in general. 
 Call for Work‐in‐Progress Track Submissions 
 The Work‐in‐Progress track seeks two kinds of submissions: (a)ongoing researchand (b)early‐stage ideas.Ongoing research submissionsare 4‐page papers describing research results that are not mature enough to be submitted to the journal track.Early‐stage ideasare 1‐page papers that pitch new research directions that fall within the scope of the conference. 
 The WIP track is expected to address emerging areas where reliability is a first-class requirement. WIP submissions may cover new application domains new technologies, and new methods related to reliable software, such as autonomous systems, IoT, Industries 4.0, AI for critical systems Cloud/Edge, security, energy management, etc. 
 Both kinds of submissions must be original and shall undergo anonymous peer review. Submissions by recent MSc graduates and PhD students are especially sought. 
 Contributions must be submitted by7 March 2025 (extended). Interested authors shall submit their work viahref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aeic2025" - Easy Chair
