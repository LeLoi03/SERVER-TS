 22nd Smart Card Research and Advanced Application ConferenceScope 
 CARDIS has been the venue for security experts from industry and academia to exchange on security of smart cards and related applications since 1994. Smart cards play an increasingly important role in our day-to-day live through their use in banking cards, SIM cards, electronic passports, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. It is thus naturally of utmost importance to understand their security features and to develop sound protocols and countermeasures while keeping reasonable performances. In this respect, CARDIS aims to gather security experts from industry, academia, and standardization bodies to make steps forward in the field of embedded security.

 CARDIS has been the venue for security experts from industry and academia to exchange on 
 security of smart cards and related applications since 1994. Smart cards play an increasingly 
 important role in our day-to-day life through their use in banking cards, SIM cards, electronic 
 passports, and IoT devices. It is thus naturally of utmost importance to understand their security 
 features and to develop sound protocols and countermeasures while keeping reasonable 
 performance. In this respect, CARDIS aims to gather security experts from industry, academia, and 
 standardization bodies to make steps forward in the field of embedded security. 
 The 21st edition of CARDIS is organized by the Centre for Cyber Security and Privacy of the 
 University of Birmingham, UK. CARDIS 2022 will be accompanied by a one-day Fall School event, 
 with more details to be announced.
