 Present CFP : 2019 
 The International Frontiers of Algorithmics Workshop (FAW) provides a focused forum on current trends of research on algorithms, discrete structures, operation research, combinatorial optimization and their applications, and will bring together international experts at the research frontiers in these areas to exchange ideas and to present significant new results. 
  
 Interesting new results in all areas of algorithmics, operation research and combinatorial optimization and their applications are welcome. In addition to theoretical work, we are also interested in results that report on experimental and applied research of general algorithmic interest. Special considerations will be given to algorithmic research that is motivated by real-world applications. FAW 2019 will be hosted at the Tsinghua Sanya International Mathematics Forum (TSIMF) from April 29 to May 3, 2019.
