 The International Conference on Web Engineering (ICWE) is the premier annual conference on Web Engineering and associated technologies. It covers different aspects of Web Engineering, including the design, creation, maintenance, operation, and usage of Web applications. 
 ICWE aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from various disciplines in academia and industry to tackle the emerging challenges in the engineering of Web applications, the problems and opportunities of its associated technologies, and the impact of those technologies on society and culture. 
 Following the general debate on the need for human-centric and responsible technology, the 24th edition of ICWE in particular invites contributions under the following general theme: 
 Ethical and Human-Centric Web Engineering: Balancing Innovation and Responsibility in Web Technology 
 We indeed solicit contributions on diverse aspects related to designing innovative Web technology that however results in being fair, ethical, transparent, privacy-preserving, trustworthy, and inclusive for all. Contributions on any other topic related to Web Engineering are also welcome. 
 Accepted contributions will be included in the ICWE 2024 Springer LNCS proceedings. The best papers will be selected to be proposed, in extended form, as part of a special issue of the Journal of Web Engineering. 
 The online version of the conference proceedings is availablehere.
