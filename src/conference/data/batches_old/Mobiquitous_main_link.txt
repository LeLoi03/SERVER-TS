 EAI MobiQuitous 2025 
 7 – 9 November, 2025 
 Shanghai, China 
 Despite nearly two decades of extensive research in the field of Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing, and the significant maturity of some foundational technologies, many challenges still remain especially when humans interact with the new generation of computing in multiple devices, e.g., lack of security considerations, and improper human-machine interface. The goal of the twenty-second annual EAI International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Systems: Computing, Networking and Services (EAI MobiQuitous 2025) is to provide a forum for presenting and discussing high-quality research in such field, involving international practitioners and researchers from diverse backgrounds. EAI MobiQuitous 2025 will thus foster research collaboration through focused discussions, interaction, case studies, and exchange of experiences that will designate future research efforts and directions for Mobile and Ubiquitous Computing. Areas addressed by the conference include systems, applications, social networks, middleware, networking, sensing, data management, data processing and services, all with special focus on mobile and ubiquitous computing.
