PacificVis 2025 
 IEEE Pacific Visualization Conference (PacificVis) was born in Kyoto in 2008 as an international event sponsored by IEEE Computer Society with the aim of promoting visualization research and technologies, especially in the Asian-Pacific region. Since then, we had a series of annual events in Beijing (2009), Taipei (2010), Hong Kong (2011), Songdo (2012), Sydney (2013), Yokohama (2014), Hangzhou (2015), Taipei (2016), Seoul (2017), Kobe (2018), Bangkok (2019), Tianjin (2020 and 2021, online), Tsukuba (2022, online), Seoul (2023), and Tokyo (2024). The 18th edition of PacificVis will take place at Chang Yung-fa Foundation International Convention Center in Taipei, Taiwan, and will be hosted by National Taiwan Normal University and Taipei ACM SIGGRAPH over April 22-25, 2025. 
 We hope that all participants will enjoy PacificVis 2025!

 Welcome to IEEE PacificVis 2024!href="#welcome-to-ieee-pacificvis-2024" - Permalink
IEEE Pacific Visualization Symposium (PacificVis) was born in Kyoto in 2008 as an international event sponsored by IEEE Computer Society with the aim of promoting visualization research and technologies, especially in the Asian-Pacific region. Since then, we had a series of annual events in Beijing (2009), Taipei (2010), Hong Kong (2011), Songdo (2012), Sydney (2013), Yokohama (2014), Hangzhou (2015), Taipei (2016), Seoul (2017), Kobe (2018), Bangkok (2019), Tianjin (2020 and 2021, online), Tsukuba (2022, online), and Seoul (2023). The 17th event is scheduled to take place inMita Campus,Keio University, Tokyo over April 23-26, 2024 with the co-sponsorship bythe Faculty of Science and Technology,Keio University. 
 We are pleased to announce three significant changes we made this year. First of all, in recognition of the growth of PacificVis to date by the IEEE Computer Society and Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee, PacificVis was upgraded from a symposium to a conference. Second, the full-paper track of PacificVis was expanded into two independent subtracks: the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) track and the conference track, unlike in the past when we published only a few best papers selected from the conference track in a special section of the TVCG. Third and last, all the accepted papers fromthe Vis-Meets-AI Workshop, which was held in conjunction with PacificVis so far since 2020, are now also included in the conference proceedings together with all accepted short papers in the track of Visualization Notes. 
 href="https://pacificvis.github.io/pvis2024/program/papers/" - The conference program
also includes two keynote speeches byProf. Huamin QuandProf. Bongshin Lee, as well as all the acceptedPosters and Visual Data Storytelling Contest worksas in the previous year. In the morning of the first day, the 7th Japan-Korea-China Joint Visualization Workshop will be held as a collocated event. This workshop is free of charge for all registered participants of PacificVis 2024 and everyone is welcome to attend. 
 We hope that all participants will enjoy PacificVis 2024!

 Common Call for Papers 
 IEEE PacificVis 2024 solicits novel research contributions and innovative applications in all areas of visualization. PacificVis is a unified visualization symposium covering topics such as information visualization, scientific visualization, visual analytics, and visualization applications in domains such as (but not limited to) biological sciences, education, machine learning, physical sciences, security, and social science. 
 IEEE PacificVis 2024 will be held in Tokyo, Japan on April 23-26, 2024. The symposium accepts a range of scientific contributions ranging from full research papers, short papers, and posters. This year, PacificVis has a TVCG journal paper track, a conference full paper track, and a short paper (VisNotes) track with consecutive deadlines. These tracks have separate calls for papers: 
 Call for papers - | href="/pvis2024/cfp/journal/" - TVCG journal papers 
 Call for papers - | href="/pvis2024/cfp/conf/" - Conference papers 
 Call for papers - | href="/pvis2024/cfp/note/" - Short papers (VisNotes) 
 Call for papers - | href="/pvis2024/cfp/poster/" - Posters 
 The deadlines for the tracks are arranged so that papers rejected from an earlier track can be resubmitted to a following track (with optional reviewer continuity). All submitted papers except short papers (VisNotes) will go through a two-stage review process to guarantee the publication of high-quality papers. Accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference and will also be published by IEEE and included in theIEEE Digital Library. Papers accepted in the journal track will be published directly inIEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG).

 Reviewing Process and Review CriteriaPermalink 
 IEEE PacificVis papers undergo a rigorous review process over multiple rounds of reviewing (VisNotes have a slightly shorter review process). Some papers may be desk rejected—rejected before they enter this detailed peer reviewing—by the papers chairs if they determine that the submission is clearly out of scope for the conference, is written using poor language that precludes effective communication, does not follow the formatting guidelines, or is otherwise not appropriate. 
 Decisions after the first round of reviews are usually conditional acceptances or rejections. All conditionally accepted papers come with written requirements for final acceptance. Effectively addressing these requirements in a second round version of the paper is essential and the responsibility of the authors. Reviewers may sometimes communicate directly with authors to address minor points in the revised paper, effectively allowing for additional reviewing rounds. However, such additional communication is at the discretion of reviewers and not a requirement. If the revised version of a paper fails to address feedback to the satisfaction of the reviewers, the paper will ultimately be rejected after the second reviewing round.
