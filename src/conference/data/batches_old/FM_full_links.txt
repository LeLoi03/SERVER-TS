FME’sTeaching Committeehas recently organised a special issue ofFormal Aspects of Computingthat puts forward different perspectives on why and how Formal Methods should be represented in Computer Science curricula. The discussion was triggered by the guidelines that ACM has been publishing for computer technology university curriculafor more than five decades. 
 A summar article of the discussed perspectives appeared in the December 2024 issue of ACM Inroads:href="https://inroads.acm.org/article.cfm?aid=3702231" - The Role of Formal Methods in

Cliff B. Jones:Understanding Programming Languages 
 Springer, November 2020, 229 pp, ISBN: 978-3-030-59256-1.https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59257-8 
 Summary 
 The bookUnderstanding Programming Languagesby Cliff B. Jones is about the formal specification of the semantics of programming languages. It focuses on the structural operational semantics of imperative and sequential languages, including features such as blocks and procedures, with an extension to concurrent objects at the end of the book. The material is presented with great clarity and requires almost no background knowledge, making the book perfectly suitable for any person curious about programming languages and seeking a deeper understanding of how they work. This book is also for language designers, as being formally precise is an invaluable tool to help catch design issues early in the design phase.

 The 27th International Symposium on Formal Methods (FM 2026) 
 href="#fm-2026-will-be-held-in-tokyo-from-may-18-to-22-2026" - FM 2026 will be held in Tokyo from May 18 to 22, 2026.
FM 2026 is the 27th international symposium on Formal Methods in a series organized by Formal Methods Europe (FME), an independent association whose aim is to stimulate the use of, and research on, formal methods for software development. The FM symposia have been successful in bringing together researchers and industrial users around a program of original papers on research and industrial experience, workshops, tutorials, reports on tools, projects, and ongoing doctoral research. FM 2026 will be both an occasion to celebrate and a platform for enthusiastic researchers and practitioners from a diversity of backgrounds to exchange their ideas and share their experiences. 
 The following conferences will be co-located with it or included as tracks. 
 ABZ: Rigorous State Based Methods 
 TAP: Tests and Proofs

 href="https://www.fmeurope.org/symposia/" - FM: The Formal Methods Symposia
The Formal Methods Symposia 
 FME organizes a symposium roughly every 18 months. Each symposium attracts between 125 and 500 attendees, interested in both theoretical aspects of formal methods as well as the practical application of formal methods, from all over the world. 
 Partnership with Journals 
 FME has established partnerships with several prestigious formal methods journals. Through these partnerships, the FM symposia will include presentations of papers published in the journals in the program of the FM symposia. These presentations compose aJournal-First Track. A dedicated Track Chair, with the help of a small committee, selects papers from the partnership journals and invite authors to present their work at FM. In this way, FME aims to strenghten the social side of our science, as lively discussion are central to scientific progress. 
 The partner journals that support the Journal-first track are: 
 Formal Aspects of Computing | (ACM) 
 Formal Methods in System Design | (Springer) 
 Science of Computer programming | (Elsevier) 
 Proceedings 
 Proceedings of the FME symposia are published by Springer Verlag as part of theLNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science)series. DBLP maintains anhref="http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/conf/fm/index.html" - index of all FME symposia
. 
 FME Subgroup 
 FME has a subgroup dealing with daily matters concerning the symposia and thinking about strategic issues in the longer run.
