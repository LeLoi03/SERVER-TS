 Introduction 
 The 20th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2025) combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty and vagueness, high-dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both, our knowledge and row data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way. 
 HAIS Series of Conferences provides an interesting opportunity to present and discuss the latest theoretical advances and real-world applications in this multidisciplinary research field.

 HHAI 2025: The 4th International Conference Series on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence 
 June 9-13, 2025 (Pisa, Italy) 
 Hybrid Human Artificial Intelligence (HHAI) 2025 
 Welcome to HHAI2025 
 The pre-conference program (Mon+Tue) will take place at University of Pisa (Sapienza) and Scuola Normale Superiore, and the main conference (Wed-Fri) atCNR(Auditorium). 
 More information in theHHAI2025 Program pagewill be published soon 
 Image byChristoph SchrattbauerfromPixabayHybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence (HHAI) is an international conference series dedicated to exploring AI systems that work collaboratively, proactively, and purposefully alongside humans, enhancing rather than replacing human intelligence. The goal of HHAI is to develop AI systems that complement human abilities, highlighting the importance of adaptive, collaborative, responsible, interactive, and human-centered intelligence. These systems leverage human strengths and compensate for weaknesses, while also considering social, ethical, and legal implications. 
 The fourth HHAI conference will take place from June 9–13, 2025, in Pisa, Italy. 
 Though the HHAI field is propelled by advances in AI, it requires fundamentally innovative approaches and solutions. We encourage collaboration across various research areas such as AI, HCI, cognitive and social sciences, philosophy, ethics, and complex systems. For this fourth international conference, we invite researchers from these fields to submit their best original or ongoing work, as well as forward-looking ideas, on Hybrid Human-Artificial Intelligence.
