Abstracts – Talks and Posters 
 We invite abstracts for research that is topical to bioinformatics and computational biology, which is in progress (unpublished, formerly Late-Breaking Research) or previously published within the last 18 months (previously Highlights Track) for consideration for oral and/or poster presentation. 
 Your abstract should be submitted to the Communities of Special Interest (COSI) or Open Session Trackthat most accuratelyreflectsthe area of the work. (You will have the option to identify two other tracks that may also be suited to your research area during your submission). You can learn more about COSIshere. 
 Talks and posters are organized according to scientific topics which are covered by the COSIs and open sessions listed and described below. Please note, abstracts are not limited to COSI and open session topics and if the topic of your submission falls outside the listed COSIs you can choose the "General Computational Biology" area. Your abstract should convey a scientific result and should not be an advertisement for any commercial software package. 
 Multiple presentations:Thesame talk is not permitted to be given more than onceas an oral presentation at ISMB. Researchmay be presented as both a talk and a poster if and only if it is submitted as two individual submissions with TWO different presenters. Having the same person deliver two (or more)different talksisNOT PERMITTEDon the same topic. This allows for many people from one lab to present the work of the lab. A presenting authormay present NO MORE THAN ONE talk or posteron the same topic. 
 For a variety of reasons, ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue. We understand that some presenters will have valid reasons to avoid in-person attendance. ISCB will grant remote presentation options for reasons associated with maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 15, 2024.Ifunableto participate in person you will need to request a waiver by writingpresentationwaiver@iscb.org 
 Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference as a precaution due to possible technical issues.

 FAQ 
 Q: Can I submit more than one abstract? 
 A: Yes, but the same person maynotdeliver more than one talk on the same topic. We encourage labs to involve multiple presenters. Thesame talk is not permitted to be given more than onceas an oral presentation at ISMB. Researchmay be presented as both a talk and a poster if and only if it is submitted as two individual submissions with TWO different presenters. Having the same person deliver two (or more)different talksisNOT PERMITTEDon the same topic. This allows for many people from one lab to present the work of the lab. A presenting authormay present NO MORE THAN ONE talk or posteron the same topic. 
 Q: Should I submit a PDF of my poster when completing my submission? 
 A: No, please only submit the poster abstract. Closer to the conference all accepted poster presenters will upload a Poster PDF and short 5-7 minute MP4 talk to the virtual conference platform. 
 Q: Can previously accepted work be considered for a poster? 
 A: Yes, we do ask that you note the year the work was published and provide the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) during the submission process.

 Why aren't extensions allowed? 
 Every file that's uploaded needs to be processed, that's a video from every virtual talk, a video and/or PDF from every in-person poster, and a video and a PDF from every virtual poster. This takes a substantial amount of time on top of travelling to the venue (often internationally), setting up the venue, coordinating volunteers, opening the virtual platform, troubleshooting attendees who try to access said platform, printing delegate name tags, preparing opening slides, organizing awards, identifying dietary requirements, running pre-conference tutorials, processing recordings from completed tutorials, answering questions from delegates who are arriving at the venue, organizing all other ongoing ISCB conferences and affiliated events, and continuing day-to-day upkeep for the Society. These deadlines don't exist in a vacuum which is why they're broadcast as early and often as they are.
