 Conference Overview 
 CIFEr 2024 will take place at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ. Stevens is named for the distinguished family known as "America's First Family of Inventors." Founded in 1870, it is one of the oldest technological universities in the United States and was the first college in America solely dedicated to mechanical engineering. The 55-acre campus encompasses Castle Point, the highest point in Hoboken, a campus green and 43 academic, student and administrative buildings. 
 Since 1995, the IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering and Economics (CIFEr) has been a leading forum for research and applications of Computational Intelligence in Business, Finance and Economics. The financial services industry is presently undergoing considerable change due to the development of new technologically focused products and services. The understanding of these innovations requires multidisciplinary approaches from the perspective of industry, societal and government policies. The upcoming CIFEr 2024 will be co-hosted by the Center for Research toward Advancing Financial Technologies (CRAFT) funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation in the New York Metropolitan area. 
 The event brings together a global community of researchers and practitioners with a particular emphasis on fostering cross disciplinary collaboration. Technical exchanges will encompass keynote talks, research presentations and tutorials. Networking will be facilitated by social functions and activities at the venue.

Scope 
 Principles of finance combined with advanced mathematical structures form financial models, strategies and products that are tested and implemented with the use of advanced quantitative techniques. The use of computing technology through advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning, is pervasive throughout this process and combined with high performance computers has enabled Computational Finance (CF) to grow steadily in the last decade. CF has influenced the marketplace extensively with enormous impact on wealth building, employment opportunities, and tremendous economic growth. This field forms an ever-expanding part of the financial sector, in many ways today.The symposium on CI for Financial Engineering and Economics, has provided a forum for advanced research since 1995, bringing together researchers who design and develop intelligent algorithms for various problems in finance. It is essential to continue bringing researchers to exchange their ideas, models, and results, providing fundamental threads to discussions and arguments. 
 Some of the major issues facing academics and practitioner alike include creating financial models (for pricing derivatives, or risk management strategies etc.), formulating them as computational problems and applying advanced computing technologies. 
 The symposium will focus on fundamentals of finance, introduce the computational issues therein and report latest findings and understanding of financial modeling using computational intelligence techniques that would benefit academic and practitioners alike. 
 Topicsof interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Finance Modeling and Analysis 
 Financial data analytics 
 Intelligent trading agents 
 Trading room simulation 
 Time series analysis 
 Probabilistic modeling/inference 
 Non-linear dynamics
