 Areas of Interest 
 We welcome the submission of technical papers describing significant and original research on all aspects of the theory and practice of autonomous agents and multiagent systems. If you are new to this community, then we encourage you to consult the proceedings of previous editions of the conference to fully appreciate the scope of AAMAS. At the time of submission, you will be asked to associate your paper with one of the following areas of interest: 
 Learning and Adaptation (LEARN) 
 Game Theory and Economic Paradigms (GTEP) 
 Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms, and Ethics (COINE) 
 Search, Optimization, Planning, and Scheduling (SOPS) 
 Representation, Perception, and Reasoning (RPR) 
 Engineering and Analysis of Multiagent Systems (EMAS) 
 Modeling and Simulation of Societies (SIM) 
 Human-Agent Interaction (HAI) 
 Robotics and Control (ROBOT) 
 Innovative Applications (IA) 
 Additionally, AAMAS 2025 includes severalspecial tracks. You can find more information about these trackshref="#special-tracks" - here
. 
 Learning and Adaptation (LEARN) 
 Area Chairs: Long Tran-Thanh, Bo An, Marc Lanctot, Chongjie Zhang, Jianye Hao, Haifeng Xu, Jakob Foerster 
 Topics: 
 Reasoning and learning under uncertainty 
 Supervised learning 
 Unsupervised and representation learning 
 Reinforcement learning 
 Multiagent learning 
 Evolutionary algorithms 
 Learning agent capabilities 
 Learning agent-to-agent interactions 
 Human-in-the-loop learning 
 Agency and learning in large language models (LLMs) 
 Learning for value alignment and RLHF 
 Modeling and analysis of Generative AI agents 
 Few-shot learning 
 Distributionally-robust learning 
 Adversarial learning 
 Description: Autonomous Agents must sense, deliberate, act and communicate in potentially complex and uncertain environments. In addition, in many cases, they must interact with other agents and/or humans. Anticipating each situation and hardcoding the appropriate agent behavior becomes impossible as the complexity of the environment and interactions increase. As such, adaptivity and learning are key properties that imbue autonomy to agents operating and communicating in the real world. Papers in this area focus on all aspects of single agent and multiagent planning, learning and communication. 
 Game Theory and Economic Paradigms (GTEP) 
 Area Chairs: Reshef Meir, Nisarg Shah, Georgios Piliouras, Vasilis Gkatzelis, Rica Gonen 
 Topics: 
 Auctions and Mechanism Design 
 Bargaining and Negotiation 
 Behavioral Game Theory 
 Evolutionary Game Theory 
 Non-Cooperative Games: Equilibrium Concepts 
 Non-Cooperative Games: Computational Issues 
 Non-Cooperative Games: Theory and Applications 
 Voting and Preference Aggregation 
 Social Choice 
 Preference Aggregation and Value Alignment 
 Matching and Allocation 
 Coalition Formation 
 Cooperative Games 
 Description: This area encompasses research on cooperative and non-cooperative games, social choice, and mechanism design, specifically focusing on computational aspects such as algorithmic and complexity analysis for equilibrium computation and verification. The area also welcomes theoretical explorations and analysis related to game theory, mechanism and market design, and social choice. Submissions showcasing practical applications of game theory are also strongly encouraged. 
 Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms, and Ethics (COINE) 
 Area Chairs: Felipe Meneguzzi, Pradeep Murukannaiah 
 Topics: 
 Coordination and teamwork 
 Social network analysis 
 Norms, normative systems 
 Organizations and institutions 
 Non-strategic coalition/team formation 
 Communication, including using natural language 
 Policy, regulation, and accountability 
 Trust and reputation 
 Ethical considerations, including privacy, safety, security, transparency 
 Agreement Technologies: Negotiation and Argumentations 
 Responsible socio-technical systems 
 Description: Research in agent and multiagent systems has a long history of developing techniques that balance agent autonomy, adaptation, and distributed social reasoning with system-level considerations such as organizational and institutional policy enforcement addressing safety, security and fairness considerations. Teamwork and human-machine cooperation has an increased relevance with the transformation of our societies into socio-technical systems. We need to ensure transparency, foster trust, and ensure social reasoning conforms to societal norms and expectations. We also need to ensure human-machine and machine-machine cooperation is fostered responsibly, within an adequate accountability system and in alignment with the ethical values of individuals concerned.

 Topics: 
 Single-agent planning and scheduling 
 Multiagent planning and scheduling 
 Decentralized planning and scheduling 
 Planning under uncertainty 
 Combinatorial optimization 
 Constraint programming 
 Distributed constraint reasoning 
 Resource and task allocation 
 Non-strategic coalition formation 
 Description: This area includes theoretical or experimental contributions to search, optimization, planning, and scheduling in single- and multi-agent systems. Important subfields include decentralized planning, planning under uncertainty, combinatorial optimization, distributed constraint reasoning, resource and task allocation, and non-strategic coalition formation. Machine learning approaches as well as foundation models for planning and scheduling are encouraged. Likewise, all approaches to single- and multi-agent planning, including motion and path planning, and their interplay with other agent components are relevant. 
 Representation, Perception, and Reasoning (RPR) 
 Area Chairs: Natasha Alechina, Aparna Taneja, Alessio Lomuscio 
 Topics: 
 Computer vision 
 Representation learning and generative AI 
 Neurosymbolic approaches 
 Argumentation 
 Agent theories and models 
 Explainability 
 Logics for agent reasoning 
 Ontologies for agents 
 Reasoning about knowledge, beliefs, goals, actions, plans, and change in multiagent systems 
 Reasoning and problem solving in agent-based systems 
 Verification of agents and multiagent systems 
 Description: This area includes theoretical or experimental contributions to knowledge representation and reasoning in single-agent and multi-agent systems. Knowledge representation is to be understood broadly, ranging from theoretical contributions (e.g., epistemic, strategic, description, and other logics) to representation learning. Moreover, representation and reasoning in complex settings often entails reasoning about sensing and perception. Relevant forms of reasoning include, for instance, automated reasoning and theorem proving approaches, verification-based approaches, as well as probabilistic reasoning and neurosymbolic approaches, as long as they are applied to, or motivated by reasoning about agents and/or multiagent systems. 
 Engineering and Analysis of Multiagent Systems (EMAS) 
 Area Chairs:Viviana Mascardi, Daniela Briola 
 Topics: 
 Requirements and formal specification

 Description:This area invites contributions that focus on general-purpose software abstractions and methodologies (including software systems) that advance the engineering of agents and multiagent systems. Contributions that demonstrate the benefit of such abstractions and methodologies for interesting application domains and other technological paradigms are also welcome. Naturally, the scope of this area spans the entire software engineering lifecycle — from requirements and verification to testing, validation, and evolution. 
 Modeling and Simulation of (Artificial) Societies (SIM) 
 Area Chairs: Ana Bazzan, Samarth Swarup 
 Topics: 
 Analysis of agent-based simulations 
 Calibration methods for socio-demographic data 
 Agent-based models & Social Networks 
 Applications of agent-based simulations in social phenomena (polarization, inequality, etc.) 
 Emergent behavior 
 Engineering agent-based simulations 
 Interactive simulation 
 Modeling for agent-based simulation 
 Simulation of complex systems 
 Simulation techniques, tools and platforms 
 Social simulation 
 Validation of social simulation systems 
 Description: Artificial societies are computer simulations or models that are created to emulate and research the behavior of intricate social systems. These societies simulate the interactions and dynamics of people, animals or other organisms to understand how individual behaviors lead to emergent structures and interactions. Agent-based models of artificial society provide a way to analyze the impact of regulations, incentives and other interventions that help to understand the complex dynamics of society as a whole. The area aims to find efficient solutions to model and simulate complex societal systems using agents-based models. Important application areas include ecology, biology, economics, transportation, management, organizational, and social sciences in general. In these areas, agent theories, metaphors, models, analysis, experimental designs, empirical studies, and methodological principles, all converge into simulation as a way of achieving explanations and predictions, exploration and testing of hypotheses, and better system designs. 
 Human-Agent Interaction (HAI) 
 Area Chairs: Michael Goodrich, Birgit Lugrin 
 Topics: 
 Human-agent interaction 
 Agent-based analysis of human interactions 
 Socially interactive agents 
 Trust and explainability in human-agent interactions 
 Human-robot interaction and collaboration 
 Social robotics and social interactions 
 Mixed-initiative and shared autonomy in human-agent interactions 
 Groups of humans and agents 
 Agents models and architectures for interaction with humans 
 Designing for human-agent interaction 
 Virtual humans 
 Description: 
 Human interaction with artificially intelligent agents is becoming more commonplace, as such, developing and evaluating agents that can understand humans’ dynamics to support competent interaction. Significant challenges arise when transitioning from pure multiagent systems to hybrid systems that need to incorporate bi-directional human and agent interactions and sustain different competitive or collaborative situations. Agents need new models and architectures to better address the interaction with humans, including perception and recognition of humans’ internal states and activities at different levels, interaction modalities that support true coordination, and incorporation of human factors and ethics concerns. The design of human-agent interaction needs special concerns that combine requirements from the perspectives of both the agents and the humans. The interactive behavior of such agents can be inspired by human-human interaction and can, additionally, be embodied by virtual agents or robots to scaffold intuitive interaction. 
 Robotics and Control (ROBOT) 
 Area Chairs: Noa Agmon, Christopher Amato 
 Topics: 
 Multi-robot coordination and collaboration 
 Robot planning
