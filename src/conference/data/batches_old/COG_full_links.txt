 The annual IEEE Conference on Games (IEEE CoG) aims to be a leading venue for researchers and practitioners to exchange ideas and novel approaches to bring innovation in and through games. Games are a great domain to study and develop novel ideas in design, artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, psychology, education, sociology, and creativity, as well as their applications in real-world problems. IEEE CoG 2024 will take place at Politecnico di Milano, which is located in Milan, Italy. 
 We invite contributions related to all game aspects, including, but not limited to: 
 Accessibility and inclusivity in games 
 Game design (frameworks, game mechanics, etc.) 
 Game technology (game engines, graphics, audio, animation, physics, networking, controls, etc.) 
 Player-Computer Interfaces 
 Generative AI for games 
 Serious/applied games (for health, sustainability, etc.) 
 Extended reality (virtual reality, mixed reality, and augmented reality) 
 Esports and live-streaming 
 Games for education, learning and development 
 Game editors and authoring tools 
 Game User Research (player/opponent modeling, player experience studies, psychology of play and player types, etc.) 
 Game-playing AI 
 Games as test-beds for algorithms 
 Game analytics, game data science, and data visualization 
 AI for game development (automated playtesting, adaptation/personalization in games, etc.) 
 Please note: CoG is not a conference about game theory and does not accept papers about game theory unless they are applied to games people would play, such as video games or board games.FULL PAPERS 
 We invite the submission of full technical and vision papers with an 8 page limit (including references and appendices). Full technical papers should provide a technical or empirical contribution to scientific, technical, or engineering aspects of games. Full vision papers should describe a vision for the future of the Games field or some part of it, be based on extensive research, and include a comprehensive bibliography. Please notice that the standards for vision papers are high: literature reviews and opinion papers with speculations not grounded in research are immediately rejected. 
 AUXILIARY PAPERS 
 We invite the submission of short and demo papers. Short papers (2-4 pages) describe work in progress, smaller projects that are not yet ready to be published as a full paper, or new progress on projects that have been reported elsewhere. Demo papers (2 pages) describe works to be presented during a demo session. 
 All page limits include references and appendices.

 SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS 
 Papers must be submitted through the conference submission system available at the following link: 
 href="https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CoG2024" - https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CoG2024
All paper submissions should follow the recommended IEEE conference author guidelines. MS Word and LaTeX templates can be found at: 
 https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html 
 All submitted papers will be fully peer-reviewed, and accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and on IEEE Xplore. CoG will use a double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from their submissions, avoiding obvious identifying statements. Submissions not abiding by anonymity requirements will be desk rejected. 
 Short papers might be allocated to either poster presentations or short oral presentations if time and space permit. Demo papers will be allocated to a demo session. 
 We look forward to having you join us at CoG 2024 in Milan. 
 Best regards, 
 The Organizing Committee of IEEE CoG 2024
