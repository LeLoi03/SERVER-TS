 Obituary 
 Welcome to Duisburg, Germany! 
 For its15th edition,the CogSIMA conference series will take placeinGermanyfor the very first time, in the city of Duisburg. 
 The2025 IEEE Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation Management (CogSIMA)will be held at theUniversity of Duisburg-Essen, Campus Duisburg, from June 2 - 5, 2025. CogSIMA 2025 is sponsored by theIEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society (SMCS)and supported by the IEEE SMCS Technical Committees onhref="http://www.ieeesmc.org/technical-activities/cybernetics/cognitive-situation-management" - Cognitive Situation Management
and onhref="https://www.ieeesmc.org/technical-activities/human-machine-systems/interactive-and-wearable-computing-and-devices/" - Interactive and Wearable Computing and Devices
. 
 TheUniversity of Duisburg-Essenrepresents one of the leading academic institutions in the heart of Germany's industrial region, offering an ideal backdrop for a technical conference. The conference venue at the Gerhard Mercator house at the Campus in Duisburg will provide a welcoming environment promoting interaction and communication among the conference attendees. Being easy to reach with public transport, the venue is ideally located in vicinity to the university cafeteria where the participants will have lunch together. This, as well as the organized discussions, will result in a stimulating, exciting event designed for scientific and social exchange and networking. 
 Being one of theyoungest universities in Germany(founded in 2003), the University Duisburg-Essen was generated by the merger of the former universities of Duisburg and Essen. With close to 40.000 students among all disciplines from engineering, education, and medicine up to nano sciences, the university is the10th largest university in Germany. 
 The CogSIMA conference series provides an annual venue for presenting multi-disciplinary research on complex heterogeneous dynamical systems - of interacting humans, machines, computer agents and/or networks - whose individual and/or collective behavior depends on their situation awareness. 
 Examples of systems include command and control systems, disaster monitoring and recovery systems, human-robot teams, physical and cyber security situation awareness systems, intelligent transportation systems, health care medical situation control systems, and many others. 
 The theme of the conference will be"Improved Situation Awareness in Theory and Application". 
 The CogSIMA conferences are aimed at researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government, with a wide variety of backgrounds and experience including computer science, human factors, cognitive science, modeling and simulation, robotics, and systems engineering.

 Topics of Interest 
 CogSIMA 2025 continues to push forward the boundaries of cognitive situation management research. Since its inception in 2011, the CogSIMA conference series has become a premier scientific forum for presenting novel results on interdisciplinary studies of complex heterogeneous dynamical systems that include humans, physical systems, and computer agents whose behaviors depend on situations. 
 Accepted papers and poster presentations will be submitted for publication in theIEEE Xplore® Digital Library, which will be indexed by all major indexing and web discovery services (such as Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, DBLP, Semantic Scholar etc.).

 How to Submit 
 We invite two types of submissions, regular papers and poster presentations, which will undergo a competitive review process. All papers must present original and unpublished work that is not currently under review elsewhere. Each paper will bereviewedby at least three independent referees. Papers will be evaluated according to theirsignificance,originality,technical content,style,clarity, andrelevanceto the conference. 
 Quantitativeand/orqualitative methodsand results are welcome, as well ashypotheses-drivenor more open-endedexploratory work. Submissions must clearly outline the methodology (manipulations, measurements, environment and context, etc.) and technologies used, for both replicability and enabling in-depth review. In addition, research providing novel system designs, algorithms, interface technologies, and computational methods supporting elements of situation management are encouraged. Submitted papers should address issues related to the general domain of situation management. 
 Regular Papers (5-8 pages):describenew resultsthatadvance the state-of-the-art. Each accepted paper will be allocated approximately 25 minutes for theoral presentationduring the conference. 
 Poster Presentations (3-5 pages):describework in progress. Each accepted poster will be presented in a 5 min. talk in theposter session, and will be included in the final conference proceedings submitted to the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. 
 Authors should prepare a Portable Document Format (PDF) version of their paper using thestylesheet templates provided by IEEE. For more information contacthref="mailto:admin@cogsima.org" - admin@cogsima.org
. All paper submissions will be handled electronically in EDAS. 
 Click here to submit 
 Authors of accepted submissions will need to sign anIEEE copyright release form. The conference proceedings will be digitally published by IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society and will be submitted to theIEEE Xplore® Digital Library. 
 At least one author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference on-site in Duisburg, unless the TPC grants permission for a substitute presenter (who is qualified to present and answer questions) or alternative presentation mode arranged in advance of the event. 
 Papers must have been presented at the conference to be included in thefinal conference proceedings submitted to the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.
