Welcome to SafeComp 2025! 
 The 44thInternational Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability and Security 
 Let’s explore new frontiers of safety critical computing systems! 
 The 44th edition of SafeComp provides a unique occasion to explore and debate challenges of safety critical computing systems. Safety is more relevant than ever, with expanding capabilities of (semi-) autonomous cyber-physical system (CPS), interacting with humans in various roles and acting in more open environments. The 2025 theme is that of “Managing safety in an era of a software defined computing continuum.” 
 SafeComp is an annual international conference covering the state-of-the-art, industrial experiences and new trends in the areas of safety, security and reliability of critical computer applications. SafeComp provides ample opportunity to exchange insights and experience on emerging methods, approaches and practical solutions. It is a single-track conference without parallel sessions, allowing easy networking. 
 Since it was established in 1979 by the European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems, Technical Committee 7 on Reliability, Safety and Security (EWICS TC7), SafeComp has contributed to the progress of the state-of-the-art in dependable application of computers in safety-related and safety-critical systems. 
 Safety engineering has to carefully investigate the implications of the increasing complexity of software defined computing systems, as they are increasingly connected, interacting with supporting digital infrastructures, filled with AI and provided with more advanced perception systems.
