 The web site of the46th International Conference on Theory and Application of Petri Nets and Concurrencyconference is now onlinehref="http://conf-2025.petrinet.net/" - http://conf-2025.petrinet.net/
The 45th International Conference on Theory and Application of Petri Nets and Concurrency conference will be organised by the SMV (Semantics, Modeling and Verification) team at the Computer Science Department of the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Geneva, Switzerland, jointly with members of the Centre Universitaire d’Informatique. The conference will take place at the Campus Biotech Geneva. The Campus Biotech is an institution hosting research institutes and biotechnology companies. The Campus Biotech is a part of the Swiss Innovation Park. 
 The language of the conference is English, and its proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Papers presenting original research on application or theory of Petri nets, as well as contributions addressing topics relevant to the general field of distributed and concurrent systems or focused on applications of concurrency to system design are sought. 
 All accepted papers will be considered for an Outstanding Paper award. Authors of selected papers presented at the conference will be invited to submit an extended version that will be further reviewed for inclusion into a special issue of a renowned journal.
