This will be limited to a maximum of four awards at any one APCC.  \n Award Format  \n Every author of an awarded paper will be presented with a certificate. Each awarded paper will also receive a cash honorarium with an amount equivalent to US$300.  \n As an option, conference organizers may wish to add some small local souvenir gifts as part of the award.  \n Selection Method  \n The Award Committee requests the TPC Chair of the conference to nominate 7 to 10 papers based on their review scores. These scores will not be made known to members of the award committee prior to the final decision of the award. \n  Members of the Award Committee will review and score each of the nominated papers. \n  The winning papers together with a few runners-ups are selected based on the combined scores of the Award Committee members and the TPC reviews in the ratio of 1:1. It is possible that some considerations/adjustments on certain issues, such as Regional balance, (e.g., Regional balance, etc.) may be necessary in the final selection of the awarded papers. \n  The members of the Award Committee will make sure that the winning papers have been orally presented at the conference. If no oral presentation is made by a winning paper, then the runner up paper, which receives the highest score and has been presented, will be chosen in its place. | Comment: Since the awards are given out during the conference banquet, normally held on the second day of the conference, it is necessary to make sure that those winning papers scheduled for the last day of the conference will in fact be presented. \n  Fund for the Awards  \n The awards are supported by the cash donations from KICS, IEICE-CS, CIC, and IEEE COMSOC APB. The ASC Secretary will receive from each organization a cash donation of US$500 per year.  \n (APB (ComSoc) is expected to give the APCC organization US$1000 every two years.)  \n APCC Steering

The goal is to obtain a precise understanding of the asymptotic, average-case characteristics of algorithms and data structures. A unifying theme is the use of probabilistic, combinatorial, and analytic methods. The objects to be studied include random branching processes, graphs, permutations, trees, and strings.  \n The area of Analysis of Algorithms is frequently traced to 27 July 1963, when Donald E. Knuth wrote \"Notes on Open Addressing\". His fundamental books, The Art of Computer Programming, established ties between areas of study that include discrete mathematics, combinatorics, probability theory, analytic number theory, asymptotic analysis, and complexity theory.  \n Thirty years after Knuth's pioneering paper, the first seminar entirely devoted to the Analysis of Algorithms was held at Dagstuhl, Germany, in 1993. Since 1993, several series of seminars related to the analysis of algorithms have been established. These take place on an annual schedule. The rich history of meetings in this research area can be seen at https://www.math.aau.at/AofA/meetings/ This is the 36th edition of the conference and just the second one in Canada (the 23rd AofA was in Montreal in 2012). The organizing committee has selected the Fields Institute as the best place in Canada to welcome these worldwide experts and showcase the Canadian research environment.  \n In this research area we aim at studying discrete objects that appear as data structures or algorithms (including graphs, networks, and so on) by mathematical methods, in particular by probabilistic, combinatorial and asymptotic methods. The topics include but are not limited to:  \n • Properties of large random data structures  \n  • Probabilistic methods for the analysis of algorithms  \n  • Combinatorial methods for the analysis of algorithms  \n  • Analytic tools for the analysis of algorithms  \n  • Average case analysis of classical or new algorithms  \n  • Analytic and enumerative combinatorics  \n  • Random trees and graphs  \n  • Branching processes  \n  • Stochastic processes in relation with random discrete structures  \n  • Random walks  \n  • Discrete probabilities  \n  • Random generation of combinatorial structures  \n  • Performance evaluation, and more.  \n We will encourage participation from students and early-career researchers – both domestic and international – and expect that the topics presented in this workshop will positively influence their future careers, both in terms of opening new scientific avenues and also providing them with exposure to top-level research and professors in these areas.  \n Invited Speakers  \n Omer Angel (University of British Columbia)  \n  Yuliy Baryshnikov (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign)  \n  Anna Ben-Hamou (Sorbonne Université)  \n  Laura Eslava (UNAM)  \n  Vincent Jugé (Université Gustave Eiffel and CNRS)  \n  Greta Panova (University of Southern California)  \n  Sebastian Wild (University of Marburg)  \n  Karen Yeats (University of Waterloo)  \n\n Registered Participants  \n  \n Name | Affiliation \n David Adeyemi | Seneca College \n Mudit Aggarwal | University of British Columbia \n Lily Agranat-Tamir | Stanford University \n Daniel Amankwah | University of Iceland \n Seyed Massoud Amini | University of Ottawa \n Ahmed Ashraf | University of Toronto \n Caelan Atamanchuk | McGill University \n Cyril Banderier | CNRS/ Univ.

The goal is to obtain a precise understanding of the asymptotic, average-case characteristics of algorithms and data structures. A unifying theme is the use of probabilistic, combinatorial, and analytic methods. The objects to be studied include random branching processes, graphs, permutations, trees, and strings.  \n The area of Analysis of Algorithms is frequently traced to 27 July 1963, when Donald E. Knuth wrote \"Notes on Open Addressing\". His fundamental books, The Art of Computer Programming, established ties between areas of study that include discrete mathematics, combinatorics, probability theory, analytic number theory, asymptotic analysis, and complexity theory.  \n Thirty years after Knuth's pioneering paper, the first seminar entirely devoted to the Analysis of Algorithms was held at Dagstuhl, Germany, in 1993. Since 1993, several series of seminars related to the analysis of algorithms have been established. These take place on an annual schedule. The rich history of meetings in this research area can be seen at https://www.math.aau.at/AofA/meetings/ This is the 36th edition of the conference and just the second one in Canada (the 23rd AofA was in Montreal in 2012). The organizing committee has selected the Fields Institute as the best place in Canada to welcome these worldwide experts and showcase the Canadian research environment.  \n In this research area we aim at studying discrete objects that appear as data structures or algorithms (including graphs, networks, and so on) by mathematical methods, in particular by probabilistic, combinatorial and asymptotic methods. The topics include but are not limited to:  \n • Properties of large random data structures  \n  • Probabilistic methods for the analysis of algorithms  \n  • Combinatorial methods for the analysis of algorithms  \n  • Analytic tools for the analysis of algorithms  \n  • Average case analysis of classical or new algorithms  \n  • Analytic and enumerative combinatorics  \n  • Random trees and graphs  \n  • Branching processes  \n  • Stochastic processes in relation with random discrete structures  \n  • Random walks  \n  • Discrete probabilities  \n  • Random generation of combinatorial structures  \n  • Performance evaluation, and more.  \n We will encourage participation from students and early-career researchers – both domestic and international – and expect that the topics presented in this workshop will positively influence their future careers, both in terms of opening new scientific avenues and also providing them with exposure to top-level research and professors in these areas.  \n Invited Speakers  \n Omer Angel (University of British Columbia)  \n  Yuliy Baryshnikov (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign)  \n  Anna Ben-Hamou (Sorbonne Université)  \n  Laura Eslava (UNAM)  \n  Vincent Jugé (Université Gustave Eiffel and CNRS)  \n  Greta Panova (University of Southern California)  \n  Sebastian Wild (University of Marburg)  \n  Karen Yeats (University of Waterloo)  \n\n Registered Participants  \n  \n Name | Affiliation \n David Adeyemi | Seneca College \n Mudit Aggarwal | University of British Columbia \n Lily Agranat-Tamir | Stanford University \n Daniel Amankwah | University of Iceland \n Seyed Massoud Amini | University of Ottawa \n Ahmed Ashraf | University of Toronto \n Caelan Atamanchuk | McGill University \n Cyril Banderier | CNRS/ Univ.

In recent years, social network research has advanced significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine learning techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social medium that fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences and knowledge, group activities, community formation and evolution. This has led to a rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics homeland security and business. This follows the pattern of known entities of our society that have evolved into networks in which actors are increasingly dependent on their structural embedding.  \n The international conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2025) will primarily provide an interdisciplinary venue that will bring together practitioners and researchers from a variety of SNAM fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices. ASONAM 2025 is intended to address important aspects with a specific focus on the emerging trends and industry needs associated with social networking analysis and mining.

In recent years, social network research has advanced significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine learning techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social medium that fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences and knowledge, group activities, community formation and evolution. This has led to a rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics homeland security and business. This follows the pattern of known entities of our society that have evolved into networks in which actors are increasingly dependent on their structural embedding.  \n The international conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2025) will primarily provide an interdisciplinary venue that will bring together practitioners and researchers from a variety of SNAM fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices. ASONAM 2025 is intended to address important aspects with a specific focus on the emerging trends and industry needs associated with social networking analysis and mining. The conference solicits experimental and theoretical works on social network analysis and mining along with their application to real life situations.  \n Full papers will be reviewed and assessed by the program committee and a \"Best Paper Award\" ceremony will be organized at the banquet.  \n\n News  \n - Good news: ASONAM is now included in the prestigious CORE Conference Portal in Australia.  \n\n Previous Conferences  \n ASONAM 2024 | 02-05 September, 2024, in person at University of Calabria, Rende (CS) , Calabria, Italy \n   \n  ASONAM 2023 | 06-09 November, 2023, in person at Pine Bay Holiday Resort , Kusadasi, Turkey \n   \n  ASONAM 2022 | 10-13 November, 2022, in person at Istanbul Medipol University, Istanbul, Turkey and Virtual using ZOOM \n   \n  ASONAM 2021 | 08-11 November, 2021, Virtual using ZOOM \n   \n  ASONAM 2020 | 07-10 December, 2020, Virtual using ZOOM \n   \n  ASONAM 2019 | 27-30 August, 2019, Vancouver, Canada, MARRIOTT HOTEL \n   \n  ASONAM 2018 | 28-31 August, 2018, Barcelona, Spain, Crowne Plaza Hotel \n   \n  ASONAM 2017 | 01-02 August, 2017, Sydney, Australia, Mercure Sydney Hotel \n   \n  ASONAM 2016 | 19-20 August, 2016, San Francisco, CA, USA, Sn Francis Drake Hotel \n   \n  ASONAM 2015 | 26-27 August, 2015, Paris, France, TELECOM ParisTech \n   \n  ASONAM 2014 | 17-20 August, 2014, Beijing, China Beijing International Convention Center \n   \n  ASONAM 2013 | 25-28 August, 2013, Niagara Falls, Canada Sheraton Hotel \n   \n  ASONAM 2012 | 26-29 August, 2012, Istanbul, Turkey Kadir Has University \n   \n  ASONAM 2011 | 25-27 July 2011, Kaohsiung, Taiwan National University of Kaohsiung \n   \n  ASONAM 2010 | 9-11 August 2010, Odense, Denmark University of Southern Denmark \n   \n  ASONAM 2009 | 20-22 July 2009, Athens, Greece Hellenic American University \n\n ASONAM 2025  \n\n Committee  \n  \n  Steering Chair \n  Reda Alhajj | University of Calgary, Canada \n  Honorary Chairs \n  Frans N.

Since its inception in 2009, ArtsIT has been established as a prominent scientific platform for sharing cutting-edge research findings at the convergence of art, science, culture, performing arts, media, and technology. Artistic practice utilizing digital media serves not only as a means of analyzing and critically reflecting on the influence of technology on our lives, culture, and society but also as a tool for fostering discussions on sustainability, responsibility, and human dignity. In addition to the main track that includes topics such digital artworks and cultural heritage, audio art, games and gamification, immersive technologies and interactive art installations, the event dedicates attention to recent advancements that have made significant contributions to the field in recent years, such as virtualization, artificial intelligence and big data, virtual reality and the metaverse, with dedicated sessions. In an attempt to bridge the gap between research in art and technology, this interdisciplinary conference aims to enrich both fields and contribute to the development of new ideas, experiences, and global societal advancements. The convergence of Art and Tech can cultivate innovation and stimulate imaginative thought.  \n The conference aims to bring together artists and technologists to join forces to challenge the limitations within their respective domains, while through the merging artistic expression with technological progress, novel concepts, methodologies, and modes of creative expression can arise.  \n\n    Submit Now     \n\n ArtsIT conference proceedings received  \n\n Total Accesses   \n  0  +    \n\n ArtsIT 2025 Deadlines  \n\n Important dates     \n\n Full Paper Submission deadline  \n\n 1 June 2025 \n\n    Submission open     \n\n Notification deadline  \n\n 15 August 2025 \n\n Camera-ready deadline  \n\n 30 September 2025 \n\n Poster Track     \n\n Full Paper Submission deadline  \n\n 10th July 2024 \n\n    Submission closed     \n\n Notification deadline  \n\n 1st August 2024 \n\n Camera-ready deadline  \n\n 20th August 2024 \n\n Late Track     \n\n Full Paper Submission deadline  \n\n 10th July 2024 \n\n    Submission closed     \n\n Notification deadline  \n\n 1st August 2024 \n\n Camera-ready deadline  \n\n 20th August 2024 \n\n Conference proceedings  \n\n Total Accesses   \n  0  +    \n\n    Know more about conference publications     \n\n Publication     \n\n All registered papers  will be submitted for publishing by Springer – LNICST series  and made available through SpringerLink Digital Library: ArtsIT Conference Proceedings  .  \n Proceedings will be submitted for inclusion in leading indexing services, such as Web of Science, Compendex, Scopus, DBLP, EU Digital Library, Google Scholar, IO-Port, MathSciNet, Inspec, and Zentralblatt MATH.  \n Available Journals   \n All accepted authors are eligible to submit an extended version in a fast track of:  \n EAI Endorsed Transactions on Creative Technologies \n  EAI Endorsed Transactions on AI and Robotics \n  By paying an additional $150, authors can publish their articles in the EAI Endorsed Transactions journal selected by the conference (Scopus and Ei-indexed):   \n EAI Endorsed Transactions on Internet of Things (Scopus) \n  The article’s publication is subject to the following requirements:   \n It must be an extended version of the conference paper with a different title and abstract.

This year we have increased special track offerings (under “Calls”) and authors are recommended to browse these initially to see if fitting your topic as the track chair and committee members are experts in their fields, thus act as expert reviewers for submissions and offering special session presentations to raise authors’ profile.  \n Reflecting on last year’s event, also hosted in UAE at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), we were delighted by the enthusiasm and impactful discussions shared by our many participants. High quality paper presentations by attending delegates were cojoined by six luminary keynote speaker talks, workshops, performances, demonstrations, posters, and a panel discussion chaired by the Australian Network for Art and Technology (ANAT). As one attendee shared, “ArtsIT 2024 was a remarkable experience, fostering a deep exchange of ideas that will resonate for years.” We look forward to building on this momentum and seeing what new insights this year will bring as we again evolve the growing ArtsIT global community.  \n\n Meet the Full Committee here     \n\n Prof. Anthony L.

Since its inception in 2009, ArtsIT has been established as a prominent scientific platform for sharing cutting-edge research findings at the convergence of art, science, culture, performing arts, media, and technology. Artistic practice utilizing digital media serves not only as a means of analyzing and critically reflecting on the influence of technology on our lives, culture, and society but also as a tool for fostering discussions on sustainability, responsibility, and human dignity. In addition to the main track that includes topics such digital artworks and cultural heritage, audio art, games and gamification, immersive technologies and interactive art installations, the event dedicates attention to recent advancements that have made significant contributions to the field in recent years, such as virtualization, artificial intelligence and big data, virtual reality and the metaverse, with dedicated sessions. In an attempt to bridge the gap between research in art and technology, this interdisciplinary conference aims to enrich both fields and contribute to the development of new ideas, experiences, and global societal advancements. The convergence of Art and Tech can cultivate innovation and stimulate imaginative thought.  \n The conference aims to bring together artists and technologists to join forces to challenge the limitations within their respective domains, while through the merging artistic expression with technological progress, novel concepts, methodologies, and modes of creative expression can arise.  \n\n    Submit Now     \n\n ArtsIT conference proceedings received  \n\n Total Accesses   \n  0  +    \n\n ArtsIT 2025 Deadlines  \n\n Important dates     \n\n Full Paper Submission deadline  \n\n 1 June 2025 \n\n    Submission open     \n\n Notification deadline  \n\n 15 August 2025 \n\n Camera-ready deadline  \n\n 30 September 2025 \n\n Poster Track     \n\n Full Paper Submission deadline  \n\n 10th July 2024 \n\n    Submission closed     \n\n Notification deadline  \n\n 1st August 2024 \n\n Camera-ready deadline  \n\n 20th August 2024 \n\n Late Track     \n\n Full Paper Submission deadline  \n\n 10th July 2024 \n\n    Submission closed     \n\n Notification deadline  \n\n 1st August 2024 \n\n Camera-ready deadline  \n\n 20th August 2024 \n\n Conference proceedings  \n\n Total Accesses   \n  0  +    \n\n    Know more about conference publications     \n\n Publication     \n\n All registered papers  will be submitted for publishing by Springer – LNICST series  and made available through SpringerLink Digital Library: ArtsIT Conference Proceedings  .  \n Proceedings will be submitted for inclusion in leading indexing services, such as Web of Science, Compendex, Scopus, DBLP, EU Digital Library, Google Scholar, IO-Port, MathSciNet, Inspec, and Zentralblatt MATH.  \n Available Journals   \n All accepted authors are eligible to submit an extended version in a fast track of:  \n EAI Endorsed Transactions on Creative Technologies \n  EAI Endorsed Transactions on AI and Robotics \n  By paying an additional $150, authors can publish their articles in the EAI Endorsed Transactions journal selected by the conference (Scopus and Ei-indexed):   \n EAI Endorsed Transactions on Internet of Things (Scopus) \n  The article’s publication is subject to the following requirements:   \n It must be an extended version of the conference paper with a different title and abstract.

Since its inception in 2009, ArtsIT has been established as a prominent scientific platform for sharing cutting-edge research findings at the convergence of art, science, culture, performing arts, media, and technology. Artistic practice utilizing digital media serves not only as a means of analyzing and critically reflecting on the influence of technology on our lives, culture, and society but also as a tool for fostering discussions on sustainability, responsibility, and human dignity. In addition to the main track that includes topics such digital artworks and cultural heritage, audio art, games and gamification, immersive technologies and interactive art installations, the event dedicates attention to recent advancements that have made significant contributions to the field in recent years, such as virtualization, artificial intelligence and big data, virtual reality and the metaverse, with dedicated sessions. In an attempt to bridge the gap between research in art and technology, this interdisciplinary conference aims to enrich both fields and contribute to the development of new ideas, experiences, and global societal advancements. The convergence of Art and Tech can cultivate innovation and stimulate imaginative thought.  \n The conference aims to bring together artists and technologists to join forces to challenge the limitations within their respective domains, while through the merging artistic expression with technological progress, novel concepts, methodologies, and modes of creative expression can arise.  \n\n    Submit Now     \n\n ArtsIT conference proceedings received  \n\n Total Accesses   \n  0  +    \n\n ArtsIT 2025 Deadlines  \n\n Important dates     \n\n Full Paper Submission deadline  \n\n 1 June 2025 \n\n    Submission open     \n\n Notification deadline  \n\n 15 August 2025 \n\n Camera-ready deadline  \n\n 30 September 2025 \n\n Poster Track     \n\n Full Paper Submission deadline  \n\n 10th July 2024 \n\n    Submission closed     \n\n Notification deadline  \n\n 1st August 2024 \n\n Camera-ready deadline  \n\n 20th August 2024 \n\n Late Track     \n\n Full Paper Submission deadline  \n\n 10th July 2024 \n\n    Submission closed     \n\n Notification deadline  \n\n 1st August 2024 \n\n Camera-ready deadline  \n\n 20th August 2024 \n\n Conference proceedings  \n\n Total Accesses   \n  0  +    \n\n    Know more about conference publications     \n\n Publication     \n\n All registered papers  will be submitted for publishing by Springer – LNICST series  and made available through SpringerLink Digital Library: ArtsIT Conference Proceedings  .  \n Proceedings will be submitted for inclusion in leading indexing services, such as Web of Science, Compendex, Scopus, DBLP, EU Digital Library, Google Scholar, IO-Port, MathSciNet, Inspec, and Zentralblatt MATH.  \n Available Journals   \n All accepted authors are eligible to submit an extended version in a fast track of:  \n EAI Endorsed Transactions on Creative Technologies \n  EAI Endorsed Transactions on AI and Robotics \n  By paying an additional $150, authors can publish their articles in the EAI Endorsed Transactions journal selected by the conference (Scopus and Ei-indexed):   \n EAI Endorsed Transactions on Internet of Things (Scopus) \n  The article’s publication is subject to the following requirements:   \n It must be an extended version of the conference paper with a different title and abstract.

As the Steering Chair, and an international artist in this contemporary field, I am proud to guide this year’s conference, which promises to bring together groundbreaking research, inspiring talks, and transformative collaborations. This year we have increased special track offerings (under “Calls”) and authors are recommended to browse these initially to see if fitting your topic as the track chair and committee members are experts in their fields, thus act as expert reviewers for submissions and offering special session presentations to raise authors’ profile.  \n Reflecting on last year’s event, also hosted in UAE at New York University Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), we were delighted by the enthusiasm and impactful discussions shared by our many participants. High quality paper presentations by attending delegates were cojoined by six luminary keynote speaker talks, workshops, performances, demonstrations, posters, and a panel discussion chaired by the Australian Network for Art and Technology (ANAT). As one attendee shared, “ArtsIT 2024 was a remarkable experience, fostering a deep exchange of ideas that will resonate for years.” We look forward to building on this momentum and seeing what new insights this year will bring as we again evolve the growing ArtsIT global community.  \n\n Meet the Full Committee here     \n\n Prof. Anthony L.

We seek articles presenting accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. Purely theoretical (e.g., cryptography-focused, with no security/application connections) submissions are not encouraged. The same goes for submissions focusing primarily on blockchains or machine learning.  \n  Like in previous years, we will also be accepting “Systemisation of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. SoK submissions need to add the prefix “SoK: ” in the title. They will be accepted based on the value to the community. Survey papers without insights evaluating, systematizing and contextualizing current knowledge will be rejected.  \n Program Chairs  \n Michail Maniatakos (New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE) \n  Yinqian Zhang (Southern University of Science and Technology, China) \n  Important Dates  \n Cycle 1 Deadline   \n Paper Submission: | 20 September 2024 (AoE) \n  Early Rejection: | 25 October 2024 \n  Author Notification: | 13 December 2024 \n  Camera Ready: | 11 January 2025 \n  Cycle 2 Deadline   \n Paper Submission: | 20 January 2025 (AoE) \n  Early Rejection: | 28 February 2025 \n  Author Notification: | 19 April 2025 \n  Camera Ready: | 25 May 2025 \n  Submission Instructions  \n Please read the instructions below before submitting your paper. Please get in touch with the PC chairs at asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org for any questions regarding the submissions.  \n  \n SUBMIT YOUR PAPER HERE   \n Paper Formatting   \n Technical papers submitted for ASIACCS must be written in English. Papers must be in PDF format and at most 12 pages double-column. We will allow up to 10 additional pages for the bibliography and well-marked appendices, but note that reviewers are not expected to read the appendices. Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest ACM Sigconf style conference template (available here ). All fonts, images, tables, and figures must comply with common standards and not generate problems for reviewers. Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:” Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.  \n Conflicts of Interest   \n When submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include:  \n Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission. \n  Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past. \n  Anyone the author has collaborated with or published within the prior two years. \n  PC members, including chairs with a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure to declare COI or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a PC member with COI reviews a paper, it will be rejected.  \n Anonymous Submissions   \n  \n ASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used. The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the submission is made unless approved by the Program Chairs. Publishing the submission on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, is allowed but authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results (e.g., social media, seminars, etc.) and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.  \n Double and Concurrent Submissions   \n Submissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double submission will result in immediate rejection. We may report detected violations to other conference chairs and journal editors.  \n Ethical Considerations   \n The authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence (beyond approval of the experiment by their institution) elaborating how they have thoroughly considered such issues. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns.  \n Early Rejection and Appeals   \n There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification email. Authors’ appeals must clearly and explicitly identify substantial disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews that should be adjudicated by a particular arbitration reviewer who the PC chairs may recruit. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.  \n Paper Revision and Resubmission   \n Rejected papers in the Cycle 1 cannot be resubmitted in the Cycle 2. A small number of the Cycle 1 submissions may receive a Revise decision, rather than Accept or Reject and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server. The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. We will request additional revisions only in exceptional circumstances.  \n Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation   \n If a paper is accepted, the author list in the submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.  \n Contact  \n For any questions related to paper submissions, please contact the PC chairs at asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org .  \n\n © ACM ASIACCS 2025.

We seek articles presenting accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. Purely theoretical submissions are not encouraged. The same goes for submissions focusing primarily on blockchains or machine learning.\\n\\nWe will also be accepting “Systematization of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. SoK submissions need to add the prefix “SoK: ” in the title. They will be accepted based on the value to the community. Survey papers without insights evaluating, systematizing, and contextualizing current knowledge will be rejected.\\n\\n## Important Dates\\n\\n### Cycle 1 Deadline\\n\\n*   **Paper Submission:** September 20, 2024 (AoE)\\n*   **Early Rejection:** October 25, 2024\\n*   **Author Notification:** December 13, 2024\\n*   **Camera Ready:** January 11, 2025\\n\\n### Cycle 2 Deadline\\n\\n*   **Paper Submission:** January 20, 2025 (AoE)\\n*   **Early Rejection:** February 28, 2025\\n*   **Author Notification:** April 19, 2025\\n*   **Camera Ready:** May 25, 2025\\n\\n## Submission Instructions\\n\\nPlease read the instructions below before submitting your paper. Please get in touch with the PC chairs at asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org for any questions regarding the submissions.\\n\\n### Paper Formatting\\n\\nTechnical papers submitted for ASIACCS must be written in English. Papers must be in PDF format and at most 12 pages double-column. We will allow up to 10 additional pages for the bibliography and well-marked appendices, but note that reviewers are not expected to read the appendices. Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest ACM Sigconf style conference template. All fonts, images, tables, and figures must comply with common standards and not generate problems for reviewers. Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:” Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.\\n\\n### Conflicts of Interest\\n\\nWhen submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include:\\n\\n*   Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission.\\n*   Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past.\\n*   Anyone the author has collaborated with or published within the prior two years.\\n\\nPC members, including chairs with a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure to declare COI or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a PC member with COI reviews a paper, it will be rejected.\\n\\n### Anonymous Submissions\\n\\nASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used. The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the submission is made unless approved by the Program Chairs. Publishing the submission on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, is allowed, but authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results (e.g., social media, seminars, etc.) and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.\\n\\n### Double and Concurrent Submissions\\n\\nSubmissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double submission will result in immediate rejection. We may report detected violations to other conference chairs and journal editors.\\n\\n### Ethical Considerations\\n\\nThe authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence (beyond approval of the experiment by their institution) elaborating how they have thoroughly considered such issues. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns.\\n\\n### Early Rejection and Appeals\\n\\nThere will be no conventional rebuttal process.

Unlike methods that isolate supply and demand components, it adopts a holistic view, crucial for understanding how various factors interact and influence outcomes. Key features of system dynamics modelling include:  \n · Feedback Loops:  It models dynamic relationships by incorporating feedback loops, showing how changes in one area (e.g., energy supply) affect others (e.g., demand for electric trucks) over time.  \n · Time Delays:  The models reflect real-world delays, important for energy demand forecasting where policy impacts are not immediate.  \n · Non-linear Behaviour:  System dynamics capture non-linear interactions, providing a more accurate representation of complex variable relationships.  \n · Scenario Analysis:  It allows exploration of different future scenarios based on variable changes, aiding decision-makers in understanding potential outcomes.  \n System dynamics is particularly suited for evolving conditions and relationships in forecasting the effectiveness of various policies such as decarbonisation scenarios for the transport and logistics sector.  \n This workshop is designed for beginners interested in learning systems dynamics simulation modelling. In the first hour of the course, the system dynamics modelling and examples will be presented. In the second hour, the attendees will develop a simple systems dynamics model using the Vensim software. In the third hour, a system dynamics modelling framework for decarbonisation of freight transport will be presented and the attendees can get a hands-on experience with the model dashboard, model reports and sensitivity analysis. The attendees will gain practical experience and improve their strategic system dynamics simulation modelling skills.  \n Workshop content:   \n In this workshop, we will cover the topics of:  \n Introduction to system dynamics modelling framework, input data and output reports \n  Simple system dynamics model development \n  Hands-on practices with a system dynamics model for decarbonisation of freight transport system in Australia \n  Facilitator:   \n Dr Hossein Hosseini is an early career researcher for the Brain and Mind Centre at the University of Sydney. His research is focused on systems modelling approaches to analyse complex socio-technical problems. In particular, his current research is concentrated on mental health policy analysis via a System Dynamics modelling effort in which simulation models are developed through a participatory approach to understand the drivers of mental health system change and to explore system transitions to the future in Australia.  \n Dr Elnaz Irannezhad is a Senior Lecturer of transport in the Research Centre for Integrated Transport Innovations (rCITI), School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Elli's research contributes to the advancement of science in cross-disciplinary fields of logistics, freight transport modelling, and decarbonisation.  \n Notes:   \n   \n (a) Please make sure you pay the workshop fee during conference registration by adding “System Dynamics Modelling and Decarbonisation of Transport Sector \" to the online payment system.  \n (b) All course material, including source codes, will be made available for attendees in advance.  \n\n Keynote Speakers  \n\n Distinguished Professor Jie Lu  \n University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, Australia   \n Distinguished Professor Jie Lu AO (Officer of the Order of Australia) is an internationally renowned scientist in the area of computational intelligence, who has made fundamental and influential contributions, particularly in fuzzy transfer learning, concept drift, data-driven decision support systems, and recommender systems.

Analyzing and improving the reliability and safety of intelligent systems is a challenging task. In this talk, we will present some of our related research and discuss the problem from a systems engineering perspective. Intelligent systems rely heavily on the availability of large amounts of data, which can be affected by issues such as measurement accuracy, sensor dependability, and uncertainty due to the changing environments in which these systems operate. Some possible approaches to address these challenges will also be discussed. These may include techniques for ensuring data quality, robust sensor fusion, uncertainty quantification, and system-level verification and validation. By rigorously addressing the dependability of intelligent systems, we can unlock their full potential while ensuring the safety and reliability of the critical applications they enable.  \n\n Prof. Dr. Dr. habil.

Unlike methods that isolate supply and demand components, it adopts a holistic view, crucial for understanding how various factors interact and influence outcomes. Key features of system dynamics modelling include:  \n · Feedback Loops:  It models dynamic relationships by incorporating feedback loops, showing how changes in one area (e.g., energy supply) affect others (e.g., demand for electric trucks) over time.  \n · Time Delays:  The models reflect real-world delays, important for energy demand forecasting where policy impacts are not immediate.  \n · Non-linear Behaviour:  System dynamics capture non-linear interactions, providing a more accurate representation of complex variable relationships.  \n · Scenario Analysis:  It allows exploration of different future scenarios based on variable changes, aiding decision-makers in understanding potential outcomes.  \n System dynamics is particularly suited for evolving conditions and relationships in forecasting the effectiveness of various policies such as decarbonisation scenarios for the transport and logistics sector.  \n This workshop is designed for beginners interested in learning systems dynamics simulation modelling. In the first hour of the course, the system dynamics modelling and examples will be presented. In the second hour, the attendees will develop a simple systems dynamics model using the Vensim software. In the third hour, a system dynamics modelling framework for decarbonisation of freight transport will be presented and the attendees can get a hands-on experience with the model dashboard, model reports and sensitivity analysis. The attendees will gain practical experience and improve their strategic system dynamics simulation modelling skills.  \n Workshop content:   \n In this workshop, we will cover the topics of:  \n Introduction to system dynamics modelling framework, input data and output reports \n  Simple system dynamics model development \n  Hands-on practices with a system dynamics model for decarbonisation of freight transport system in Australia \n  Facilitator:   \n Dr Hossein Hosseini is an early career researcher for the Brain and Mind Centre at the University of Sydney. His research is focused on systems modelling approaches to analyse complex socio-technical problems. In particular, his current research is concentrated on mental health policy analysis via a System Dynamics modelling effort in which simulation models are developed through a participatory approach to understand the drivers of mental health system change and to explore system transitions to the future in Australia.  \n Dr Elnaz Irannezhad is a Senior Lecturer of transport in the Research Centre for Integrated Transport Innovations (rCITI), School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

Analyzing and improving the reliability and safety of intelligent systems is a challenging task. In this talk, we will present some of our related research and discuss the problem from a systems engineering perspective. Intelligent systems rely heavily on the availability of large amounts of data, which can be affected by issues such as measurement accuracy, sensor dependability, and uncertainty due to the changing environments in which these systems operate. Some possible approaches to address these challenges will also be discussed. These may include techniques for ensuring data quality, robust sensor fusion, uncertainty quantification, and system-level verification and validation. By rigorously addressing the dependability of intelligent systems, we can unlock their full potential while ensuring the safety and reliability of the critical applications they enable.  \n\n Prof. Dr. Dr. habil.

Unlike methods that isolate supply and demand components, it adopts a holistic view, crucial for understanding how various factors interact and influence outcomes. Key features of system dynamics modelling include:  \n · Feedback Loops:  It models dynamic relationships by incorporating feedback loops, showing how changes in one area (e.g., energy supply) affect others (e.g., demand for electric trucks) over time.  \n · Time Delays:  The models reflect real-world delays, important for energy demand forecasting where policy impacts are not immediate.  \n · Non-linear Behaviour:  System dynamics capture non-linear interactions, providing a more accurate representation of complex variable relationships.  \n · Scenario Analysis:  It allows exploration of different future scenarios based on variable changes, aiding decision-makers in understanding potential outcomes.  \n System dynamics is particularly suited for evolving conditions and relationships in forecasting the effectiveness of various policies such as decarbonisation scenarios for the transport and logistics sector.  \n This workshop is designed for beginners interested in learning systems dynamics simulation modelling. In the first hour of the course, the system dynamics modelling and examples will be presented. In the second hour, the attendees will develop a simple systems dynamics model using the Vensim software. In the third hour, a system dynamics modelling framework for decarbonisation of freight transport will be presented and the attendees can get a hands-on experience with the model dashboard, model reports and sensitivity analysis. The attendees will gain practical experience and improve their strategic system dynamics simulation modelling skills.  \n Workshop content:   \n In this workshop, we will cover the topics of:  \n Introduction to system dynamics modelling framework, input data and output reports \n  Simple system dynamics model development \n  Hands-on practices with a system dynamics model for decarbonisation of freight transport system in Australia \n  Facilitator:   \n Dr Hossein Hosseini is an early career researcher for the Brain and Mind Centre at the University of Sydney. His research is focused on systems modelling approaches to analyse complex socio-technical problems.

Analyzing and improving the reliability and safety of intelligent systems is a challenging task. In this talk, we will present some of our related research and discuss the problem from a systems engineering perspective. Intelligent systems rely heavily on the availability of large amounts of data, which can be affected by issues such as measurement accuracy, sensor dependability, and uncertainty due to the changing environments in which these systems operate. Some possible approaches to address these challenges will also be discussed. These may include techniques for ensuring data quality, robust sensor fusion, uncertainty quantification, and system-level verification and validation. By rigorously addressing the dependability of intelligent systems, we can unlock their full potential while ensuring the safety and reliability of the critical applications they enable.  \n\n Prof. Dr. Dr. habil.

Unlike methods that isolate supply and demand components, it adopts a holistic view, crucial for understanding how various factors interact and influence outcomes. Key features of system dynamics modelling include:  \n · Feedback Loops:  It models dynamic relationships by incorporating feedback loops, showing how changes in one area (e.g., energy supply) affect others (e.g., demand for electric trucks) over time.  \n · Time Delays:  The models reflect real-world delays, important for energy demand forecasting where policy impacts are not immediate.  \n · Non-linear Behaviour:  System dynamics capture non-linear interactions, providing a more accurate representation of complex variable relationships.  \n · Scenario Analysis:  It allows exploration of different future scenarios based on variable changes, aiding decision-makers in understanding potential outcomes.  \n System dynamics is particularly suited for evolving conditions and relationships in forecasting the effectiveness of various policies such as decarbonisation scenarios for the transport and logistics sector.  \n This workshop is designed for beginners interested in learning systems dynamics simulation modelling. In the first hour of the course, the system dynamics modelling and examples will be presented. In the second hour, the attendees will develop a simple systems dynamics model using the Vensim software. In the third hour, a system dynamics modelling framework for decarbonisation of freight transport will be presented and the attendees can get a hands-on experience with the model dashboard, model reports and sensitivity analysis. The attendees will gain practical experience and improve their strategic system dynamics simulation modelling skills.  \n Workshop content:   \n In this workshop, we will cover the topics of:  \n Introduction to system dynamics modelling framework, input data and output reports \n  Simple system dynamics model development \n  Hands-on practices with a system dynamics model for decarbonisation of freight transport system in Australia \n  Facilitator:   \n Dr Hossein Hosseini is an early career researcher for the Brain and Mind Centre at the University of Sydney. His research is focused on systems modelling approaches to analyse complex socio-technical problems.

Analyzing and improving the reliability and safety of intelligent systems is a challenging task. In this talk, we will present some of our related research and discuss the problem from a systems engineering perspective. Intelligent systems rely heavily on the availability of large amounts of data, which can be affected by issues such as measurement accuracy, sensor dependability, and uncertainty due to the changing environments in which these systems operate. Some possible approaches to address these challenges will also be discussed. These may include techniques for ensuring data quality, robust sensor fusion, uncertainty quantification, and system-level verification and validation. By rigorously addressing the dependability of intelligent systems, we can unlock their full potential while ensuring the safety and reliability of the critical applications they enable.  \n\n Prof. Dr. Dr. habil.

Infrastructures, software components, and applications aim to hide their increasing complexity in order to appear more human-centric. However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes keep demanding for the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA). Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decade. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of the test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud.  \n AST continues with a long record of international scientific forums on methods and solutions to automate software testing. This year AST is the 6th edition of a conference that was formerly organized as workshops since 2006. The conference promotes high quality research contributions on methods for software test automation, and original case studies reporting practices in this field. We invite contributions that focus on: i) lessons learned about experiments of automatic testing in practice; ii) experiences of the adoption of testing tools, methods and techniques; iii) best practices to follow in testing and their measurable consequences; and iv) theoretical approaches that are applicable to the industry in the context of AST.  \n Authors of the best papers presented at AST 2025 will be invited to submit an extension of their work for possible inclusion in a special issue in Software Testing, Verification, and Reliability (STVR) journal   \n Call for papers.  \n\n Dates    \n Mon 28 Apr 2025   \n Tue 29 Apr 2025   \n\n Plenary    \n Hide plenary sessions   \n\n  This program is tentative and subject to change.  \n  Program Display Configuration  \n   \n   Time Zone   \n   \n The program is currently displayed in (GMT-04:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)  .

There will be some tables with computers where people can edit presentations (bring on a USB stick) and upload presentations to the presentation rooms through the Contact 1 website. There will also be AV technicians to help if needed.  \n You do not need to use the Ready Room: You have several choices: You can upload your presentation from your own computer in advance of your session (days in advance even) at the Contact 1 website (you will be sent a link). Or you can plug your computer in using an HDMI cable when you are starting your presentation. This last option is available but not recommended, since it increases the chance of delays.  \n There will be some tables and couches in the Ready Room where you can get work done, or have small get-togethers with people.  \n This room will not be ‘quiet’. If you want a quiet place to work or chill out (library quiet, no talking) then Room 209 will be available much of the time.  \n The Ready Room will also have some poster boards. \n\n 09:00 - 10:30 | Quiet Room Monday 9AM ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 202 \n\n 09:00 - 10:30 | Conference Opening & Keynote AST 2025  at 211 \n 09:00   \n 90m    \n Keynote | Personalized Fuzzing  AST 2025   \n Andreas Zeller CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security \n\n 10:30 - 11:00 | Break ICSE Catering  at Canada Hall 3 plus Foyer \n 10:30   \n 30m    \n Break | Monday Morning Break  ICSE Catering \n\n 11:00 - 12:30 | Quiet Room Monday 11AM ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 202 \n\n 11:00 - 12:30 | Session 1: LLM for Testing AST 2025  at 211 \n 11:00   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Acceptance Test Generation with Large Language Models: An Industrial Case Study  AST 2025   \n Margarida Ferreira University of Porto and Critical TechWorks  , Luís Viegas University of Porto and Critical TechWorks  , João Pascoal Faria Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto and INESC TEC  , Bruno Lima Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto & LIACC \n 11:30   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | AsserT5: Test Assertion Generation Using a Fine-Tuned Code Language Model  AST 2025   \n Severin Primbs University of Passau  , Benedikt Fein University of Passau  , Gordon Fraser University of Passau    \n  Pre-print \n 12:00   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Simulink Mutation Testing using CodeBERT  AST 2025   \n Jingfan Zhang University of Ottawa  , Delaram Ghobari University of Ottawa  , Mehrdad Sabetzadeh University of Ottawa  , Shiva Nejati University of Ottawa    \n  Pre-print \n\n 12:30 - 14:00 | Lunch ICSE Catering  at Canada Hall 3 plus Foyer \n 12:30   \n 90m    \n Lunch | Monday Lunch  ICSE Catering \n\n 14:00 - 15:30 | Quiet Room Monday 2PM ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 202 \n\n 14:00 - 15:30 | Session 2: Test Generation AST 2025  at 211 \n 14:00   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Automated Test-Case Generation for REST APIs Using Model Inference Search Heuristic  AST 2025   \n Clinton Cao Delft University of Technology  , Annibale Panichella Delft University of Technology  , Sicco Verwer TU Delft    \n  Pre-print \n 14:30   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Automated Test Generation for Integration Testing  AST 2025   \n Elson Kurian University of Milano Bicocca  , Luca Guglielmo Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca  , Pietro Braione University of Milano-Bicocca  , Giovanni Denaro University of Milano - Bicocca \n 15:00   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Automated Test Generation from Program Documentation Encoded in Code Comments  AST 2025   \n Giovanni Denaro University of Milano - Bicocca  , Luca Guglielmo Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca \n\n 15:30 - 16:00 | Break ICSE Catering  at Canada Hall 3 plus Foyer \n 15:30   \n 30m    \n Break | Monday Afternoon Break  ICSE Catering \n\n 16:00 - 17:30 | Quiet Room Monday 4PM ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 202 \n\n 16:00 - 17:30 | Session 3: Panel Discussion AST 2025  at 211 \n 16:00   \n 90m    \n Panel | Automated Software Testing for Sustainability and Resource Efficiency  AST 2025   \n Istvan David McMaster University / McMaster Centre for Software Certification (McSCert)  , Roberto Verdecchia University of Florence  , Bimpe Ayoola Dalhousie University  , Jari Porras LUT University  , Lina Marsso Polytechnique Montreal \n\n Tue 29 Apr   \n  \n Displayed time zone: Eastern Time (US & Canada)  change     \n\n 07:00 - 19:00 | Ready Room Tuesday ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 209 \n\n 09:00 - 10:30 | Conference Opening & Keynote 2 AST 2025  at 211 \n 09:00   \n 90m    \n Keynote | Learning-Based Testing: The Ease, the Impact, the Future  AST 2025   \n Tiziana Margaria University of Limerick and Lero - The Irish Software Research Centre \n\n 10:30 - 11:00 | Break ICSE Catering  at Canada Hall 3 plus Foyer \n 10:30   \n 30m    \n Break | Tuesday Morning Break  ICSE Catering \n\n 11:00 - 12:30 | Session 4: When and How to Test AST 2025  at 211 \n 11:00   \n 22m    \n Full-paper | An Adaptive Testing Approach Based on Field Data  AST 2025   \n Samira Santos da Silva Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI)  , Ricardo Caldas Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI)  , Patrizio Pelliccione Gran Sasso Science Institute, L'Aquila, Italy  , Antonia Bertolino National Research Council, Italy    \n  Pre-print \n 11:22   \n 22m    \n Full-paper | Exceptional Behaviors: How Frequently Are They Tested?

Infrastructures, software components, and applications aim to hide their increasing complexity in order to appear more human-centric. However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes keep demanding for the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA). Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decade. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of the test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud.  \n AST continues with a long record of international scientific forums on methods and solutions to automate software testing. This year AST is the 6th edition of a conference that was formerly organized as workshops since 2006. The conference promotes high quality research contributions on methods for software test automation, and original case studies reporting practices in this field. We invite contributions that focus on: i) lessons learned about experiments of automatic testing in practice; ii) experiences of the adoption of testing tools, methods and techniques; iii) best practices to follow in testing and their measurable consequences; and iv) theoretical approaches that are applicable to the industry in the context of AST.  \n Authors of the best papers presented at AST 2025 will be invited to submit an extension of their work for possible inclusion in a special issue in Software Testing, Verification, and Reliability (STVR) journal   \n Call for papers.  \n\n Dates    \n Mon 28 Apr 2025   \n Tue 29 Apr 2025   \n\n Plenary    \n Hide plenary sessions   \n\n  This program is tentative and subject to change.  \n  Program Display Configuration  \n   \n   Time Zone   \n   \n The program is currently displayed in (GMT-04:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada)  .

There will also be AV technicians to help if needed.  \n You do not need to use the Ready Room: You have several choices: You can upload your presentation from your own computer in advance of your session (days in advance even) at the Contact 1 website (you will be sent a link). Or you can plug your computer in using an HDMI cable when you are starting your presentation. This last option is available but not recommended, since it increases the chance of delays.  \n There will be some tables and couches in the Ready Room where you can get work done, or have small get-togethers with people.  \n This room will not be ‘quiet’. If you want a quiet place to work or chill out (library quiet, no talking) then Room 209 will be available much of the time.  \n The Ready Room will also have some poster boards. \n\n 09:00 - 10:30 | Quiet Room Monday 9AM ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 202 \n\n 09:00 - 10:30 | Conference Opening & Keynote AST 2025  at 211 \n 09:00   \n 90m    \n Keynote | Personalized Fuzzing  AST 2025   \n Andreas Zeller CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security \n\n 10:30 - 11:00 | Break ICSE Catering  at Canada Hall 3 plus Foyer \n 10:30   \n 30m    \n Break | Monday Morning Break  ICSE Catering \n\n 11:00 - 12:30 | Quiet Room Monday 11AM ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 202 \n\n 11:00 - 12:30 | Session 1: LLM for Testing AST 2025  at 211 \n 11:00   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Acceptance Test Generation with Large Language Models: An Industrial Case Study  AST 2025   \n Margarida Ferreira University of Porto and Critical TechWorks  , Luís Viegas University of Porto and Critical TechWorks  , João Pascoal Faria Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto and INESC TEC  , Bruno Lima Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto & LIACC \n 11:30   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | AsserT5: Test Assertion Generation Using a Fine-Tuned Code Language Model  AST 2025   \n Severin Primbs University of Passau  , Benedikt Fein University of Passau  , Gordon Fraser University of Passau    \n  Pre-print \n 12:00   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Simulink Mutation Testing using CodeBERT  AST 2025   \n Jingfan Zhang University of Ottawa  , Delaram Ghobari University of Ottawa  , Mehrdad Sabetzadeh University of Ottawa  , Shiva Nejati University of Ottawa    \n  Pre-print \n\n 12:30 - 14:00 | Lunch ICSE Catering  at Canada Hall 3 plus Foyer \n 12:30   \n 90m    \n Lunch | Monday Lunch  ICSE Catering \n\n 14:00 - 15:30 | Quiet Room Monday 2PM ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 202 \n\n 14:00 - 15:30 | Session 2: Test Generation AST 2025  at 211 \n 14:00   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Automated Test-Case Generation for REST APIs Using Model Inference Search Heuristic  AST 2025   \n Clinton Cao Delft University of Technology  , Annibale Panichella Delft University of Technology  , Sicco Verwer TU Delft    \n  Pre-print \n 14:30   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Automated Test Generation for Integration Testing  AST 2025   \n Elson Kurian University of Milano Bicocca  , Luca Guglielmo Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca  , Pietro Braione University of Milano-Bicocca  , Giovanni Denaro University of Milano - Bicocca \n 15:00   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Automated Test Generation from Program Documentation Encoded in Code Comments  AST 2025   \n Giovanni Denaro University of Milano - Bicocca  , Luca Guglielmo Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca \n\n 15:30 - 16:00 | Break ICSE Catering  at Canada Hall 3 plus Foyer \n 15:30   \n 30m    \n Break | Monday Afternoon Break  ICSE Catering \n\n 16:00 - 17:30 | Quiet Room Monday 4PM ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 202 \n\n 16:00 - 17:30 | Session 3: Panel Discussion AST 2025  at 211 \n 16:00   \n 90m    \n Panel | Automated Software Testing for Sustainability and Resource Efficiency  AST 2025   \n Istvan David McMaster University / McMaster Centre for Software Certification (McSCert)  , Roberto Verdecchia University of Florence  , Bimpe Ayoola Dalhousie University  , Jari Porras LUT University  , Lina Marsso Polytechnique Montreal \n\n Tue 29 Apr   \n  \n Displayed time zone: Eastern Time (US & Canada)  change     \n\n 07:00 - 19:00 | Ready Room Tuesday ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 209 \n\n 09:00 - 10:30 | Conference Opening & Keynote 2 AST 2025  at 211 \n 09:00   \n 90m    \n Keynote | Learning-Based Testing: The Ease, the Impact, the Future  AST 2025   \n Tiziana Margaria University of Limerick and Lero - The Irish Software Research Centre \n\n 10:30 - 11:00 | Break ICSE Catering  at Canada Hall 3 plus Foyer \n 10:30   \n 30m    \n Break | Tuesday Morning Break  ICSE Catering \n\n 11:00 - 12:30 | Session 4: When and How to Test AST 2025  at 211 \n 11:00   \n 22m    \n Full-paper | An Adaptive Testing Approach Based on Field Data  AST 2025   \n Samira Santos da Silva Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI)  , Ricardo Caldas Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI)  , Patrizio Pelliccione Gran Sasso Science Institute, L'Aquila, Italy  , Antonia Bertolino National Research Council, Italy    \n  Pre-print \n 11:22   \n 22m    \n Full-paper | Exceptional Behaviors: How Frequently Are They Tested?

If you want to listen to a stream or music., please wear headphones. Please do not talk to others or participate in a virtual event where you may have to talk.  \n This room is especially designed to be helpful for the neurodiverse community, who may need to recharge their social battery, or simply get away from noise.  \n Some people may choose to pray in this room. Please respect them when they do this. There is also Room 2A set aside for this purpose.  \n Note that the Ready Room (209) is another room where you can hang out and talk to others or get work done.  \n\n  Close   \n\n Accepted Papers  \n  \n Title \n Acceptance Test Generation with Large Language Models: An Industrial Case Study AST 2025   \n Margarida Ferreira , Luís Viegas , João Pascoal Faria , Bruno Lima \n Adaptive Probabilistic Operational Testing for Large Language Models Evaluation AST 2025   \n Ali Asgari , Antonio Guerriero , Roberto Pietrantuono , Stefano Russo \n An Adaptive Testing Approach Based on Field Data AST 2025   \n Samira Santos da Silva , Ricardo Caldas , Patrizio Pelliccione , Antonia Bertolino   \n  Pre-print \n A New Era in Software Security: Towards Self-Healing Software via Large Language Models and Formal Verification AST 2025   \n Norbert Tihanyi , Yiannis Charalambous , Ridhi Jain , Mohamed Amine Ferrag , Lucas C.

Infrastructures, software components, and applications aim to hide their increasing complexity in order to appear more human-centric. However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes and methods keep demanding for the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA).  \n Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decades. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of the test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud.  \n The Automation of Software Test (AST) conference continues with a long record of international scientific forums on methods and solutions to automate software testing. In 2025, AST is in its 6th edition of a conference that was formerly organized as workshops since 2006. The conference promotes high-quality research contributions on methods for software test automation, and original case studies reporting practices in this field. We invite contributions that focus on: i) lessons learned about experiments of automatic testing in practice; ii) experiences of the adoption of testing tools, methods and techniques; iii) best practices to follow in testing and their measurable consequences; and iv) theoretical approaches that are applicable to the industry in the context of AST.  \n Our theme for this year is “Adapting test automation to the AI era including sustainability and emerging challenges” with special sessions on test automation for AI, sustainability, and AI testing education and training.  \n Topics of Interest  \n Submissions on the AST 2025 theme are especially encouraged, but papers on other topics relevant to the automation of software tests are also welcome. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:  \n AI for Automated Software Testing \n  Testing of AI-based systems \n  Effective testing through explainable AI \n  Education to software testing with the advent of AI-based technology \n  Automated software testing for sustainability, resource efficiency, energy consumption \n  Codeless and low code test automation \n  Test Automation in Software Process and Evolution, DevOps, Agile, CI/CD flows \n  Test-driven development \n  Model-based testing \n  Formal methods, model checking and theories for testing and test automation \n  Test case generation based on formal, semi-formal and AI models \n  Theoretical foundations and methods for test automation \n  Standardization of test languages, processes and tools \n  Security, performance, and robustness testing \n  Functional, interoperability, and conformance testing \n  Usability and user experience testing \n  Software simulation and automated software testing \n  Testing of embedded, reactive and object-oriented systems \n  Test automation of large complex systems \n  Testing cyber physical systems \n  Testing cloud and web systems and services \n  Product line testing \n  Testing anomaly detectors \n  Metrics for testing - test effectiveness, efficiency, test coverage \n  Testing tools \n  Testing in different industry domains including healthcare, energy, finance, etc. \n  Important Dates  \n Submission: 9 November 2024  \n Notification: 12 January 2025 ( UPDATED  )  \n Final version: 31 January 2025  \n Conference: 28-29 April 2025  \n Organizers  \n Andy Zaidman, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands (General Chair)  \n Francesca Lonetti, ISTI-CNR, Italy (Program Co-Chair)  \n Ina Schieferdecker, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany (Program Co-Chair)  \n Rajesh Subramanyan, Stealth Startup & University of Washington, USA (Program Co-Chair)  \n\n Submission  \n   \n Submission Details  \n Three types of submissions are invited for both research and industry:  \n Regular Papers (up to 10 pages plus 2 additional pages of references) Research Paper Industrial Case Study \n  Short Papers (up to 4 pages plus 1 additional page of references) Research Paper Industrial Case Study Doctoral Student Research \n  Industrial Abstracts (up to 2 pages for all materials) \n  The submission website is: https://ast2025.hotcrp.com/  \n All submissions must adhere to the following requirements: The page limit is strict (10 pages plus 2 additional pages of references for full papers; 4 pages plus 1 additional page of references for short papers; 2 pages for all materials in case of industrial abstracts).

Or you can plug your computer in using an HDMI cable when you are starting your presentation. This last option is available but not recommended, since it increases the chance of delays.  \n There will be some tables and couches in the Ready Room where you can get work done, or have small get-togethers with people.  \n This room will not be ‘quiet’. If you want a quiet place to work or chill out (library quiet, no talking) then Room 209 will be available much of the time.  \n The Ready Room will also have some poster boards. \n\n 09:00 - 10:30 | Quiet Room Monday 9AM ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 202 \n\n 09:00 - 10:30 | Conference Opening & Keynote AST 2025  at 211 \n 09:00   \n 90m    \n Keynote | Personalized Fuzzing  AST 2025   \n Andreas Zeller CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security \n\n 10:30 - 11:00 | Break ICSE Catering  at Canada Hall 3 plus Foyer \n 10:30   \n 30m    \n Break | Monday Morning Break  ICSE Catering \n\n 11:00 - 12:30 | Quiet Room Monday 11AM ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 202 \n\n 11:00 - 12:30 | Session 1: LLM for Testing AST 2025  at 211 \n 11:00   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Acceptance Test Generation with Large Language Models: An Industrial Case Study  AST 2025   \n Margarida Ferreira University of Porto and Critical TechWorks  , Luís Viegas University of Porto and Critical TechWorks  , João Pascoal Faria Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto and INESC TEC  , Bruno Lima Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto & LIACC \n 11:30   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | AsserT5: Test Assertion Generation Using a Fine-Tuned Code Language Model  AST 2025   \n Severin Primbs University of Passau  , Benedikt Fein University of Passau  , Gordon Fraser University of Passau    \n  Pre-print \n 12:00   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Simulink Mutation Testing using CodeBERT  AST 2025   \n Jingfan Zhang University of Ottawa  , Delaram Ghobari University of Ottawa  , Mehrdad Sabetzadeh University of Ottawa  , Shiva Nejati University of Ottawa    \n  Pre-print \n\n 12:30 - 14:00 | Lunch ICSE Catering  at Canada Hall 3 plus Foyer \n 12:30   \n 90m    \n Lunch | Monday Lunch  ICSE Catering \n\n 14:00 - 15:30 | Quiet Room Monday 2PM ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 202 \n\n 14:00 - 15:30 | Session 2: Test Generation AST 2025  at 211 \n 14:00   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Automated Test-Case Generation for REST APIs Using Model Inference Search Heuristic  AST 2025   \n Clinton Cao Delft University of Technology  , Annibale Panichella Delft University of Technology  , Sicco Verwer TU Delft    \n  Pre-print \n 14:30   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Automated Test Generation for Integration Testing  AST 2025   \n Elson Kurian University of Milano Bicocca  , Luca Guglielmo Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca  , Pietro Braione University of Milano-Bicocca  , Giovanni Denaro University of Milano - Bicocca \n 15:00   \n 30m    \n Full-paper | Automated Test Generation from Program Documentation Encoded in Code Comments  AST 2025   \n Giovanni Denaro University of Milano - Bicocca  , Luca Guglielmo Università degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca \n\n 15:30 - 16:00 | Break ICSE Catering  at Canada Hall 3 plus Foyer \n 15:30   \n 30m    \n Break | Monday Afternoon Break  ICSE Catering \n\n 16:00 - 17:30 | Quiet Room Monday 4PM ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 202 \n\n 16:00 - 17:30 | Session 3: Panel Discussion AST 2025  at 211 \n 16:00   \n 90m    \n Panel | Automated Software Testing for Sustainability and Resource Efficiency  AST 2025   \n Istvan David McMaster University / McMaster Centre for Software Certification (McSCert)  , Roberto Verdecchia University of Florence  , Bimpe Ayoola Dalhousie University  , Jari Porras LUT University  , Lina Marsso Polytechnique Montreal \n\n Tue 29 Apr   \n  \n Displayed time zone: Eastern Time (US & Canada)  change     \n\n 07:00 - 19:00 | Ready Room Tuesday ICSE Social, Networking and Special Rooms  at 209 \n\n 09:00 - 10:30 | Conference Opening & Keynote 2 AST 2025  at 211 \n 09:00   \n 90m    \n Keynote | Learning-Based Testing: The Ease, the Impact, the Future  AST 2025   \n Tiziana Margaria University of Limerick and Lero - The Irish Software Research Centre \n\n 10:30 - 11:00 | Break ICSE Catering  at Canada Hall 3 plus Foyer \n 10:30   \n 30m    \n Break | Tuesday Morning Break  ICSE Catering \n\n 11:00 - 12:30 | Session 4: When and How to Test AST 2025  at 211 \n 11:00   \n 22m    \n Full-paper | An Adaptive Testing Approach Based on Field Data  AST 2025   \n Samira Santos da Silva Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI)  , Ricardo Caldas Gran Sasso Science Institute (GSSI)  , Patrizio Pelliccione Gran Sasso Science Institute, L'Aquila, Italy  , Antonia Bertolino National Research Council, Italy    \n  Pre-print \n 11:22   \n 22m    \n Full-paper | Exceptional Behaviors: How Frequently Are They Tested?

Infrastructures, software components, and applications aim to hide their increasing complexity in order to appear more human-centric. However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes and methods keep demanding for the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA).  \n Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decades. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of the test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud.  \n The Automation of Software Test (AST) conference continues with a long record of international scientific forums on methods and solutions to automate software testing. In 2025, AST is in its 6th edition of a conference that was formerly organized as workshops since 2006. The conference promotes high-quality research contributions on methods for software test automation, and original case studies reporting practices in this field. We invite contributions that focus on: i) lessons learned about experiments of automatic testing in practice; ii) experiences of the adoption of testing tools, methods and techniques; iii) best practices to follow in testing and their measurable consequences; and iv) theoretical approaches that are applicable to the industry in the context of AST.  \n Our theme for this year is “Adapting test automation to the AI era including sustainability and emerging challenges” with special sessions on test automation for AI, sustainability, and AI testing education and training.  \n Topics of Interest  \n Submissions on the AST 2025 theme are especially encouraged, but papers on other topics relevant to the automation of software tests are also welcome. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to the following:  \n AI for Automated Software Testing \n  Testing of AI-based systems \n  Effective testing through explainable AI \n  Education to software testing with the advent of AI-based technology \n  Automated software testing for sustainability, resource efficiency, energy consumption \n  Codeless and low code test automation \n  Test Automation in Software Process and Evolution, DevOps, Agile, CI/CD flows \n  Test-driven development \n  Model-based testing \n  Formal methods, model checking and theories for testing and test automation \n  Test case generation based on formal, semi-formal and AI models \n  Theoretical foundations and methods for test automation \n  Standardization of test languages, processes and tools \n  Security, performance, and robustness testing \n  Functional, interoperability, and conformance testing \n  Usability and user experience testing \n  Software simulation and automated software testing \n  Testing of embedded, reactive and object-oriented systems \n  Test automation of large complex systems \n  Testing cyber physical systems \n  Testing cloud and web systems and services \n  Product line testing \n  Testing anomaly detectors \n  Metrics for testing - test effectiveness, efficiency, test coverage \n  Testing tools \n  Testing in different industry domains including healthcare, energy, finance, etc. \n  Important Dates  \n Submission: 9 November 2024  \n Notification: 12 January 2025 ( UPDATED  )  \n Final version: 31 January 2025  \n Conference: 28-29 April 2025  \n Organizers  \n Andy Zaidman, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands (General Chair)  \n Francesca Lonetti, ISTI-CNR, Italy (Program Co-Chair)  \n Ina Schieferdecker, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany (Program Co-Chair)  \n Rajesh Subramanyan, Stealth Startup & University of Washington, USA (Program Co-Chair)  \n\n Submission  \n   \n Submission Details  \n Three types of submissions are invited for both research and industry:  \n Regular Papers (up to 10 pages plus 2 additional pages of references) Research Paper Industrial Case Study \n  Short Papers (up to 4 pages plus 1 additional page of references) Research Paper Industrial Case Study Doctoral Student Research \n  Industrial Abstracts (up to 2 pages for all materials) \n  The submission website is: https://ast2025.hotcrp.com/  \n All submissions must adhere to the following requirements: The page limit is strict (10 pages plus 2 additional pages of references for full papers; 4 pages plus 1 additional page of references for short papers; 2 pages for all materials in case of industrial abstracts).

The following sections contains detailed instructions on formatting your document and completing the submission process, as well as a description of how the review process works and how to prepare for your presentation at the conference if your paper is accepted.    \n  \n  I. Originality & Plagiarism Policy    \n Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for this conference.  \n   \n  Registered and Presented papers will be submitted for possible inclusion into IEEE Xplore as well as other Abstracting and Indexing (A&I) databases.  \n   \n  Papers submitted to ATSIP’2024 will be automatically checked for plagiarism (including self-plagiarism) using electronic databases, including other submissions to the same conference. Severe cases of plagiarism will result in rejection of a manuscript. The most common mistake by authors is cutting and pasting from previous versions of manuscripts describing earlier stages of the same work. The following link provides helpful and detailed guidelines for identifying and handling instances of plagiarism  \n\n http://www.ieee.org/publications_standards/publications/rights/plagiarism.html    \n\n  II. Paper Format      \n Language:   Submitted papers should be written in the English language \n  Number of Pages  :  6 pages max, including figures, tables & references. Papers longer than 6 pages will not be reviewed. \n  Page Size   : A4 format \n  Page Numbering  :  Off \n  File Format  :   PDF only \n  File Size:    4MB maximum \n  Abstract:     It is important that the abstract be a meaningful description of your paper. \n  Keywords:    Choose from 3 to 8  keywords. \n  Color:    Use of color is encouraged, but since readers will usually print the papers in black and white  , it is the author’s responsibility to ensure that all figures/plots can be printed and understood in black and white. Reviewers are not required to read your paper in color. \n  III. Templates      \n To help ensure correct formatting, please use the standard IEEE Transactions templates for Microsoft Word or LaTeX formats found the link below as templates for your submission.      \n https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html    \n As the page indicates, IEEE has recently revised their LaTeX templates. If you had previously downloaded these templates please revisit this site to access the latest version.      \n  \n  IV. Single-blind review process      \n All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through a Single-blind reviewing process   : authors declare their names and affiliations in the manuscript for the reviewers to see, but reviewers do not know each other's identities, nor do the authors receive information about who has reviewed their manuscript.      \n V. Online Regular Paper Submission      \n The online paper submission system is now open. Submitted papers should be uploaded through the Easychair conference management system.  \n  To submit your paper, please follow the instructions below.       \n    1. If you don't have an EasyChair account, please register to obtain an account using a valid e-mail address.     \n  \n  https://www.easychair.org/account/signin    \n  \n  2. Then, log in to EasyChair using the following link:   \n  \n  https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atsip2024    \n  \n  3. Upon a successful login, you will see the Main Interface. Click on 'New Submission'.   \n\n  4. Fill out the information on the corresponding author, co-authors, title, and abstract.     \n  \n  5. Click on Choose File to select the file to upload and make sure that it is in  only adobe acrobat   format (.pdf).     \n  \n  6. Finally, press the 'Submit Paper' button to complete the submission. You will receive a confirmation e-mail that your submission was successful    \n\n © ATMS lab | all Rights Reserved   \n   \n  ",

The current state-of-the-art exact VRP algorithms employ a combination of column generation and cut separation, known as Branch-Cut-and-Price (BCP) algorithms. This presentation examines notable recent contributions made by various researchers in the field. Additionally, the talk showcases VRPSolver, a very flexible package that implements a BCP algorithm that achieves outstanding performance for many routing, packing, and scheduling problems. Furthermore, VRPSolverEasy, a recent Python application built on top of VRPSolver, is introduced. While heuristic algorithms are likely to remain the dominant approach for practical routing, the availability of exact solutions for reasonably sized instances opens up new possibilities.  \n\n IMPORTANT DATES  \n\n Submission deadline: | Sunday June 30  July 7  , 2024 (AoE) \n Notification to authors: | July 31  August 7th, 2024 \n Camera ready submission: | August 7  August 14th, 2024 \n Symposium: | September 5-6, 2024 \n\n TOPICS  \n\n The symposium welcomes but is not limited to papers addressing the following topics:  \n\n Congestion Modelling and Reduction \n  Crew and Duty Scheduling \n  Demand Forecasting \n  Delay Management \n  Design of Pricing Systems \n  Electromobility \n  Infrastructure Planning \n  Intelligent Transportation Systems \n  Models for User Behaviour \n  Line Planning \n  Mobile Applications for Transport \n  Mobility-as-a-Service \n  Multi-modal Transport Optimization \n  Route Planning in Road and Public Transit Networks \n  Rostering \n  Timetable Generation \n  Tourist Tour Planning \n  Traffic Guidance \n  Vehicle Routing \n  Vehicle Scheduling \n\n The symposium welcomes but is not limited to papers applying and advancing the following techniques: Algorithmic Game Theory, Approximation Algorithms, Combinatorial Optimization, Graph and Network Algorithms, Heuristics and Meta-heuristics, Mathematical Programming, Methods for the Integration of Planning Stages, Online and Real-time Algorithms, Simulation Tools, Stochastic and Robust Optimization.  \n\n SUBMISSIONS  \n\n Authors are invited to submit high-quality manuscripts reporting original unpublished research in the topics related to the symposium.

However, decades after the advent of computers, we are now reconsidering their existence against the backdrop of the rapid expansion and evolution of information technology and its profound impact on industry, the economy, daily life, and society.  \n  \n The quantum acceleration of information processing and communication has had a profound impact on the design of all kinds of artifacts, production techniques, management systems, and usage patterns, and has already surpassed the traditional concept of design and its support methods. By considering social activities and human organizations as forms of information processing, we can reconsider architecture and cities as information systems that have been constructed, accumulated, and acted upon. Viewing architecture and cities through this lens suggests that real and virtual spaces should not be seen as opposing entities, but rather as complementary components within a unified system.  \n  \n In other words, information may be architecture. With “Architectural Informatics” as the theme of CAADRIA's 30th anniversary, we would like to reexamine the fundamental existence of architecture in the age of information technology.  \n  \n ​We invite original high-quality papers presenting current computer-aided architectural design research, accommodating a broad spectrum of approaches ranging from speculative, informal investigations to conventional scientific research, including but not limited to the following topics:  \n ​   \n Artificial intelligence, neural networks and machine learning \n  Building Information Modeling (BIM) \n  City Information Modeling (CIM) \n  Collective, collaborative & interdisciplinary design \n  Computational design research & education \n  Design cognition and human-computer interaction \n  Disrupted practices, resilience, and social sustainability \n  Environmental and ecological performance \n  Generative, algorithmic & evolutionary design \n  Digital Heritage \n  Interactive environments \n  Material systems, processes and assembly \n  Practice-based design research \n  Robotics, digital fabrication and construction \n  Simulation, visualisation and impact projection \n  Theory, philosophy & methodology of computational design research \n  Urban analytics, big data analysis and smart cities \n  AR / VR / XR \n  Application of technology in the context of the Asia-Pacific Region \n   \n Paper acceptance will be subject to a two-stage reviewing process, based on an initial abstract review and a later double-blind peer review of full-length manuscripts. The paper publication will be subject to review acceptance, compliance with submission deadlines and formatting guidelines, and to payment of the conference registration fee. Please kindly note that multiple submissions are subject to multiple registrations.  \n ​   \n\n © CAADRIA2025 Organizing committee     \n\n  ",

Through the mutual exchange on classic core topics of database and information systems technology, but also on current topics such as data science, data protection, the connection with machine learning and highly scalable data processing, database research is constantly being advanced.  \n Tracks and Topics  \n At the BTW conference, both classic and emerging questions from the database area and their possible solutions will be discussed. To ease orientation, contributions will be organized in five tracks. Since many papers will address aspects from several tracks, authors will be able to assign their paper to more than one track. Papers by researchers and practitioners covering basic research, applied research or applications are equally welcome in all tracks  \n Database Technologies and Systems.  \n Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  \n Query processing and optimization \n  Storage and physical database design \n  Indexing, access methods \n  Data management on modern hardware \n  Transaction processing and concurrency control \n  Data warehousing and analytics \n  Implementation and architecture of database systems \n  Parallel, distributed, and cloud-based data processing \n  NoSQL systems (e.g. systems for data streams, web and graph data) \n  Performance analysis and benchmarking \n  Text, Semi-structured Data and IR.  \n Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  \n User aspects of retrieval applications \n  System and foundational aspects \n  Retrieval models, query processing and ranking, efficiency and scalability \n  Machine learning, deep learning and neural models \n  Text mining and text analysis \n  Natural language processing \n  Applications such as web and social media search, professional and domain-specific search \n  Evaluation research of retrieval systems, users, and/or applications \n  Data Engineering, Data Science & Machine Learning.  \n Topics of interest include but are not limited to:  \n Green-IT, sustainability, data ethics, and FAIR data management \n  Data analytics, mining, intelligent systems and machine learning \n  Data transformation, integration, linkage and interoperability \n  Data preparation, cleaning, profiling, and visualization \n  Data provenance, versioning, and reasoning \n  Data streaming and dataflow engines \n  Batch- and ETL-processing systems \n  Schema engineering, evolution, and optimization \n  Metadata management and recording \n  Data processing on modern hardware, distributed systems, and cloud \n  Semantic data and knowledge bases \n  Benchmarks for data engineering algorithms and workflows \n  Database Languages & Theory.  \n All topics of the other tracks are in principle suitable for Databases Languages and Theory  , but this track is primarily interested in work focusing on foundational aspects concerning the principles and theory of data management.  \n Innovations and Use Cases.  \n The Innovations and Use Cases  track at BTW 2025 invites contributions that showcase the interplay between advanced database technologies and their industrial applications. This track emphasizes papers that  \n bridge the gap between foundational database research and the innovative deployment of these technologies. \n  All topics of the other tracks are suitable for the Innovations and Use Cases  track if they have a particular focus on practical use cases. Beyond that we also encourage contributions on the following topics:  \n Implementation and architectural advancements of database systems, particularly for distributed and big data solutions. \n  Integration and performance optimization of database technologies in the cloud and in “as-a-service” models, with an emphasis on scalability and data management. \n  Application of Data Engineering, AI, machine learning methods, and language models within database systems to drive innovation and operational efficiency. \n  Exploration of data protection, security measures, and ethical considerations within industrial data systems, ensuring robustness and compliance. \n  Procedures  \n BTW 2025 aims to be as attractive as possible for authors and conference participants. For this purpose, we will continue or extend the new measures introduced with previous instances of BTW:  \n The review process will include a feedback phase, which allows authors to submit a revision letter. With this letter, they can address questions and criticisms from the reviewers and outline how they plan to revise their contribution to address reviewer comments. \n  The scientific program and the industrial program will be merged again at the conference; contributions from industry, application examples and innovative developments are very welcome and can either be assigned to any thematic track or submitted to the innovations track. \n  Upon submission, the authors will be asked to choose one or more tracks that best fit their paper. \n  The organization team encourages the authors of papers to ensure the repeatability and reproducibility of their experiments and analyses. It is therefore possible to subject accepted contributions to a reproducibility test. Successful contributions are distinguished accordingly in the program and in the proceedings. \n  Both long papers (original papers or review papers) and short papers (on current projects and ongoing research) can be submitted. Practical contributions are also qualified for both long and short papers. Submissions should be written in English. English is also recommended as the lecture language during the conference.  \n The contributions must correspond to the layout specifications of the conference proceedings (LNI style, see https://gi.de/service/publikationen/lni ). The page limit (not including references) is 20 pages for long papers and 10 pages for short papers. Submissions exceeding the page limit will be rejected without review. The accepted papers will be published in the Lecture Notes in Informatics  (LNI) of the GI.  \n Submissions will be reviewed according to the following criteria:  \n Short papers: thematic fit to the conference, degree of innovation, convincing presentation. \n  Long articles: as above, as well as a careful evaluation and/or proof. \n  Practical contributions: thematic fit to the conference, degree of innovation, convincing presentation, degree of use/impact. \n  Submissions via https://www.conftool.com/btw2025/ from July 2024 onwards. All research track papers are subject to single-anonymity requirement.  \n Deadlines  \n Submission deadline for abstracts is September 13, 2024.   \n  Papers are due September 20, 2024  October 2, 2024.  \n (11:59 pm, GMT+1)  \n\n  Teilen   tweet \n  teilen \n  mitteilen \n  mail \n\n  © 2025 Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. \n    \n Impressum \n  Datenschutz \n  Problem melden \n\n Cookie Einstellungen  \n Auf unserer Webseite werden Cookies verwendet.

SEDE 2025 aims at facilitating cross-fertilization of ideas in Software and Data Engineering, and hence especially encourages high-quality research integrating both domains. SEDE-2025 includes a Best Paper Award to be presented during the conference banquet. Publication and Indexing:  \n  \n  Accepted papers in SEDE-2025 will be published by Springer Nature  . Proceedings will be submitted to Web of Science and will be indexed in Scopus, EI Engineering, DBLP, Google Scholar, Conference Proceedings Citation Index (CPCI), ACM Digital Library, IO-Port, MathSciNet and Zentralblatt MATH. The submitted manuscript (no page limit) should closely reflect the final paper as it will appear in the proceedings published by Springer Nature. The formatting templates (LaTex and Word) can be found on Springer Nature’s website at https://www.springer.com/kr/authors-editors/conference-proceedings/conference-proceedings-guidelines.  \n The submitted manuscripts are peer reviewed (single blind). Each paper will be reviewed by at least two experts in the area. After the conference, you may submit an extended version of your paper for possible publication in the ISCA journal.  \n Important Dates:  \n  \n Paper Submission Deadline | May 30, 2025 \n Notification of Acceptance | July 15, 2025 \n Registration due: | August 15, 2025 \n Camera-Ready Final Manuscript | August 15, 2025 \n  \n ****************************************************************************************  Conference Chair  \n Dr. Nick Rahimi   \n  University of Southern Mississippi, USA  \n  nick.rahimi@usm.edu  \n   \n Program Chair  \n Dr. Venkatasivakumar Margapuri   \n  Villanova University, USA  \n  vmargapu@villanova.edu | Program Chair  \n Dr. Noor Amiri   \n  University of Alabama, USA  \n  noor.amiri@ua.edu \n  \n ****************************************************************************************  Program Committee:  \n Abhay Paroha, Birla Institute of Tech.& Science   \n   \n Mirsalar Kamari, University of Southern Mississippi   \n   \n Karan Gupta, SunPower Corporation   \n   \n Saydul Akbar Murad, University of Southern Mississippi   \n   \n Takaaki Goto, Toyo University   \n   \n Tamer Aldwairi, Temple University   \n   \n Saleh Alnaeli, University of Wisconsin   \n   \n Maral Azizi, East Carolina University   \n   \n Silvia Cristea, Anglia Ruskin University   \n   \n Lei Yang, University of Nevada   \n   \n Xudong He, Florida International University   \n   \n Vic Grout, Glyndwr University,   \n   \n Somenath Chakraborty - West Virginia University   \n   \n Antoine Bossard - Kanagawa University   \n   \n Xudong He- Southern Illinois University Carbondale   \n   \n Bingyang Wei, Texas Christian University   \n   \n Nic Herndon, East Carolina University   \n   \n Mejid Memari, Utah Valley University   \n   \n Ning Yang- Southern Illinois University Carbondale   \n   \n Chinmay Rajguru, GKN Aerospace   \n   \n Jose Martinez Cruz, University of Southern Mississippi   \n   \n Wei Dai, Purdue University Northwest   \n   \n Robert Stewart, Kansas State University   \n   \n Md.

The conference will also include satellite workshops and tutorials.   \n\n Submission Instructions    \n\n All submissions will be handled electronically via the conference’s CMT Website  at the following link:   \n https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICIAPconf2025   \n Authors can  download  the templa  te, together   with the  instructions  , from the following link  :   \n\n Template Download    \n\n In addition, authors who want to write their manuscripts on Overleaf, can use this template:   \n\n Overleaf Template    \n\n The maximum number of pages is  12 including references  .   \n Papers will be selected through a  double-blind  review process, taking into account originality, significance, clarity, soundness, relevance and technical contents.   \n Each submission will be managed by two Area Chairs and reviewed by at least three reviewers.   \n Accepted papers will be included in the ICIAP 2025 Conference Proceedings, which will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (LNCS).   \n\n Additional Author Guidelines   \n They are inherited from other conferences such a CVPR and ICCV.   \n Double blind review:  ICIAP25 reviewing is  double blind  , in that authors do not know the names of the area chairs or reviewers for their papers, and the area chairs/reviewers cannot, beyond a reasonable doubt, infer the names of the authors from the submission and the additional material.  Do not provide information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments  (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs) or in any other part of the paper. Please, use the provide template above properly anonymized. Also  do not provide links to websites that identify the authors even github repository etc  . Violation of any of these guidelines may lead to rejection without review.   \n Dual submissions:  The goals of ICIAP25 are to publish exciting  new work  for the first time and to avoid duplicating the effort of reviewers. By registering or submitting a manuscript to ICIAP25, the authors acknowledge that it has not been previously published or accepted for publication in substantially similar form in any peer-reviewed venue including journal, conference or workshop, or archival forum. Furthermore, no publication substantially similar in content (defined as having 20 percent or more overlap) has been or will be registered or submitted to this or another conference, workshop, or journal during the review period. Violation of any of these conditions will lead to rejection, and will be reported to the other venue to which the submission was sent.   \n A publication, for the purposes of this policy, is defined to be a written work longer than four pages (excluding references) that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, was accepted. In particular, this definition of publication does not depend upon whether such an accepted written work appears in a formal proceedings or whether the organizers declare that such work “counts as a publication.”   \n arXiv preprints  : Under the above definition, arXiv preprints and university technical reports are  not  considered as publications. However, peer-reviewed workshop papers are considered as publications if their length is more than four pages (excluding references), even if they do not appear in a proceedings.   \n Note that a technical report (departmental, arXiv, etc.) version of the submission that is put up without any form of direct peer-review is NOT considered prior art and does NOT NEED to be cited in the submission; authors may cite such material, but cannot be penalized for not citing it.   \n\n Important Dates    \n\n First round paper submission & notification:   \n Submission: 14 February 2025 \n  Notification to Authors: 31 March 2025 \n   \n  Second round paper submission & notification:   \n Submission: 15 April 2025 \n  Notification to Authors: 15 June 2025 \n   \n  Conference:   \n Main conference: 17th - 19th September 2025 \n  Workshop and Tutorials: 15th - 16th September 2025 \n\n ICIAP 2025.

Information systems are applied in diverse contexts such as business process management, geographical information systems, and digital twins. The discipline continually evolves with trends in data science, machine learning, process mining, blockchain, mobile computing, sustainability, new regulations, cyber warfare, and military conflicts, all influencing its development. Each application context and emerging trend can lead to specializations within information systems engineering, necessitating various research traditions and needs. While beneficial, these specializations risk creating silos. Thus, the CAiSE conference, the premier event for this discipline, aims to prevent such fragmentation.  \n  Therefore, the theme for this year’s CAiSE conference is \"Bridging Silos.\" We encourage submissions that consider information systems engineering as a cohesive design involving multiple aspects. Submissions focused on specific specializations should explicitly position their results within the broader context to engage researchers across different areas and avoid silo formation.  \n\n BI Group Office  \n Erzherzog-Johann-Platz 1/194-3,  \n  1040 Vienna, Austria  \n  On the 1st floor  \n   Phone:   +43 (1) 58801-194301  \n  Email:   caise2025@big.tuwien.ac.at   \n   \n  CAiSE'25 conference:  \n   Vienna, Austria  \n   June 16-20, 2025    \n\n Subscribe  to Our Newsletter to get Important News & Reminders:  \n\n  Subscribe    \n\n Copyrights © by Business Informatics Group (BIG), TU Wien, 2024  \n  Privacy Policy   \n\n  caise2025@big.tuwien.ac.at ·   tel: +43 (1) 58801-194301",

The AIED 2025 conference, themed “AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future,” centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education.\",\n  \"Call for Papers\": \"# AIED 2025: Call for Papers\\n\\nThe 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025) will take place between **July 22-26, 2025 in Palermo, Italy**.\\n\\n## Theme\\n\\n“AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future”\\n\\nThe AIED 2025 conference centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education. By harnessing AI’s capacity to personalize learning experiences, educators can address the diverse needs of students and mitigate educational disparities, particularly among underserved and marginalized communities. This year’s theme also underscores the critical importance of ethical AI integration, ensuring that these advanced technologies are deployed responsibly to uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and privacy.\\n\\n## Tracks\\n\\nFor its main paper submissions, AIED 2025 solicits empirical and theoretical papers relating to both AI and education in the following lines of research and application, which represent our research tracks:\\n\\n*   Track 1 – AIED architectures and tools\\n*   Track 2 – Machine learning and Generative AI\\n*   Track 3 – Learning, teaching and pedagogy\\n*   Track 4 – Human-centered design and design-based research\\n*   Track 5 – Teaching AI\\n*   Track 6 – Ethics, Equity, and AIED in Society\\n*   Track 7 – Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modelling for Education\\n\\n## Submission Instructions\\n\\nWe invite the following main submissions to the conference, to be submitted directly to one of the above research tracks:\\n\\n*   **Full paper submission:** Full papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Full papers will be presented as long oral talks. Papers submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper.\\n*   **Short paper submission:** Short papers are expected to describe novel and interesting results to the overall community at large. The goal is to give novel but not necessarily mature work a chance to be seen by other researchers and practitioners and to be discussed at the conference. Short papers will be presented as short oral talks.\\n\\nSubmissions must follow Springer policies on publication (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process): [https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v](https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v).\\n\\n## Review Process\\n\\nAll submissions will be reviewed by three members of the program committee, followed by a metareview conducted by a senior member of the program committee (all double-masked) to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation.\\n\\n## Anonymity\\n\\nThe review process will be double-masked, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous. To this end, authors should:\\n\\n*   Eliminate all information that could lead to their identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, projects and/or systems)\\n*   Cite own prior work (if needed) in the third person\\n*   Eliminate acknowledgments and references to funding sources\\n\\n## Important Dates (full and short papers, main submission)\\n\\n*   **Submissions open:** December 20, 2024\\n*   **Abstracts due:** February 12, 2025\\n*   **Papers due:** February 19, 2025\\n*   **Notification of acceptance to authors:** April 2, 2025\\n*   **Camera-ready paper due:** May 2, 2025\"\n}",
