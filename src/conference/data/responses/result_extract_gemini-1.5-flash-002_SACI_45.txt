  "Call for Papers": "# SACI 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe IEEE 19th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI 2025) will be held on **May 19-24, 2025, in Budapest, Hungary, and Timişoara, Romania.**\n\n## Conference Focus\n\nSACI 2025 focuses on theory and application in the field of applied computational intelligence and informatics. The aim is to provide a platform for scientists, teachers, researchers, and students to publish their papers.\n\n## Tracks\n\nTopics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Computational Intelligence (track chair: Amir Mosavi)\n*   Intelligent Mechatronics (track chair: Radu-Emil Precup)\n*   Systems Engineering (track chair: Gábor Kertész)\n*   Intelligent Manufacturing Systems (track chair: László Horváth)\n*   Intelligent Robotics (track chair: Tamás Haidegger)\n*   Informatics (track chairs: Levente Kovács and Dániel András Drexler)\n\n## Special Sessions\n\n*   Special Session on PhD Student Research in Applied Informatics and Numerical Mathematics (organized by László Horváth)\n*   Special session on 5G and Cybersecurity (organized by Anna Bánáti and Miklós Kozlovszky)\n*   Special session on Digitalisation, Generation Research, Consumer Trends (organized by Mónika Garai-Fodor, Ágnes Csiszárik-Kocsir and János Varga)\n*   Special session on Nonlinear Mathematical Problems: Theory and Applications (organized by Alexandru Kristály)\n*   Special session on Applied Computational Tools in Research of the Built Environment (organized by Viktória Sugár and Zsuzsanna Fáczányi)\n\n## Plenary Speakers\n\n*   Prof. Dr. Peng Shi: Consensus and Formation Control for Multi-agent Systems\n*   Prof. Dr. László Gulácsi: AI-backed Advanced Medical Technology; Insights, Value, Innovation\n*   Prof. Shuai Li: Online Iterative Learning Enhanced Sim-to-Real Transfer for Efficient Manipulation of Deformable Objects\n*   Dr. Razvan Stanica: Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Mobile Traffic Data\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAuthors are welcome to submit original and unpublished papers.  Manuscripts must be prepared in 10-point font using the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column conference format. All papers must not exceed 8 pages and should be exported in PDF format and anonymous since IEEE AICCSA manages a double-blind review process.  The official language for the conference is English.\n\nThe papers must be submitted electronically on EasyChair.\n\n## Publication\n\nThe conference appears on the IEEE Conference Search. Conference proceedings that meet IEEE quality review standards may be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore), if the paper is not presented at the conference. 'Pay to publish' is not allowed by IEEE. So at least one author of a paper must show up and present the paper at the conference.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Full paper submission deadline:** February 7, 2025\n*   **Notification:** March 25, 2025\n*   **Final paper submission deadline:** April 23, 2025\n\n## Venues\n\n*   Óbuda University, Budapest\n*   Conference Center, Politehnica University of Timişoara\n\n## Organizers\n\n*   Óbuda University, Budapest, Hungary\n*   Politehnica University of Timişoara, Romania\n*   IEEE Chapter of SMC, Romania\n\n## Sponsors\n\n*   IEEE Hungary Section\n*   IEEE Chapter of SMC, Hungary\n*   IEEE Joint Chapter of IES and RAS, Hungary\n*   IEEE Control Systems Chapter, Hungary\n\n## Technical Co-sponsor\n\n*   IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society\n\n## In Technical Cooperation With\n\n*   IEEE Romania Section\n*   Romanian Academy - Section of Information Sciences and Technology\n*   ASTR - Academy of Technical Sciences, Romania\n*   Romanian Academy - Timisoara Branch\n*   John von Neumann Computer Society, Hungary\n*   Hungarian Fuzzy Association"
