  "Call for Papers": "# CASCADE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nCASCADE 2025, merging COSADE and CARDIS, focuses on cryptographic implementations, physical attacks, and embedded security. The conference will be held in **Saint-Ã‰tienne, France, from April 2 to 4, 2025**.\n\n## Conference Goal\n\nTo encourage research and exchanges on cryptographic implementations and embedded security challenges.\n\n## Target Audience\n\nContributions are welcomed from academia and industry, particularly from European PhD students.\n\n## Submission Details\n\nPapers can be submitted for review on two dates (one in the summer, one in the winter) for a single event in April.\n\n*   Submissions must be original, unpublished, anonymous, and not submitted to journals or other conferences or workshops with proceedings.\n*   Submissions must be written in English and should be at most 20 pages in total (excluding references and appendices), strictly following Springer's LNCS format.\n*   All submissions will be blind-refereed.\n*   Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper.\n*   The proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe program committee is seeking original papers on all aspects of design, development, deployment, evaluation, and application of cryptographic implementations and secure embedded systems. Submissions across a broad range of the development phase are encouraged, from exploratory research and proof-of-concept studies to practical applications and deployment. The program committee also invites survey and Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that assess, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as these papers offer significant value to our community. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n**Attacks and Countermeasures:**\n\n*   Physical and remote side-channel attacks & countermeasures\n*   Fault injection attacks and countermeasures\n*   Combined implementation attacks and countermeasures\n*   Micro-architectural attacks and countermeasures\n*   Hardware tampering and tamper-resistance\n*   Reverse engineering, (anti-)cloning, and (anti-)counterfeiting\n*   Hardware trojans and detection mechanisms\n*   Machine learning attacks and countermeasures\n\n**Efficient and Secure Cryptographic Implementations:**\n\n*   Hardware & software cryptographic implementations\n*   Algorithmic aspects of cryptographic implementations\n*   Hardware security mechanisms, physically unclonable functions, true random number generator\n*   Cryptographic implementations for RISC-V architectures\n*   Post-quantum cryptographic implementations\n*   Lightweight cryptography\n*   White-box cryptography\n\n**Tools and Methodologies:**\n\n*   Formal methods, techniques, and security models (for embedded security)\n*   Secure design and verification tools for hardware/software\n*   Security proofs in relevant models\n*   Computer-aided cryptographic engineering\n*   Domain-specific languages for cryptographic systems\n*   Automated and machine learning analysis frameworks\n*   Security evaluation platforms and tooling\n*   Open benchmarks for efficient and secure designs\n\n**Applications:**\n\n*   Applications of secure embedded systems\n*   Trusted execution environments and trusted computing platforms\n*   Security of the internet of things\n*   Security of RISC-V architectures\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 23:59:59 Anywhere on Earth (AoE).\n\n### Summer Submission\n\n*   **Paper submission:** September 17, 2024 - October 1, 2024\n*   **Result notification:** December 1, 2024 - November 29, 2024\n\n### Winter Submission\n\n*   **Paper submission:** December 17, 2024\n*   **Result notification:** February 22, 2025\n\n### Conference Dates\n\n*   **Conference dates:** April 2 to 4, 2025\n*   **Early registration deadline:** February 28, 2025\n\n## Stipends\n\nThanks to our generous sponsors, we are able to offer a limited number of registration fee waivers. Interested candidates should send a CV and a letter from their supervisor (for PhD students) as soon as possible to [vincent.grosso@cnrs.fr, pierre.louis.cayrel@univ-st-etienne.fr, b.colombier@univ-st-etienne.fr](mailto:vincent.grosso@cnrs.fr, pierre.louis.cayrel@univ-st-etienne.fr, b.colombier@univ-st-etienne.fr?subject=CASCADE%202025%20fee%20waiver) with the subject line \"CASCADE 2025 fee waiver\"."
