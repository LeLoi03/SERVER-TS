  "Call for Papers": "# ICTAI 2022: Call for Papers\n\nThe IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI) is a leading IEEE-CS annual scientific meeting.\n\n## Topics\n\nThe ICTAI encompasses all technical aspects of specifying, developing and evaluating the theoretical underpinnings and applied mechanisms of the AI-based components of computer tools such as algorithms, architectures and languages.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nThe submissions should contain original, high-quality, not submitted or published elsewhere work. Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format and should conform to IEEE specifications (single-spaced, double-column, 10-point font size, up to 8 pages).\n\nICTAI receives only full papers (up to 8 pages long). The Review Committee makes the decision of categorization of these papers based on their merit. More specifically, the categories are:\n\n*   Full papers based on their quality after review (8 pages long with regular registration plus one extra page, if needed, with extra cost $100 according to IEEE CS policy).\n*   Short papers based on their merit after review (5 pages long with regular registration PLUS ONE extra page, if needed, with extra cost $100 according to IEEE CS policy).\n\nFull papers and short papers will be published in the same proceedings and will be presented in the sessions in a mixed order.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   Paper Submission: August 8, 2022\n*   Paper Notification: September 12, 2022\n*   Camera Ready: September 30, 2022\n\n## Paper Presentation\n\nEach accepted paper should be presented by one of the authors and accompanied by at least one full registration fee payment, to guarantee publication in the proceedings.\n\n## Special Issues\n\nExtended versions of the best papers of the conference will be invited for publication in a special issue of the International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools (IJAIT) (SCI Indexed)."
