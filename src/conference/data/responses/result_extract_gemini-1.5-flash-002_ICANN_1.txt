  "Call for Papers": "# ICANN 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 34th International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN 2025) will take place in **Kaunas, Lithuania, from September 9 to September 12, 2025**.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nICANN 2025 invites prospective authors to submit original and innovative papers in the following areas:\n\n### AI and Machine Learning:\n\n*   Theory and Foundations of Neural Networks\n*   Novel Neural Network Architectures\n*   Topics in Neural Networks\n*   Large Language Models\n*   Explainable AI\n*   Machine Learning for Graphs\n*   Graph Neural Networks\n*   Clustering\n*   Reinforcement Learning\n*   New Topics in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n*   Neurorobotics\n\n### Neuroscience:\n\n*   Cognitive and Theoretical/Computational Neuroscience\n*   Brain-Inspired Computing\n*   Neuromorphic Systems\n*   Digital Twins and Virtual Brain models\n\n### Applications:\n\n*   Human-Computer Interaction\n*   Biosignal Processing\n*   Medicine and Physiology\n*   Speech and Language Processing\n*   Computer Vision\n*   Robotics\n*   Climate and Environment\n*   General Applications of Machine Learning\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAuthors are invited to submit:\n\n*   A full paper of 6-12 pages (including references) to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series with individual DOI.\n*   An extended abstract of maximum 2 pages to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, without individual indexing.\n\nPapers will undergo rigorous peer review; the Program Committee will make the final decision which papers will be included in the conference program. Selected papers will be assigned to oral sessions (15 minutes presentation + 5 minutes questions) and poster sessions, depending on the number of submissions; this assignment does in no way incur a judgment on paper quality. Note that presentation rules for workshops and special sessions may differ. All accepted papers will be published in the Springer LNCS series.\n\nPapers must be written in English language and must conform to the format defined in the Author’s Kit, available on the conference webpage at: [https://e-nns.org/icann2025/submission](https://e-nns.org/icann2025/submission)\n\nThe ICANN 2025 will be an in-person conference. At least one co-author of each paper must physically attend the conference in Kaunas to present the work.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   Opening of submission portal: February 15, 2025\n*   Deadline for full paper submission: March 29, 2025\n*   Notification of Acceptance or Rejection: May 15, 2025\n*   Camera-ready paper upload: June 1, 2025\n*   Deadline for author registration and early registration at early rate: June 15, 2025\n\nAll deadlines are anywhere on earth (AoE).\n\n## Call for Special Sessions, Workshops and Tutorials\n\nWe invite prospective organizers to submit Special Sessions, Workshops and Tutorials, until March 15th.
