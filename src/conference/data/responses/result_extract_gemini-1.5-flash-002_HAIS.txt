  "Call for Papers": "# HAIS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 20th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2025) will be held in **Salamanca, Spain, on October 16-17, 2025.**\n\nHAIS 2025 combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem-solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real-world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty, and vagueness, and high-dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both our knowledge and raw data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Special Sessions proposal deadline:** March 15, 2025\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** May 1, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notification:** May 15, 2025\n*   **Submission of revised papers:** June 1, 2025\n*   **Final version submission:** June 15, 2025\n*   **Payment deadline:** July 1, 2025\n*   **Conference dates:** October 16-17, 2025\n\n## Publication\n\nHAIS 2025 proceedings will be published by Springer in its series of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence – LNAI (part of its prestigious Lecture Notes in Computer Science – LNCS series). All submissions will be refereed by experts in the field based on originality, significance, quality, and clarity. Every submitted paper to HAIS’25 will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.  All accepted papers must be presented by one of the authors who must register for the conference and pay the fee. Papers must be prepared according to the LNCS-LNAI style template ([http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html](http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html)) and must be no more than twelve (12) pages long, including figures and bibliography. Additional pages (over 12 pages) will be charged 150 euros for each page.\n\n## Submission System\n\nThe submission system is available at: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hais2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hais2025)\n\n## Special Issues\n\nAll the accepted papers of HAIS/SOCO/CISIS conference (submitted both to the general track and the special sessions) will be considered for its possible inclusion in a special issue of the following journals:\n\n*   Neurocomputing (ELSEVIER). 2024 JCR Impact Factor: 5.5 –Q1\n\n## Call for Special Sessions\n\nSpecial sessions submission for SOCO’25, CISIS’25, and ICEUTE’25 proposals is open until March 15th.  Organizers of Special Sessions are responsible for:\n\n*   Selecting a topic of interest to conference delegates.\n*   Obtaining papers on this topic (normally a minimum of 5 for an invited special session, but often more). At least 60% of the papers must be by authors that are neither session chairs, from their team, nor reviewers for the session.\n*   Managing the review process for these papers on due time and deadlines.\n*   Providing suitable reviewers for the reviews of the papers.\n*   Ensuring the final versions of the papers are uploaded before the deadline.\n*   Attending the conference and chairing the session.\n*   Disseminating widely a call for papers for the special session (CFPs, etc.).\n\n## Conference Chairs\n\n*   Emilio Corchado, University of Salamanca, Spain (General Chair)\n*   Héctor Quintián, University of A Coruña, Spain (Co-Chair)\n*   Alicia Troncoso Lora, Pablo de Olavide University, Spain (Co-Chair)\n*   Hilde Pérez García, University of León, Spain (Co-Chair)\n*   Esteban Jove, University of A Coruña, Spain (Co-Chair)\n*   José Luis Calvo Rolle, University of A Coruña, Spain (Co-Chair)\n*   Francisco Javier Martínez de Pisón, University of La Rioja, Spain (Co-Chair)\n*   Pablo García Bringas, University of Deusto, Spain (Co-Chair)\n*   Francisco Martínez Álvarez, Pablo de Olavide University, Spain (Co-Chair)\n*   Álvaro Herrero Cosio, University of Burgos, Spain (Co-Chair)\n*   Paolo Fosci, University of Bergamo, Italy (Co-Chair)\n*   Sergio Ramos, University of Polytechnic of Porto, Portugal (Co-Chair)"
