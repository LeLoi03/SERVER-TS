  "Call for Papers": "# QUATIC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 18th International Conference on the Quality of Information and Communications Technology (QUATIC 2025) will be held in **Lisbon, Portugal from September 3-5, 2025**.\n\nQUATIC is a forum for disseminating advanced methods, techniques, and tools for supporting quality approaches to ICT engineering and management. This forum fosters lively discussion on furthering the state-of-the-art, defining future directions, and disseminating advanced new methods, techniques, and tools.\n\n## Aims and Scope\n\nQUATIC 2025 invites practitioners and researchers to submit technical papers reporting original research and experience results in all topics and sub-fields of Quality in ICT process, product, and applications domains, as well as sharing practical studies.\n\n## Thematic Tracks\n\nThe conference is organized into thematic tracks that serve as dedicated discussion venues on focused topics of interest, mixing well-established traditional QUATIC topics and newly proposed tracks, covering breakthrough research challenges:\n\n*   Requirements Engineering\n*   Cloud computing and System Architecture\n*   Edge computing and Cyber Physical systems\n*   Verification, Validation, and Testing\n*   Evolution and maintenance\n*   Process Improvement and Analytics\n*   Security and Privacy\n*   Green and Sustainable Computing\n*   Human, Ethical and Social Aspects\n*   Quality in the Age of AI\n\n## Submissions\n\nQUATIC 2025 accepts the following types of contributions:\n\n*   **Research and experience papers:** (full papers, between 12 and 16 pages). Full papers should describe novel and scientifically rigorous contributions to any aspect related to the quality of ICT systems. Experience papers should present original reports on relevant industrial case studies.\n*   **Innovative and exploratory papers:** (short papers, between 6 and 8 pages). Short papers should describe new, unconventional approaches that fundamentally challenge established research directions and the current state of practice, but which are at an early stage of investigation.\n\nAll papers must conform to the Springer Computer Science Proceedings guidelines and be submitted through the EasyChair link, selecting the track that best suits their field.\n\n## Proceedings\n\nQUATIC is an in-person conference. To ensure the quality of the technical program and encourage active participation, accepted full and short papers must be presented onsite by at least one of their authors to be included in the conference proceedings.\n\nAs with previous QUATIC editions, QUATIC 2025 proceedings will be published in a Springer conference series volume and indexed in DBLP, Google Scholar, EI-Compendex, Mathematical Reviews, SCImago, and Scopus, and also submitted for inclusion in ISI Proceedings.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper Submission (all tracks):** June 10, 2025\n*   **Notification to authors:** July 8, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready:** July 26, 2025\n*   **Conference:** September 3-5, 2025\n\n## Organizing Committee\n\n*   Stamatia Bibi, Program Co-Chair (University of Western Macedonia)\n*   Ricardo J. Machado, Program Co-Chair (CCG/ZGDV Institute, UMinho)\n*   Américo Rio, Organizing Co-Chair (NOVA-IMS)\n*   José Reis, Organizing Co-Chair (Iscte-IUL)\n*   Diogo Cosme, Web Chair (Iscte-IUL)\n*   Rodrigo Simões, Publicity Chair (Iscte-IUL)"
