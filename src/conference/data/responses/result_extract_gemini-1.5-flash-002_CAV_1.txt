  "Call for Papers": "# CAV 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 37th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV 2025) will be held from **July 21-25, 2025, in Zagreb, Croatia**.\n\n## Scope\n\nCAV 2025 is dedicated to the advancement of the theory and practice of computer-aided formal analysis methods for hardware and software systems. The conference covers the spectrum from theoretical results to concrete applications, with an emphasis on practical verification tools and the algorithms and techniques that are needed for their implementation. CAV considers it vital to continue spurring advances in hardware and software verification while expanding to new domains such as machine learning, autonomous systems, and computer security. The proceedings of the conference will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A selection of papers is expected to be invited to a special issue of Formal Methods in System Design and the Journal of the ACM.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include but are not limited to:\n\n*   Algorithms and tools for verifying models and implementations\n*   Algorithms and tools for system synthesis\n*   Algorithms and tools that combine verification and learning\n*   Mathematical and logical foundations of verification and synthesis\n*   Specifications and correctness criteria for programs and systems\n*   Deductive verification using proof assistants\n*   Hardware verification techniques\n*   Program analysis and software verification\n*   Software synthesis\n*   Hybrid systems and embedded systems verification\n*   Formal methods for cyber-physical systems\n*   Compositional and abstraction-based techniques for verification\n*   Probabilistic and statistical approaches to verification\n*   Verification methods for parallel and concurrent systems\n*   Testing and run-time analysis based on verification technology\n*   Decision procedures and solvers for verification and synthesis\n*   Applications and case studies in verification and synthesis\n*   Verification in industrial practice\n*   New application areas for algorithmic verification and synthesis\n*   Formal models and methods for security\n*   Formal models and methods for biological systems\n*   AI safety and explainability using formal methods\n\nSubmissions on a wide range of topics are sought, particularly ones that identify new research directions. CAV 2025 is not limited to topics discussed in previous instances of the conference. Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic may communicate with the conference chairs prior to submission.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are AoE (Anywhere on Earth)\n\n### Paper Submission\n\n*   **Full papers due:** January 31, 2025 (*Firm*)\n*   **Author Response Period:** March 11 - 14, 2025\n*   **Author notification:** April 2, 2025\n\n### Workshop Proposal Submissions\n\n*   **Proposals are due by email to the Workshop chair:** December 1, 2024\n*   **Organizers will be notified about the participation:** December 18, 2024\n\n## Submission Site\n\nThe main submission site is: [https://cav2025.hotcrp.com/](https://cav2025.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Paper Submission Categories\n\nPaper submissions in CAV fall into one of the following three categories:\n\n*   Regular Papers (18 pages max, must be anonymized)\n*   Tool Papers (10 pages max, not anonymized)\n*   Industrial Experience Reports & Case Studies (10 pages max, not anonymized)\n\nPapers in all three categories must be submitted by January 31, 2025 AoE, and should be in LNCS format. Simultaneous submission to other conferences with proceedings or submission of material that has already been published elsewhere is not allowed.\n\n## CAV Award\n\nThe CAV award is given annually at the CAV conference for fundamental contributions to the field of Computer-Aided Verification.\n\n*   **CAV Award Nomination Deadline:** March 1, 2025\n\n## Contact\n\nFor any questions, please contact the PC chairs:\n\n*   Ruzica Piskac ([ruzica.piskac@yale.edu](mailto:ruzica.piskac@yale.edu))\n*   Zvonimir Rakamaric ([zrakamar@gmail.com](mailto:zrakamar@gmail.com))"
