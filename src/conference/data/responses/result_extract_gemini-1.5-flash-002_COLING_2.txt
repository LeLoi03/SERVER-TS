These page limits only apply to the main body of the paper. Papers can include unlimited pages of references and an unlimited appendix.  A mandatory section discussing the limitations of the work and an optional section discussing ethical considerations must be included at the end of the paper (after the conclusions but before the references).\n\nAuthors should follow the [general instructions for COLING 2025 proceedings](https://coling2025.org/downloads/coling-2025.pdf), which are an adaptation of the general instructions for *ACL proceedings*.  To prepare your submission, use the COLING 2025 style files:\n\n*   [LaTeX](https://coling2025.org/downloads/coling-2025.zip)\n*   [Word](https://coling2025.org/downloads/coling-2025.docx)\n*   [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/instructions-for-coling-2025-proceedings/hfhcytgpqmzf)\n\nPapers deviating from the provided style files will be rejected without review. COLING 2025 adopts the ACL Ethics Policy.\n\n## Submission Routes\n\nThere are two routes for paper submission:\n\n### Direct Submission\n\nPapers should be submitted through Softconf/START using this link: [https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/](https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/)\n\nEach paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal.\n\n### ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers\n\nPapers which have already been reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed.  ARR papers should be committed using Softconf/START. When making a new submission, you will be able to specify the details of the ARR paper that you want to commit, including the openreview ID of your paper.\n\n## Optional Supplementary Materials\n\nEach COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz or .zip archive containing supplementary materials, such as program code and datasets.  Additional information should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Submissions need to remain fully self-contained.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 11:59 PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).\n\n*   **Deadline for direct submissions:** September 16, 2024\n*   **Commitment deadline for ARR papers:** October 20, 2024\n*   **Author rebuttal phase (for direct submissions):** October 30 - November 1, 2024\n*   **Notification of acceptance for COLING 2025:** November 29, 2024\n*   **Camera-ready papers due:** December 15, 2024\n*   **Tutorials and Workshops:** January 19-20, 2025\n*   **Main Conference:** January 21-24, 2025\n\n## Multiple Submission Policy\n\nPapers submitted to COLING 2025 cannot be under review for other conferences or journals at the same time.
