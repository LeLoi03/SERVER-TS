  "Call for Papers": "# ACSAC 2025: Call for Submissions\n\nThe Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) brings together leading researchers and practitioners, along with a diverse group of security professionals drawn from academia, industry, and government, gathered to present and discuss the latest cybersecurity results and topics. ACSAC continues its core mission of investigating practical solutions for computer and network security technologies.\n\n## Submission Deadlines\n\n*   **Technical Papers:** May 30\n*   **Case Studies:** September 4\n*   **Panels:** July 8 (abstract), August 20 (details)\n*   **Posters:** September 13\n*   **Works in Progress:** September 13\n*   **Workshop Proposals:** May 26\n*   **Artifacts Competition:** September 17\n*   **Student Conferenceships:** September 30\n\n## Hard Topic Theme: Automated Detection and Patching of Software Vulnerabilities\n\nThis year's hard topic theme solicits research results and technologies that advance our ability to automatically identify and fix software security vulnerabilities.\n\n## Submission Types\n\n*   **Technical Papers:** We solicit papers offering novel contributions in any aspect of applied security. Papers are encouraged on results that have been demonstrated to be useful for improving information systems security and that address lessons learned from the actual application. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Please ensure that your submission is a PDF file of a maximum of 11 pages, excluding well-marked references and appendices limited to 5 pages. Committee members are not required to read the appendices.\n*   **Case Studies:** The Case Studies in Applied Security Track is a critical part of the technical conference. It is an opportunity for professionals to share information that is current without writing a detailed technical paper, but enables attendees to learn about the next generation of products and solutions. It is open to anyone in the community such as vendors, network providers, systems integrators, government civil/federal/military programs or users across the spectrum of computer security applications.\n*   **Panels:** Panels should encourage audience participation and focus on the sharp edges of a topic where there is controversy or where there are widely varying positions. A typical panel proposal should list the moderator, three panel members and an abstract of the proposed topic.\n*   **Posters:** The poster session provides an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present their new and innovative preliminary work in an informal, interactive setting. Conference attendees can learn about novel on-going research projects that might not yet be complete, but whose preliminary results are already interesting.\n*   **Works in Progress:** The Works in Progress (WiP) session offers short presentations (5 minutes maximum) of ongoing work. These presentations highlight the most current work in both business and academia, emphasizing goals and value added, accomplishments to date, and future plans. Special consideration is given to topics that discuss real-life security experience, including system implementation, deployment, and lessons learned.\n*   **Workshops:** ACSAC workshops are on up to date topics that attendees usually rate to provide a useful and exciting forum for information technology professionals (e.g., standards developers, software developers, security engineers, security officers) to exchange ideas, concerns, and opinions.\n*   **Artifacts Competition:** This competition invites the submission of applied cybersecurity artifacts that have been published in previous years in academic or industry venues. In particular, the competition aims to identify previously published applied security artifacts that have demonstrated meaningful impact for the security and privacy research communities.\n*   **Student Conferenceships:** ACSAC offers conferenceships to enable students to attend the conference. This program will help pay for some of the cost to attend ACSAC.\n\n## General Submissions and Speaking Proposals\n\nACSAC does not accept \"speaking proposals\" per se; however, you are encouraged to submit suggestions in the form of a one paragraph description of a topic and a biography of the proposed presenter. Depending on a proposal's technical content, it may be acceptable as a case study. If a full paper is available, it may be acceptable as a technical paper. If a presentation by a group of related speakers is contemplated, a proposal for this session may be acceptable as a panel. If a proposal for a half day or full day seminar is appropriate, it may be acceptable as a professional development course. If a one or two page technical write-up is available that describes work that is not yet completed, it may be acceptable as a poster. Finally, if your have an interest in a full day interactive dialogue, exchanging ideas, opinions and concerns between multiple presenters and attendees, consider being a workshop presenter.\n\n## Topics\n\nThe main topics of interest to ACSAC include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Access Control, Assurance, Audit\n*   Anonymity, Privacy\n*   Application Security\n*   Automated Detection and Patching of Software Vulnerabilities (Hard Topic)\n*   Big Data for Security\n*   Cloud and Virtualization Security\n*   Cybercrime\n*   Cyber-Physical Systems, Embedded Systems, and IoT Security\n*   Data Integrity and Protection\n*   Denial of Service Attacks and Defenses\n*   Deployable Trustworthy Systems\n*   Digital Forensics\n*   Distributed Systems Security\n*   Enterprise Security Management and Incident Response\n*   Hardware and Supply Chain Security\n*   Identity Management\n*   Intrusion Detection and Prevention\n*   Machine Learning Security\n*   Malware\n*   Mobile/Wireless Security\n*   Network Security\n*   OS and Systems Security\n*   Resilience\n*   Security Applications of Generative AI\n*   Software Security\n*   Software-defined Programmable Security\n*   Usability and Human-centered Security\n*   Web Security\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nAuthors are required to specify their conflicts of interest with Program Committee (PC) members when submitting a paper. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members, according to the defined conditions.\n\n## Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion\n\nACSAC adheres to the IEEEâ€™s Computer Society Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion guidelines. Authors are encouraged to consider DEI issues as they prepare their submissions (e.g., keep in mind that Words Matter). For any suggestions, concerns, or complaints regarding DEI-related biases or harassment, we encourage you to reach out to the Conference Chairs. All communications regarding DEI will be treated as confidential."
