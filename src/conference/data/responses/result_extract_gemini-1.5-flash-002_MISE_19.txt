  "Call for Papers": "# WSESE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 2nd International Workshop on Methodological Issues with Empirical Studies in Software Engineering (WSESE 2025) will be co-located with ICSE 2025 in **Ottawa, Canada from April 27-May 3, 2025.**\n\n## Theme & Goals\n\nWith the steep increase in empirical studies and the advent of secondary studies that aggregate their results, a main concern is their quality. The workshop aims to increase awareness of the importance of quality and appropriateness in the methods applied during the different stages of software engineering empirical studies to yield reliable results and to disseminate this knowledge to the broader SE community. This year, we are placing a special emphasis on Machine Learning (ML). We encourage submissions that explore the integration and application of ML techniques throughout the empirical process.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not restricted to:\n\n*   Issues with the motivation and definition of appropriate research questions.\n*   Issues with the operationalization, e.g., missing standard metrics.\n*   Issues with the systematic identification of threats to validity and how to address them.\n*   Issues selecting an appropriate study design and the consequences of that selection.\n*   Issues with drawing appropriate conclusions from the findings and generalizing them.\n*   Issues with aggregating results from individual studies.\n*   Issues with reproduction, replication, or families of studies.\n*   Issues with quantitative, qualitative approaches and combined approaches.\n*   Issues with understanding failures and successes: lessons learned.\n\n## Paper Categories\n\n*   **Technical papers (6-8 pages including references):** formally describe studies, explain how they were designed and executed to overcome challenges, highlight concrete results, and describe any advances to the state-of-the-art.\n*   **Experience reports / Work in progress (4-6 pages including references):** describe the experience in conducting studies and lessons learned that address methodological issues.\n*   **Vision / Position papers (2-4 pages including references):** describe new directions in conducting empirical studies including convincing arguments supported by clear rationale.\n*   **Panel proposals (1-2 pages including references):** discuss hot topics about conducting empirical studies.\n\nPapers must describe original work that has not been submitted to or presented at other forums (although the studies described may have been). Accepted papers will be published in the ICSE workshop proceedings.\n\n## Submission Information\n\nSubmissions will be made via HotCRP. Papers must be formatted according to [ICSE 2025 guidelines](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2025/icse-2025-research-track#submission-process). Please note that WSESE does not follow a double-anonymous review process.\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://wsese2025.hotcrp.com/](https://wsese2025.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are AoE (UTC-12h):\n\n*   **Submission of papers (extended):** November 18, 2024\n*   **Notification:** December 8, 2024\n*   **Camera-ready:** February 5, 2025"
