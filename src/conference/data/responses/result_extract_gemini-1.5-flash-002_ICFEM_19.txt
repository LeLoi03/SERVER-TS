"Call for Papers": "# ICFEM 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 26th International Conference on Formal Engineering Methods (ICFEM 2025) will be held at the **Hangzhou Xixi Hotel in Hangzhou, China, from November 10-13, 2025.**\n\nICFEM is an international leading conference series in formal methods and software engineering.  The conference is interested in work that has been incorporated into real production systems, and in theoretical work that promises to bring practical and tangible benefit.\n\n## Scope and Topics\n\nAuthors are invited to submit high-quality technical papers describing original and unpublished work in all theoretical aspects of software engineering. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Formal specification and modeling\n*   Formal approaches to fault prevention and detection\n*   Abstraction, refinement, and evolution\n*   Formal verification and validation\n*   Integration of formal methods and testing\n*   Integration of formal methods and review\n*   SAT/SMT solvers for software analysis and testing\n*   Practical formal methods\n*   Applications of formal methods\n*   Formal approaches to software maintenance\n*   Formal approaches to safety-critical system development\n*   Supporting tools for formal methods\n*   Formal methods for agile development\n*   Formal methods for human-machine pair programming\n*   Formal methods for and with AI\n*   Formal methods for Cyber-physical systems and IoT\n*   Formal certification of products\n*   Industrial case studies\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Submission:** May 25, 2025\n*   **Full Paper Submission:** June 1, 2025\n*   **Author Notification:** August 1, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready versions:** August 20, 2025\n*   **Conference dates:** November 10-13, 2025\n\n## Conference Paper Submission and Publication\n\nSubmission should be done through the ICFEM 2025 submission page (the web page is under construction).\n\nAs in previous years, the proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Papers should be written in English and should not exceed 16 pages (excluding references and appendix) in the Springer's LNCS format. Each submission will undergo a rigorous single-blind peer-review process by at least three experts. Extended versions of selected papers will be recommended to special issues of Formal Aspects of Computing after the conference proceedings.\n\n## Journal-First Presentations\n\nICFEM 2025 is inviting journal-first presentations of papers published recently in the following journals:\n\n*   ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems\n*   ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology\n*   Formal Aspects of Computing\n*   Formal Methods in System Design\n*   IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering\n*   Theoretical Computer Science\n\nThe presentations will offer the authors an opportunity to speak directly to their peers in the community and also enrich the ICFEM program. The journal-first presentation will be listed in the conference program, yet the corresponding papers will not be part of the ICFEM proceedings as they have been published through the journals. At least one author of each accepted journal-first presentation must register for and attend the ICFEM conference to present the paper.\n\n## Doctoral Symposium Paper Submission\n\nThe ICFEM Doctoral Symposium is an international forum for PhD students studying all areas related to formal methods for software, hardware, and system development.  Submissions to the Doctoral Symposium should include: Title of the research, the author name (single name) and affiliation; Context and motivation; Problem statement and related work; Proposed solutions and current research efforts, their significance, methodology, results and analysis, and future work. The paper should be prepared using the LNCS format and submitted in PDF format via EasyChair.\n\nWe accept two types of submissions:\n\n*   2-page extended abstracts (which will not be included in the ICFEM proceedings)\n*   6-page papers (which will be published in the LNCS volume of Springer as part of the main ICFEM proceedings)\n\nAuthors with accepted submissions are expected to attend the Doctoral Symposium in person to present their work. A discounted registration fee for Doctoral Symposium participants will be announced later."
