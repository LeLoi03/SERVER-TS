"Call for Papers": "# ICDE 2025: Call for Research Papers\n\nThe 41st IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2025) will be held in **Hong Kong SAR, China from May 19-23, 2025.**\n\nICDE is one of the premier conferences in data and information engineering. It addresses research issues on designing, building, managing, and evaluating advanced data-intensive systems and applications. It is a leading forum for researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe invite the submission of original research contributions in the following areas as they relate to data management:\n\n*   AI for Database Systems and Database Systems for AI\n*   Benchmarking, Performance Modeling, Tuning, and Testing\n*   Cloud Data Management\n*   Crowdsourcing and Data Management\n*   Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery from a Data Management Perspective\n*   Data Models, Semantics, Query languages\n*   Data Stream Systems and Edge Computing\n*   Very Large Data Visualization and Interactive Data Exploration\n*   Database Security and Privacy\n*   Distributed Ledgers and Blockchains\n*   Distributed, Parallel and P2P Data Management\n*   Explainability, Fairness, and Trust in Data Systems and Analysis\n*   Graphs, Networks, and Semi-structured Data Management\n*   Information Integration and Data Quality\n*   IoT Data Management\n*   Modern Hardware and In-Memory Database Systems\n*   Query Processing, Indexing, and Optimization\n*   Transaction Management\n*   Spatial Databases and Temporal Databases\n*   Text, Semi-Structured Data Management, Multimedia Databases\n*   Information Retrieval from a Data Management Perspective\n*   Uncertain, Probabilistic, and Approximate Databases\n*   Very Large Data Science Applications/Pipelines\n*   Workflows, Scientific Data Management\n\nWe also welcome any original contributions that may cross the boundaries among areas or point in other novel directions of interest to the database research community.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nIEEE ICDE 2025 will have two rounds of research paper submissions. Notification dates are approximate. All deadlines are 11:59 PM AoE.\n\n### First Round\n\n*   Submission due: August 2, 2024\n*   Notification for authors (Accept/Revise/Reject): September 24, 2024\n*   Revision due: October 29, 2024\n*   Notification to authors (Accept/Reject): November 26, 2024\n*   Camera-ready copy due: December 10, 2024\n\n### Second Round\n\n*   Submission due: November 25, 2024\n*   Notification for Authors (Accept/Revise/Reject): January 21, 2025\n*   Revision Due: February 25, 2025\n*   Notification to authors (Accept/Reject): March 25, 2025\n*   Camera-ready copy due: April 8, 2025\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nPaper should be submitted using the Conference Management Tool: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICDE2025](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICDE2025)\n\n## Notes on Research Papers\n\n*   Manuscripts must be prepared in accordance with the IEEE format available at [https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).\n*   Research papers must not exceed 12 pages, not including the references. No appendix is allowed. Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered.\n*   A paper submitted to ICDE 2025 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire time it is considered for ICDE 2025, and it must be substantially different from any previously published work.\n*   Any author of ICDE 2025 should not be a co-author of more than 10 submitted research papers across the two submission rounds.\n\n## Desk Rejection Policy\n\nICDE research track submissions that don’t meet the following requirements may be rejected without review.\n\n*   Submissions must follow the aforementioned guidelines and length requirements specified in the ICDE 2025 Call for Papers.\n*   Submissions must be in scope of ICDE 2025.\n*   Authors must correctly declare all conflicts of interest (COI) with members of the program committee.\n*   After a paper is accepted, the set of authors cannot be changed.\n\n## Reviewing Process\n\nICDE 2025 papers will be stringently reviewed with at least 3 reviews per paper. The review process will be coordinated by the meta-reviewer resulting in one of the decisions to either accept, reject, or revise the submission. A meta-review will be provided based on the discussions about the paper. Paper revisions will go through an additional round of reviews before a final decision is made to accept or reject the paper.\n\n## Inclusions and Diversity in Writing\n\nWe value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and profession. Both are important in our writing as well. Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing.\n\n## Conflict of Interest\n\nDuring submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about Conflicts of Interest (COI) of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members.\n\n## Best Papers\n\nThe best papers (as judged by the ICDE 2025 PC) will be selected for submission as an extended version to be published in the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)."
