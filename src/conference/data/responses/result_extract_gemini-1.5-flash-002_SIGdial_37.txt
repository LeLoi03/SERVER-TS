  "Call for Papers": "# SIGDIAL 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 26th Annual Meeting of the Special Interest Group on Discourse and Dialogue (SIGDIAL 2025) will be held in **Avignon, France, on August 25-27, 2025**.\n\nThe SIGDIAL venue provides a regular forum for the presentation of cutting-edge research in dialogue and discourse to both academic and industry researchers.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nSIGDIAL 2025 invites submissions of original research on all aspects of discourse and dialogue. We encourage formal, corpus-based, experimental, or analytical work, as well as work on implementations and applications, including but not limited to the following areas:\n\n*   **Discourse Processing:** Research on rhetorical and coherence relations, discourse parsing, discourse connectives, reference resolution, event representation, and causality in narrative. This also includes work on argument mining, text quality and style, cross-lingual discourse analysis, and discourse considerations in applications like machine translation, text summarization, essay grading, question answering, and information retrieval. We particularly encourage submissions that explore discourse issues in text generated by large language models.\n*   **Pragmatic and Semantic Modeling:** Investigations into the pragmatics and semantics of conversations, going beyond the single sentence level. This includes research on rational speech acts, conversation acts, intentions, conversational implicature, and presuppositions.\n*   **Dialogue Systems:** Contributions related to task-oriented and open-domain dialogue systems, whether spoken, multimodal, embedded, situated, or text-based. This includes research on system components, evaluation, and applications. Specific areas of interest include knowledge representation and extraction for dialogue, state representation and tracking, policy learning, social and emotional intelligence, dialogue in virtual reality and human-robot interaction, entrainment, alignment, and priming. We also welcome work on generation for dialogue, style, voice, personality, and safety and ethics in dialogue systems.\n*   **LLM-Based Dialogue Technologies:** Research on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in dialogue systems, including but not limited to areas like prompt engineering, fine-tuning for dialogue, data synthesis and augmentation for dialogue tasks, safety and ethics of LLMs in conversation, and evaluation of LLM-generated dialogue.\n*   **Corpora, Tools, and Methodology:** Submissions focused on corpus-based and experimental work on discourse and dialogue. We encourage submissions related to annotation tools and schemes, crowdsourcing, evaluation methodologies, and corpora development.\n*   **Applications of Dialogue and Discourse Processing Technology:** We welcome submissions showcasing innovative applications of dialogue and discourse processing technology in various domains.\n\n## Submission Types\n\n*   **Long Papers:** 8 pages max, excluding references and appendices; +1 page in the final version.\n*   **Short Papers:** 4 pages max, excluding references and appendices; +1 page in the final version.\n*   **Demo Descriptions:** 4 pages max, including references. Also a separate 1-page document for equipment requirements.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   All content crucial for understanding your contribution or assessing its technical correctness should be included in the main paper, not solely in appendices.\n*   Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary materials like corpora, code, videos, or sound files to ensure reproducibility and/or enhance their submissions.\n*   SIGDIAL 2025 cannot accept work that is currently under review, or has been published elsewhere, including other conferences or journals with overlapping review periods.\n*   Long and short papers will undergo double-blind review, following ACL policies ([https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines)). Demo descriptions will NOT be anonymous.\n*   All submissions must adhere to the two-column ACL format (Overleaf template and downloadable LaTeX/Word templates available). Submit electronically in PDF format.\n\n## Submission Deadlines\n\nSIGDIAL accepts both regular submissions via the Softconf/START system and commitments of papers previously reviewed through ACL Rolling Review (ARR).\n\n*   **Regular Submission (Softconf/START):** [https://www.softconf.com/n/sigdial2025/](https://www.softconf.com/n/sigdial2025/) Submission deadline is April 21, 2025 (23:59 GMT-11). The authors are allowed to update ONLY the PDF until April 28, 2024 (23:59 GMT-11).\n*   **ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Commitment:** Before June 6, 2024 (23:59 GMT-11)\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 11.59 pm UTC -12h (anywhere on earth).\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** April 21, 2025\n*   **Paper update deadline (PDF only):** April 28, 2025\n*   **Reviews due:** June 6, 2025\n*   **Paper notification:** June 20, 2025\n*   **Final camera-ready submission deadline:** July 8, 2025\n*   **Early registration deadline:** July 8, 2025\n*   **SIGDIAL 2025:** August 25-27, 2025\n*   **YRRSDS and satellite workshops:** August 28-29, 2025\n\n## General Co-Chairs\n\n*   Frédéric Béchet\n*   Fabrice Lefèvre\n\n## Contact\n\n[sigdial25@univ-avignon.fr](mailto:sigdial25@univ-avignon.fr)"
