They can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 15 pages overall.\n\n### Posters and demos\n\nWiSec will solicit the submission of posters and demos. The instructions to submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.\n\n### Artifact Evaluation label\n\nIn the spirit of open science, WiSec encourages authors of accepted papers to make software and data artifacts publicly available to the community.\n\n## Research Ethics\n\nThe ethical conduct of research is critical to ensuring the public’s trust and support of science. All submitted papers will be reviewed for ethical concerns, and if ethical practices are not followed a paper will be rejected regardless of any other merit.\n\n## Policy for Peer-Review Integrity\n\nAll SIGSAC-sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. Also, all authors, PC members, and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies."
