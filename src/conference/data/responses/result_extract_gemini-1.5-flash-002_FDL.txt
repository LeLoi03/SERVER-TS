  "Call for Papers": "# FDL 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 28th Forum on Specification and Design Languages (FDL 2025) is an international event where academics and industrials exchange their results, experiences, advances, and new trends related to languages, tools, and techniques for developing software and hardware systems.  The conference will be held in **Schloß Rheinfels, St. Goar, Germany, from September 10-12, 2025**.\n\n## Scientific Areas\n\nFDL is based on the four following non-limiting scientific areas:\n\n*   **Languages:** Domain-specific languages for software, execution platforms, allocations environment, contracts, abstractions, and refinements are of interest, together with the associated design methods, frameworks, and tools.\n*   **Semantics:** Formal definitions, compilers, interpreters, typing, abstraction/refinement are of interest, together with the underlying specification frameworks or new approaches for their specification, modeling, and model transformation.\n*   **Verification and Analysis:** Innovative static analysis, testing, debugging, model checking, machine learning-based analysis, or design space exploration are of interest, together with the underlying models, tools, and frameworks.\n*   **Simulation:** Innovative simulation techniques, virtual prototypes, digital twins, collaborative simulation, hybrid simulations, or runtime abstraction/refinement are of interest with special attention on the efficiency and correctness of simulations and their underlying tools and frameworks.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nCross-fertilization between the above areas, in particular in the context of system engineering, is of great interest. Topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Languages and formalisms in model-based system design for modeling, testing, verification, and simulation\n*   Languages for knowledge representation about system designs\n*   Models of computations considering concurrency and time like dataflow computing, synchronous and functional languages, event-based languages, etc.\n*   Modeling languages and tools for modeling (cyber-)physical environments or networks\n*   Formal methods and languages for modeling, specification, and verification\n*   System design for modern hardware architectures like multi/manycore processors, and heterogeneous platforms, accelerators including GPUs and FPGAs\n*   High-level hardware and software synthesis, virtual prototyping, and design space exploration\n*   Modeling and programming languages for smart contracts and distributed ledger technologies\n*   Case studies from typical application areas like healthcare, automotive, Industry 4.0, etc.\n\n## Paper Categories\n\nThe following categories of papers are presented orally at the conference and will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore:\n\n*   **Research Papers:** Original papers with clear research contributions and evaluation (8 pages plus references)\n*   **Special Session Papers:** Call for organizing special sessions on a specific topic (2-page session proposals). Papers within the special session follow the same peer reviewing and publishing process as for research papers (8 pages plus references).\n*   **Wild-and-Crazy-Idea Papers:** Papers with well-explained fundamentally new ideas without rigorous evaluation (4 pages plus references)\n*   **Tool Papers:** Papers about new tools, their methods, and successful case studies (6 pages plus references). Tool papers may not describe new research ideas, and rather present on a solid implementation of existing methods that are made publically available to the community.\n*   **Work-in-progress Extended Abstracts:** Submission of 2-page papers (extended abstracts) describing ongoing work where final results are not yet available but where potential solutions are already mature enough to be discussed at the conference.\n\n## Ph.D. Forum Extended Abstracts\n\nSubmission of 2-page papers (extended abstracts, single blind) about planned and ongoing work on Ph.D. theses that can be discussed at the conference.\n\n## Formatting and Submission Guidelines\n\nAuthors should submit papers in double columns, IEEE format as PDF through the submission system. All submitted papers must describe original, unpublished work, and must not be under consideration for publication elsewhere.\n\n*   Initial submissions are double-blind (to avoid initial bias), but author names become available to reviewers during discussion and before the final decision.\n*   Submissions must be clearly tagged to determine the submission category by using the `\\IEEEspecialpapernotice` keyword.\n*   Please submit your paper via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fdl2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fdl2025)\n\n## Camera Ready for IEEE Xplore Proceedings\n\nThe deadline for the submission of the final version of the paper is July 19, 2025.\n\n*   Papers must be written in English using the available LaTeX or Microsoft Word templates for A4 format. Formatting may not be altered.\n*   Confirmed IEEE Xplore compatibility by using IEEE PDF eXpress.\n*   Included Copyright Information.\n*   Final paper submitted via the \"proceedings author (IEEE Proceedings)\" menu on EasyChair.\n\n## Important Deadlines (23:59 Anywhere on Earth)\n\n*   Special Session proposals: April 18, 2025\n*   Paper Deadline: May 2, 2025\n*   Author Notification: June 20, 2025\n*   Ph.D. Forum deadline: July 19, 2025\n*   Camera-ready submission: July 19, 2025"
