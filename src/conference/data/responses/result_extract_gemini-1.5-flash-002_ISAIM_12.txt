  "Call for Papers": "# ISAIM 2024: Call for Papers\n\nThe International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM) is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\n## About the Symposium\n\nISAIM seeks submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled lessons learned from the development of the application.\n\nWork that will have been published as of January 2024 should not be submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the previously published work. However, the ISAIM web site proceedings are not archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review elsewhere at the time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM.\n\nAuthors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in an archival special volume of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and unpublished to be considered for the special volume.\n\n## Paper Submissions\n\nPlease select [Paper Submissions](submissions.html) from the sidebar for instructions on how to submit a paper.\n\nAny questions regarding paper submissions should be sent to the Program Committee Chairs (Claudio Gentille and Aldo Pacchiano) at [isaim-l@lists.ou.edu](mailto:isaim-l@lists.ou.edu).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission:** October 17, 2023 (11:59 PM PDT)\n*   **Notification:** November 15, 2023 (11:59 PM PDT)\n*   **Final papers due:** November 29, 2023 (11:59 PM PDT)\n*   **Workshop:** January 8-10, 2024, Ft.
