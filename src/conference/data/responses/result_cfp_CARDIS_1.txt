  "callForPapers": "# Call for Papers: CASCADE 2025\n\nCASCADE is a new conference formed by the merge of COSADE and CARDIS, focusing on cryptographic implementations, physical attacks, and embedded security. It aims to foster research and exchange on these topics. The conference welcomes contributions from both academia and industry, particularly encouraging submissions from European PhD students.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe program committee invites original papers on all aspects of design, development, deployment, evaluation, and application of cryptographic implementations and secure embedded systems. Submissions are encouraged across a broad range of the development phase.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n### Attacks and Countermeasures\n\n*   Physical and remote side-channel attacks & countermeasures\n*   Fault injection attacks and countermeasures\n*   Combined implementation attacks and countermeasures\n*   Micro-architectural attacks and countermeasures\n*   Hardware tampering and tamper-resistance\n*   Reverse engineering, (anti-)cloning, and (anti-)counterfeiting\n*   Hardware trojans and detection mechanisms\n*   Machine learning attacks and countermeasures\n\n### Efficient and Secure Cryptographic Implementations\n\n*   Hardware & software cryptographic implementations\n*   Algorithmic aspects of cryptographic implementations\n*   Hardware security mechanisms, physically unclonable functions, true random number generator\n*   Cryptographic implementations for RISC-V architectures\n*   Post-quantum cryptographic implementations\n*   Lightweight cryptography\n*   White-box cryptography\n\n### Tools and Methodologies\n\n*   Formal methods, techniques, and security models (for embedded security)\n*   Secure design and verification tools for hardware/software\n*   Security proofs in relevant models\n*   Computer-aided cryptographic engineering\n*   Domain-specific languages for cryptographic systems\n*   Automated and machine learning analysis frameworks\n*   Security evaluation platforms and tooling\n*   Open benchmarks for efficient and secure designs\n\n### Applications\n\n*   Applications of secure embedded systems\n*   Trusted execution environments and trusted computing platforms\n*   Security of the internet of things\n*   Security of RISC-V architectures\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 23:59:59 Anywhere on Earth (AoE).\n\n*   **Summer Submission:**\n    *   Paper submission: **September 17, 2024 - October 1, 2024**\n    *   Result notification: **December 1, 2024 - November 29, 2024**\n*   **Winter Submission:**\n    *   Paper submission: **December 17, 2024**\n    *   Result notification: **February 22, 2025**\n*   **Early registration deadline:** **February 28, 2025**\n*   **Conference Dates:** **April 2 to 4, 2025**\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Submissions must be original, unpublished, anonymous, and not submitted to journals or other conferences/workshops with proceedings.\n*   Submissions must be written in English.\n*   Papers should be at most **20 pages** in total (excluding references and appendices) strictly following Springer's LNCS format.\n*   There is no limit on the length of the bibliography and appendices when submitting.\n*   Reviewers are not required to read any appendices, and the camera-ready version should be self-contained without appendices and strictly adhere to the page limit.\n*   Papers not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration.\n*   All submissions will be blind-refereed.\n*   Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper.\n*   The proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.\n*   Both submissions and accepted papers must follow the LNCS default author instructions accessible on the Springer webpage: [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)\n\n## Stipends\n\nThanks to our generous sponsors, we are able to offer a limited number of registration fee waivers. The general chairs will select the recipients. Interested candidates should send a CV and a letter from their supervisor (for PhD students) as soon as possible to [vincent.grosso@cnrs.fr, pierre.louis.cayrel@univ-st-etienne.fr and b.colombier@univ-st-etienne.fr](mailto:vincent.grosso@cnrs.fr, pierre.louis.cayrel@univ-st-etienne.fr and b.colombier@univ-st-etienne.fr?subject=CASCADE 2025 fee waiver) with the subject line \"CASCADE 2025 fee waiver\". We will consider applications as they are received. Priority will be given to PhD students who would not otherwise be able to attend due to financial constraints. Gender equality is also encouraged in the selection process.\n\n## Contact\n\n*   Email: cascade2025programchairs(at)gmail(dot)com\n\n## Organization\n\n### General Chairs\n\n*   Pierre-Louis Cayrel, UJM-Saint-Etienne, FR\n*   Brice Colombier, UJM-Saint-Etienne, FR\n*   Vincent Grosso, CNRS and UJM-Saint-Etienne, FR\n\n### Program Chairs\n\n*   Matthieu Rivain, CryptoExperts, FR\n*   Pascal Sasdrich, Ruhr-Universit√§t Bochum, DE",
