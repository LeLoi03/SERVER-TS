  "Call for Papers": "# FormaliSE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nFormaliSE 2025 will take place in **Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, from April 27-28, 2025**, co-located with ICSE 2025.\n\n## Areas of Interest\n\nThe FormaliSE conference series promotes work at the intersection of the formal methods and software engineering communities.\n\nAreas of interest include:\n\n*   Requirements formalization and formal specification\n*   Approaches, methods, and tools for verification and validation\n*   Formal approaches to safety and security-related issues\n*   Analysis of performance and other non-functional properties based on formal approaches\n*   Scalability of formal method applications\n*   Integration of formal methods within the software development lifecycle\n*   Model-based engineering approaches\n*   Correctness-by-construction approaches for software and systems engineering\n*   Application of formal methods to specific domains (e.g., autonomous, cyber-physical, intelligent, and IoT systems)\n*   Formal methods for AI-based systems (FM4AI), and AI applied in formal method approaches (AI4FM)\n*   Formal methods in a certification context\n*   Case studies developed/analyzed with formal approaches\n*   Experience reports on the application of formal methods to real-world problems\n*   Guidelines to use formal methods in practice\n*   Usability of formal methods\n\n## Paper Categories\n\nWe accept papers in three categories:\n\n1.  **Full research papers:** describing original research work and results. We encourage authors to include validation of their contributions by means of a case study or experiments. We also welcome research papers focusing on tools and tool development.\n2.  **Case study papers:** discussing a significant application that suggests general lessons learned and motivates further research, or empirically validates theoretical results (such as a technique’s scalability).\n3.  **Research ideas papers:** describing new ideas in preliminary form, in a way that can stimulate interesting discussions at the conference, and suggest future work.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAll papers submitted to the FormaliSE 2025 conference must be written in English, must be unpublished original work, and must not be under review or submitted elsewhere at the time of submission. Submissions must comply with the FormaliSE’s lightweight double-anonymous review process (see below).\n\n*   Full research papers and case study papers can take up to 10 pages including all text, figures, tables, and appendices, but excluding references.\n*   Research ideas papers can take up to 4 pages, plus up to 1 additional page solely for references.\n*   All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract submissions:** November 18, 2024\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** November 25, 2024\n*   **Notifications:** January 13, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready papers due:** February 5, 2025\n*   **Early registration deadline:** February 18, 2025\n*   **Conference:** April 27-28, 2025"
