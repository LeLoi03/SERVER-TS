  "Call for Papers": "# PODS 2025: Call for Research Papers\n\nThe Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management, traditional or nontraditional.\n\nThe 2025 conference will be held in **Berlin, Germany**.\n\n## Mission\n\nThe PODS community has a pivotal position in the research of computer science. It aims to provide a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques, and solutions for the data management challenges that continually arise in our data-driven society.\n\n## Scope\n\nPODS seeks scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application, and system building in the context of data management.\n\nTopics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Database processing: Query evaluation, query optimization, schema management, distributed data processing, approximate data processing\n*   Database design: Data models, query languages, schemas, constraints\n*   Database access: Data structures, access methods, concurrency, transactions\n*   Data quality: Data consistency, data cleaning, data discovery, data exploration\n*   Data analysis: Data mining, machine learning, information extraction, data streams\n*   Uncertainty: Incomplete data, inconsistent data, probabilistic data\n*   Interoperability: Mappings and views, data integration, data exchange, ontology-based data access\n*   Responsible data management: Access control, privacy, security, verification, ethical aspects of data management\n*   Human-database interaction: data summarization, data visualization, explanation for database queries\n*   Connections between database principles and other disciplines\n\n## Submission Format\n\nLaTex users must format their submission using the standard ACM \"acmsmall\" proceedings stylesheet:\n\n*   [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)\n*   They must use the following class declaration:\n    *   `\\documentclass[acmsmall,review,anonymous]{acmart}`\n\nA submission can be up to 15 pages, not including references, plus unlimited space for references. Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, of unlimited length, that should be incorporated at submission time; online appendices are not allowed. However, an appendix will be read at the discretion of the program committee.\n\n## Double-anonymous reviewing\n\nPODS 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous reviewing process. This means that submissions must adhere to the following:\n\n*   Author names and institutions must be omitted.\n*   References to the authorsâ€™ own related work should be in the third person.\n*   Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines end at 5 PM Pacific Time.\n\n**FIRST SUBMISSION PHASE:**\n\n*   Abstract: May 31, 2024\n*   Submission: June 7, 2024\n*   Rebuttal: July 29 - August 1, 2024\n*   Initial notification: August 12, 2024\n*   Revision submission: August 26, 2024\n*   Final notification: September 2, 2024\n\n**SECOND SUBMISSION PHASE:**\n\n*   Abstract: December 2, 2024\n*   Submission: December 9, 2024\n*   Rebuttal: February 3-7, 2025\n*   Initial notification: February 14, 2025\n*   Revision submission: February 28, 2025\n*   Final notification: March 7, 2025"
