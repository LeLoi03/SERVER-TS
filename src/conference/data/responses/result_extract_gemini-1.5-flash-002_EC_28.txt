  "Call for Papers": "# EC'25: Call for Papers\n\nThe 26th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC’25) will take place at **Stanford University, Stanford, CA, from July 7-10, 2025**.\n\n## TL;DR for Seasoned Authors\n\n*   Authors must submit abstracts by February 3 and full papers by February 10.\n*   Papers submitted to EC’25 must select one of four methodological tracks and several content areas.\n*   New this year: papers that have been submitted to a journal can be submitted to EC as long as they have not been accepted and have not received a request for revision. If they have received a revise and resubmit they CANNOT be submitted to EC.\n*   EC’25 is continuing the forward-to-journal option as in previous years.\n*   EC’25 is currently planned as a primarily in-person event.\n\n## Policy for Accepted Papers\n\nAt least one author of each accepted paper must attend and present the paper. Exceptions will be made in rare cases such as severe illness, visa denial, or a death in the family. In approved instances, authors will have the opportunity to present their work in the online preview week, either live or self-recorded. The presentation time will be 18 minutes.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n*   Submit a Paper: [https://ec2025.hotcrp.com/](https://ec2025.hotcrp.com/)\n*   The body of the submission (excluding the title page and the bibliography) may be up to 18 pages long.\n*   Authors will be required to format their submissions using the [EC’25 LaTex style files](https://ec25.sigecom.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ec25-submission-style-files.zip), which uses a single-column format with 10-point font. Papers that do not use the EC’25 LaTex style files or violate the page limit may be rejected without review.\n\n## Tracks\n\nEach submission must select one of four tracks that differ along methodological dimensions:\n\n*   **Theory:** Typical papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new techniques that could be applied more broadly.  Track chairs: Nima Haghpanah, Annie Liang, Ruta Mehta, Mallesh Pai, Grant Schoenebeck\n*   **Applied Modeling:** Typical papers in this track propose and analyze novel models that capture real-world phenomena or provide fresh perspectives on previously studied applied problems. Track chairs: Nick Arnosti, Eduardo Azevedo, Sigal Oren\n*   **Empirics:** Typical papers in this track draw significant insights from real or synthetic data, through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources or experiments. Track chairs: Chiara Farronato, Denis Nekipelov\n*   **AI:** Typical papers in this track apply the methods and models of artificial intelligence, including both theoretical and computational approaches, to topics at the intersection of economics and computing. Track chairs: Annie Liang, Grant Schoenebeck, Nisarg Shah\n\n## Areas\n\nEach submission must select at least one content area from the list provided below.  Content areas will be used to match papers with a member of the Senior Program Committee (SPC) who is assigned to at least one of the paper’s areas. SPCs are responsible for shepherding papers through the review process and for making accept/reject recommendations to the Track and Program Chairs.\n\n*   Agent-based modeling\n*   Algorithmic fairness and data privacy\n*   Auctions and pricing\n*   Behavioral economics and bounded rationality\n*   Blockchain and cryptocurrencies\n*   Contract design\n*   Crowdsourcing and information elicitation\n*   Decision theory\n*   Econometrics\n*   Economic aspects of learning algorithms\n*   Economic aspects of neural networks and large language models\n*   Equilibrium analysis, including price of anarchy\n*   Equilibrium computation and complexity\n*   Fair division\n*   Industrial organization\n*   Information design\n*   Laboratory and field experiments\n*   Market design & matching markets\n*   Market equilibria\n*   Mechanism design\n*   Online algorithms\n*   Online platforms and applications\n*   Social good and ethics\n*   Social choice & voting theory\n*   Social networks and social learning\n\n## Alternative Venues\n\nWe will ask the authors to specify alternative venues to which they would consider submitting the paper.\n\n## Review Process\n\nEach paper will be reviewed in detail by at least two referees. There will be two stages of review, with some decisions announced on March 27 after first-round reviews, and the remaining decisions announced on May 17 after a second round of reviews. Between April 22-25, authors of papers undergoing second-round reviewing will be able to submit responses to the reviews, which will be taken into account by the review team.\n\nThe review process is double blind.\n\n## Submission of code and data\n\nIn the interest of reproducibility, authors are strongly encouraged to submit their code and data, if any. Such material should be archived as a single zip file and submitted as supplementary material.\n\n## One-page extended abstract option\n\nTo accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper.\n\n## Submission of publicly available work\n\nIt is acceptable to submit work that has been presented in public (provided there are no published proceedings) or has been uploaded to arXiv or similar online archives, provided the submission itself is anonymized.\n\n## Simultaneous submissions to journals\n\nIt is acceptable to simultaneously submit a paper to EC’25 and to a journal, or to submit a paper that is already under review at a journal as long as the paper (a) has not been accepted by the journal, and (b) has not received a request for a revision (revise and resubmit, major or minor revision) by the journal.\n\n## No other simultaneous submissions\n\nThe following submissions are not allowed: (a) papers that are currently under review at another archival conference, (b) papers that have been accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference before the EC’25 submission deadline, (c) papers in which one or more of the contributions have previously been published or accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference.\n\n## Highlights beyond EC\n\nPapers that have already been published (or have been accepted for publication) in conferences or journals other than EC can be nominated (including self-nominations) for inclusion in a special plenary session at EC’25 called “Highlights beyond EC”.\n\n## Forward to journal\n\nAs in prior years, authors of accepted papers will have the option to select the forward-to-journal option to have the reviews forwarded to a journal of their choice.
