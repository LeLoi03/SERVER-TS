  "Call for Papers": "# FoSSaCS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 28th International Conference on Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures (FoSSaCS 2025) will be held in **Gothenburg, Sweden, from April 28 to May 2, 2025**.\n\nFoSSaCS seeks original papers on foundational research with a clear significance for software science. The conference invites submissions on theories and methods to support the analysis, integration, synthesis, transformation, and verification of programs and software systems.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe specific topics covered by the conference include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n*   categorical models and logics\n*   language theory, automata, and games\n*   modal, spatial, and temporal logics\n*   type theory and proof theory\n*   concurrency theory and process calculi\n*   rewriting theory\n*   semantics of programming languages\n*   program analysis, correctness, transformation, and verification\n*   logics of programming\n*   software specification and refinement\n*   models of concurrent, reactive, stochastic, distributed, hybrid, and mobile systems\n*   emerging models of computation\n*   logical aspects of computational complexity\n*   models of software security\n*   logical foundations of databases\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nFoSSaCS solicits just a single paper category—research papers. The page limit is 18 pages (excluding references), respecting the Springer’s LNCS format at the submission time. Additional material (no page limit) can be placed in a clearly marked appendix, at the end of the paper.\n\nPC submissions are not allowed.\n\nAll submissions should be made electronically through the EasyChair Conference System: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fossacs2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fossacs2025)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   Submission deadline: December 11, 2024\n*   Notification of acceptance: February 5, 2025\n*   Camera-ready version due: March 5, 2025\n\n## Artifact Evaluation\n\nFoSSaCS 2025 will have a post-paper-acceptance voluntary artifact evaluation. Authors will be encouraged to submit artifacts for evaluation after paper notification. The outcome will not alter the paper’s acceptance decision.\n\nFor more information about FoSSaCS artifact evaluation, please contact Ondřej Lengál.\n\n## Program Committee\n\n### PC Chairs\n\n*   Delia Kesner (Université Paris Cité, France)\n*   Parosh Aziz Abdulla (Uppsala University, Sweden)\n\n### PC Members\n\n*   Aiswarya Cyriac (Chennai Mathematical Institute, India)\n*   Aleksandar Nanevski (IMDEA Software Institute, Spain)\n*   Aleksy Schubert (University of Warsaw, Poland)\n*   Alwen Tiu (Australian National University, Australia)\n*   Ambrus Kaposi (Eötvös Loránd University, Hungary)\n*   Anthony Widjaja Lin (TU Kaiserslautern and MPI-SWS, Germany)\n*   Assia Mahboubi (Inria and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, France and The Netherlands)\n*   Caterina Urban (INRIA and PSL, France)\n*   Dana Fisman (Ben-Gurion University, Israel)\n*   Dylan McDermott (Reykjavik University, Island)\n*   James Worrell (University of Oxford, UK)\n*   Jean-François Raskin (Université libre de Bruxelles, Belgium)\n*   Karin Quaas (Universität Leipzig, Germany)\n*   Laure Daviaud (University of East Anglia, UK)\n*   Luca Padovani (Università di Camerino, Italy)\n*   Luis Caires (Técnico ULisboa and INESC ID, Portugal)\n*   Masha ShirMohammadi (CNRS, Université Paris Cité, France)\n*   Matija Pretnar (University of Ljubljana, Slovenia)\n*   Naoki Kobayashi (The University of Tokyo, Japan)\n*   Nathalie Bertrand (Inria, France)\n*   Orna Kupferman (Hebrew University, Israel)\n*   Patrick Totzke (University of Liverpool, UK)\n*   Prakash Saivasan (The Institute of Mathematical Sciences, India)\n*   Santiago Figueira (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina)\n*   Ugo Dal Lago (Università di Bologna, Italy)\n*   Yu-Fang Chen (Academia Sinica, Taiwan)\n*   Yuxin Deng (East China Normal University, China)\n*   Zena M.
