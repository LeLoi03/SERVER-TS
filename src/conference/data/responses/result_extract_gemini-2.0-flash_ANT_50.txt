  "Call for Papers": "# ANT 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 16th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks, and Technologies (ANT 2025) will be held in **Patras, Greece, from April 22-24, 2025**.\n\nANT 2025 is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results, and practical development experiences from all Ambient Systems, Networks, and Technologies-related areas.\n\nANT 2025 will be held in conjunction with the 8th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40).\n\n## Scope\n\nAmbient systems can be viewed as interconnected systems that exist anywhere and everywhere in the environment. These systems are able to work together in the network collaboratively or competitively to provide human users with their daily technological needs, during which these systems remain invisible. This concept has emerged as a major research area with many potential applications. This is because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the themes required such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, networks and communications, data science, Internet of Things, Smart Entities, etc.\n\n## Publication\n\nAll ANT 2025 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series online.\n\nProcedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect ([www.sciencedirect.com](http://www.sciencedirect.com/)), and will be freely available worldwide.\n\nAll papers in Procedia will be indexed by:\n\n*   Scopus ([www.scopus.com](http://www.scopus.com/))\n*   Thomson Reuters' Conference Proceeding Citation Index ([https://thomsonreuters.com/conference-proceedings-citation-index/](https://thomsonreuters.com/conference-proceedings-citation-index/))\n*   Engineering Village (Ei) ([www.engineeringvillage.com](http://www.engineeringvillage.com/))\n*   EI Compendex ([www.ei.org/compendex](http://www.ei.org/compendex))\n*   DBLP ([https://dblp.uni-trier.de/](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/))\n\nThe papers will contain linked references, XML versions, and citable DOI numbers.\n\n## Contact\n\n*   Home page\n*   Call for Papers\n*   Workshop\n*   Registration\n*   Conference Program\n*   Past ANT\n*   Contact us"
