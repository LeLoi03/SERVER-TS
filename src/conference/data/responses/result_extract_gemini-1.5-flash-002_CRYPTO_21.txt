  "Call for Papers": "# Crypto 2025: Call for Papers\n\nCrypto 2025 will take place in **Santa Barbara, USA, from August 17-21, 2025**.\n\nThis is the 45th annual international cryptology conference, organized by the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR). The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series.\n\n## General Information\n\nOriginal research papers are welcomed on any cryptographic topic, including but not limited to:\n\n*   Foundational theory and mathematics\n*   The design, proposal, and analysis of cryptographic primitives and protocols\n*   Secure implementation and optimization in hardware or software\n*   Applied aspects of cryptography\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission deadline at 23:59 AoE:** February 13, 2025\n*   **First round notification:** April 7, 2025\n*   **Rebuttal deadline:** April 12, 2025\n*   **Final notification:** May 3, 2025\n*   **Conference begins:** August 17, 2025\n\n## Review Process\n\nSubmissions must not substantially duplicate published work or work that has been submitted in parallel to any other journal or conference/workshop with published proceedings. Additionally, submissions may not be submitted to any other venue unless notified of rejection or withdrawn by the authors. Accepted submissions may not appear in any other conference or workshop that has proceedings.\n\nThe review process will consist of two rounds with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee will reject some submissions; the rest will proceed to the second round. At the end of the first round, the authors will be either notified of rejection, or invited to submit a response to questions from the program committee (if any). The authors' response will be used to make the final decision in the second round.\n\nThe double-blind review process will follow the IACR Conflict of Interest Policy. The authors will be asked, at submission time, to help identify program committee members with potential conflicts of interest.\n\n## Awards\n\nThe Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall Best Paper Award. The Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper(s) authored exclusively by students and postdocs (at the time of submission). As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.\n\n## Stipends\n\nStudents whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. A limited number of stipends will be available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Application instructions will be posted together with other registration information.\n\n## Program Committee\n\n### Program Co-chairs\n\n*   Seny Kamara, MongoDB and Brown University\n*   Yael Tauman Kalai, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\n\n### General Chair\n\n*   Francisco Rodríguez-Henríquez, Technology Innovation Institute (TII)"
