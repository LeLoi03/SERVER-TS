  "Call for Papers": "# PIMRC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 36th edition of the annual IEEE International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications (PIMRC) will be held in **İstanbul, Türkiye, from September 1-4, 2025.**\n\nPIMRC is one of the flagship conferences of the IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc) in wireless communications and networking.\n\n## Tracks\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit original technical papers, as well as proposals for special sessions and workshops, addressing a wide range of topics in wireless and mobile communications, including but not limited to:\n\n*   **Track 1: Fundamentals and PHY**\n*   **Track 2: MAC and Cross Layer Design**\n*   **Track 3: Mobile and Wireless Networks**\n*   **Track 4: Emerging Technologies, Applications and Platforms**\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Workshop Proposals:** February 16, 2025\n*   **Tutorial Proposals:** March 16, 2025\n*   **Paper Submissions:** April 13, 2025 (FINAL)\n*   **Panel Proposals:** May 15, 2025\n*   **Acceptance Notification:** June 1, 2025\n*   **Final Manuscripts:** June 22, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAll papers must be submitted to the official PIMRC 2025 submission system: [https://edas.info/N32873](https://edas.info/N32873)\n\n*   The page length limit for all initial submissions for review is SIX (6) printed pages (10-point font) and must be written in English. Initial submissions longer than SIX (6) pages will be rejected without review.\n*   All final submissions of accepted papers must be written in English with a maximum paper length of six (6) printed pages (10-point font) including figures. No more than one (1) additional printed page (10-point font) may be included in final submissions and the extra page (the 7th page) will incur an over length page charge of US$100.\n*   You may also use one of the following templates for Microsoft Word: A4, US letter.\n*   [Download Standard IEEE conference templates for LaTeX formats](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)\n\n## IEEE Policies\n\n*   The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Explore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.\n*   Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission).\n*   To be published in the IEEE PIMRC 2025 Conference Proceedings and to be eligible for publication in IEEE Xplore®, an author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the “FULL or LIMITED” rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC Chair grants permission for a substitute presenter in advance of the event and who is qualified both to present and answer questions. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one registration is valid for up to 3 papers. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE PIMRC 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore®."
