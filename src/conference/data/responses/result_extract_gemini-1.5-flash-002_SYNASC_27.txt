  "Call for Papers": "# SYNASC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 27th International Symposium on Symbolic and Numeric Algorithms for Scientific Computing (SYNASC 2025) will be held in **Timișoara, Romania, from September 22-25, 2025.**\n\nSYNASC aims to stimulate the interaction among multiple communities focusing on defining, optimizing, and executing complex algorithms in several application areas. The focus ranges from symbolic and numeric computation to formal methods applied to programming, artificial intelligence, distributed computing, and computing theory.\n\n## Topics\n\nSYNASC is organized into six tracks:\n\n*   **Symbolic Computation:** computer algebra, symbolic analysis, symbolic combinatorics, symbolic techniques applied to numerics, symbolic regression, hybrid symbolic and numeric algorithms, numerics and symbolics for geometry, programming with constraints, narrowing, applications of symbolic computation to artificial intelligence and vice-versa\n*   **Numerical Computing:** iterative approximation of fixed points, solving systems of nonlinear equations, numerical and symbolic algorithms for differential equations, numerical and symbolic algorithms for optimization, parallel algorithms for numerical computing, scientific visualization and image processing\n*   **Logic and Programming:** automatic reasoning, formal system verification, formal verification and synthesis, software quality assessment, static analysis, timing analysis, automated testing\n*   **Distributed Computing:** modelling of parallel and distributed systems, parallel and distributed algorithms, architectures for parallel and distributed systems, applications for parallel and distributed systems, acceleration of AI or Big Data applications using distributed and parallel computing, networked intelligence and Internet of Things\n*   **Artificial Intelligence:** knowledge discovery, representation, and management, automated reasoning, uncertain reasoning, and constraint strategies, recommender and expert systems, intelligent systems, agents, and networks, agent-based complex systems, AI-based systems for scientific computing, machine learning – including deep learning models and technologies, explainable and trustworthy AI, information retrieval, data mining, text mining and web mining, computational intelligence - including fuzzy, neural and evolutionary computing, AI applications: natural language processing, computer vision, signal processing, stock market, computational neuroscience, robotics, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, cybersecurity, digital design, online education, algorithm invention and analysis\n*   **Theory of Computing:** data structures and algorithms, combinatorial optimization, formal languages and combinatorics on words, graph-theoretic and combinatorial methods in computer science, algorithmic paradigms, including distributed, online, approximation, probabilistic, game-theoretic algorithms, computational complexity theory, including structural complexity, boolean complexity, communication complexity, average-case complexity, derandomization and property testing, logical approaches to complexity, including finite model theory, algorithmic and computational learning theory, aspects of computability theory, including computability in analysis and algorithmic information theory, proof complexity, computational social choice and game theory, new computational paradigms: CNN computing, quantum, holographic and other non-standard approaches to computability, randomized methods, random graphs, threshold phenomena and typical-case complexity, automata theory and other formal models, particularly in relation to formal verification methods such as model checking and runtime verification, applications of theory, including wireless and sensor networks, computational biology and computational economics, experimental algorithmics\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAll submissions must contain original research results and should not be submitted or published elsewhere. There are three categories of submissions:\n\n*   **Regular papers:** describing fully completed research results (up to 8 pages of text, excluding references, in the two-column paper style)\n*   **System descriptions and experimental papers:** describing software prototypes, results of simulations, or experimental data analysis, with a link to the reported results (up to 8 pages of text, excluding references, in the two-column paper style)\n*   **Short papers:** describing ongoing work, preliminary results and/or research challenges of PhD students (up to 4 pages of text, excluding references, in the two-columns paper style)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Proposals for special sessions, workshops, and tutorials:** March 15, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Paper submission for main tracks:** May 15, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Paper submission for workshops and special sessions:** June 15, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** July 25, 2025\n*   **Registration:** September 12, 2025\n*   **Revised papers according to the reviews:** September 12, 2025\n*   **Symposium:** September 22-25, 2025\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=synasc2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=synasc2025)\n\n## Collocated Events\n\n*   **AVM 2025:** (17th Alpine Verification Meeting) is collocated with SYNASC 2025.
