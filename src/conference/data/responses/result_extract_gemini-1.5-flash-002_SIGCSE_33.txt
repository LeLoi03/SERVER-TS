  "Call for Papers": "# ITiCSE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 30th annual ACM conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE 2025) will take place at **Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands, from June 30 to July 2, 2025**.\n\n## Paper Tracks\n\nPapers presented at ITiCSE address aspects of computing education, that is, the education of students who are studying computing.  A mandatory abstract submission is required for all papers and is due a week before the deadline for full papers. When making a submission, you will be asked to place it in one of three tracks:\n\n*   **Computing education research:** papers that define research questions, describe the data gathering and the methods used to address the questions, present the results, and discuss the contribution to knowledge about the teaching and learning of computing;\n*   **Experience reports and tools:** papers that describe computing education experiences, including tools that have been developed for use in computing education, in sufficient detail for others to see whether their use was beneficial and to be able to adopt them if required;\n*   **Position papers and proposals:** papers articulating original and well-argued positions on aspects of computing education, or proposals for work that is in its early stages; while these papers should be well situated in the literature, they need not report on work that has been completed; however, they must offer something of value to the community.\n\nAll papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and where there is an intervention contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention.\n\n## Submitting the Abstract\n\nYour abstract can be up to 250 words and **must be submitted by the paper abstract deadline** (see the sidebar for these dates). The abstract will be plain text â€” not, for example, a PDF.\n\n## Anonymous Version for Review\n\nThe paper submitted for review must be a fully anonymous version so as to allow the authors an unbiased review. The anonymous version should have ALL identifying references to the authors removed. Submissions that fully use the page limit, without leaving space for these items, will be rejected on the grounds of exceeding the page limit.\n\nPapers are expected to stand alone, and not to require the reading of supplementary information. For this reason, they should not include links to additional material, such as a demonstration of software being introduced.\n\n## Ethical Status of Data Collection\n\nAny submission that makes use of data from human participants must clearly indicate whether approval has been granted for the use of that data, by what authority, and what the approval covers.\n\n## Formatting the Paper\n\nThe paper is limited to a maximum of six pages plus one page for references.  For details regarding the mandatory formatting requirements, see [Formatting requirements](https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/#formatting) on the [Call for Participation](https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/) page.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Mandatory abstract submission:** January 12, 2025\n*   **Full paper submission:** January 19, 2025\n*   **Author notification:** March 3, 2025\n*   **Camera ready deadline:** November 16, 2025\n\n## Submitting the Paper\n\nFollow the instructions on [Submission process](https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/#process) at the foot of the [Call for Participation](https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/) page.\n\nPlease note: ITiCSE 2025 will be a face-to-face conference. Registration, attendance in person, presentation, and discussion are mandatory for at least one author, otherwise, your publication cannot be included in the proceedings.\n\n## Contact\n\nQuestions regarding paper submissions should be addressed to the program chairs: [iticse2025papers@easychair.org](mailto:iticse2025papers@easychair.org)."
