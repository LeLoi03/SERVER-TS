  "Call for Papers": "# SYSTOR 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe ACM International Systems and Storage Conference (SYSTOR 2025) is an international forum for interaction across the systems research community. SYSTOR 2025 will be held **virtually on September 8–9**, followed by the **Israeli Systems & AI Workshop (ISW), which will be held physically in Haifa on September 10**.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nSYSTOR has traditionally welcomed academic and industrial papers in systems, including storage, cloud and distributed systems, networking, and systems security, broadly construed. SYSTOR encourages submissions that describe results from experimental system prototypes, as well as experience papers describing practical deployments and valuable lessons learned from them. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Systems and workload optimization for AI/ML systems\n*   Sustainability/carbon footprint of computer and network systems\n*   System security and trust\n*   Big Data infrastructure\n*   Cloud, edge, data center, and distributed systems\n*   Embedded and real-time systems\n*   Fault tolerance, reliability, and availability\n*   File and storage systems\n*   Networked, mobile, wireless, peer-to-peer, and sensor systems\n*   Operating systems, computer architecture, and their interactions\n*   Performance evaluation and workload characterization\n*   Runtime systems and compiler/programming-language support\n*   System deployment, usage, and experience\n*   System design or adaptation for emerging storage technologies\n*   Virtualization and containers\n*   Storage 3.0\n*   Systems for AI and AI for Systems\n\n## Submission Categories\n\nSYSTOR 2025 solicits submissions in two separate categories:\n\n*   **Full Papers Track:** original research, at most 12 pages, excluding references\n*   **Short Papers Track:** original research, at most 5 pages, excluding references\n*   **Posters with Extended Abstract Track:** original work presented as a poster, accompanied by an extended abstract in the conference proceedings\n\n## Important Dates\n\n### Full and Short Papers Track\n\n*   **Paper Submission:** May 20, 2025 (23:59 AoE)\n*   **Acceptance Notification:** July 10, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready:** August 21, 2025\n\n### Posters with Extended Abstract Track\n\n*   **Poster & Abstract Submission:** July 3, 2025 (23:59 AoE)\n*   **Acceptance Notification:** July 17, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready:** August 21, 2025\n\n### Conference\n\n*   **Conference:** September 8-10, 2025\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nResearch papers (full and short) should be submitted through: [https://systor25.hotcrp.com/](https://systor25.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Review Process\n\nThe program committee will review submissions in a double-blind manner. All submissions should be properly anonymized, and all identifiable information should be removed whenever possible, including obvious self-references. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.\n\n## Copyright and Originality\n\nSYSTOR will enforce ACM’s plagiarism policy regarding copying and resubmitting prior work. Simultaneous submissions are not allowed.\n\n## Formatting Instructions\n\nSubmissions must be printable PDF files.
