  "Call for Papers": "# MICRO 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe International Symposium on Microarchitecture® (MICRO) is the premier forum for the presentation and discussion of new ideas in microarchitecture, compilers, hardware/software interfaces, and design of advanced computing and communication systems.  MICRO 2025 will be held in **Seoul, South Korea, from October 18–22, 2025**.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Deadline:** April 4, 2025 at 11:59 PM EDT\n*   **Full Paper Deadline:** April 11, 2025 at 11:59 PM EDT\n*   **Rebuttal/Revision:** June 9-21, 2025\n*   **Author Notification:** July 14, 2025\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe invite original paper submissions related to (but not limited to) the following topics:\n\n*   Microarchitectural, architectural, compiler, and hybrid techniques for improving system performance, power, energy-efficiency, security, cost, complexity, programmer productivity, predictability, quality of service, reliability, dependability, scalability, sustainability\n*   Processor, memory, and storage architectures\n*   Multicore and multiprocessor systems\n*   Instruction-, thread-, and data-level parallelism\n*   Prediction and Speculation\n*   Memory Hierarchy\n*   Cloud and datacenter-scale computing\n*   IoT, mobile, and embedded architecture\n*   Interconnection network, router, and network interface architecture\n*   Accelerator-based, application-specific, and reconfigurable architectures\n*   Architectural support for programming languages, compilation, software development, security and privacy, virtualization\n*   Architectures for emerging technologies and applications\n*   Architectural support for non-volatile/persistent memory\n*   Quantum computing\n*   In-/near-memory or in-/near-storage processing\n*   Approximate computing and architectural support for approximation\n*   Effects of circuits and technology on architecture\n*   Architecture modeling and simulation methodologies\n*   Evaluation and measurement of real computing systems\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions should follow the guidelines and formatting rules specified on the conference website. Papers that violate these guidelines and rules may be returned to author(s) without review. Papers will go through a rigorous peer-review process. All accepted papers will be presented at the conference.\n\n## Program Chairs' Policy\n\nThe Program Chair(s) are responsible for the paper selection process and do not submit papers to avoid potential bias. Program Committee members and the Organizing Committee, including the General Chair(s), are allowed to submit papers because of double-blind reviewing and conflict-of-interest declaration and enforcement. The rationale for explicitly allowing General Chair(s) to submit is that they do not participate in the paper selection process, nor are they involved in the Program Chair and Program Committee selection process.
