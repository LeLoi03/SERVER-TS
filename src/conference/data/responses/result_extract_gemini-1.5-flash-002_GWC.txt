  "Call for Papers": "# GWC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 13th International Global WordNet Conference (GWC 2025) will be held in **Pavia, Italy, from January 27-31, 2025**.\n\n## Conference Topics\n\nWe invite submissions of original research contributions addressing, though not limited to, the following topics:\n\n*   **Lexical semantics and meaning representation:** Critical analysis and applications of lexical and semantic relations; Proposed new relations; Definitions, semantic components, co-occurrence and frequency statistics; Word, sense, and context embeddings; Necessity and completeness issues; Ontology and wordnet; Lexical semantics of emotions and other lexical fields of interest for lexical typology (e.g., body parts, colors, motion verbs, etc.); Wordnets and other modalities; Wordnets and other theoretical frameworks for modelling lexical semantics; Other lexicographical and lexicological questions pertaining to wordnet-style meaning representation.\n*   **Architecture of lexical databases:** Language independent and language dependent components; Integration of multi-wordnets in research infrastructures (e.g., CLARIN, ELG, ELRA, etc.); Wordnets and Linked Open Data (LOD).\n*   **Tools and methods for wordnet development:** User and data entry interfaces; Methods for constructing, extending, and enriching wordnets; Methods for linking wordnets to other lexical and semantic resources; Methods for leveraging existing wordnets and semantic networks with large language models; Wordnets for under-resourced languages.\n*   **Applications of wordnet:** Word sense disambiguation; Text generation; Commonsense reasoning; Machine translation; Information extraction and retrieval; Document structuring and categorization; Text classification; Automatic hyperlinking; Language teaching; Psycholinguistic applications; Embeddings and pretrained language models; Probing large language models.\n*   **Standardization, distribution and availability of wordnets and wordnet tools:** Best practices for wordnet maintenance, standardization, and distribution; Evaluation metrics for wordnet tools and resources; Interoperability across wordnets and wordnet tools; Licensing and legal considerations for wordnets distribution; APIs and other web services for accessing wordnets; Strategies for community involvement in wordnet standardization.\n\n## Submission Categories\n\nSubmissions should fall into one of the following categories (page limits exclude references):\n\n*   **Long papers:** 8 pages max, 30-minute presentation\n*   **Short papers:** 5 pages max, 15-minute presentation\n*   **Project reports:** 5 pages max, 10-minute presentation\n*   **Demonstrations:** 5 pages max, with up to 3 additional pages for screenshots or images, 20-minute presentation\n\nSubmissions must be anonymized, and any identifying information must be removed. Authors should indicate their preferred submission category; however, the final category of acceptance may be adjusted by the organizing and scientific committees (e.g., if need be, a long paper submission may be accepted as a short paper).\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nTo enhance replicability and transparency, authors are encouraged to share the data and code used in their research, whenever possible in an anonymized form. We recommend exploring data repositories that support anonymization techniques and open-source code hosting platforms like GitHub.\n\nCamera-ready and final papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format only. Paper submissions must adhere to the official ACL style templates available [here](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/stylesheets) for LaTeX and Word. Please also follow the general paper formatting guidelines established by the “ACL” conferences available [here](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/stylesheets).\n\nPapers must be submitted via the EasyChair website: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gwc2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gwc2025)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **New Paper Submission Deadline:** October 14, 2024\n*   **Notification of Acceptance:** November 18, 2024\n*   **Camera-Ready Submission Deadline:** January 10, 2025\n*   **Conference Dates:** January 27-31, 2025\n*   **Final Paper Submission for Proceedings:** February 28, 2025"
