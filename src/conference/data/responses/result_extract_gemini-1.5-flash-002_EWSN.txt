  "Call for Papers": "# EWSN 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 22nd International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks (EWSN 2025) will be held in **Leuven, Belgium, from September 22–25, 2025.**\n\nEWSN is a highly selective single-track international conference focusing on the latest research in embedded systems and wireless networking and their role as key enablers for visionary scenarios such as the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems.\n\nThis year’s edition will highlight a feature topic in **Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)**.\n\n## Specific Topics\n\nSpecific topics for the conference include (but are not exclusively limited to):\n\n*   AI-operated wireless sensing, actuation, and control systems\n*   Applications and opportunities for networked embedded systems in developing countries\n*   Applications of wireless embedded networks in various domains: health, automation, manufacturing, transportation, etc.\n*   Architectures and infrastructures for edge-cloud solutions that integrate networked embedded systems\n*   Communication and networking for wireless and embedded systems\n*   Computing architectures for networked embedded systems\n*   Dependability in wireless systems, including reliability, availability, safety, and real-time guarantees\n*   Edge/embedded intelligence paradigms, models, and techniques for networked embedded systems\n*   Foundation models and generative AI for networked embedded systems\n*   TinyML and on-device AI for networked embedded systems\n*   Empirical studies, measurement, validation, deployment, and experience reports\n*   Human-centric interaction with wireless and embedded systems\n*   Localization and context-awareness for embedded wireless systems and networks\n*   Modeling, simulation, and measurement tools for wireless systems and applications\n*   Neuromorphic computing\n*   Next-generation wireless networks, including 6G\n*   New communication techniques for embedded systems (Wi-Fi HaLow, NearLink, etc.)\n*   Operating systems, middleware, and services for networked embedded systems\n*   Privacy and security in networked embedded systems and applications\n*   Processing, storage, and management of data in embedded wireless networks\n*   Sustainable applications of networked embedded systems (low-power operation, energy harvesting, etc.)\n*   Embedded systems for joint sensing and communication with mmwave, Terahertz, Wi-Fi, visible light, etc.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nEWSN 2025 will have two submission deadlines, one in the winter and one in the spring.\n\n*   **Winter submission deadline:** December 1, 2024\n*   **Notification of acceptance (winter submission):** February 1, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready submission deadline (winter submission):** March 1, 2025\n*   **Spring submission deadline:** May 1, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance (spring submission):** June 15, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready submission deadline (spring submission):** July 1, 2025\n\n## Submission Details\n\nAny paper submitted to EWSN 2025 must be original (i.e., not previously published) and should not have been published, accepted for publication, or be under review by any other venue (including other conferences, workshops, or journals).\n\nThe conference will accept two types of papers – Full Papers (max 12 pages) and Short Papers (max 6 pages). Short papers are intended to present preliminary research results or advocate for new research directions; their titles should be prepended with “Vision paper: / Position paper: / WiP paper” when they are submitted for review as well as in the final proceedings. Authors should carefully consider the distinction between Full Papers and Short Papers; papers submitted in one category will not be considered in the other category.\n\nEWSN 2025 will use a double-anonymous review policy. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed.\n\n## Submission System\n\nSubmissions are via HotCRP: [https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/](https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/)\n\nDecisions will be: accept, reject, or one-shot revision; papers receiving a “one-shot revision” for the winter deadline will be invited to submit a revised paper by the summer deadline.  Authors of papers rejected in the winter cycle may submit a revised paper in the spring cycle along with a cover letter explaining how/why the new revision addresses all the concerns raised by the reviewers."
