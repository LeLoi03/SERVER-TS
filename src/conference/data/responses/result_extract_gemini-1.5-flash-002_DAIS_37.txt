  "Call for Papers": "# DAIS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nDAIS 2025 is one of three conferences at DisCoTec 2025. The DAIS conference series addresses all practical and conceptual aspects of distributed applications, including their design, modeling, implementation, and operation.\n\n## Scope\n\nSubmissions will be judged on their originality, significance, clarity, relevance, and technical correctness. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   **Novel and innovative distributed applications and systems:** middleware, cloud, edge and fog computing, big data processing, distributed embedded machine learning (TinyML), streaming and complex event processing, distributed social networking, IoT and cyber-physical systems, mobile computing, advanced networking (SDN/NFV), micro-services and service-oriented computing, peer-to-peer systems, and data center and internet-scale systems.\n*   **Novel architectures and mechanisms:** publish/subscribe systems, epidemic protocols, language-based approaches, virtualization and resource allocation, distributed storage, trusted execution environments, blockchains, cryptocurrencies and smart contracts, and distributed consensus mechanisms.\n*   **System issues and design goals:** interoperability and adaptation, self-* properties (e.g., self-organization, self-management,…), security and practical applications of cryptography, trust and privacy, cooperation incentives and fairness, fault-tolerance and dependability, scalability and elasticity, and tail-performance and energy-efficiency.\n\n## Submission and Publication\n\nAll papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Each paper will undergo a thorough peer review by the Program Committee. DAIS 2025 offers three submission tracks:\n\n*   Full research papers (no more than 15 pages + 2 pages references)\n*   Full practical experience reports (no more than 15 pages + 2 pages references)\n*   Work-in-progress papers (no more than 6 pages + 2 pages references)\n\nPublication of proceedings is coordinated among the three DisCoTec conferences.\n\n## Submission Link\n\nSubmissions are via EasyChair at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dais2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dais2025).\n\n## Publication\n\nThe DAIS proceedings will be published by Springer as an LNCS-IFIP volume and will comprise accepted submissions from all categories.\n\n## Important Dates (Extended)\n\n*   **Abstract submission:** February 14, 2025\n*   **Paper submission:** February 21, 2025\n*   **Artefact submission:** February 28, 2025\n*   **Artefact kick-the-tires - problem reports:** March 10, 2025\n*   **Artefact kick-the-tires - author response:** March 17, 2025\n*   **Artefact notification:** April 4, 2025\n*   **Paper notification:** April 4, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready:** April 23, 2025 (TBC)\n*   **Conference:** June 16-20, 2025\n\n**Deadlines expire at 23:59 anywhere on earth on the dates displayed above.**\n\n## Program Committee Chairs\n\n*   Daniel Balouek (Inria, France)\n*   Ibéria Medeiros (University of Lisbon, Portugal)\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Pierre Louis Aublin, IIJ Research laboratory, Japan\n*   Christian Berger, University of Passau, Germany\n*   David Bermbach, TU Berlin, Germany\n*   Lorenzo Carnevale, Universty of Messina, Italy\n*   Zhiyuan Chen, University of Maryland Baltimore County, USA\n*   Davide Frey, Inria, France\n*   Shashikant Ilager, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands\n*   Pradeeban Kathiravelu, University of Alaska Anchorage, USA\n*   Odorico Machado Mendizabal, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Brazil\n*   Anas Mokhtari, Morocco\n*   Guillaume Pierre, University of Rennes/Inria/CNRS/IRISA, France\n*   Hans Reiser, Reykjavik University, Iceland\n*   Etienne Rivière, UC Louvain, Belgique\n*   Guillaume Rosinosky, IMT Atlantique, France\n*   Valerio Schiavoni, University of Neuchâtel, Switzerland\n*   Ali Shoker, KAUST, Saudi Arabia\n*   Luís Antunes Veiga, University of Lisbon, Portugal\n*   Spyros Voulgaris, Athens University of Economics and Business, Greece\n\n## Artifact Evaluation Committee\n\n*   Alan Oliveira de Sá, LASIGE & Faculdade de Ciências, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal\n*   Cláudia Brito, INESC TEC & U.
