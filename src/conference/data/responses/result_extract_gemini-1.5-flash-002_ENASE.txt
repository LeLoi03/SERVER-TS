  "Call for Papers": "# ENASE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nENASE (Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering) is a prime international forum to discuss and publish research findings and IT industry experiences with relation to novel approaches to software engineering. The conference acknowledges evolution in systems and software thinking due to contemporary shifts of computing paradigm to e-services, cloud computing, mobile connectivity, business processes, and societal participation. By publishing the latest research on novel approaches to software engineering and by evaluating them against systems and software quality criteria, ENASE conferences advance knowledge and research in software engineering, including and emphasizing service-oriented, business-process driven, and ubiquitous mobile computing. ENASE aims at identifying most hopeful trends and proposing new directions for consideration by researchers and practitioners involved in large-scale systems and software development, integration, deployment, delivery, maintenance and evolution.\n\n## Conference Areas\n\n1.  **Theory and Practice of Systems and Applications Development**\n2.  **Challenges and Novel Approaches to Systems and Software Engineering (SSE)**\n3.  **Systems and Software Quality**\n4.  **Systems and Software Engineering (SSE) for Emerging Domains**\n\n## Keynote Speakers\n\n*   Wim Vanhaverbeke, FBE, University of Antwerp, Belgium\n*   Loic Bachelart, Microsoft, France\n*   Philipp Leitner, Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nAuthors can submit their work in the form of a complete paper or an abstract. Complete papers can be submitted as a Regular Paper, representing completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, portraying a short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue.\n\n*   Authors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics.\n*   To facilitate the double-blind paper evaluation method, authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors.\n*   All papers must be submitted through the online submission platform PRIMORIS and should follow the instructions and templates that can be found under Guidelines and Templates.\n\n## Publications\n\nAll accepted complete papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and on digital support. The proceedings will be submitted for indexation by SCOPUS, Google Scholar, DBLP, Semantic Scholar, EI, and Web of Science / Conference Proceedings Citation Index.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Conference Date:** April 4 - 6, 2025\n*   **Regular Papers Paper Submission:** November 18, 2024\n*   **Regular Papers Authors Notification:** January 6, 2025\n*   **Regular Papers Camera Ready and Registration:** January 23, 2025\n*   **Position Papers /Regular Papers Paper Submission:** January 3, 2025\n*   **Position Papers /Regular Papers Authors Notification:** January 30, 2025\n*   **Position Papers /Regular Papers Camera Ready and Registration:** February 12, 2025\n*   **Late-Breaking Paper Submission:** January 23, 2025\n*   **Late-Breaking Authors Notification:** February 13, 2025\n*   **Late-Breaking Camera Ready and Registration:** February 20, 2025\n*   **Workshops Workshop Proposal:** November 27, 2024\n*   **Special Sessions Special Session Proposal:** November 27, 2024\n*   **Tutorials Tutorial Proposal:** February 18, 2025\n*   **Demos Demo Proposal:** February 18, 2025\n*   **Panels Panel Proposal:** February 18, 2025\n*   **Abstracts Track Abstract Submission:** January 30, 2025\n*   **Abstracts Track Authors Notification:** February 13, 2025\n*   **Abstracts Track Camera Ready and Registration:** February 21, 2025\n\n**Note:** All dates refer to AOE time, i.e., \"Anywhere on Earth\"\n\n## Conference Chair\n\nLeszek Maciaszek, Macquarie Univ., Australia and Wroclaw Univ. of Economics and Business, Poland\n\n## Program Co-Chairs\n\n*   Mike Mannion, Computing, Glasgow Caledonian University, United Kingdom\n*   Tomi Mannisto, University of Helsinki, Finland"
