The conference will be held **in person** in **Cagliari, Italy, from March 24-27, 2025**.\n\n## Theme\n\nSustainability, covering a wide variety of topics such as intelligent user interfaces accounting social inclusion, interactive intelligent systems for environmental sustainability, human control of energy management or resource conservation, behavioural change, and data-driven decision making for environmental monitoring. While we encourage submissions related to this theme, the scope of the conference is not limited to the theme only.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nIUI topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Human-centered AI methods, approaches, and systems\n*   Explainable AI methods\n*   Democratization of AI\n*   Persuasive technologies in IUI\n*   Privacy and security of IUI\n*   Recommendations in IUI\n*   Knowledge-based approaches to user interface design and generation\n*   User modeling for intelligent interfaces\n*   User-adaptive interaction and personalization\n*   IUI for crowd computing and human computation\n*   Human control in daily automations\n*   Computational innovation\n*   Interactive machine learning\n*   Human-in-the-loop AI testing and debugging\n*   Human-centered recommendation and recommender systems\n*   Generative models\n*   Human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning\n*   Intelligent user interfaces for generative AI\n*   Innovative User Interfaces\n*   Affective interfaces\n*   Intelligent aesthetic interfaces\n*   Intelligent collaborative interfaces\n*   Intelligent AR/VR interfaces\n*   Intelligent visualization and visual analytics\n*   Intelligent wearable and mobile interfaces\n*   Intelligent tangible interfaces\n*   Intelligent Multimodal Systems\n*   Embodied agents\n*   Multimodal AI assistants\n*   Intelligent multimodal interfaces\n*   Evaluations of Intelligent User Interfaces\n*   User experiments and studies\n*   Reproducibility (including benchmarks, datasets, and challenges)\n*   Meta-analysis\n*   Mixed-methods evaluations\n*   Intelligent Applications\n*   Education and learning-related technologies\n*   Healthcare and wellbeing\n*   Automotive\n*   Assistive technologies\n*   Entertainment\n*   Workplace happiness\n*   Social media\n*   Information retrieval\n*   Internet of things (IoT)\n*   Smart homes\n*   Generative AI\n*   Large Language Models\n*   End-user interaction with LLMs and Multimodal models (e.g., chatbots, image generation)\n*   LLMs in the workplace\n*   Trustworthy LLMs\n*   Bias in LLMs\n*   The effects of LLMs use on creative tasks\n*   Personalized user interaction with LLMs\n*   Prompt Engineering\n*   User control and steering of LLMs (e.g. RLHF)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract:** October 3, 2024\n*   **Full Paper:** October 10, 2024\n*   **Initial decisions released:** December 12, 2024\n*   **Rebuttal period (by invitation only):** December 12-19, 2024\n*   **Notification Sent:** January 9, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready:** January 30, 2025\n\n## Submission Process\n\nAll materials must be submitted electronically to PCS 2.0 ([https://new.precisionconference.com/~sigchi](https://new.precisionconference.com/~sigchi)) by the abstract and paper deadline.\n\n## Anonymization\n\nACM IUI uses a double-blind review process. All submissions (and supplemental materials) must be appropriately anonymized.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nAuthors are asked to make their paper submissions accessible. The authors of accepted papers will be required to make their final PDFs accessible.\n\n## Submission Format and Length\n\nWe will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow. Papers are of variable length. We encourage authors to stay within a 10,000-word limit. Authors of papers exceeding 12,000 words should add a note at the end of their manuscript explaining how the length of the paper is commensurate with the contribution of the work.\n\n## Supplemental Materials\n\nSubmitting supplemental material (e.g., questionnaires, demo videos of applications, data sheets) is optional but encouraged.\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n*   Luis A. Leiva, University of Luxembourg\n*   Davide Spano, University of Cagliari\n*   Katrien Verbert, KU Leuven University"
