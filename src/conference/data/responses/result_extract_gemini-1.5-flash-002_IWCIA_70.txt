  "Call for Papers": "# IWCIA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe International Workshop on Combinatorial Image Analysis (IWCIA 2025) will be held in **hybrid mode** with a base in **Szeged, Hungary, from September 24-26, 2025**.\n\n## Scope\n\nImage analysis is a scientific discipline providing theoretical foundations and methods for solving problems appearing in a wide range of areas, as diverse as medicine, robotics, defense, and security. Combinatorial image analysis often features various advantages (in terms of efficiency and accuracy) over the more traditional approaches based on continuous models requiring numeric computation.\n\nThe Workshop is a forum for current research on the following (or similar) research subjects which are directly or potentially applicable to image analysis:\n\n*   Combinatorial problems in the discrete plane and space\n*   Lattice polygons and polytopes\n*   Digital/combinatorial geometry and topology\n*   Digital manifolds\n*   Geometry of digital curves and surfaces\n*   Analysis and processing of digital surfaces with singularities\n*   Homotopy of digital manifolds; thinning algorithms and skeletons\n*   Boundary tracking of digital solids; Geometric characteristics of object boundaries\n*   Multigrid convergence analysis of metric-based descriptors\n*   Tilings and patterns; Combinatorial pattern matching\n*   Computational geometry and imaging sciences\n*   Integer programming, linear programming, and graph theoretic models and approaches to problems of image analysis\n*   Image representation, segmentation, grouping, and reconstruction\n*   Processing “very large” digital pictures; Methods for image compression\n*   Parallel architectures and algorithms\n*   Fuzzy and stochastic image analysis\n*   Discrete tomography\n*   Grammars and models for image or scene analysis and recognition; cellular automata\n*   Mathematical morphology and image analysis\n*   Applications in medical imaging, biometrics, computer vision, image understanding, robotics, metrology, and others\n*   AI and machine learning in imaging and image analysis\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit a paper on some of the Workshop’s topics or a closely related topic. The submitted work should contain only results that are unpublished and not included in other work considered for publication elsewhere.  All manuscripts must be prepared according to the LNCS requirements and submitted electronically in PDF format using the [Microsoft CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IWCIA2025). The length should be at least 10 pages. The manuscripts may not contain information revealing authors’ identity.\n\nPapers will be reviewed thoroughly with an emphasis on potential to contribute to the state-of-the-art in the field. Each paper will receive at least two double-blind reviews ensuring maximal objectiveness. Selection criteria will include mathematical depth, accuracy and originality of the ideas, clarity and significance of the results, and presentation quality.\n\nThe notification of acceptance will be sent by email on a rolling basis (at most 4 weeks after the submission). The accepted papers should be revised according to the referees’ comments and submitted in camera-ready form by together with all the source files and the signed copyright form. The final version should be prepared strictly following requirements.\n\nThe accepted papers will be published in a volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (Springer) series (approved). The volume will be published after the conference and the authors will receive electronic access to their papers. During the conference, they will have access to the abstracts. A special journal issue can be arranged after the conference.\n\nAuthors should consult [author’s guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) for the preparation of their papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form.\n\nA paper will be included in the proceedings only if at least one regular or online author registers and pays the registration fee. The author takes on the obligation to attend the workshop and present the paper.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission open:** April 30, 2025\n*   **Submission deadline:** June 30, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance (on a rolling basis; 4 weeks after submission):** at latest August 17, 2025\n*   **Revised submission deadline (camera-ready version):** October 15, 2025\n*   **Registration open:** May 30, 2025\n*   **Registration deadline:** September 7, 2025\n*   **IWCIA 2025, Szeged:** September 24-26, 2025"
