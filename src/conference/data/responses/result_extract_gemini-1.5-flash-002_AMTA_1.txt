  "Call for Papers": "# AMTA 2025 Virtual: Call for Proposals\n\nThe Association for Machine Translation in the Americas (AMTA) announces the first call for proposals for **Emerging AI Breakthroughs and Challenges in Translation Automation**, a **one-day virtual event** to be held on **Thursday, September 25, 2025**.\n\n## Focus\n\nThe event will focus on advances in technologies and processes that leverage generative AI, agentic AI, Large Language Models, reasoning LLMs, Machine Translation, and any combination of them, that address challenges in multilingual communication and the provisioning of high-quality translation or interpretation.\n\n## Call for Submissions\n\nWe invite researchers, developers, and practitioners to contribute to a substantive dialogue at the intersection of AI innovation and multilingual challenges.  We welcome proposals for presentations and tutorials on all topics related to research, development, application, and evaluation of these technologies as they apply to cross- and multilingual technology(ies).\n\nWe seek submissions for:\n\n*   20-minute talks (15-minute presentations plus 5 minutes for questions)\n*   40-minute tutorials (practical descriptions or exercises)\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest might include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n*   The use of Large Language Models for Translation, Transcreation, and other cross- and multilingual tasks: development, deployment, and adaptation to specific use-cases.\n*   Application of agentic and reasoning LLMs to translation automation: case studies and experiments.\n*   Adaptation and customization of large language models for cross- and multilingual use cases: case studies on applying few-shot learning, RAG, prompt-tuning and fine-tuning, comparison of methodologies.\n*   Combining narrow and large models to improve performance of specific tasks, such as translation, OCR, ASR and others.\n*   Augmenting MT systems and other Human Language Technologies (HLT) with AI: including approaches to leveraging TM and end-user feedback, classification, context awareness, content moderation, sentiment analysis, domain-specificity, geolocation, summarization.\n*   Integrating MT into AI-powered TRS workflows: transcription, translation, and optimization, domain-specific processing, multilingual entity intelligence, summarization and roundup, etc.\n*   Training Data: data sources, data preparation, terminology, knowledge graphs, data augmentation, multimodal data, etc.\n*   Output quality and confidence scoring for cross- and multilingual tasks: tools, methods, and metrics, such as human evaluations, automatic scoring, reference-based and source-only scoring.\n*   Challenges to adopting AI in cross- and multilingual use cases: Responsible deployment and regulatory considerations of generative AI (such as technical, ethical, social, legal, and environmental challenges).\n*   Generative and agentive AI use for professional translation: Approaches, success and failure stories, fair pricing models, and cognitive load.\n*   Business Cases: making the business case for or against adopting AI to drive business requirements.\n*   Future research directions: open problems that researchers are/should be considering in this area.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nProposals should be submitted in PDF format by **June 23, 2025**, to [submissions@amtaweb.org](mailto:submissions@amtaweb.org) and include:\n\n*   Title of proposed session\n*   Type of proposed session (20-minute presentation or 40-minute tutorial)\n*   A 250-500 word description of the proposed session\n*   Name and e-mail address of the person submitting the proposal\n*   Name(s) and e-mail address(es) of proposed speakers\n*   A short (<100 words) biographical introduction to the proposed presenter(s)\n*   Any special technical requirements you may have\n\n## Publication and Recording\n\nPresentation proposals will be reviewed and selected by an AMTA-selected program committee based on submitted, non-anonymous abstracts. Accepted abstracts will be available to conference attendees on the conference platform and will otherwise not be published. Any research papers submitted for presentation will also follow this same process and will not follow a double-blind peer review process. Video recordings will be made of each presentation and will be made available to association members on the AMTA website. Submission of a proposal will be understood by the Organizing Committee as your tacit permission for AMTA to create an audio and video recording of your presentation and make it available to conference attendees and, through archiving, to members of AMTA, EAMT, and AAMT.\n\n## Contacts\n\n*   Jay Marciano, President ([president@amtaweb.org](mailto:president@amtaweb.org))\n*   Alex Yanishevsky, Vice President ([vicepresident@amtaweb.org](mailto:vicepresident@amtaweb.org))\n*   Marianna Martindale, Secretary ([secretary@amtaweb.org](mailto:secretary@amtaweb.org))"
