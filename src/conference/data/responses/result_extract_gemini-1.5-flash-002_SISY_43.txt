  "Call for Papers": "# SISY 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Intelligent Systems and Informatics (SISY 2025) will be held in **Subotica, Serbia, on September 25-27, 2025.** The conference is **in-person** with **onsite presentations only**.\n\nAuthors are welcome to submit original and unpublished papers which are not currently under review by another conference or journal and addressing state-of-the-art research.\n\n## IEEE Publication\n\nThe conference appears on the IEEE Conference Search. Conference proceedings that meet IEEE quality review standards may be eligible for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from IEEE Xplore), if the paper is not presented at the conference. 'Pay to publish' is not allowed by IEEE. So at least one author of a paper must show up and present the paper at the conference.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe aim of SISY 2025 Symposium is to offer researchers an opportunity to extend the existing scientific relationships all over the world in the field of Intelligent Systems including Fuzzy Systems, Fuzzy and Neuro-Fuzzy Control, Knowledge Based Systems, Expert Systems, Intelligent Robotics, Reasoning, Learning, Robotic Systems, Human-Robotic Interaction, Service Robots, Surgery Robots, Intelligent Mechatronics, Cybermedical Systems, CAD/CAM/CAE Systems, Intelligent Manufacturing Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Machine learning, Deep learning, Engineering Education, 5G and Cybersecurity, Digitalisation, Generation Research, Consumer Trends, Women in Engineering and Informatics.\n\n## Topics\n\n*   **Computational Intelligence** (track chair: Amir Mosavi): Machine Learning, Genetic Algorithms, Neural Nets, Fuzzy Systems, Fuzzy and Neuro-Fuzzy Control, Knowledge Based Systems, Expert Systems\n*   **Intelligent Robotics** (track chair: Enikő Nagy): Control, Flexible Arm Control, Perception and Recognition, Reasoning, Learning, Robotic Systems, Human-Robotic Interaction, Service Robots, Surgery Robots, Machine Vision\n*   **Intelligent Mechatronics** (track chair: Radu-Emil Precup): Sensing and Sensor Data Fusion, Motion Control, Intelligent Actuators\n*   **Intelligent Manufacturing Systems** (track chair: László Horváth): Flexible Manufacturing Systems, Production Planning and Scheduling, System Simulation, Rapid Prototyping, Concurrent Engineering, Virtual Reality\n*   **Informatics** (track chair: György Eigner): The Web, Business & Digital Culture, Databases, Design & Graphics, Digital Audio, Video and Photography, Hardware, Home & Office, Networking & Sys Admin, Operating Systems, programming, Science & Math, Security Software Engineering, Healthcare Informatics, Teaching Informatics, Informatics in education process\n*   **Applied Mathematics** (track chair: Ivana Štajner-Papuga)\n\n## Special Sessions\n\n*   Special Session on PhD Student Research in Applied Informatics (organized by László Horváth)\n*   Special Session on Digitalisation, Generation Research, Consumer Trends (organized by Mónika Garai-Fodor, Ágnes Csiszárik-Kocsir and János Varga)\n*   Special Session on 5G and Cybersecurity (organized by Anna Bánáti and Miklós Kozlovszky)\n*   Special Session on Soft Computing-driven Intelligent Systems and Applications (organized by Edit Laufer and Ákos Odry)\n*   Special Session on Women in Engineering and Informatics (organized by Melánia Puskás and Andrea Tick)\n\n## Plenary Speakers\n\n*   Márta Takács: Fuzzy Challenges ([abstract](SISY2025_plenary_abstract_TakacsM.pdf))\n*   Bernard De Baets: “Fuzzy Sets”, 60 Years Later ([abstract](SISY2025_plenary_abstract_Bernard.pdf))\n*   Robert Kozma: Implementation of Brain-Inspired Multi-Sensory Integration and Decision Making using Embodied Robotic Platforms ([abstract](SISY2025_plenary_abstract_Kozma.pdf))\n*   Ljiljana Trajković ([abstract](SISY2025_plenary_abstract_Ljiljana.pdf))\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Full paper submission:** May 15, 2025\n*   **Notification:** July 21, 2025\n*   **Final manuscript submission:** August 18, 2025\n\n**Note:** There will be no deadline extension."
