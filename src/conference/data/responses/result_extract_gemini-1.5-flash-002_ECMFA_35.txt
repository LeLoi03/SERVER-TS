  "Call for Papers": "# ECMFA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 21st European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) will be held in **Koblenz, Germany, from June 10-11, 2025**, as part of STAF 2025 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations).\n\nECMFA is the premier European forum dedicated to advancing the state of knowledge and fostering the application of all aspects of MBE and related approaches.  Its focus is on engaging the key figures of research and industry in a dialog that will result in stronger and more effective practical application of MBE, hence producing more reliable software based on state-of-the-art research results.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nWe are soliciting papers presenting original research on all aspects of model-based engineering. Two types of submissions are possible:\n\n*   **Foundation Papers:** dealing with modeling foundations, such as metamodeling, model transformations, model validation, verification and testing, model engineering methods and tools, and related aspects.\n*   **Application Papers:** dealing with the application of modeling techniques, including experience reports on the use of MBE methods and tools, industrial case studies, or successful applications of MBE practices in industry or in public administration, with significant modeling lessons learned. All applications must have been done in real contexts and at least one of the authors of the paper must be from the company or administration where the application took place.\n\n## Submission Process\n\nSubmissions must conform to the JOT LaTeX template ([https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip](https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip)) and must not exceed 14 pages (including figures, references, and appendices). Secondary studies may use 2 additional pages for references only. Failure to conform to these guidelines may result in disqualification of the paper. No simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed; any concurrent submission will be deemed as a serious breach of scientific ethics, resulting in the immediate rejection of the paper and appropriate action will be taken.\n\nAll submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through EasyChair ([link to be published](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=staf2025)).\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\n*   Foundations of MBE, including model transformations, domain-specific languages, verification and validation approaches, etc.\n*   Novel paradigms, formalisms, applications, approaches, frameworks, or processes for model-based engineering such as low-code/no-code development, digital twins, etc.\n*   Interplay between MBE with and for AI-based systems.\n*   Application of MBE methods, tools, and techniques to specific domains, e.g., automotive, aerospace, cyber-physical systems, robotics, Artificial Intelligence or IoT.\n*   Successful use of MBE in connection with other disciplines and approaches, such as Artificial Intelligence, DevOps, Open Source, or Safety Assurance.\n*   Educational aspects of MBE.\n*   Tools and initiatives for the successful adoption of MBE in industry.\n\n## Review Criteria and Process\n\nThe program committee will assess all papers for novelty, significance, technical quality, rigor, and suitability for the conference. Contributions can be submitted to any of the two submission periods. In both rounds, each submitted paper can be recommended by the Program Committee to be accepted-as-is, accepted with minor revisions, undergo major revisions, or rejected.\n\n## Artifacts\n\nArtifacts are recommended but not required, for the initial submission. Depending on the papers, reviewers may take the existence of artifacts as a positive signal about the work. Also, depending on the papers, artifacts may be required as a condition for publication.\n\n## Publication\n\nAll accepted papers will be published as platinum open-access journal publications in JOT. At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.\n\n## Important Dates (AoE (UTC-12h))\n\n*   **Round 1 - Abstract (Optional):** November 22, 2024\n*   **Round 1 - Paper Submission:** November 29, 2024\n*   **Round 1 - Author Notification:** January 17, 2025\n*   **Round 1 - Submissions of Revision:** February 23, 2025\n*   **Round 2 - Abstract (Optional):** January 31, 2025\n*   **Round 2 - Paper Submission:** February 9, 2025\n*   **Round 2 - Author Notification:** March 28, 2025\n*   **Round 2 - Submission of Revisions:** April 11, 2025\n*   **Final Notification to Authors:** May 2, 2025\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=staf2025](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=staf2025)\n\n## Contact\n\nChairs can be contacted using the following email address: [ecmfa2025@easychair.org](mailto:ecmfa2025@easychair.org)\n\nQuestions?
