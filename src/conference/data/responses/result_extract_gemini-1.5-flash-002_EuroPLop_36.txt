  "Call for Papers": "# EuroPLoP 2025: Call for Papers\n\nEuroPLoP is the premier European conference on patterns and pattern languages. The 30th edition will be held in **Kloster Irsee, Germany, from July 2-6, 2025**.\n\n## 30th Anniversary Special Edition\n\nCelebrating 30 editions, the event will feature special activities and prominent figures from its history.  Submissions reflecting on the history of patterns and their future are especially welcome.\n\n## Call for Pattern Papers\n\nEuroPLoP accepts papers containing patterns or pattern languages, as well as papers related to the theory and the practical application of patterns.  Up to 20% of pattern papers on non-computing topics are accepted.\n\nWe particularly welcome submissions on the following topics (theory and practice):\n\n*   **Software/Systems Engineering, Classical Software Design Patterns:** Patterns in software and systems architecture, design, and implementation\n*   **Patterns in Human-computer-interface (HCI) design and architecture**\n*   **Patterns for improving software quality and software verification**\n*   **Reports, studies, or empirical evaluations of using patterns and pattern languages**\n*   **Modern Development and Operations Paradigms:** Patterns in agile processes, e.g., XP, Scrum, DevOps, CI/CD\n*   **Patterns in API Design & Management, Microservices, SOA, Serverless**\n*   **Patterns in Domain Driven Design (DDD), Model-driven Development & Eng.**\n*   **Patterns in Business, Organization, Innovation, and Requirements Engineering:** Patterns for business, organization, requirements engineering, and process management\n*   **Patterns for design thinking / lateral thinking, innovation processes, and creativity**\n*   **Patterns for transformations of corporate processes and alternative business cultures**\n*   **Education and Learning Patterns:** Patterns in education, collaboration, and interdisciplinary topics\n*   **Reports of using patterns in education**\n*   **Gamification patterns**\n*   **Patterns in Cloud and the Internet of Things:** Patterns in (Industrial) IoT, Cyber-Physical-Systems, embedded devices, control systems\n*   **Hardware/Software Co-Design patterns**\n*   **Patterns about safety, security, reliability, or dependability**\n*   **Patterns for cloud/fog/edge/embedded environments and isomorphic computing**\n*   **Patterns in Emerging Topics:** Hyper-automation, robotic process automation, digital transformation, Industry 4.0 patterns\n*   **Decentralized systems patterns**\n*   **Patterns for AI and machine learning**\n*   **Patterns for virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and immersive applications**\n*   **Patterns for multi-experience environments and people-centric smart spaces**\n*   **Meta Topics:** Pattern Theory / Theoretical arguments about patterns, Empirical evaluations of patterns and pattern languages, Reflections on the history of patterns, Perspectives on the future of patterns\n\n## Call for Focus Group Proposals\n\nDo you have a pattern-related topic with the potential to spark a discussion? Focus Groups at EuroPLoP are an excellent opportunity to collaborate with other passionate pattern writers.  Your submission should include a summary of the topic, outcomes you envision, a brief description of how you will organize the session, its time budget, and the required number of participants.\n\n*   **Focus Group Proposal submission deadline:** May 16, 2025\n\n## Paper Submission Process\n\nThe submission runs through three quality gates before the final proceedings are published.  After the first draft is accepted, your paper will be assigned to a shepherd. This is an experienced pattern author, who will provide feedback and suggestions on how to improve your paper. Following several iterations of shepherding, your improved second draft will be reviewed again and accepted or rejected for the conference. On acceptance, your paper will be discussed in the writers’ workshop during the conference. Based on the feedback received during the workshops, you must submit a final revised version that will be published. \n\n*   The submission system is available at: [https://www.europlop.net/submission/](https://www.europlop.net/submission/)\n\n## Paper Submission Format\n\nThe final submission for publication must be formatted using the Springer template, but you can use any format for drafts and intermediate versions. We recommend 10 pages as a guideline and especially welcome shorter papers. Longer papers are also possible but bear in mind that the writers’ workshop might decide to focus only on a part of your paper. \n\n*   Have a look at the introductory information pack: [https://europlop.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pattern_introduction_pack.zip](https://europlop.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pattern_introduction_pack.zip)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Deadline for initial paper submission:** February 17, 2025 (extended)\n*   **Acceptance for shepherding:** March 10, 2025\n*   **Start of shepherding:** March 10, 2025\n*   **Deadline for improved paper version (for PC review):** May 5, 2025\n*   **Deadline for Focus Group proposals:** May 16, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notification; Registration opens:** May 28, 2025\n*   **Author Registration Deadline:** June 4, 2025\n*   **End of shepherding; Deadline for conference version of paper:** June 16, 2025\n*   **Registration closes:** June 23, 2025\n*   **Conference:** July 2-6, 2025\n*   **Deadline for proceedings version of paper:** September 30, 2025\n\n## Contact\n\n*   **Conference Chair:** Eduardo Guerra, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, [eduardo.guerra@unibz.it](mailto:eduardo.guerra@unibz.it)\n*   **Program Chair:** Tsvetelina Plummer, NielsenIQ, [tsvetelina.plummer@nielseniq.com](mailto:tsvetelina.plummer@nielseniq.com)\n*   **Focus Group Chair:** Dennis Dubbert, Technische Hochschule Cologne, [dennis.dubbert@th-koeln.de](mailto:dennis.dubbert@th-koeln.de)"
