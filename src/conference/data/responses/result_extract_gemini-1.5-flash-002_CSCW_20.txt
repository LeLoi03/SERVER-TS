  "Call for Papers": "# CSCW 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 28th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW 2025) will be held in **Bergen, Norway, from October 18–22, 2025**.\n\nCSCW is the premier venue for human-centered research in the design, use, and evaluation of technologies that support or affect social, cooperative, and collaborative practices in groups, organizations, communities, and networks.\n\n## Submission Model\n\nTo support diverse and high-quality contributions, CSCW uses a two-cycle review process with the opportunity for major revisions reviewed by the same reviewers. Accepted papers are published in the *Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction* (PACM HCI) Journal.\n\nCSCW 2025 will follow the half-yearly submission model implemented in CSCW 2022. New paper submissions will only be possible for the July 2024 and October 2024 deadlines. We have four additional deadlines in December, March, April, and July for revisions only. Failure to submit a revised version of a paper by the associated deadline means that the paper has been withdrawn.\n\n## July 2024 Cycle\n\n*   **New paper submissions due:** July 2, 2024 (23:59 AoE)\n*   **Expected notification date:** October 9, 2024 AoE\n*   **Possible outcomes:** Major Revisions, Minor Revisions, Reject\n*   **Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation:** October 29, 2024 (23:59 AoE)\n*   **Expected notification date:** November 19, 2024\n*   **Possible outcomes:** Accept or Reject\n*   **Resubmission of papers that received a Major Revision recommendation:** December 10, 2024 (23:59 AoE)\n*   **Expected notification date:** February 12, 2025\n*   **Possible outcomes:** Accept with Minor Revisions, Reject\n*   **Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation after Major Revisions:** March 4, 2025 (23:59 AoE)\n*   **Expected notification date:** March 26, 2025\n*   **Possible outcomes:** Accept or Reject\n\n## October 2024 Cycle\n\n*   **New paper submissions due:** October 29, 2024 (23:59 AoE)\n*   **Expected notification date:** February 12, 2025\n*   **Possible outcomes:** Major Revisions, Minor Revisions, Reject\n*   **Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation:** March 4, 2025 (23:59 AoE)\n*   **Expected notification date:** March 26, 2025\n*   **Possible outcomes:** Accept or Reject\n*   **Resubmission of papers that received a Major Revision recommendation:** April 15, 2025 (23:59 AoE)\n*   **Expected notification date:** June 11, 2025\n*   **Possible outcomes:** Accept with Minor Revisions, Reject\n*   **Resubmission of papers that received a Minor Revision recommendation after Major Revisions:** July 1, 2025 (23:59 AoE)\n*   **Expected notification date:** August 6, 2025\n*   **Possible outcomes:** Accept or Reject\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW) is the premier venue for human-centered research in the design, use, and evaluation of technologies that support or affect social, cooperative, and collaborative practices in groups, organizations, communities, and networks.  Topics of interest include:\n\n*   Social and crowd computing\n*   CSCW and social computing system development\n*   Methodologies and tools\n*   Critical, historical, ethnographic analyses\n*   Empirical investigations\n*   Domain-specific social, cooperative, and collaborative applications\n*   Ethics and policy implications\n*   CSCW and social computing systems based on emerging technologies\n*   Crossing boundaries\n\n## Submission Process Details\n\nCSCW 2025 uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: [https://new.precisionconference.com](https://new.precisionconference.com)\n\n## Paper Guidelines Regarding Scope\n\nContributions must have a focus on social aspects of technology mediation and be properly contextualized in the CSCW literature, with clear reference to CSCW concepts and/or theories informing, being affected, or being proposed. Papers whose research contributions are primarily of relevance or benefit to individual users will be considered out of scope.  Systems-based or algorithmic research not making explicit how it involves aspects of cooperative, collaborative or social computing are not within the scope of CSCW.\n\n## Anonymous Review Policy\n\nPapers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed.  Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Images used in the paper must NOT disclose the authors' identity or suggest affiliation.\n\n## Formatting and Length\n\n*   Word authors: Use the old interim ACM Small template ([https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates))\n*   LaTeX authors: Use the template at ([https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions)), and insert the acmsmall call.\n*   Overleaf authors: Use the template at [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf), and use the acmsmall call.\n\nPapers that use a completely different template will be desk rejected.  Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. If a paper is shorter than 5000 words or exceeds 12,000 words, it will be submitted to additional scrutiny. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be rejected.\n\n## Policy on Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Other AI Tools\n\nIf AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) were used in the writing of the paper beyond a simple grammar check, their use should be acknowledged and described in the text of the submitted version.\n\n## Decisions and Deadlines\n\nCSCW will return submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, roughly 2-4 months from the initial submission (depending on the cycle).\n\n*   **Accept:** Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication.\n*   **Minor revision:** Submissions that receive this decision will require some revisions before being accepted for publication.\n*   **Major revision:** Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, then re-reviewed.\n*   **Reject:** Authors of rejected papers are allowed to resubmit their papers under special conditions.\n*   **Desk / Quick Reject:**  Editors will desk reject papers that do not comply with submission requirements.\n\n## Resubmission of Rejected and Withdrawn Papers\n\nPapers in the following categories can be resubmitted at the next submission deadline:\n\n*   Papers that have been desk or quick rejected\n*   Papers that got Minor Revisions but missed the resubmission deadline (considered withdrawn)\n*   Papers that get rejected after resubmitting Major Revisions\n\nPapers that fall in the following categories must wait an extra deadline to be resubmitted:\n\n*   Papers that get rejected in the first review round\n*   Papers that got Major Revisions but missed the resubmission deadline (considered withdrawn)\n\n## Decision Appeal Process\n\nCSCW has implemented a process for authors who wish to appeal a decision. Appeals must be submitted no later than seven days after the decision notification is out. Any appeal submitted after that time limit will not be pursued.\n\n## Primary Research Paradigm\n\nWhen uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be asked to indicate the primary research paradigm of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment.\n\n## Open and Transparent Science\n\nAuthors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods.  Authors are encouraged to use open access repositories and make their data and other material FAIR when appropriate for their work.\n\n## Video Figures\n\nAuthors may consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission (no more than three minutes long).\n\n## Presenting at the Conference\n\nAccepted papers are invited to present at the corresponding conference, and authors can choose whether or not they wish to present.\n\n## Papers Chairs\n\nContact: [papers2025@cscw.acm.org](mailto:papers2025@cscw.acm.org)\n\n*   Xiaojuan Ma (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR)\n*   Xinru Page (Brigham Young University, USA)\n*   Chiara Rossitto (Stockholm University, Sweden)\n*   Norman Makoto Su (University of California, Santa Cruz, USA)\n\n## General Chairs\n\nContact: [chairs2025@cscw.acm.org](mailto:chairs2025@cscw.acm.org)\n\n*   Fabiano Pinatti (University of Oslo, Norway)\n*   Jessica Vitak (University of Maryland, USA)"
