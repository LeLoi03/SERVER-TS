  "Call for Papers": "# CHES 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (CHES) conference will take place in **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia from September 14-18, 2025**.\n\nCHES is the premier venue for research on both the design and analysis of cryptographic hardware and software implementations. As an area conference of the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), CHES bridges the cryptographic research and engineering communities and attracts participants from academia, industry, government, and beyond.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe scope of CHES is intentionally diverse. We solicit submissions of papers on topics including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n### Cryptographic Implementations:\n\n*   Hardware architectures\n*   Cryptographic processors and coprocessors\n*   True and pseudorandom number generators\n*   Physical unclonable functions (PUFs)\n*   Efficient software implementation\n*   SHARCS (Special-purpose HARdware for Cryptanalysis, quantum included)\n\n### Attacks against Implementations, and Countermeasures:\n\n*   Remote, micro-architectural, and physical side-channel attacks and countermeasures\n*   Fault attacks and countermeasures\n*   Hardware tampering and tamper-resistance\n*   White-box cryptography and code obfuscation\n*   Reverse engineering of hardware/software\n*   Hardware trojans and countermeasures\n\n### Tools and Methodologies:\n\n*   Formal methods, techniques, and tools for secure design and verification for hardware/software\n*   Computer aided cryptographic engineering\n*   Domain-specific languages for cryptographic systems\n*   Metrics for the security of embedded systems\n*   FPGA design security\n*   Physical assurance and analysis of embedded systems\n*   Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)\n\n### Interactions between Cryptographic Theory and Implementation Issues:\n\n*   Quantum cryptanalysis\n*   Algorithm subversion and subversion prevention\n*   New and emerging cryptographic algorithms and protocols targeting embedded devices\n*   Theoretical hardware models that allow proofs\n\n### Applications:\n\n*   RISC-V security\n*   Trusted execution environments and trusted computing platforms\n*   IP protection for hardware/software and technologies for anti-counterfeiting\n*   Reconfigurable hardware for cryptography\n*   Secure elements, security subsystems, and applications\n*   Security for the Internet of Things and cyberphysical systems (RFID, sensor networks, smart meters, medical implants, smart devices for home automation, industrial control, automotive, etc.)\n*   Secure storage devices (memories, disks, etc.)\n*   Isolation and monitoring hardware for cyberresilience\n*   Engineering of zero-knowledge proof systems\n*   Privacy-preserving computing in practice (MPC, FHE)\n*   Post-quantum security\n\n## TCHES Publication Model\n\nCHES has transitioned to an open-access journal/conference hybrid model.  Submitted papers will undergo a journal-style review process with accepted papers published by Ruhr University Bochum in an issue of the journal IACR Transactions on Cryptographic Hardware and Embedded Systems (TCHES). All papers published in TCHES are immediately and freely available.\n\nThe annual CHES conference consists of presentations for each paper published in the associated issues of TCHES, plus invited talks and a range of additional and social activities.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll submission deadlines are at 23:59:59 Anywhere on Earth (AoE).\n\n**Schedule for TCHES Volume 2025/1**\n\n*   Submission deadline: July 15, 2024\n*   Rebuttal phase: August 19–23, 2024\n*   Notification: September 15, 2024\n*   Final version due: October 14, 2024\n\n**Schedule for TCHES Volume 2025/2**\n\n*   Submission deadline: October 15, 2024\n*   Rebuttal phase: November 20–25, 2024\n*   Notification: December 15, 2024\n*   Final version due: January 14, 2025\n\n**Schedule for TCHES Volume 2025/3**\n\n*   Submission deadline: January 15, 2025\n*   Rebuttal phase: February 24–28, 2025\n*   Notification: March 15, 2025\n*   Final version due: April 14, 2025\n\n**Schedule for TCHES Volume 2025/4**\n\n*   Submission deadline: April 15, 2025\n*   Rebuttal phase: May 26–30, 2025\n*   Notification: June 15, 2025\n*   Final version due: July 14, 2025\n\nCamera-ready deadlines relate to (conditionally) accepted papers.\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nAuthor instructions for paper submission are on the [submissions page](papersubmission.php).\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   **Program Co-Chairs:**\n    *   Michael Hutter, PQShield, Austria\n    *   Debdeep Mukhopadhyay, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, India\n*   **General Co-Chairs:**\n    *   Muhammad Reza Z’aba, MIMOS, Malaysia\n    *   Muhammad Rezal Kamel Ariffin, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Malaysia\n    *   Norziana Jamil, United Arab Emirates University, UAE, and Universiti Tenaga Nasional, Malaysia\n*   **Managing Editor:** Tim Güneysu, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany"
