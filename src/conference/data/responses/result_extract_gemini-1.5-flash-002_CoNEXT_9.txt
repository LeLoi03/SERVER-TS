  "Summary": "CoNEXT 2025, the 21st International Conference on emerging Networking EXperiments and Technologies, will be held from December 1-4, 2025, at HKUST in Hong Kong.  The conference is a major forum for presentations and discussions of novel networking technologies and will feature a high-quality technical program.",
  "Call for Papers": "# CoNEXT 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Proceedings of the ACM on Networking (PACMNET) journal is seeking papers containing significant and novel research results on emerging computer networks and its applications. All accepted long papers will also be presented in the ACM CoNEXT 2025 conference. This is a new model that strives to combine the benefits of both conference and journal-based publication.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe invite submissions on a wide range of networking topics, including (in alphabetical order):\n\n*   Content distribution and caching, e.g., CDN, peer-to-peer, overlays\n*   Design, analysis, and evaluation of network architectures\n*   Energy-efficient computing and networking\n*   Experience and lessons learned by deploying large-scale networked systems\n*   In-network computing, NFV and network programmability\n*   Innovative uses of network data beyond communication\n*   Network measurements and modeling\n*   Internet economics and policy\n*   Mobile and wireless network protocols and applications\n*   Machine learning as applied to all layers of networking\n*   Networked applications including web, video, and online social networks\n*   Network and Systems for AI\n*   Network aspects of datacenters, cloud computing, operating systems, virtualization\n*   Network aspects of IoT\n*   Network control and management, including SDN\n*   Network, transport, and application-layer protocols\n*   Reliability and availability of networks, protocols, and applications\n*   Reproducibility of networking research\n*   Routing and traffic engineering\n*   Security and privacy aspects of network applications and protocols\n\nWe are open to other contributions that stretch networking research outside of these topics, present new emerging computing trends, or potentially involve unfamiliar techniques. We welcome experience submissions that clearly articulate lessons learned, as well as submissions that refute prior published results.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nThere are two submission opportunities over the course of the year:\n\n### Winter Submission\n\n*   Paper Registration: November 28th, 2024\n*   Paper Submission: December 5th, 2024\n*   Early reject notification: February 2025\n*   Notification of Acceptance: April 4th, 2025\n*   Camera Ready for accepted papers: April 30th, 2025\n*   Publication of accepted papers: June 2025 issue of PACMNET\n\nFor papers given the one-shot major revision option:\n\n*   Major revision due: May 29th, 2025\n*   Final decision: June 16th, 2025\n*   Camera Ready for accepted papers: July 17th, 2025\n*   Publication of accepted papers: September 2025 issue of PACMNET\n\n### Summer Submission\n\nTBA\n\nAll deadline times are at 24:00 Anywhere on Earth (AoE).\n\n## Submission\n\nCoNEXT welcomes the submission of both long and short papers. All submissions should be double-anonymous and will be peer-reviewed.\n\n### Long Papers\n\nSubmissions should be no more than 16 pages, with unlimited pages for references and up to four pages for appendices. Authors shall use a single column, 10pt, ACM small template for articles following the acmsmall template.\n\n### Short Papers\n\nShort papers are the preferred vehicle for contributions whose novelty and impact show the same technical excellence, but whose description fits within 6 pages (one additional page for appendices and unlimited pages for references). Short paper shall use the 2-columns, 10pt ACM format used for conferences following the sigconf template.\n\n## Submission Portal\n\n[https://conext25-winter.hotcrp.com/](https://conext25-winter.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## One-shot Major Revision\n\nEach paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot “major” revision.\n\n## Early Reject Notification\n\nThe review process will consist of multiple rounds of scrutiny. In order to allow authors to submit an improved version of work to other venues, authors of submissions for which there is a consensus on rejection will be notified earlier.\n\n## Research Reproducibility\n\nWe value submissions that are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available.\n\n## Double-anonymous Requirements\n\nAll submitted papers will be assessed through a double-anonymous review process.\n\n## Ethical Concerns\n\nAll papers must include a statement or subsection about ethical issues raised by the work.\n\n## PACMNET Open Access\n\nPACMNET adheres to the ACM OpenTOC initiative.\n\n## Contact Us\n\nIf you have any questions, please email the TPC co-chairs:\n\n*   Ying Zhang ([zhangying_at_meta.com](mailto:zhangying_at_meta.com))\n*   Andra Lutu ([andra.lutu_at_telefonica.com](mailto:andra.lutu_at_telefonica.com))"
