  "Summary": "The 21st Annual International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT 2025) will take place in Tuscany (Lucca), Italy. The conference covers several aspects of distributed computing in smart systems, such as high-level abstractions and models, systematic design methodologies, signal and information processing, algorithms, analysis, and applications. DCOSS-IoT 2025 will host 12 confirmed workshops and will announce a best paper award and a best poster/demo award.",
  "Call for Papers": "# DCOSS-IoT 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 21st International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT 2025) will be held in **Tuscany (Lucca), Italy, from June 9-11, 2025**.\n\n## Scope\n\nDCOSS-IoT focuses on issues arising in the entire IoT and networked sensor systems stack, covering aspects of high-level abstractions, models and languages, communication technologies, novel algorithms and applications, system design approaches and architectures, and tools for simulated and real deployments. Potential authors are invited to submit original, unpublished manuscripts demonstrating recent advances in theoretical and experimental research.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Artificial Intelligence for IoT\n*   Machine learning and data mining for IoT and Smart Systems\n*   Smart healthcare to combat epidemics\n*   Edge and fog computing\n*   Machine intelligence in distributed sensor systems and real-time analytics\n*   Novel communication paradigms (e.g., 5G/6G, VLC, DSA) for IoT and Smart Systems\n*   Cyber-Physical Systems\n*   IoT and Smart Systems for Smart and Connected Communities\n*   Autonomous systems\n*   Time and location management\n*   Robustness, resilience, and dependability of IoT and smart systems\n*   Security and privacy in IoT and Smart Systems\n*   Performance analysis\n*   Mobile and human-centric sensing\n*   IoT and Smart Systems for social computing\n*   Interoperability, heterogeneity and scalability\n*   Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based sensing/communications/networking\n*   Social sensing and crowd sensing techniques, applications, and systems\n*   Complex systems comprising wearable, robotic and/or fixed sensor systems\n*   IoT and Smart Systems for emerging and developing economies\n*   Green and environmentally friendly IoT (low power, harvesting, energy management)\n*   Sensors and Robots for Internet of Intelligent Things\n*   Design and implementation of real-world applications and systems\n*   Approaches, tools, and experience of deployment and operation\n*   Interdisciplinary applications of IoT and Smart Systems\n*   Smart healthcare and digital epidemiology\n*   Smart agriculture\n*   Smart infrastructures\n*   Smart cities\n*   Smart energy, transportation, and water distribution systems\n*   Smart factories\n*   Smart workspace\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAuthors are invited to submit original, unpublished manuscripts demonstrating current research on distributed smart systems and IoT.  Please use the US letter size (8.5 X 11 in) standard IEEE conference LaTeX format or Microsoft Word template available on: [http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).\n\nAll submissions should be written in English and have a maximum of eight (8) printed pages, including figures and references. Two (2) additional pages at 100$/page for supplementary material only (such as theorems, proofs, implementation details) are allowed. Starting 2023, DCOSS-IoT follows a double-blind review process. As a result, authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the EDAS submission system.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Registration Deadline:** February 11, 2025\n*   **Paper Submission Deadline:** February 11, 2025\n*   **Acceptance Notification:** March 28, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready Deadline:** April 15, 2025\n*   **Early registration deadline:** TBA\n*   **Posters/Demos Deadline:** March 31, 2025\n*   **Posters/Demos Notifications:** April 7, 2025\n*   **Camera ready deadline for Posters:** April 11, 2025\n*   **Camera ready deadline for Workshops papers:** May 9, 2025\n\n## Awards\n\nDCOSS-IoT 2025 will announce a best paper award and a best poster/demo award. Extended versions of selected best papers from DCOSS-IoT 2025 will be included in a Special Issue of the Computer Networks (COMNET) Journal.\n\n## Key Organizers\n\n*   **Technical Program Committee Co-Chairs:** Dario Pompili (Rutgers University, USA), Jennifer Simonjan (Technology Innovation Institute â€“ TII, UAE), Zhi Sun (Tsinghua University, China)\n*   **General Chairs:** Francesco Betti Sorbelli (UNIPG, Italy), Cristina M. Pinotti (UNIPG, Italy)\n*   **Steering Committee Chair:** Sotiris Nikoletseas (University of Patras and CTI, Greece)"
