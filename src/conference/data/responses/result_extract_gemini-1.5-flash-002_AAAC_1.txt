  "Call for Papers": "# AAAC 2025 Call for Papers\n\nThe 16th Annual Meeting of the Asian Association for Algorithms and Computation (AAAC 2025) will take place on **May 31 and June 1, 2025**, at the **City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.**\n\nWe invite submissions of abstracts presenting original research or surveys of existing results in theoretical computer science. The meeting is a face-to-face event, and at least one author of each submission is expected to register and give the talk at the venue.\n\n## Topics\n\nAll areas of theoretical computer science, especially design and analysis of algorithms and complexity theory.\n\n## Submissions\n\nAuthors are invited to submit one-page (A4) abstracts (in pdf format) that can be based on original results or surveys of existing results of authors. Informal working notes including the one-page abstracts will be distributed at the meeting, which does not prevent any form of future publication of the same work. All submissions should be made electronically through the EasyChair Conference System: [https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=aaac2025](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=aaac2025)."
