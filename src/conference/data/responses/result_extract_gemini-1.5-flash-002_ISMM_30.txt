  "Call for Papers": "# ISMM 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 2025 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2025) will be held in **Seoul, South Korea on June 17, 2025**, co-located with PLDI’25 at **The Westin Josun Seoul**.\n\nISMM is the premier forum dedicated to research in memory management, covering the areas of memory performance, allocator design, garbage collection, architectural support for memory management, persistent memories, emerging memory technologies, and more. This year’s ISMM has an expanded scope to encourage submissions and participation from related fields such as computer architecture and computer systems.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nThe 2025 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2025) is soliciting full-length submissions covering new work on all memory management-related topics in both software and hardware (and their cooperation), as well as papers presenting confirmations or refutations of important prior results. In addition to regular papers, traditionally submitted to ISMM, we also invite submissions of the following kinds:\n\n*   Surveys and comparative analyses that shed new light on previously published techniques.\n*   Practitioner reports, describing experience with memory management in production. Such papers are not expected to provide novel research contributions, but they should not have been previously published.\n*   Intellectual abstracts, where researchers share designs, algorithms, or theory that may be interesting to the memory management community, but not yet evaluated.\n\nPlease indicate whether the paper is a regular paper, a survey, a practitioner report, or an intellectual abstract, by using a subtitle. For example, for a regular paper, include one of the following on the line below the title line:\n\n`\\subtitle{This submission is a regular paper}`, `\\subtitle{This submission is a survey}`, `\\subtitle{This submission is a practitioner report}`, or `\\subtitle{This submission is an intellectual abstract}`.\n\n## Areas of Interest\n\nAreas of interest include but are not limited to (in no particular order):\n\n*   Garbage collection algorithms and implementations\n*   Memory allocation and de-allocation\n*   Memory system design and analysis (both software and hardware)\n*   Hardware support for memory management\n*   Memory management for large-scale data-intensive systems\n*   Memory management at datacenter and cloud scales\n*   Formal analysis and verification of memory management algorithms\n*   Compiler analyses to aid memory management\n*   Tools to analyze memory usage and characteristics of programs\n*   Empirical analysis of memory intensive programs\n*   Formal analysis and verification of memory intensive programs\n*   Memory management for machine learning systems\n*   Programming and management of emerging or persistent memories\n*   Caches, memory controllers, memory hierarchies and their management\n*   Cache coherence and memory consistency\n*   Processing in memory (including processing near and using memory)\n*   Memory technology and architecture (SRAM, DRAM, flash, NVM, emerging technologies)\n*   Security and privacy of memory systems\n*   Robustness of memory systems\n*   Low-latency and low-energy memory systems\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://ismm25.hotcrp.com](https://ismm25.hotcrp.com)\n\n## Formatting Instructions\n\nAll papers must be submitted online in Portable Document Format (PDF). Papers should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format. Each paper should have no more than 12 pages, excluding bibliography, in 10pt font. There is no limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]. Submissions should be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper. These requirements are all the same as in the previous years.\n\n## Double-Blind Reviewing\n\nISMM uses double-blind reviewing. This means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in the third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized.\n\n## Declaring Conflicts\n\nWhen submitting the paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).\n\n## Important Dates (AoE UTC-12h)\n\n*   **Paper submission:** March 18, 2025\n*   **Author response period:** April 23 - 25, 2025\n*   **Author notification:** May 3, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready papers due:** May 13, 2025\n*   **Conference day:** June 17, 2025"
