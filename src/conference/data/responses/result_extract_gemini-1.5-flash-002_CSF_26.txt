  "Summary": "The Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF) is an annual conference for researchers in computer security, to examine current theories of security, the formal models that provide a context for those theories, and techniques for verifying security. CSF 2025 will be held in Santa Cruz, CA, USA, from June 16-20, 2025.",
  "Call for Papers": "# CSF 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 38th IEEE Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF 2025) will be held in **Santa Cruz, CA, USA, from June 16-20, 2025**.\n\nCSF seeks papers on foundational aspects of computer security, such as formal security models, relationships between security properties and defenses, principled techniques and tools for design and rigorous analysis of security mechanisms, as well as their application to practice.  Papers lacking foundational aspects risk desk rejection without further evaluation of their merits; contact the PC chairs when in doubt.\n\n## Topics\n\nPossible topics for all papers include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   access control\n*   accountability\n*   anonymity\n*   attack models\n*   authentication\n*   blockchains and smart contracts\n*   cloud security\n*   cryptography\n*   data provenance\n*   data and system integrity\n*   database security\n*   decidability and complexity\n*   decision theory\n*   distributed systems security\n*   electronic voting\n*   embedded systems security\n*   forensics\n*   formal methods and verification\n*   hardware-based security\n*   information flow control\n*   intrusion detection\n*   language-based security\n*   mobile security\n*   network security\n*   privacy\n*   security and privacy aspects of machine learning\n*   security and privacy for the Internet of Things\n*   security architecture\n*   security metrics\n*   security policies\n*   security protocols\n*   software security\n*   socio-technical security\n*   trust management\n*   usable security\n*   web security\n\n### SoK papers: Systematization of Knowledge Papers\n\nCSF 2025 solicits systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers in foundational security and privacy research. These papers systematize, re-formulate, or evaluate existing work in one established and significant research topic.  Such papers must provide new insights. Survey papers without new insights are not appropriate.\n\n## Ethics\n\nWe expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out the research as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so will result in summary rejection of a submission regardless of its quality and scientific value.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are AoE (UTC-12h)\n\n*   **Spring cycle paper submission:** May 28, 2024\n*   **Spring cycle author notification:** July 30, 2024\n*   **Fall cycle paper submission:** October 1, 2024\n*   **Fall cycle author notification:** December 3, 2024\n*   **Winter cycle paper submission:** February 4, 2025\n*   **Winter cycle author notification:** April 8, 2025\n*   **CSF Symposium:** June 16-20, 2025\n\n## Paper Submission Instructions\n\n*   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with published proceedings.\n*   Papers must be submitted using the two-column IEEE Proceedings style.\n*   All papers should be at most 12 pages long, not counting bibliography and well-marked appendices.\n*   Anonymized supplementary material such as proof scripts can be uploaded as a tar ball on the submission site.\n*   At least one coauthor of each accepted paper is required to attend CSF to present the paper.\n\n## Decisions\n\nThe outcome of the review process can be one of the following three: accept, reject, major revision. In some occasions, accepted papers are shepherded for minor modifications.\n\n## Contact\n\nOwen Arden"
