  "Summary": "The ACM SIGPLAN 2025 International Conference on Compiler Construction (CC 2025) is interested in work on processing programs in the most general sense: analyzing, transforming, or executing input programs that describe how a system operates, including traditional compiler construction as a special case. CC 2025 will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, on March 1-2, 2025.",
  "Call for Papers": "# CC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe ACM SIGPLAN 2025 International Conference on Compiler Construction (CC 2025) will be held in **Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, on March 1-2, 2025**.\n\nCC is interested in work on processing programs in the most general sense: analyzing, transforming, or executing input that describes how a system operates, including traditional compiler construction as a special case.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nOriginal contributions are solicited on the topics of interest, which include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Compilation and interpretation techniques, including program representation, analysis, and transformation; code generation, optimization, and synthesis; the verification thereof\n*   Run-time techniques, including memory management, virtual machines, and dynamic and just-in-time compilation\n*   Programming tools, including refactoring editors, checkers, verifiers, compilers, debuggers, and profilers\n*   Techniques, ranging from programming languages to micro-architectural support, for specific domains such as secure, parallel, distributed, embedded, or mobile environments\n*   Design and implementation of novel language constructs, programming models, and domain-specific languages\n*   Implications to compiler construction from emerging or non-conventional applications (e.g., deep learning, quantum computing, DNA computing, etc.)\n\n## Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers\n\nThis year, CC will offer a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Submission site: [https://cc25.hotcrp.com](https://cc25.hotcrp.com)\n*   All submissions must be made electronically through the conference submission website and include an abstract (100–400 words), author contact information, the full list of authors, and their affiliations.\n*   Full paper submissions must be in PDF format, printable on US letter-size paper.\n*   All papers must be prepared in ACM Conference Format using the 2-column acmart format.\n*   Papers should contain a maximum of 10 pages of text (in a typeface no smaller than 10 point) or figures, NOT INCLUDING references.\n*   Appendices are not allowed, but authors may submit anonymous supplementary material, such as proofs, source code, or data sets; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract deadline:** November 5, 2024\n*   **Submission deadline:** November 12, 2024\n*   **Author response:** December 11 - 13, 2024\n*   **Author notification:** December 21, 2024\n*   **Artifact Submission Deadline:** January 17, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready Deadline:** January 24, 2025\n\n## Artifact Evaluation\n\nAuthors are encouraged to submit their artifacts for the Artifact Evaluation (AE). The Artifact Evaluation process begins after the acceptance notification, and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers.\n\n## Organizers\n\n*   **General Chair:** Daniel Kluss - Archeo Futurus / Our Virtue\n*   **Program Co-Chairs:**\n    *   Sara Achour - Stanford\n    *   Jens Palsberg - UCLA\n\n## Venue\n\nWestin Las Vegas\n160 E Flamingo Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89109, USA\n[Google Map](https://g.co/kgs/pvY9Bci)"
