  "Call for Papers": "# AAAI-25: Call for Papers\n\nThe Thirty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25) will be held in **Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, from February 25 to March 4, 2025**.\n\n## Theme\n\nThe theme of this conference is to create collaborative bridges within and beyond AI. We emphasize the importance of AI for social impact and responsible AI.\n\n## Tracks\n\nAAAI-25 will feature three technical tracks:\n\n*   Main Track\n*   Special Track on AI for Social Impact (AISI)\n*   Special Track on AI Alignment\n\n## Submission Site\n\nAAAI-25 author registration and paper submissions will be accepted via OpenReview ([https://openreview.net/](https://openreview.net/)).\n\n## Timetable for Authors\n\n*   AAAI-25 web site open for paper submission: July 8, 2024\n*   Abstracts due: August 7, 2024\n*   Full papers due: August 15, 2024\n*   Supplementary material and code due: August 19, 2024\n*   Notification of Phase 1 rejections: October 14, 2024\n*   Author feedback window: November 4-8, 2024\n*   Notification of final acceptance or rejection (Main Technical Track): December 9, 2024\n*   Submission of camera-ready files (Main Technical Track): December 19, 2024\n*   AAAI-25 Conference: February 27 – March 4, 2025\n\n**Note:** Deadlines are track-specific and may differ from those listed above. Track-specific deadlines are listed on their respective CFP.\n\n## Topics\n\nAAAI-25 welcomes submissions reporting research that advances artificial intelligence, broadly conceived. The conference scope includes machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, multiagent systems, knowledge representation, human-in-the-loop AI, search, planning, reasoning, robotics and perception, and ethics.\n\n## Special Track on AI for Social Impact (AISI)\n\nSubmissions to this track will be reviewed according to a rubric that emphasizes the fit between the techniques used and a problem of social importance, rather than simply rewarding technical novelty.\n\n## Special Track on AI Alignment\n\nThis year we are introducing a special track on AI alignment. This track is motivated by the fact that as we begin to build more and more capable AI systems, it becomes crucial to ensure that the goals and actions of such systems are aligned with human values.\n\n## Review Criteria\n\nAAAI is a highly selective conference. Prospective authors are therefore strongly encouraged to submit only their very best work to AAAI.\n\nAll submissions will be rigorously evaluated by expert reviewers to assess whether the contributions of the paper are substantive enough to warrant publication in AAAI.\n\n## Plagiarism & Use of ChatGPT or similar LLMs Policy\n\nPapers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. Note that this policy does not prohibit authors from using LLMs for editing or polishing author-written text.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nMore specific details are on the following pages:\n\n*   [Submission Instructions](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/submission-instructions/)\n*   [AAAI-25 Author Kit](https://aaai.org/authorkit25/)\n*   [Keywords](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/aaai-25-keywords/)\n*   [Supplementary material](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/supplementary-material/)\n*   [Review process](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/review-process/)\n*   [AI for Social Impact Track](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/aisi-call/)\n*   [AI Alignment Track](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/ai-alignment-call/)\n*   [Paper Modification Guidelines](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/paper-modification-guidelines/)\n*   [Paper Publication and Conference Attendance](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/paper-publication-and-conference-attendance/)\n*   [Affiliated Events](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/affiliated-events/)\n\n## Contact\n\n*   For queries about conference registration: [aaai25@aaai.org](mailto:aaai25@aaai.org)\n*   For inquiries about the submission process and the technical program: [workflowchairs25@aaai.zendesk.com](mailto:workflowchairs25@aaai.zendesk.com) and [pcchairs25@aaai.zendesk.com](mailto:pcchairs25@aaai.zendesk.com)\n*   Other general inquiries to the AAAI-25 General and Program Co-chairs: [aaai25chairs@aaai.org](mailto:aaai25chairs@aaai.org)"
