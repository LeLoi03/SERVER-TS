  "Call for Papers": "# NSPW 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW 2025) will be held on **August 24-27, 2025, in Aerzen, Germany.**\n\nNSPW is an invitation-only workshop for researchers in information security and related disciplines.  The focus is on work that challenges dominant approaches and perspectives in computer security.\n\n## Theme: Trusting\n\nThe theme for NSPW 2025 is **Trusting**. Relevant topics include:\n\n*   Novel paradigms for conceptualising trust and trusting in computer security\n*   Trust decisions in a world of deepfakes and misinformation\n*   Detection of breach of trust, intrusion and misinformation\n*   Trust boundaries and threat modeling\n*   Trust in changing threat landscapes and technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence\n*   Trust evaluation\n*   Social configuration of trust and mistrust in organisations\n*   Trust and mistrust as methodological problems in studies of computer security\n*   The consequences of not trusting\n*   Audits and certifications\n*   Authentication and authorization\n*   Reputation systems and reviewer/recommender systems\n*   Anomaly detection\n*   Formal verification and testing\n*   Privacy\n*   Decentralized trust\n*   Zero trust architectures\n*   Human, social and organisational understandings of trust in technologies\n\nOther interpretations of trusting are welcome.\n\n## Submission Types\n\nNSPW 2025 invites three types of submissions:\n\n*   **Regular submissions:** present a new approach (paradigm) to a security problem or critique existing approaches.  The change in approach should be the focus, not the research results.\n*   **Theme Submissions:** focused on “Trusting” and should explain the connection with the theme in the justification statement.\n*   **Implementation Submissions:** explore implementing previous NSPW submissions.  These submissions should clearly cite which previous work(s) is being referenced and how the current submission extends beyond the original scope.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n*   All submissions are treated as confidential.\n*   NSPW does not accept previously published or concurrently submitted papers.\n*   **Due Date:** April 25, 2025\n*   **Response Date:** May 30, 2025\n*   **Format:** PDF format, 6-15 pages, ACM “sigconf” formatting\n*   **Submission System:** [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025)\n\nEach paper requires two separate EasyChair submissions:\n\n1.  Cover page with authors’ names, affiliation, and the participation statement\n2.  Anonymous PDF paper with a justification statement\n\nThe participation statement must specify which author(s) will attend upon acceptance/invitation, that all authors will engage in good faith with the feedback given in the review and revision periods, and that all authors will abide by the NSPW code of conduct.  The justification statement briefly explains why the submission is appropriate for NSPW and the chosen submission category. The justification statement will not appear in the final publication. Submissions that do not include both statements risk rejection without review.\n\n## Publication\n\nDepending on publication venue, there may be open access publication fees.  Further details regarding publication will be forthcoming.\n\n## Social Contract and Code of Conduct\n\nThe process for paper submission, revision, presentation, and publication at NSPW is different from many other security conferences. Accepted papers are shepherded and revised before the workshop; this revised version is then presented and discussed in an hour-long session. After the workshop, the final version is produced, incorporating the discussions and feedback. Acceptance to the workshop is conditional on engagement with this process.\n\nAll participants must commit to a “social contract\": no one arrives late, no one leaves early, no electronic distractions (including laptops, tablets, and mobile devices), attend all sessions of the 2.5-day program, share meals in a group setting, and comply with the code of conduct. The workshop is preceded by an evening reception allowing attendees to meet each other beforehand.\n\nNSPW is making arrangements for (some) child care during the event. If any potential attendee wants to take advantage of this or has questions, please email [general-chairs@nspw.org](mailto:general-chairs@nspw.org).\n\nThe submission, review, and workshop phases of NSPW are all governed by the NSPW code of conduct: [https://www.nspw.org/conduct](https://www.nspw.org/conduct)."
