  "Summary": "The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO) provides a premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. CGO 2025 will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada, from March 1-5, 2025.",
  "Call for Papers": "# CGO 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO’25) will be held in **Las Vegas, USA, from March 1-5, 2025**.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nOriginal contributions are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:\n\n*   Code Generation, Translation, Transformation, and Optimization for performance, energy, virtualization, portability, security, or reliability concerns, and architectural support\n*   Efficient execution of dynamically typed and higher-level languages\n*   Optimization and code generation for emerging programming models, platforms, domain-specific languages\n*   Dynamic/static, profile-guided, feedback-directed, and machine learning-based optimization\n*   Static, Dynamic, and Hybrid Analysis for performance, energy, memory locality, throughput or latency, security, reliability, or functional debugging\n*   Program characterization methods\n*   Profiling and instrumentation techniques; architectural support\n*   Novel and efficient tools\n*   Compiler design, practice and experience\n*   Compiler abstraction and intermediate representations\n*   Vertical integration of language features, representations, optimizations, and runtime support for parallelism\n*   Solutions that involve cross-layer (HW/OS/VM/SW) design and integration\n*   Deployed dynamic/static compiler and runtime systems for general-purpose, embedded system and Cloud/HPC platforms\n*   Parallelism, heterogeneity, and reconfigurable architectures\n*   Optimizations for heterogeneous or specialized targets, GPUs, SoCs, CGRA, and Quantum Computers\n*   Compiler support for vectorization, thread extraction, task scheduling, speculation, transaction, memory management, data distribution, and synchronization\n\n### Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers\n\nCGO has a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.\n\nThe successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper. Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.\n\n## Submission Information\n\nPapers can be submitted at [https://cgo25-second-round.hotcrp.com/](https://cgo25-second-round.hotcrp.com/).\n\n### Submission Guidelines\n\n*   The paper must be original material that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal.\n*   Your submission is limited to eleven (11) letter-size (8.5\"x11\"), single-spaced, double-column pages, using 10pt or larger font, not including references. There is no page limit for references.\n*   Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages.\n*   Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review.\n*   Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers.\n*   Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass.\n*   Please number the pages.\n*   The paper must be written in English.\n*   The paper must be submitted in PDF.\n\n## Artifact Evaluation\n\nThe Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within one week of paper acceptance.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are AoE (UTC-12h)\n\n*   **R1: Submission Deadline:** May 30, 2024\n*   **R1: Author Rebuttal Period:** July 9 - 11, 2024\n*   **R1: Author Notification:** July 22, 2024\n*   **R2: Submission Deadline:** September 12, 2024\n*   **R2: Author Rebuttal Period:** October 22 - 24, 2024\n*   **R2: Author Notification:** November 4, 2024\n\n## Program Committee Co-Chairs\n\n*   Hugh Leather - Meta - [hleather@meta.com](mailto:hleather@meta.com)\n*   Saday Sadayappan – University of Utah – [saday@cs.utah.edu](mailto:saday@cs.utah.edu)"
