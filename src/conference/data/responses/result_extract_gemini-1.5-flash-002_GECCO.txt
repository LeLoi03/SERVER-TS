  "Call for Papers": "# GECCO 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025) will be a hybrid event held in **M치laga, Spain from July 14-18, 2025**.\n\n## General Information\n\nGECCO 2025 invites submissions of technical papers describing the latest high-quality results in genetic and evolutionary computation.  Topics include genetic algorithms, genetic programming, ant colony optimization and swarm intelligence, complex systems, evolutionary combinatorial optimization and metaheuristics, evolutionary machine learning, evolutionary multiobjective optimization, evolutionary numerical optimization, neuroevolution, real-world applications, theory, hybrids and more. The full list of tracks is available [here](Tracks).\n\n## Paper Categories\n\n### Full Papers\n\nFull papers (at most 8 pages excluding references) should present original work that meets the high-quality standards of GECCO. Accepted full papers appear in the ACM digital library as part of the Main Proceedings of GECCO.  A separate abstract must be submitted by January 22, 2025. Full papers are due by January 29, 2025.\n\n### Poster-Only Papers\n\nPoster-only papers (at most 4 pages including references) may be submitted.  These should present original work that has not yet reached the maturity of full papers. Accepted poster-only papers appear in the ACM digital library as part of the Companion Proceedings of GECCO. Poster-only papers are due by January 29, 2025.\n\n## Paper Acceptance Regulations\n\nFor each track at GECCO, at most CEILING(40% * N_submitted_to_track) papers shall be accepted as a full paper, where N_submitted_to_track is the number of full papers submitted to that track.  There is no maximum acceptance rate on poster papers.\n\n## Best Paper Regulations\n\nA track for which there are less than 10 full-length submitted papers is fully excluded from the Best Paper Award (BPA) procedure. A track is allowed to have a track-specific BPA if at least 30 full-length papers were submitted to that track. Best paper nominations are decided upon per track and by the track chairs.\n\n## Double-Blind Review Process\n\nEach paper submitted to GECCO will be rigorously evaluated in a double-blind review process. Submitted papers should be anonymized.\n\n## Publication Policy\n\nAll accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Simultaneously submitting substantially similar work to another conference or journal is not allowed. \n\n## Supplementary Material\n\nIt is possible to submit supplementary material (e.g., videos, a PDF appendix, source code, data, mathematical proofs) in addition to the PDF of the paper.  You can upload supplementary material as a PDF, ZIP archive (.zip) or a compressed tarball (.tgz or .tar.gz). Please use informative filenames and do not upload more than 10MB.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n### Tutorial, Workshop, Competition Proposals\n\n*   Proposals: November 13, 2024\n*   Notifications: December 18, 2024\n\n### Paper and Poster Submissions\n\n*   Abstract submissions for full papers: January 22, 2025\n*   Full paper submission: January 29, 2025\n*   Poster-only submission: January 29, 2025\n*   Notification of paper acceptance: March 19, 2025\n*   Camera-ready: April 9, 2025\n*   Presenter mandatory registration: May 8, 2025\n\n### Workshop Papers\n\n*   Submission opening: February 10, 2025\n*   Submission deadline: April 2, 2025\n*   Notification: April 28, 2025\n*   Camera-ready: May 5, 2025\n*   Author's mandatory registration: May 8, 2025\n\n### Humies\n\n*   Deadline for entries: May 30, 2025\n\n### Conference\n\n*   Conference: July 14-18, 2025\n\n## Submission Website\n\n[https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/gecco/](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/gecco/)"
