  "Call for Papers": "# TCC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 23rd Theory of Cryptography Conference (TCC 2025) will take place in **Aarhus, Denmark, from December 2-5, 2025**.\n\nTCC 2025 is organized by the **International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR)**. The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series.\n\n## Scope\n\nPapers presenting original research on foundational and theoretical aspects of cryptography are sought.  The scope of the conference includes, but is not limited to:\n\n*   The study of known paradigms, approaches, and techniques, directed towards their better understanding and utilization\n*   The discovery of new paradigms, approaches, and techniques that overcome limitations of the existing ones\n*   The formulation and treatment of new cryptographic problems\n*   The study of notions of security and relations among them\n*   The modeling and analysis of cryptographic algorithms\n*   The study of the complexity assumptions used in cryptography\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** May 27, 2025, 23:59 anywhere on earth (AoE)\n*   **Final notification:** August 28, 2025\n*   **Final versions due:** September 25, 2025\n*   **Conference begins:** December 2, 2025\n\n## Proceedings\n\nProceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.
