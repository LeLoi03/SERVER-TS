  "Call for Papers": "# NAACL 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 2025 Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2025) will be held in **Albuquerque, New Mexico, from April 29–May 4, 2025**.\n\n## Submission\n\nNAACL 2025 will use [ACL Rolling Review](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference.\n\n**Submission deadline for ARR 2024 October:** October 15, 2024\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Reviewing period for ARR 2024 October:** October 30 - November 18, 2024\n*   **Notification of desk rejection for submissions to ARR 2024 October that violate policy:** November 11, 2024\n*   **Author response period for ARR 2024 October:** November 22 - 26, 2024\n*   **Reviews and meta-reviews released for ARR 2024 October:** December 12, 2024\n*   **Commitment deadline for NAACL 2025:** December 16, 2024\n*   **Notification of acceptance for NAACL 2025:** January 22, 2025\n*   **Deadline for accepted papers to withdraw from NAACL 2025 or Findings of NAACL 2025:** February 8, 2025\n*   **Deadline for accepted papers to upload of final version for NAACL 2025 or Findings of NAACL 2025:** February 8, 2025\n*   **Welcome Reception:** April 29, 2025\n*   **Main Conference:** April 30 - May 2, 2025\n*   **Tutorials and Workshops:** May 3 - 4, 2025\n\n**All deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).**\n\n## Overview\n\nNAACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. NAACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results.\n\nAs in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.\n\n## Submission Topics\n\nNAACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas:\n\n*   Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics\n*   Dialogue and Interactive Systems\n*   Discourse and Pragmatics\n*   Efficient/Low-resource Methods for NLP\n*   Ethics, Bias, and Fairness\n*   Generation\n*   Human-centered NLP\n*   Information Extraction\n*   Information Retrieval and Text Mining\n*   Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP\n*   Language Modeling\n*   Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics\n*   Machine Learning for NLP\n*   Machine Translation\n*   Multilinguality and Language Diversity\n*   Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond\n*   Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation\n*   Question Answering\n*   Resources and Evaluation\n*   Semantics: Lexical, Sentence-level, Textual Inference and Other areas\n*   Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining\n*   Speech recognition, text-to-speech and spoken language understanding\n*   Summarization\n*   Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing / ML\n*   NLP Applications\n\n### Special Theme: NLP in a Multicultural World\n\nCurrent NLP tools and models, especially LLMs, require vast amounts of data to train. However, the data used often favors only a handful of over-represented languages, and even for these majoritarian languages only some of the existing geographical or cultural varieties are considered, leaving a large tail of under-represented languages, varieties, and cultures that have had considerably less attention from the NLP community. In this year’s theme track we would like to focus on work providing support to the vibrant multicultural world we live in. We welcome papers in the following non-exhaustive list of topics:\n\n*   Cultural localization of language models.\n*   New NLP applications to support people from diverse cultures.\n*   Revitalization or refunctionalization of endangered or sleeping languages.\n*   Analysis of cultural biases in language models.\n*   Historical considerations and diachronic analysis.\n\n## Submission Details\n\nBoth long and short paper submissions should follow all of the [ARR submission requirements](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#paper-submission-information), including:\n\n*   Long Papers (8 pages)\n*   Short Papers (4 pages)\n*   Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers’ comments.\n\n## Review Process\n\nNAACL 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference.\n\n## Presentation at the Conference\n\nAll accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options.\n\n## Contact Information\n\n*   General chair: Colin Cherry, Google Research\n*   Program co-chairs:\n    *   Lu Wang, University of Michigan\n    *   Alan Ritter, Georgia Institute of Technology\n    *   Luis Chiruzzo, Universidad de la República, Uruguay\n*   For questions related to paper submission, email: [editors@aclrollingreview.org](mailto:editors@aclrollingreview.org)\n*   For all other questions, email: [naacl-2025-pcs@googlegroups.com](mailto:naacl-2025-pcs@googlegroups.com)"
