  "Call for Papers": "# EvoApplications 2025: Call for Papers\n\nEvoApplications, the International Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation, will be held as part of the EvoStar 2025 event from **April 23-25, 2025 in Trieste, Italy**.\n\nEvoApplications invites high-quality contributions for its 28th edition, co-located with EuroGP, EvoCOP, and EvoMUSART.\n\n## Aim\n\nThe aim of EvoApplications is to create a friendly environment that can lead to the establishment or strengthening of scientific collaborations and exchanges among attendees.\n\n## Topics\n\nEvoApplications solicits high-quality original research papers (including significant work-in-progress) on any aspect of applications of Evolutionary Computation, both to real-world or methodological contexts in which Evolutionary Computation can contribute to pushing the limits of the state of the art beyond the present ones.  We encourage submissions focused on interesting, relevant, and original works related to all kinds of applications of Evolutionary Computation.\n\n## Special Sessions\n\nIn addition to regular sessions, special sessions will be organized on the following topics:\n\n*   30 years of Particle Swarm Optimization\n*   Analysis of Evolutionary Computation Methods: Theory, Empirics, and Real-World Applications\n*   Applications of Bioinspired techniques on Social Networks\n*   Bioinspired Algorithms for Green Computing and Sustainable Complex Systems\n*   Computational Intelligence for Sustainability\n*   EvoLLMs: Integrating Evolutionary Computing with Large Language Models (LLMs)\n*   Evolutionary Computation and Machine Learning in Humanitarian Logistics and Disaster Forecasting\n*   Evolutionary Computation in Edge, Fog, and Cloud Computing\n*   Evolutionary Computation in Image Analysis, Signal Processing, and Pattern Recognition\n*   Machine Learning and AI in Digital Healthcare and Personalized Medicine\n*   Resilient Bio-Inspired Algorithms\n*   Soft Computing Applied to Games\n\n## Submission Details\n\nAccepted papers will be published by Springer Nature in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Submissions must be original and not published elsewhere. They will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The reviewing process will be double-blind, so please omit information about the authors in the submitted paper.\n\n*   **Page limit:** 14 + unlimited references pages\n*   **Submission link:** [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=evo2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=evo2025)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **EvoApps Special Session Proposals:** September 8, 2024\n*   **Submission deadline:** November 15, 2024 (extended)\n*   **Notification to authors:** January 10, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready submission:** January 24, 2025\n*   **Author's mandatory registration:** February 26, 2025\n*   **Early registration deadline:** March 19, 2025\n*   **Late-Breaking Abstracts submission deadline:** April 13, 2025\n*   **EvoStar Conference:** April 23-25, 2025\n\n## Conference Programme Chairs\n\n*   Emma Hart | Edinburgh Napier University, UK | E.Hart(at)napier.ac.uk\n*   Pablo García-Sánchez | University of Granada | pablogarcia(at)ugr.es\n\n## Publication Chair\n\n*   Sarah L.
