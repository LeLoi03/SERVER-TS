  "Call for Papers": "# ICLR 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025) will be held at the **Singapore EXPO from April 24-28, 2025**.\n\nICLR is the premier gathering of professionals dedicated to the advancement of deep learning.\n\n## Key Dates\n\nAll times are UTC-12h, aka “Anywhere on Earth”.\n\n*   **Abstract submission:** September 27, 2024, 11:59 PM\n*   **Submission date:** October 1, 2024, 11:59 PM\n*   **Reviews released:** November 12, 2024\n*   **Author/Reviewer Discussion:** November 12-26, 2024\n*   **Author Last Day to Reply:** November 27, 2024\n*   **Final decisions:** January 22, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready Deadline:** March 14, 2025\n\n## Subject Areas\n\nWe consider a broad range of subject areas including feature learning, metric learning, compositional modeling, structured prediction, reinforcement learning, uncertainty quantification, and issues regarding large-scale learning and non-convex optimization, as well as applications in vision, audio, speech, language, music, robotics, games, healthcare, biology, sustainability, economics, ethical considerations in ML, and others.\n\n## Double-Blind Reviewing\n\nSubmissions will be double-blind: reviewers cannot see author names when conducting reviews, and authors cannot see reviewer names. Having papers on arXiv is allowed per the dual submission policy outlined below.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n*   Authors must submit paper abstracts by the abstract submission deadline of September 27, 2024.\n*   The full paper submission deadline is October 1, 2024, 11:59 PM AOE.\n*   Abstracts and papers must be submitted using the conference submission system at: [https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2025/Conference)\n*   The submission site will be open on September 13, 2024.\n*   Supplementary material is due at the same time as the main paper.\n\n## Paper Length\n\nThe main text must be between 6 and 10 pages (inclusive). This limit will be strictly enforced. Papers with main text on the 11th page will be desk rejected. The page limit applies to both the initial and final camera-ready version.\n\n## Style Files and Templates\n\nTo prepare your submission to ICLR 2025, please use the LaTeX style files provided at: [https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2025.zip](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2025.zip)\n\n## Reviewing Process\n\nSubmissions to ICLR are uploaded on OpenReview, which enables public discussion. Official reviews are anonymous and publicly visible.\n\n## Reciprocal Reviewing Requirement\n\nNew this year, there is a requirement for authors to serve as reviewers based on the number of papers they submit.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nAll ICLR participants, including authors, are required to adhere to the ICLR code of conduct ([https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfConduct](https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfConduct)).\n\n## Code of Ethics\n\nAll ICLR participants, including authors, are required to adhere to the ICLR Code of Ethics ([https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfEthics](https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfEthics)).\n\n## Dual Submission Policy\n\nSubmissions that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to this or other conferences or journals, are not allowed and violate our dual submission policy.\n\n## The Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\nThe use of LLMs is allowed as a general-purpose assist tool. Authors and reviewers should understand that they take full responsibility for the contents written under their name, including content generated by LLMs that could be construed as plagiarism or scientific misconduct (e.g., fabrication of facts). LLMs are not eligible for authorship.\n\n## Withdrawal Policy\n\nAuthors have the right to withdraw papers from consideration at any time until paper notification."
