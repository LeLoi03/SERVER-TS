  "Call for Papers": "# DaMoN 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 21st International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware (DaMoN) will be a one-day workshop held on **Monday, June 23, 2025, in Berlin, Germany**, in conjunction with **ACM SIGMOD/PODS 2025**.\n\nThe workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in optimizing database performance on modern computing infrastructure by designing new data management techniques and tools.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe seek submissions bridging database systems to computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems. We also invite submissions on hardware/software co-design for modern data-intensive workloads, including but not limited to machine learning training and inference, graph analytics, and similar tasks.  Submissions covering topics from the following non-exclusive list are encouraged:\n\n*   database algorithms and data structures on modern hardware\n*   cost models and query optimization for novel hierarchical memory systems\n*   hardware systems for query processing\n*   data management using co-processors\n*   novel application of new storage technologies to data management\n*   query processing using computing power in storage systems\n*   database architectures for low-power computing and embedded devices\n*   database architectures on multi-threaded and chip multiprocessors\n*   performance analysis of database workloads on modern hardware\n*   compiler and operating systems advances to improve database performance\n*   new benchmarks for micro-architectural evaluation of database workloads\n*   taking advantage of modern network capabilities for data processing\n*   hardware/software co-design for modern data-intensive workloads (e.g., machine learning, graph analytics)\n\n## Submission Tracks\n\nWe invite submissions to two tracks:\n\n*   **Full papers:** A full paper must be no longer than six pages, excluding the bibliography.  Accepted papers will be given 10 pages (plus a bibliography) for the camera-ready version and a long presentation slot during the workshop.\n*   **Short Papers:** Short papers must not exceed two pages, excluding the bibliography. Short papers will be included in the proceedings, given 4 pages (plus a bibliography) for the camera-ready version, and may be given a short presentation slot during the workshop.\n\nAll accepted papers (full and short) will also be presented as posters during a workshop poster session.\n\n## Best of DaMoN 2025\n\nThis year all accepted DaMoN papers will be considered for a best paper award. We intend to invite extended versions of a selection of DaMoN'25 papers for submission to the VLDB Journal.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission:** March 21st, 2025 (11:59 pm AoE)\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** April 28th, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready copies:** TBD\n*   **Workshop:** June 23rd, 2025\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nAuthors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that are not being considered for publication in any other forum. Manuscripts should be submitted electronically as PDF files using the latest ACM paper format consistent with the [ACM SIGMOD formatting guidelines](https://2025.sigmod.org/calls_papers_sigmod_research.shtml) to the DaMoN 2025 CMT site at [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DaMoN2025](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DaMoN2025) (available from mid-February on). Submissions will be reviewed in a single-blind manner. Submissions that are two pages or shorter, excluding the bibliography, will be reviewed as short papers. Submissions that are six pages or shorter, excluding the bibliography, will be reviewed as full papers. Submissions that are longer than six pages, excluding the bibliography, will be desk-rejected.\n\nAccepted papers will be included in the informal online proceedings at the website. Additionally, all accepted papers will be published online in the ACM Digital Library. Therefore, the papers must include the standard ACM copyright notice on the first page.\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   **Chairs:**\n    *   Carsten Binnig, TU Darmstadt, Germany ([carsten.binnig@cs.tu-darmstadt.de](mailto:carsten.binnig@cs.tu-darmstadt.de))\n    *   Eric Sedlar, Oracle Labs ([eric.sedlar@oracle.com](mailto:eric.sedlar@oracle.com))\n*   **Members:** Anastasia Ailamaki, Yannis Chronis, Muhammad El-Hindi, Jana Giceva, Norman May, Beng Chin Ooi, Orestis Polychroniou, Danica Porobic, Tilmann Rabl, Kenneth Ross, Rathijit Sen, Utku Sirin, Rebecca Taft, Pinar Tozun, Tianzheng Wang, Huanchen Zhang, Tobias Ziegler\n\n## Steering Committee\n\n*   Anastasia Ailamaki\n*   Peter Boncz\n*   Stefan Manegold\n*   Ken Ross"
