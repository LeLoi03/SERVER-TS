  "Call for Papers": "# IEEE MASS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 22nd IEEE International Conference on Mobile Ad-Hoc and Smart Systems (MASS 2025) will be held in **Chicago, USA, from October 6-8, 2025.**\n\nIEEE MASS is a premier annual forum for sharing original, novel ideas in mobile ad-hoc networks and smart systems, defined broadly.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   5G/6G networks and technologies\n*   AI/ML for smart wireless networks\n*   AI and machine learning aided protocol design and resource allocation\n*   AI and machine learning based applications for ad hoc networks\n*   Algorithms for MANETs and WSNs\n*   Application Layer Protocols\n*   Clustering, topology control, coverage, and connectivity\n*   Cognitive networking\n*   Cooperative and cognitive communication\n*   Cooperative sensing, compressive sensing, sensing from communications\n*   Cloud, crowd-sourced, participatory and (mobile) social sensing\n*   Cyber-physical systems and applications\n*   Data gathering, fusion, and dissemination\n*   Energy-efficient architectures, algorithms, and protocols\n*   Experiences in real-world applications and deployments\n*   Flying Ad-Hoc Networks\n*   Free-space optical networks\n*   Heterogeneous networks\n*   Internet of Things (IoT) devices, gateways, and infrastructure\n*   Light-weight distributed machine learning\n*   Localization and Location Based Services\n*   Measurements, experimental systems and test-beds\n*   Mobile computing and networking\n*   mmWave and Terahertz networks\n*   Mobility modeling and management\n*   Multi-channel, multi-radio and MIMO technologies\n*   Network components, operating systems, and middleware\n*   Opportunistic networking, delay tolerant networking\n*   QoS and Resource management\n*   Robotic networks\n*   Routing protocols\n*   Scalability, stability, and robustness of networks and sensor systems\n*   Security and privacy at all layers, including the physical layer\n*   Sensor enabled drone, UAV, UUV systems\n*   Smart grid, healthcare, transportation applications\n*   Vehicular networks and protocols\n*   Visible light communications\n*   Wearable and human-centric devices and networks\n\n## Submission Guidelines and Proceedings\n\nAuthors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers that are not currently under review elsewhere. All submissions should be written in English with a maximum length of 9 single-spaced, double-column pages using 10pt fonts on 8.5 in x 11 in paper, including all figures, tables, and references, in PDF format. Authors must use the Manuscript Templates for IEEE Conference Proceedings. Reviewing will be single-blind, i.e., authors can keep their names on their submitted paper. Accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings published by IEEE and will be presented at the conference. Based on TPC reviews and discussions, some papers may be accepted as 5-page short papers or 2-page posters in addition to the regular 9-page papers.\n\nFor each accepted paper to be published in the IEEE MASS 2025 Proceedings and IEEE Xplore, at least one author is required to register and attend the conference. The paper must be presented by an author listed on the paper. Substitute presenters, due to unforeseen circumstances or verifiable excuses, must be authorized in advance by the TPC Chairs. Unauthorized substitute presentations will result in the paper not being added to the IEEE digital archive of the conference proceedings.\n\n## Important Dates (EDT)\n\n*   **Paper Submission Due:** April 15, 2025\n*   **Acceptance Notification:** June 30, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready Version:** July 31, 2025\n*   **Conference Dates:** October 6-8, 2025\n\n## Submission System (EDAS)\n\n[https://edas.info/N33357](https://edas.info/N33357)"
