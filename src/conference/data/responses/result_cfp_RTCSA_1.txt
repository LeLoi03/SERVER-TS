  "callForPapers": "# Call for Papers\n\nThe International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE) is a premier conference for research related to empirical software engineering. EASE 2025 welcomes high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results.\n\n## Topics\n\nEASE welcomes papers addressing topics related to evaluating and assessing software products, processes, practices, tools & techniques, including:\n\n*   Meta-science (e.g., papers about research methods and methodological issues, whether empirical or conceptual)\n*   Infrastructure and techniques for conducting empirical studies on software engineering\n*   Theory development, operationalization, testing, and application\n*   Applications of evaluation and assessment in specific contexts, such as:\n    *   Software Requirements\n    *   Software Architecture\n    *   Data-Driven Software Engineering\n    *   Global Software Engineering\n    *   Software Design\n    *   Software Construction\n    *   Software Testing\n    *   Software Operations\n    *   DevOps and Continuous Delivery\n    *   Software Maintenance\n    *   Software Configuration Management\n    *   Software Engineering Management\n    *   Software Engineering Models and Methods\n    *   Software Engineering Process (e.g., agile, hybrid)\n    *   Software Quality\n    *   AI-Based Software Development\n    *   Human factors and behavioral aspects of Software Engineering\n    *   Software development practices and process improvement\n    *   Sustainability in Software Engineering\n    *   Inter- or multi-disciplinary studies intersecting software engineering\n    *   Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering\n    *   Ethics in Software Engineering\n\nEASE also welcomes studies with negative findings or non-significant results.\n\n## How to Submit\n\n*   All papers must be submitted in PDF format through the web-based submission system [EasyChair for EASE 2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ease2025).\n*   Submissions must not exceed **10 pages** for the main text, including all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Up to two additional pages containing ONLY references are permitted.\n*   All submissions should use the official ACM Primary Article Template. Deviating from the ACM formatting instructions may lead to a desk rejection. LaTeX users should use the following options:\n    ```latex\n    \\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}\n    \\acmConference[EASE 2025]{The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering}{17–20 June, 2025}{Istanbul, Türkiye}\n    ```\n*   Authors must comply with the [SIGSOFT Open Science Policy](SIGSOFT Open Science Policies).\n*   EASE 2025 will employ a double-anonymous review process. Do not include author names or affiliations in submissions. All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. Any online supplements, replication packages, etc., referred to in the work should also be anonymized. Advice for sharing supplements anonymously can be found [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/anonymity-policy).\n*   By submitting to EASE, authors agree to the [ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification](ACM Policy on Plagiarism, etc.).\n*   If the research involves human participants/subjects, the authors must adhere to the [ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).\n\n## Review Criteria\n\nThe reviewers will be encouraged to do a standards-based review. To see the criteria for standards-based reviews, please use this tool: [Empirical Standards Checklist](https://acmsigsoft.github.io/EmpiricalStandards/form_generator/Checklist.html?role=author).\n\nThe reviews will evaluate submissions additionally against the following criteria:\n\n*   **Soundness:** The extent to which the paper’s contributions and innovations address its research questions and are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods\n*   **Significance:** The extent to which the paper’s contributions can impact the field of software engineering and under which assumptions (if any)\n*   **Novelty:** The extent to which the contributions are sufficiently original with respect to the state-of-the-art\n*   **Verifiability and Transparency:** The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to understand how an innovation works, how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, and how the paper supports independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions.\n*   **Presentation:** The extent to which the paper’s quality of writing meets the high standards of EASE, including clear descriptions, adequate use of the English language, absence of significant ambiguity, clearly readable figures and tables, and adherence to the formatting instructions provided above.",
  "summary": "The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE) will be held in Istanbul, Turkey, from June 17-20, 2025.
