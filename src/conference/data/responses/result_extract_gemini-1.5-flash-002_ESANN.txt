  "Call for Papers": "# ESANN 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 33rd European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning (ESANN 2025) will be held as a **hybrid event** in **Bruges, Belgium and online from April 23-25, 2025**.\n\n## Scope and Topics\n\nESANN 2025 covers artificial neural networks, machine learning, statistical information processing, and computational intelligence. Mathematical foundations, algorithms and tools, and applications are covered.\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of topics:\n\n*   Neural networks\n*   Deep learning\n*   Kernel machines\n*   Signal processing and modeling\n*   Transfer learning\n*   Graphical models, EM and Bayesian learning\n*   Classification and clustering\n*   Vector quantization and self-organizing maps\n*   Recurrent networks and dynamical systems\n*   Time series forecasting\n*   Single- and zero-shot learning\n*   Ensemble learning\n*   Feature selection\n*   Graphs and networks\n*   Nonlinear dimensionality reduction\n*   Manifold learning\n*   Statistical and mathematical aspects of learning\n*   Trustworthy AI\n*   Image processing\n*   Natural Language Processing\n*   Data mining\n*   Machine learning for signal processing\n*   Multimodal interfaces and multichannel processing\n*   Vision and sensory systems\n*   Data visualization\n*   Identification of non-linear dynamical systems\n*   Machine learning for healthcare\n*   Evolutionary computation for machine learning\n*   Bioinformatics\n*   Bio-inspired systems\n*   Brain-computer interfaces\n\n## Special Sessions\n\nSpecial sessions will be organized by renowned scientists in their respective fields. Papers submitted to these sessions are reviewed according to the same criteria as the submissions to the regular sessions.  See the [special sessions](https://www.esann.org/special-sessions) page for details.\n\n## Talks and Posters\n\nAccepted papers are presented either as talks or posters. Authors may indicate their preference at submission; however, as ESANN is a single-track conference, the number of slots for talks is limited. All poster presentations are coupled to a one-minute spotlight oral presentation during a plenary session.\n\n## Deadline\n\n**Prospective authors are invited to submit their contributions before November 20, 2024.**"
