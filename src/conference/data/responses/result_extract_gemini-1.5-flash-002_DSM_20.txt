  "Summary": "The Models and Evolution workshop promotes novel theories, techniques, and tools to support the evolution of model artifacts in software and systems engineering. The 2024 workshop was co-located with Models'24 and held at Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria on September 24, 2024.",
  "Call for Papers": "# Models and Evolution 2024: Call for Papers\n\nThe Models and Evolution workshop aims to provide a forum to present and discuss bleeding-edge research contributions related to model evolution, and to provide visibility to novel technical solutions, early new ideas, and outside-the-box approaches.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:\n\n### Foundations\n\n*   Theories, methods, and tools for (meta-)model evolution\n*   Co-evolution across multiple meta-levels (incl. instance and data levels)\n\n### Correctness and quality aspects\n\n*   Correctness and consistency concerns of model evolution\n*   Verification and validation of evolving MDE artifacts\n\n### Applications\n\n*   Software migration, reconstruction, reuse, and repurposing\n*   Evolution of heterogeneous systems, e.g., CPS and digital twins, including the (co-)evolution of virtual and physical artifacts and infrastructure\n*   Empirical works, industry reports, patterns and catalogs, training and education in the area of model evolution\n\n## Paper Types\n\nWe solicit three types of papers:\n\n1.  **Full research papers (max. 10 pages):** novel research contributions\n2.  **Position papers (max. 5 pages):**\n    *   Work in progress: preliminary results especially by young researchers\n    *   Vision papers: new visions and strategic ideas\n    *   Industry experience reports\n3.  **Tool papers (max. 5 pages):** experience with tools for model-based software evolution and evolution issues encountered in model-based development\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAll submitted papers must adhere to the ACM Conference format, and submitted electronically through EasyChair ([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=me20240](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=me20240)).\n\nLaTeX users must use the provided `acmart.cls` and `ACM-Reference-Format.bst` without modification, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e., `\\documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}`), and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e., `\\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}`). The `review` option adds line numbers, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments.\n\nAll submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee. Papers submitted to the workshop should have at least 5 pages and 10 pages for full papers following the same style and format of the main tracks of the Conference. Submissions that do not adhere to the formatting instructions may be desk-rejected without review.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nWe follow the defined deadlines by the MODELS workshop co-chairs.\n\n*   **Abstract submission:** July 5, 2024\n*   **Paper submission:** July 15, 2024\n*   **Author notification:** August 7, 2024\n*   **Camera-ready:** August 16, 2024"
