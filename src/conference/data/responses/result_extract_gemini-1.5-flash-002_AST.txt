  "Call for Papers": "# AST 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 6th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automation of Software Test (AST 2025) will be held in **Ottawa, Ontario, Canada from April 26 to May 4, 2025**, co-located with ICSE 2025.\n\n## Scope\n\nSoftware pervasiveness in both industry and digital society, as well as the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are continuously leading to emerging needs from both software producers and consumers.  Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decades. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of the test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud.\n\nThe Automation of Software Test (AST) conference continues with a long record of international scientific forums on methods and solutions to automate software testing.  The conference promotes high-quality research contributions on methods for software test automation, and original case studies reporting practices in this field. \n\nOur theme for this year is “Adapting test automation to the AI era including sustainability and emerging challenges” with special sessions on test automation for AI, sustainability, and AI testing education and training.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nSubmissions on the AST 2025 theme are especially encouraged, but papers on other topics relevant to the automation of software tests are also welcome. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   AI for Automated Software Testing\n*   Testing of AI-based systems\n*   Effective testing through explainable AI\n*   Education to software testing with the advent of AI-based technology\n*   Automated software testing for sustainability, resource efficiency, energy consumption\n*   Codeless and low code test automation\n*   Test Automation in Software Process and Evolution, DevOps, Agile, CI/CD flows\n*   Test-driven development\n*   Model-based testing\n*   Formal methods, model checking and theories for testing and test automation\n*   Test case generation based on formal, semi-formal and AI models\n*   Theoretical foundations and methods for test automation\n*   Standardization of test languages, processes and tools\n*   Security, performance, and robustness testing\n*   Functional, interoperability, and conformance testing\n*   Usability and user experience testing\n*   Software simulation and automated software testing\n*   Testing of embedded, reactive and object-oriented systems\n*   Test automation of large complex systems\n*   Testing cyber physical systems\n*   Testing cloud and web systems and services\n*   Product line testing\n*   Testing anomaly detectors\n*   Metrics for testing - test effectiveness, efficiency, test coverage\n*   Testing tools\n*   Testing in different industry domains including healthcare, energy, finance, etc.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission:** November 9, 2024\n*   **Notification:** January 12, 2025\n*   **Final version:** January 31, 2025\n*   **Conference:** April 28-29, 2025\n\n## Submission Details\n\nThree types of submissions are invited for both research and industry:\n\n*   Regular Papers (up to 10 pages plus 2 additional pages of references)\n*   Short Papers (up to 4 pages plus 1 additional page of references)\n*   Industrial Abstracts (up to 2 pages for all materials)\n\nThe submission website is: [https://ast2025.hotcrp.com/](https://ast2025.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Organizers\n\n*   Andy Zaidman, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands (General Chair)\n*   Francesca Lonetti, ISTI-CNR, Italy (Program Co-Chair)\n*   Ina Schieferdecker, Technische Universität Berlin, Germany (Program Co-Chair)\n*   Rajesh Subramanyan, Stealth Startup & University of Washington, USA (Program Co-Chair)"
