A satellite event will be hosted in **Guangzhou, China, from August 28 to August 31, 2025** to support authors who may experience difficulties obtaining Canadian visas.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions to IJCAI 2025 should report significant, original, and previously unpublished results on any aspect of artificial intelligence. Papers on novel AI research problems, AI techniques for novel application domains, and papers that cross discipline boundaries within AI are especially encouraged.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll times are 23:59 Anywhere On Earth (UTC-12)\n\n*   **Main Track**\n    *   **Abstract submission deadline:** January 16, 2025\n    *   **Author information and Full paper submission deadline (including Appendix and resubmission information):** January 23, 2025\n    *   **Summary reject notification:** March 7, 2025\n    *   **Author response period:** April 6-9, 2025\n    *   **Paper notification:** April 28, 2025\n*   **AI, Arts and Creativity Track**\n    *   **Submission deadline (full papers, no separate abstract submission):** February 11, 2025\n    *   **Notification:** April 28, 2025\n*   **AI and Social Good Track**\n    *   **Submission deadline (full papers, no separate abstract submission):** February 11, 2025\n    *   **Notification:** April 28, 2025\n\n## Conference Dates\n\n*   **Conference (Montreal):** Saturday, August 16 to Friday, August 22, 2025\n*   **Satellite event (Guangzhou):** Thursday, August 28 to Sunday, August 31, 2025\n\n## Paper Length and Format\n\n*   Papers must be no longer than 9 pages in total: 7 pages for the body of the paper and 2 pages for references.\n*   An optional ethics statement can be placed in the body of the paper or in the reference pages.\n*   For accepted papers, the last two pages can also contain acknowledgements and an optional contribution statement.\n*   For accepted papers, up to two additional pages may be purchased at an additional cost per page.\n*   Overlength papers will be rejected without review.\n*   Supplementary material (e.g., appendices, data, source code, resubmission information) must be submitted by the full paper submission deadline.\n\n## Submission Process\n\n*   The updated LaTeX styles and Word template will be available at [https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit](https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit) in December 2024.\n*   Submissions must be made through the CMT system: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCAI2025](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IJCAI2025)\n*   All authors must provide author information.\n*   All authors are expected to be available to review (unless extenuating circumstances apply).\n*   IJCAI 2025 will enforce a strict submission limit. Each author is limited to no more than 8 submissions to IJCAI 2025.\n\n## Review Process\n\nThe reviewing process will proceed in two phases:\n\n*   **Phase 1:** Every paper will receive two reviews by PC members. If a paper receives two good-quality reviews that are not sufficiently positive in Phase 1, it will be rejected without any opportunity to submit an author response.\n*   **Phase 2:** Papers passing the summary reject step will receive additional reviews by a group of PC members (PCs) and SPC members (SPCs).  Area Chairs (ACs) will coordinate the review process and write a meta-review with a recommendation cross-checked by a Senior Area Chair (SAC). The full paper review process will allow authors to respond to the reviews.  Author responses should be concise and are not intended to create a dialogue between reviewers and authors.\n\n## Participation in the Conference\n\nAt least one author of each accepted paper must participate in the conference at Montreal and present the work. Authors who possess evidence indicating their inability to obtain visas for Canada may submit a request to [pcchair@2025.ijcai.org](mailto:pcchair@2025.ijcai.org) to participate in the satellite event in Guangzhou.\n\nPapers not presented in person, whether at the main conference in Montreal or the satellite event in Guangzhou, will be excluded from the proceedings unless one of the authors provides notification of exceptional circumstances to IJCAI via [pcchair@2025.ijcai.org](mailto:pcchair@2025.ijcai.org). Any such exceptional circumstances must receive prior approval from IJCAI.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor inquiries, email [pcchair@2025.ijcai.org](mailto:pcchair@2025.ijcai.org)"
