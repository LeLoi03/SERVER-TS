  "Call for Papers": "# SSS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 27th International Symposium on Stabilization, Safety, and Security of Distributed Systems (SSS 2025) will take place from **October 9-11, 2025**, at the **Aloft Hotel Kathmandu in Kathmandu, Nepal**.\n\nSSS is an international forum for researchers and practitioners in the design and development of distributed systems with a focus on systems that are able to provide guarantees on their structure, performance, and/or security in the face of an adverse operational environment.\n\n## Tracks\n\nThe symposium encourages submissions of original contributions on both fundamental research and practical applications concerning topics in the symposium tracks:\n\n*   **Track A. Stabilization and Locality in Distributed Computing**\n*   **Track B. Time, Safety, and Security in Distributed Computing**\n*   **Track C. Moving and Computing**\n\n## New Conference Model\n\nWe experiment with a new conference model. There will be **THREE non-overlapping deadlines**, and thus three submission rounds. Papers that are rejected at an early round (1 or 2) may be reworked, corrected, enhanced, and resubmitted at a later round (2 or 3), if wished by the authors. In case of resubmission, reviews from the previously submitted round will be transmitted to the reviewers of the resubmission round.\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nPapers are to be submitted electronically through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sss2025). All submissions must conform to the formatting instructions of the Springer LNCS series. Each submission must be an original work written in English, in PDF format.\n\n## Double-blind Review\n\nAll submissions must be anonymous. We use a somewhat relaxed implementation of double-blind peer review: you are free to disseminate your work through arXiv and other online repositories and give presentations on your work as usual. However, please make sure you do not mention your own name or affiliation in the submission, and please do not include obvious references in the text that reveal your identity.\n\n## Submissions\n\nThere are two types of submissions: regular papers and brief announcements.\n\n*   A regular submission must not exceed 15 pages (including the title, abstract, figures, and excluding references).\n*   A brief announcement submission must not exceed 5 pages including everything.\n\nAny submission deviating from these guidelines will be rejected without consideration of its merits.\n\n## Publication\n\nRegular papers and brief announcements will be included in the conference proceedings. Conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS conference series.\n\n## Special Issue\n\nExtended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of an international journal (under negotiation).\n\n## Paper Award\n\nPrizes will be given to the best regular paper and best student regular paper.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 11:59 PM AoE (Anywhere on Earth).\n\n### First Deadline\n\n*   Paper Submission Deadline: March 21, 2025\n*   Acceptance Notification: April 30, 2025\n*   Camera-Ready Copy Due: May 10, 2025\n\n### Second Deadline\n\n*   Paper Submission Deadline: May 15, 2025\n*   Acceptance Notification: June 30, 2025\n*   Camera-Ready Copy Due: July 10, 2025\n\n### Third Deadline\n\n*   Paper Submission Deadline: July 15, 2025\n*   Acceptance Notification: August 30, 2025\n*   Camera-Ready Copy Due: September 10, 2025"
