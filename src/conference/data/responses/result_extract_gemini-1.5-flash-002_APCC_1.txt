For the regular tracks and special sessions, we invite you to contribute your original work on topics in the following, but not limited to, areas:\n\n### Track #1: Signal Processing for Communications\n\n*   Advanced equalization, channel estimation, signal detection, and synchronization techniques\n*   Novel architectures for signal demodulation and decoding\n*   Signal processing for millimeter and Tera-Hz communication systems\n*   Signal processing for single-carrier, OFDM, and NOMA systems\n*   Signal processing for MIMO/Massive MIMO systems\n*   Machine learning and stochastic geometry-based signal processing\n\n### Track #2: Wireless Communications\n\n*   Antennas and propagation\n*   MIMO, multi-user MIMO, and massive MIMO\n*   OFDM and multi-carrier systems\n*   Multiple access techniques and air interfaces (CDMA, TDMA, FDMA, OFDMA, NOMA)\n*   Millimeter wave and Terahertz communications\n*   Maritime, space, and underwater communications\n*   Intelligent reflecting surfaces for wireless communications\n*   Ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC)\n*   Spectrum sharing and coexistence in heterogeneous networks\n*   Privacy and security in wireless communications\n*   Visible light communications (VLC) and optical wireless communications (OWC)\n*   Wireless charging and energy harvesting\n*   Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) for wireless communications\n\n### Track #3: Networking\n\n*   Beyond 5G/6G and other emerging broadband wireless networks\n*   WLAN, WPAN, and other home/personal networking technologies\n*   Optical network architecture, design, and control\n*   Non-terrestrial networks (NTN)\n*   V2X and Vehicular networks\n*   Maritime and underwater wireless networks\n*   Network function virtualization (NFV) and software-defined networking (SDN)\n*   Information-centric networks (ICN) and content centric networks (CCN)\n*   Green networks and sustainable communication technologies\n*   AI/ML based networks\n\n### Track #4: Emerging Technologies, Applications, and Services\n\n*   Context and location-aware wireless services and applications\n*   Edge, fog, and cloud computing for emerging applications and services\n*   User-centric networks and adaptive services\n*   Wireless body area networks and e-health services\n*   Intelligent transportation systems\n*   Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities\n*   Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLT)\n*   Cybersecurity and privacy for communication systems\n*   Human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience (UX)\n\n### Special Sessions\n\n*   SS1: Ambient Intelligence for Smart City ([link](../call-for-special-session-papers#ss1-ambient-intelligence-for-smart-city))\n*   SS2: Alternative Radio Efficiency: Semantic communications and ML-based semantic video transfer ([link](../call-for-special-session-papers#ss2-alternative-radio-efficiency-semantic-communications-and-ml-based-semantic-video-transfer))\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nThe paper submission process will be managed by using EDAS. Prospective authors may submit full or short papers. Paper length should be 3-6 pages for a full paper and 2 pages for a short paper including figures, tables, references, and appendices. Please use the standard IEEE conference proceedings templates for Microsoft Word or LaTeX format on A4 size pages found at [https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).\n\nSubmitted papers (for both regular track and special sessions) are subject to a blind reviewed process handled by an international technical program committee.\n\n## Proceedings\n\nAll accepted and presented papers in the conference are expected to be included in the proceedings of the conference as well as IEICE Proceeding Series, and IEEE Xplore Digital Library. The copyright of accepted papers will be transferred to IEICE. To be published in the proceedings, for each accepted paper, at least one author is required to register for the conference, and the paper must be presented at the conference by one of the authors.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Regular/special session paper submission:**\n    *   Manuscript submission: June 5, 2025\n    *   Notification of acceptance: September 10, 2025\n    *   Camera-ready submission: October 15, 2025\n*   **Proposal submission:**\n    *   Special sessions: May 7, 2025 (Extended)\n    *   Tutorials: July 31, 2025"
