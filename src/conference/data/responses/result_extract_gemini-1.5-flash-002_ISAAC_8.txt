  "Call for Papers": "# ISSAC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC 2025) will be held from **July 28th to August 1st, 2025, at the Center for Research in Mathematics (CIMAT) in Guanajuato, Mexico.**\n\nISSAC is the premier conference for research in symbolic computation and computer algebra. ISSAC 2025 will be the 50th meeting in the series.\n\n## Call for Regular Papers\n\nISSAC 2025 invites the submission of original research contributions to be considered for publication and presentation at the conference. Papers should not duplicate work published or submitted for consideration elsewhere.\n\n*   Papers must be in English and should not exceed 8 pages in the ACM two-column style ([http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)), which can be downloaded from: [https://portalparts.acm.org/hippo/latex_templates/acmart-primary.zip](https://portalparts.acm.org/hippo/latex_templates/acmart-primary.zip).\n*   However, 2 additional pages may be used for bibliographical references, and/or for experimental results (tables, figures), experimental data (e.g., input or output systems for a solver), and computer program code (library code, scripts, worksheets, Makefiles, etc.). The portion of the paper before these two additional pages must be self-contained.\n*   Extended abstracts are not allowed.\n*   At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper.\n*   Submission is via EasyChair at [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=issac2025](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=issac2025).\n\n## Call for Software Presentations\n\nThe software presentations at ISSAC are opportunities to demonstrate and communicate about new implementations of algorithms in symbolic and algebraic computation.\n\n*   Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract in PDF format of no more than 4 pages.\n*   The abstracts will be reviewed by the software committee and relevant experts when needed.\n*   The accepted software abstracts will be printed and distributed at the conference as well as published in an upcoming issue of the ACM SIGSAM Communications in Computer Algebra.\n\n## Call for Poster Presentations\n\nThe poster session at ISSAC is a venue to announce early research results or ongoing projects that might not yet be complete. Posters reporting on recent work published or accepted or submitted elsewhere are also welcome (with original publications clearly referenced).\n\n*   Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract in PDF format of no more than 4 pages.\n*   The abstracts will be reviewed by the short communications committee and relevant experts when needed.\n*   The accepted poster abstracts will be printed and distributed at the conference as well as published in an upcoming issue of the ACM SIGSAM Communications in Computer Algebra.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Conference:** July 28 - August 1, 2025\n\n### Regular Papers\n\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** January 30, 2025, 23:59 (anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** February 6, 2025, 23:59 (anywhere on Earth)\n*   **First notification of acceptance/rejection:** April 23, 2025\n*   **End of rebuttal phase:** May 4, 2025, 23:59 (anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Final notification after rebuttal phase:** May 16, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready copy due:** June 10, 2025, 23:59 (anywhere on Earth)\n\n### Short Communications (Posters)\n\n*   **Abstract submission (.pdf) deadline:** May 14, 2025, 23:59 (anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Notification of acceptance/rejection:** May 24, 2025\n*   **Final version (.tex) due:** June 11, 2025\n\n### Software Presentations\n\n*   **Submission software presentations:** April 16, 2025, 23:59 (anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Notification of acceptance/rejection:** May 7, 2025\n*   **Final version due:** June 11, 2025"
