  "Call for Papers": "# NSPW 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW 2025) invites submissions exploring current trends and groundbreaking ideas in computer security research. NSPW 2025 is an invitation-only event consisting of in-depth 1-hour discussions of each of the 10–12 accepted papers.  The workshop will be held from **August 24-27, 2025, at the Schlosshotel Münchhausen in Aerzen, Germany.**\n\n## Theme\n\nThe theme for NSPW 2025 is **Trusting**.\n\nRelevant topics include:\n\n*   Novel paradigms for conceptualising trust and trusting in computer security\n*   Trust decisions in a world of deepfakes and misinformation\n*   Detection of breach of trust, intrusion and misinformation\n*   Trust boundaries and threat modeling\n*   Trust in changing threat landscapes and technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence\n*   Trust evaluation\n*   Social configuration of trust and mistrust in organisations\n*   Trust and mistrust as methodological problems in studies of computer security\n*   The consequences of not trusting\n*   Audits and certifications\n*   Authentication and authorization\n*   Reputation systems and reviewer/recommender systems\n*   Anomaly detection\n*   Formal verification and testing\n*   Privacy\n*   Decentralized trust\n*   Zero trust architectures\n*   Human, social and organisational understandings of trust in technologies\n\nOther interpretations of trusting are welcome.\n\n## Submission Types\n\nNSPW 2025 invites three types of submissions:\n\n1.  **Regular submissions:** present a new approach (paradigm) to a security problem or critique existing approaches. While regular submissions may present research results (mathematical or experimental), these results should not be the focus of the submission; instead, the change in approach should be the focus.\n2.  **Theme Submissions:** are focused on “Trusting” and should explain the connection with the theme in the justification statement (see below). They follow the format of a regular submission.\n3.  **Implementation Submissions:** explore implementing previous NSPW submissions. These submissions should clearly cite which previous work(s) is being referenced and how the current submission extends beyond the original scope. Original authors may be involved or not; if not, they will be offered the chance to comment on the submission.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nAll submissions are treated as confidential as a matter of policy. NSPW does not accept previously published or concurrently submitted papers.\n\n*   **Due Date:** April 25, 2025\n*   **Response Date:** May 30, 2025\n*   **Format:** PDF format, 6–15 pages, ACM “sigconf” formatting\n*   **Submission:** [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025)\n\n### Special Submission Instructions\n\nEach paper requires two separate EasyChair submissions:\n\n1.  Cover page with authors’ names, affiliation, and the participation statement\n2.  Anonymous PDF paper with a justification statement\n\nThe participation statement must specify which author(s) will attend upon acceptance/invitation, that all authors will engage in good faith with the feedback given in the review and revision periods, and that all authors will abide by the NSPW code of conduct.\n\nThe justification statement (clearly marked as part of the PDF submission) briefly explains why the submission is appropriate for NSPW and the chosen submission category. The justification statement will not appear in the final publication.\n\nTo support double-blind reviewing, the cover page should not be part of the PDF submission but will be submitted separately on EasyChair. Submissions that do not include both statements risk rejection without review. In addition, submissions should blind author identity where possible.\n\n## Publication\n\nDepending on publication venue, there may be open access publication fees, and we encourage authors to ensure their institution can cover these fees before submitting. Further details regarding publication will be forthcoming.\n\n## Social Contract and Code of Conduct\n\nGiven the focus on the development and exploration of new ideas, the process for paper submission, revision, presentation, and publication at NSPW is different from many other security conferences. Accepted papers are shepherded and revised before the workshop; this revised version is then presented and discussed in an hour-long session. After the workshop, the final version is produced, incorporating the discussions and feedback. Acceptance to the workshop is conditional on engagement with this process.\n\nAll participants must commit to a “social contract”: no one arrives late, no one leaves early, no electronic distractions (including laptops, tablets, and mobile devices), attend all sessions of the 2.5-day program, share meals in a group setting, and comply with the code of conduct. The workshop is preceded by an evening reception allowing attendees to meet each other beforehand.\n\nNSPW is making arrangements for (some) child care during the event. If any potential attendee wants to take advantage of this or has questions, please email [general-chairs@nspw.org](mailto:general-chairs@nspw.org) now. We would like to get a general understanding of interest and capacity to assist with planning for the event.\n\nThe submission, review, and workshop phases of NSPW are all governed by the NSPW code of conduct: [https://www.nspw.org/conduct](https://www.nspw.org/conduct)."
