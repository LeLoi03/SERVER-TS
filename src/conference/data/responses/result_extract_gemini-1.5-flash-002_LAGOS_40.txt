  "Call for Papers": "# LAGOS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe XIII Latin American Algorithms, Graphs, and Optimization Symposium (LAGOS 2025) will be held in **Buenos Aires, Argentina, from November 10–14, 2025** at the **Pabellón Cero + Infinito, Universidad de Buenos Aires**.\n\nLAGOS is a biennial event that brings together researchers and practitioners from around the world. It is the merger of two Latin American conferences: the Brazilian Symposium on Graphs, Algorithms, and Combinatorics (GRACO) and the Latin American Conference on Combinatorics, Graphs, and Applications (LACGA).\n\n## Honorees\n\nThis special edition of LAGOS honors three distinguished scholars in celebration of their 60th birthdays:\n\n*   Guillermo Durán, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina\n*   Cláudia Linhares Sales, Universidade Federal do Ceará, Brazil\n*   Fábio Protti, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil\n\n## Plenary Speakers\n\n*   Flavia Bonomo-Braberman, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina\n*   Mitre Dourado, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n*   Mariana Escalante, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Argentina\n*   Mario Guajardo, NHH Norwegian School of Economics, Norway\n*   Martine Labbé, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium\n*   Martin Milanič, University of Primorska, Slovenia\n*   Irena Penev, Charles University, Czech Republic\n*   Bruce Reed, Academia Sinica, Taiwan\n*   Ana Silva, Università degli Studi di Firenze, Italy & Universidade Federal do Ceará, Brazil\n*   Zoran Stanić, University of Belgrade, Serbia\n*   Andrés Weintraub, Universidad de Chile, Chile\n\n## Scope and Topics\n\nLAGOS 2025 invites submissions on a broad range of topics, including but not limited to:\n\n*   **Algorithms and Complexity:** Approximation algorithms, computational complexity, parallel and distributed algorithms, parameterized complexity, computational geometry, randomized algorithms.\n*   **Operations Research and Optimization:** Combinatorial optimization, integer programming, polyhedral combinatorics, heuristics and metaheuristics.\n*   **Graph Theory:** Cliques, independent and dominating sets, colorings, covering and packing, matchings, digraphs, graph algorithms, graphs and matrices, hypergraphs, perfect graphs, random graphs, structural characterization of graph classes.\n*   **Applications:** Mathematical programming, combinatorial optimization applied to areas such as logistics, scheduling, resource allocation, and other real-world problems.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nProceedings will be published in *Procedia Computer Science* (Elsevier).\n\nAuthors are invited to submit original contributions in English, following the journal’s [template for LAGOS 2025](ecrc-procs_LAGOS2025.zip) and [Guide for Authors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/procedia-computer-science/publish/guide-for-authors).\n\n*   Submissions should not exceed eight (8) single-column pages, including references.\n*   If necessary, additional content may be included in an appendix, which will not be published in the proceedings but will be available to the reviewers.\n*   Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or previously published papers is not allowed.\n*   At least one author of each accepted paper must register and present the paper at the event for it to be included in the proceedings.\n*   Submissions must be made electronically through the EasyChair platform: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lagos2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lagos2025)\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are at 23:59 Anywhere on Earth (AoE, UTC -12) Time Zone.\n\n*   **Submission Deadline:** April 30, 2025\n*   **Decision Notification:** July 20, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready Version Deadline:** August 14, 2025\n*   **Early Bird Registration Deadline:** October 7, 2025\n*   **Event Dates:** November 10–14, 2025\n\n## Special Issue\n\nA special issue of *Discrete Applied Mathematics* will be devoted to selected full papers after the event. The Call for Papers will be announced in the coming months.\n\n## Committees\n\n*   **Steering Committee:**\n    *   Flavia Bonomo-Braberman, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina\n    *   Manoel Campêlo, Universidade Federal do Ceará, Brazil\n    *   Guillermo Durán, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina\n    *   Celina Herrera de Figueiredo, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n    *   Martín Matamala, Universidad de Chile, Chile\n    *   Miguel Pizaña, Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, Mexico\n*   **Emeritus Steering Committee:**\n    *   Thomas Liebling, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland\n    *   Jayme Luiz Szwarcfiter, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n*   **General Chairs of LAGOS 2025:**\n    *   Luciano Grippo, Universidad Nacional de General Sarmiento, Argentina\n    *   Martín Safe, Universidad Nacional del Sur, Argentina\n*   **Program Committee:**  *(A very long list of program committee members is omitted here.)*\n"
