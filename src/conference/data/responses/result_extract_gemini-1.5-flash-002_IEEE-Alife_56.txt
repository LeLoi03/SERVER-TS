  "Call for Papers": "# IEEE SSCI 2025: Call for Papers and Abstracts\n\nThe 2025 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (IEEE SSCI 2025) will be held in **Trondheim, Norway, from March 17-20, 2025**.\n\nIEEE SSCI is widely recognized for cultivating the interchange of state-of-the-art theories and sophisticated algorithms within the broad realm of Computational Intelligence Applications. The Symposia provide for cross-pollination of research concepts, fostering an environment that facilitates future inter and intra collaborations.\n\n## Symposia Overview\n\nThe 2025 event launches the newly restructured biennial Symposia Series featuring ten dedicated Applied Computational Intelligence Symposia:\n\n1.  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI for Energy, Transport and Environmental Sustainability (IEEE CIETES)\n2.  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Engineering / Cyber Physical Systems (IEEE CIES)\n3.  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Image, Signal Processing and Synthetic Media (IEEE CISM)\n4.  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Artificial Life and Cooperative Intelligent Systems (IEEE ALIFE-CIS)\n5.  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Security, Defence and Biometrics (IEEE CISDB)\n6.  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Health and Medicine (IEEE CIHM)\n7.  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI for Financial Engineering and Economics (IEEE CiFer)\n8.  2025 IEEE Symposia on CI in Natural Language Processing and Social Media (IEEE CI-NLPSoMe)\n9.  2025 IEEE Symposia on Trustworthy, Explainable and Responsible CI (IEEE CITREx)\n10. 2025 IEEE Symposia for Multidisciplinary Computational Intelligence Incubators (IEEE MCII)\n\n## Paper Types\n\n*   **Full papers:** Complete papers describing your novel research in full. Up to 6 pages, plus 1 page for references. A maximum of two extra content pages per full paper is allowed (i.e., up to 8 pages plus 1 page for references), at an additional charge per extra page as specified in the registration page. To be submitted for publication in the respective symposium proceedings. Lightning talk + poster.\n*   **Short papers:** Papers with novel insights, approaches or ideas which may not have been fully tested yet. Up to 4 pages, plus 1 page for references. To be submitted for publication in the respective symposium proceedings. Poster.\n*   **Late-breaking papers:** Extended abstracts with a \"prequel\" to provoke novel conversations for future work or ideas to emerge, or with a \"sequel\" to a prior research contribution, or with a discussion to alert the community of important topics that may not yet have received sufficient attention, or with an original discussion or critique of existing methodologies. Up to 2 pages, including references, if any. For presentation at the conference but not to be included in the proceedings. Poster.\n*   **Abstract (poster-only) submission:** Abstracts may involve, e.g., novel insights, or new ideas which may not have been fully tested yet, or presentation of challenges posed by a given domain that could benefit from computational intelligence. Up to 250 words. For presentation at the conference but not to be included in the proceedings. Poster.\n*   **Journal to conference (J2C):** Papers accepted at IEEE Transactions journals sponsored by CIS and first appeared in IEEEXplore within the past 2 years. Up to 1 page listing bullet points with the highlights of the paper, and an explanation on why you believe the paper to be relevant to SSCI. For presentation at the conference but not to be included in the conference proceedings. Lightning talk + poster.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Full papers & Short papers Submission Deadline:** December 1, 2024\n*   **Full papers & Short papers Notification:** January 15, 2025\n*   **Full papers & Short papers Camera-Ready:** February 15, 2025\n*   **Late-Breaking Papers, Poster-Only Submissions, J2C Submissions Deadline:** February 1, 2025\n*   **Late-Breaking Papers, Poster-Only Submissions, J2C Submissions Notification:** February 28, 2025\n*   **Late-Breaking Papers Camera-Ready:** March 10, 2025\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nFor more instructions on each kind of submission including page limitations and submission format, please see [submission instructions](\"?ui=submission-instructions\").\n\n## Download Call for Papers and Abstracts\n\n[Download Call for Papers and Abstracts](\"./assets/files/SSCI-2025-call-4-papers.pdf\")"
