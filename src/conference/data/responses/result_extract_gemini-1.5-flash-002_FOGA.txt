  "Call for Papers": "# FOGA XVIII: Call for Papers\n\nThe 18th ACM/SIGEVO Conference on Foundations of Genetic Algorithms (FOGA XVIII) will take place on **August 27–29, 2025, in Leiden, The Netherlands.**\n\nFOGA is the premier event to discuss advances on the theoretical foundations of evolutionary algorithms and related randomized search heuristics.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Run time analysis\n*   Mathematical tools suitable for the analysis of search heuristics\n*   Fitness landscapes and problem difficulty\n*   (On- and offline) configuration and selection of algorithms, heuristics, operators, and parameters\n*   Stochastic and dynamic environments, noisy evaluations\n*   Constrained optimization\n*   Problem representation\n*   Complexity theory for search heuristics\n*   Multi-objective optimization\n*   Benchmarking aspects, including performance measures, the selection of meaningful benchmark problems, and statistical aspects\n*   Connection between black-box optimization and machine learning\n\nSubmissions covering the entire spectrum of work, ranging from rigorously derived mathematical results to carefully crafted empirical studies, are invited.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll times are “Anywhere on Earth”.\n\n*   **Submission:** May 2, 2025\n*   **Notification of decision to authors:** June 27, 2025\n*   **Camera ready:** July 10, 2025\n*   **Early registration:** July 10, 2025\n*   **Conference:** August 27–29, 2025\n\n## Submission Process\n\nThis year, FOGA will use the \"linklings\" submission management system.  A separate account will be required to submit papers to FOGA. \n\n[Linklings submission page](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/FOGA)\n\n## Paper Format\n\nAuthors should submit their papers consistent with the alternate 2-column ACM SIG style file \"sigconf\" by the submission deadline (May 2, 2025). The maximum number of pages is 12, including references.\n\n## Review Process\n\nThe review process is double-blind. Selection criteria include originality of ideas, correctness, clarity, significance of results, and quality of presentation.  There will be no rebuttal opportunity for authors before discussion within the Program Committee.\n\n## Camera Ready Submission\n\nFormatting must comply with the ACM format requirements using the sigconf template.  CCS Concepts and Keywords are mandatory.\n\n## Keynote Speakers\n\n*   Joshua D. Knowles, Schlumberger Cambridge Research\n*   Stephanie Wehner, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands\n*   Tobias Glasmachers, Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Germany\n\n## Organizers\n\n*   Anna V. Kononova, General Chair\n*   Thomas Bäck, General Chair\n*   Francisco Chicano, Program Chair\n*   Jonathan Fieldsend, Program Chair\n*   Niki van Stein, Proceedings Chair\n*   Elena Raponi, Local Chair\n*   Carola Doerr, Publicity Chair"
