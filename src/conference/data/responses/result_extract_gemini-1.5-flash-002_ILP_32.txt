  "Call for Papers": "# IJCLR 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 5th International Joint Conference on Learning and Reasoning (IJCLR 2025) will be held at the **University of Surrey, Guildford, UK, from September 11-14, 2025**.\n\n## General Information\n\nSince 2021, IJCLR has aimed at being the conference bringing together the international AI community that is interested in the research of integrating learning and reasoning for addressing many of the shortcomings of contemporary AI approaches, including the black-box nature and the brittleness of deep learning, and the difficulty to adapt knowledge representation models in the light of new data.\n\n## Submission Tracks\n\nAuthors could submit their papers to the \"Main Track\" or \"Recently Published Papers Track\". Selected conference papers from these two tracks are also invited to submit a significantly revised and extended version of their paper to a post-conference special issue of the Machine Learning Journal (please see below).\n\n### Main Track\n\nConference papers describing original work with appropriate experimental evaluation and/or a self-contained theoretical contribution. Submitted conference papers should not have been published, or be under review for a journal, or another conference with published proceedings. Conference papers may be either long papers (up to 15 pages, including references) or short papers (up to 6-9 pages, including references).\n\n### Recently Published Papers Track\n\nIJCLR invites high-quality papers relevant to the scope of the conference, which have been recently published, or accepted for publication, by a first-class conference (e.g., IJCAI, AAAI, NeurIPS, ICML, KDD, ECML/PKDD, ICDM) or journals (e.g., AIJ, MLJ, DMKD, JMLR).\n\nPapers submitted to the “Recently Published Papers Track” will be accepted on the grounds of relevance and quality of the original publication venue. Accepted papers will be presented at IJCLR.\n\n## Journal Special Issue\n\nA post-conference special issue of the Machine Learning Journal is planned with papers selected by the PC from the \"Main Track\" and “Recently Published Papers Track (conference papers)\". The authors of invited papers should submit a significantly revised and/or extended version of their conference papers to meet the MLJ criteria, and re-reviewed by the PC.\n\n## Publication\n\nConference papers (either short or long) will be included in the conference proceedings, to be published by Springer Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) Series. Late Breaking abstracts will be published on the conference website. A link to recently published papers will be included in the conference website.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nThe deadline on each of the dates below is midnight AOE (Anywhere on Earth) time.\n\n*   **Conference paper submission:** May 31, 2025\n*   **IJCLR 2025 Conference paper notification:** July 30, 2025\n*   **Extended abstracts & already published papers submission:** August 5, 2025\n*   **Journal Special Issue:** By invitation from papers submitted to the conference. TBC\n*   **Registration opens:** TBC\n*   **IJCLR 2025 Conference:** September 11-14, 2025"
