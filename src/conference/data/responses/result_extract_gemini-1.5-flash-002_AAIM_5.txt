The authors will be notified of the decision on the abstract within 7 days of submission. For those needing more time to apply for a visa to enter Mongolia, please submit your abstracts earlier and contact the PC chairs immediately.\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nAAIM 2025 will only accept PDF format submissions via Springer Online Conference Service. The authors will register their account and submit their paper at [Springer OCS AAIM2025 Homepage](https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/aaim2025).\n\nOnly previously unpublished new results will be considered for publication. Papers that have already been published or simultaneously submitted at another journal or conference (with published proceedings) will not be considered.\n\nA submission should start with the title of the paper and a one-paragraph summary of the results. This should be followed by a scholarly exposition of the ideas, techniques, and a full description of the results achieved. A clear indication of the motivation and comparison with prior or related work should be presented. The paper should not exceed 12 pages, including bibliography, formatted for letter-size paper using 10-point font, with at least one-inch margins around. Authors are required to submit their papers in the Springer LNCS Format. For the complete author guideline, please access Springer's official [Springer Instructions for Authors of Proceedings CS](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19242230/data/v15).\n\nPlease make sure to hide all author-related information; a double-blind review process will be conducted.\n\nAdditional details can be included in a clearly marked appendix, to be consulted at the discretion of program committee members. The appendix is not included in the page limit and will not be published in the conference proceedings.\n\nSubmissions that deviate significantly from these guidelines or are unprintable risk rejection without consideration of their merit. At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference as a registered participant.\n\n## Publication and Special Issue\n\nThe conference proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. After the conference, selected papers will be invited to a special issue of journals: TBD. The invited papers will go through the normal reviewing process.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Submission Deadline:** May 20, 2025\n*   **Full Paper Submission Deadline:** July 15, 2025\n*   **Author Notification:** August 15, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready Version Due:** September 1, 2025\n*   **Conference Dates:** June 23-25, 2025"
