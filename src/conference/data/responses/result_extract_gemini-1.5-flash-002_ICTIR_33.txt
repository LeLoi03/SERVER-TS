  "Call for Papers": "# ICTIR 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 11th ACM SIGIR International Conference on Innovative Concepts and Theories in Information Retrieval (ICTIR 2025) will be held on **July 18, 2025, in Padua, Italy**.\n\nICTIR 2025 invites submissions with substantial and original research on innovative and foundational contributions to the field of Information Retrieval.  This includes original research on the theoretical aspects of Information Retrieval, topics from neighboring fields with a strong and clear connection to Information Retrieval, and novel approaches and methods for developing, improving, and evaluating models related to the field of Information Retrieval.\n\n## Special Theme: “LLMs + IR, what could possibly go wrong?”\n\nICTIR 2025 especially welcomes research papers related to the theme: “LLMs + IR, what could possibly go wrong?”  This theme focuses on the long-term relationship between LLMs and IR. We are seeking both innovative and foundational technical research papers and discussion papers that methodologically study this theme by providing impactful perspectives, opinions, or positions on the matter.\n\n## Submission Types\n\nNew to ICTIR, we welcome two types of submissions:\n\n*   **Regular**\n*   **SIGIR-Revise-and-Resubmit (SIGIR-RR)** submissions (for revised manuscripts of papers submitted to but not accepted by SIGIR 2025)\n\n## Double-blind Reviewing\n\nThe conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any obvious way.  However, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference.\n*   The page limit is 9 pages in ACM SIGIR style, excluding the references and the optional appendix.\n*   Submissions will be evaluated based on the merits of their contents, not on the number of pages.\n*   Submissions must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 9 pages in length (including figures, tables, proofs, acknowledgments, and any content except references and optional appendices), with unrestricted space for references, in the current ACM two-column conference format.\n*   Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via OpenReview: [https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/SIGIR/ICTIR/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/SIGIR/ICTIR/2025/Conference)\n\n## Presentation at the Conference\n\nAt least one author of an accepted paper must register and present the work at ICTIR 2025.  The works will be presented either as a long or short talk, with an optional poster presentation or invitation to the panel.\n\n## Key Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** Thursday, April 24, 2025 (or two weeks after the SIGIR 2025 full paper notification deadline, whichever is later)\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** Thursday, June 5, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready deadline:** Thursday, June 26, 2025\n*   **Conference date:** Friday, July 18, 2025\n\n**Time zone for all deadlines: Anywhere on Earth (AoE)**\n\n## Contact Information\n\nYou can contact the PC chairs via [pc-ictir2025@listes.isir.upmc.fr](mailto:pc-ictir2025@listes.isir.upmc.fr) or the SIGIR Slack channel (#ictir2025)."
