  "Call for Papers": "# SOUPS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Twenty-First Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS 2025) will take place **August 10–12, 2025**, co-located with the 34th USENIX Security Symposium in **Seattle, WA, USA**.\n\n## Overview\n\nSOUPS brings together an interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners in human computer interaction, security, and privacy. The program will feature:\n\n*   Technical papers, including replication papers and systematization of knowledge papers\n*   Workshops and tutorials\n*   A poster session\n*   Lightning talks\n\n## Technical Papers\n\nWe invite authors to submit previously unpublished papers describing research or experience in all areas of usable privacy and security. We welcome a variety of research methods, including both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Papers will be judged on their scientific quality, overall quality, and contribution to the field. Topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Innovative security or privacy functionality and design\n*   Field studies of security or privacy technology\n*   Usability evaluations of new or existing security or privacy features\n*   Security testing of new or existing usability features\n*   Longitudinal studies of deployed security or privacy features\n*   Studies of administrators or developers and support for security and privacy\n*   Organizational policy or procurement decisions and their impact on security and privacy\n*   Lessons learned from the deployment and use of usable privacy and security features\n*   Foundational principles of usable security or privacy\n*   Ethical, psychological, sociological, or anthropological aspects of usable security and privacy\n*   Usable security and privacy implications/solutions for specific domains (e.g., IoT, medical, vulnerable populations)\n*   Replicating or extending important previously published studies and experiments\n*   Systematization of knowledge papers that integrate and systematize existing knowledge to provide new insight into a previously studied area\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll dates are at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth) time. These are firm deadlines; no extensions will be granted.\n\n*   **Mandatory Paper Registration Deadline:** February 6, 2025\n*   **Paper Submission Deadline:** February 13, 2025\n*   **Early Rejection Notification:** March 20, 2025\n*   **Author Response Period:** April 17–24, 2025\n*   **Paper Notifications:** May 12, 2025\n*   **Final Papers Files Due:** June 9, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Papers must use the SOUPS formatting template (available for [MS Word](https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference-files/usenix2025_soups.doc) or [LaTeX](https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference-files/usenix2025_soups_latex-template.zip)) and be submitted as a PDF via the [web submission system](https://soups2025.usenix.hotcrp.com/).\n*   Submissions must be no more than 12 pages (excluding acknowledgments, bibliography, and appendices).\n*   Submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for references and for supplementary material in appendices. The paper should stand alone without the supplementary material.\n*   All submissions must clearly relate to the human aspects of security or privacy. Papers on security or privacy that do not address usability or human factors will not be considered. Likewise, papers on usability or human factors that do not address security or privacy will not be considered.\n*   Your paper and research approach—including research instruments—should be inclusive and respectful.\n*   We are soliciting Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers and Replication papers.\n*   Reviewing is anonymous. No names or affiliations should appear on the title page or in the body of the paper.\n*   Any overlap between your submitted paper and other work either under submission, previously published, or submitted elsewhere before the SOUPS notification deadline must be documented in an explanatory note sent to the chairs.\n*   Self-plagiarism is generally not acceptable.\n\n## Contact\n\nContact the program chairs prior to submission at [soups25chairs@usenix.org](mailto:soups25chairs@usenix.org) if you have any questions about these requirements."
