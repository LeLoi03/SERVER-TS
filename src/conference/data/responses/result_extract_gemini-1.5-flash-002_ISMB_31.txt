  "Call for Papers": "# ISMB/ECCB 2025: Call for Abstracts\n\nThe joint meeting of the 33rd Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference and the 24th European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB) will be held in **Liverpool, United Kingdom from July 20-24, 2025**.\n\nThe conference will be held **in-person at ACC Liverpool and virtually through ISCB's Nucleus platform**.\n\n## Abstracts â€“ Talks and Posters\n\nWe invite abstracts for research that is topical to bioinformatics and computational biology, which is in progress (unpublished) or previously published within the last 18 months for consideration for oral and/or poster presentation.\n\n*   Your abstract should be submitted to the Communities of Special Interest (COSI) or Open Session Track that most accurately reflects the area of the work.\n*   You can learn more about COSIs [here](https://www.iscb.org/ismbeccb2025/call-for-submissions/abstracts#cosi).\n*   Your abstract should convey a scientific result and should not be an advertisement for any commercial software package.\n*   The same talk is not permitted to be given more than once as an oral presentation at ISMB. Research may be presented as both a talk and a poster if and only if it is submitted as two individual submissions with two different presenters.\n*   ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue.\n*   ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models: [https://www.iscb.org/iscb-policy-statements/iscb-policy-for-acceptable-use-of-large-language-models](https://www.iscb.org/iscb-policy-statements/iscb-policy-for-acceptable-use-of-large-language-models)\n\n## Abstracts: Deadlines\n\nDifferent submission types have different deadlines and notification dates. Be sure to check the below table or the [key dates page](/ismbeccb2025/key-dates) to find the dates relevant to your submission.\n\n*   **Abstracts:**\n    *   Submission Deadline: February 28, 2025\n    *   Notification of Acceptance: April 11, 2025\n*   **Late-breaking Posters:**\n    *   Submission Deadline: May 15, 2025\n    *   Notification of Acceptance: June 1, 2025\n\n## Tracks: Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) and Open Sessions\n\n*   3DSIG\n*   Bio-Ontologies\n*   BioInfo-Core\n*   Bioinformatics in UK\n*   BioVis\n*   BOSC: Bioinformatics Open Source Conference\n*   CAMDA\n*   CompMS\n*   Computational and Systems Immunology\n*   Digital Agriculture\n*   Education\n*   Equity and Diversity in Computational Biology Research\n*   EvolCompGen: Evolution and Comparative Genomics\n*   Function\n*   General Computational Biology\n*   HitSeq\n*   iRNA\n*   MLCSB\n*   MICROBIOME\n*   NetBio\n*   RegSys\n*   SysMod\n*   Text Mining\n*   TransMed\n*   VarI\n\n## Abstracts: Submission Guidelines\n\nAll submissions MUST select a presenting author. The presenting author MUST be marked as a corresponding author. Presenters of accepted abstracts are required to make the presentation themselves, and must register and pay to attend the conference. Submitters may choose to have their submission reviewed for: talk or poster or poster only. If you select talk or poster and are unsuccessful for a talk your abstract will automatically be considered for a poster presentation.\n\n*   All abstracts must be submitted using the conference submission site by the abstract deadlines.\n*   Accepted abstracts (maximum 250 words) will be posted on the conference website.\n*   If you are submitting for a talk, a PDF (2 pages maximum) can be uploaded to provide additional details including figures and graphics that support the main points of the abstract. \n*   Your abstract must not contain your title/position or any personal information (e.g., affiliation). These details will be collected through the EasyChair submission system.\n\n## Abstracts: Review Criteria\n\nAll submissions will be evaluated by a program committee. Submitters may choose to have their submission reviewed for talk or poster or poster only. If you select talk or poster and are unsuccessful for a talk your abstract will automatically be considered for a poster.\n\nPosters advertising commercial software will be rejected from this poster session and/or removed from the conference without notice. There is a separate space for such posters in the exhibition area. If you have an industry poster, contact [events@iscb.org](mailto:events@iscb.org).\n\n## Poster Details for ISMB/ECCB 2025\n\n*   **Scientific Research Exchange - Posters Presentation Hours:** 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM & 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM July 21-24, 2025\n*   **Poster Display Size:** Recommended poster size is A0 size (84.1cm wide and 118.9cm tall).\n*   *No onsite poster printing is available*\n\n## Late-breaking Posters\n\nAfter the initial submission deadline, late-breaking posters can be submitted. The submission window is notably smaller, be sure not to miss deadlines posted in the deadlines section or [key dates page](/ismbeccb2025/key-dates), as extensions cannot be granted.\n\n## Submission Portal\n\n[Click Here to Submit](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ismbeccb2025)\n\n## Contact Information\n\nFor further information, please visit the [ISCB website](https://www.iscb.org/)."
