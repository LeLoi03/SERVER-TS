  "Call for Papers": "# CALCO 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 11th International Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science (CALCO 2025) will be held at the **University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, UK, from June 16-18, 2025**, co-located with MFPS XLI.  It is planned as a physical, in-person event.\n\n## Scope\n\nAlgebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer science. CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in both foundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science, traditional as well as emerging ones.\n\n## Submission Categories\n\nCALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four categories of submissions:\n\n*   **Regular papers:** that report results on theoretical foundations, novel methods and techniques for software development, experiences with technology transfer to industry.\n*   **(Co)Algebraic pearls:** that present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way.\n*   **Early ideas abstracts:** that lead to presentations of work in progress, proposals for original venues of research.\n*   **Tool presentation papers:** that report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nAll topics relating to algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications are of interest for CALCO, and among them:\n\n*   Models and logics\n*   Automata and languages\n*   Graph transformations and term rewriting\n*   Modal logics\n*   Proof systems\n*   Relational systems\n*   Behavioural metrics\n*   Algebraic and coalgebraic semantics\n*   Abstract data types\n*   Re-engineering techniques (program transformations)\n*   Semantics of conceptual modelling methods and techniques\n*   Semantics of programming languages\n*   Methodologies in software and systems engineering\n*   Development processes\n*   Method integration\n*   Usage guidelines\n*   Specialised models and calculi\n*   Hybrid, probabilistic, and timed systems\n*   Concurrent, distributed, mobile, cyber-physical, and context-aware computational paradigms\n*   Systems theory and computational models (chemical, biological, etc.)\n*   System specification and verification\n*   Formal testing and quality assurance\n*   Generative programming and model-driven development\n*   Integration of formal specification techniques\n*   Model-driven development\n*   Specification languages, methods, and environments\n*   Tools supporting algebraic and coalgebraic methods for:\n    *   Advances in automated verification\n    *   Model checking\n    *   Theorem proving\n    *   Testing\n*   String diagrams and network theory\n*   Theory of PROPs and operads\n*   Rewriting problems and higher-dimensional approaches\n*   Automated reasoning with string diagrams\n*   Applications of string diagrams\n*   Quantum computing\n*   Categorical semantics for quantum computing\n*   Quantum calculi and programming languages\n*   Foundational structures for quantum computing\n*   Applications of quantum algebra\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAll submissions will be handled via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco25](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=calco25)\n\nThe format for all submissions is specified by LIPIcs.  Proceedings will be published in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics series. A special issue of the open access journal Logical Methods in Computer Science, containing extended versions of selected papers, is planned.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll dates are Anywhere on Earth (AoE):\n\n*   **Abstract submission:** March 10, 2025 (extended; was March 3)\n*   **Full Paper submission:** March 13, 2025 (extended; was March 6)\n*   **Author notification:** April 28, 2025 (updated; was April 16)\n*   **Final version due:** May 30, 2025\n\n## Invited Speakers\n\n*   Ugo dal Lago (University of Bologna) (joint special session on Quantitative Semantics)\n*   Gordon Plotkin (University of Edinburgh) (joint keynote speaker)\n*   Elena di Lavore (University of Oxford)\n*   Alexander Kurz (Chapman University)\n\n## Chairs\n\n*   Corina Cirstea (University of Southampton)\n*   Alexander Knapp (University of Augsburg)\n\n## Programme Committee\n\n*   Andreas Abel (Chalmers University of Technology)\n*   Guillermo Badia (University of Queensland)\n*   Paolo Baldan (University of Padova)\n*   Rui Soares Barbosa (International Iberian Nanotechnology Laboratory)\n*   Henning Basold (Leiden University)\n*   Harsh Beohar (University of Sheffield)\n*   Filippo Bonchi (University of Pisa)\n*   Thierry Boy de La Tour (Laboratoire d'Informatique de Grenoble)\n*   Jim de Groot (Australian National University)\n*   Valeria de Paiva (Topos Institute)\n*   Jérémy Dubut (École Polytechnique)\n*   Fabio Gadducci (University of Pisa)\n*   Daniel Hausmann (University of Liverpool)\n*   Sophia Knight (Swenson College of Science and Engineering)\n*   Clemens Kupke (University of Strathclyde)\n*   Carlos Gustavo Lopez Pombo (University of Buenos Aires)\n*   Alexandre Madeira (University of Aveiro)\n*   Larry Moss (Indiana University)\n*   Koko Muroya (Kyoto University)\n*   Peter Ölveczky (University of Oslo)\n*   Jurriaan Rot (Radboud University)\n*   Todd Schmid (Bucknell University)\n*   Pawel Sobocinski (Taltech)\n*   Ana Sokolova (University of Salzburg)\n*   Henning Urbat (Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg)\n*   Tarmo Uustalu (Reykjavik University)\n*   Maaike Zwart (University of Copenhagen)\n\n## Publicity Chair\n\nThorsten Wißmann\n\n## Local Organiser\n\nClemens Kupke (University of Strathclyde)"
