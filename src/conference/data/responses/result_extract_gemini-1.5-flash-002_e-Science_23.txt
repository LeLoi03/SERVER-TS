  "Call for Papers": "# IEEE eScience 2025: Call for Papers and Posters\n\nThe 21st IEEE International Conference on e-Science (eScience’25) will be held in **Chicago, USA, from September 15-18, 2025**.\n\n## Conference Overview\n\neScience studies, enacts, and improves the ongoing process of innovation in computationally-intensive or data-intensive research methods; typically this is carried out collaboratively, often using distributed computing infrastructure. eScience encompasses all fields of research and addresses all stages of the research lifecycle, from formulation of the research questions, through large-scale simulations and data analytics, scientific discovery, up to long-term sharing, publication, reusing, and reapplying of the results, data, as well as the relevant tools, processes, and knowledge.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest related to eScience include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, generative AI, large language models applied/applicable in science\n*   Research computing cyberinfrastructure (e.g., cloud, cluster, HPC, supercomputer)\n*   Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) principles for scientific software, data, workflows, models\n*   Reproducible and replicable eScience\n*   Translational research in computer and computational sciences\n*   Continuum computing: convergence between cloud computing, edge computing, and/or the Internet of Things (IoT)\n*   Education and e-Science\n*   Collaborative, reproducible and replicable eScience\n*   Science gateways, data portals, and digital repositories\n*   Resource management and scheduling\n*   Programming paradigms and models\n*   Real-time (time-sensitive) computing (e.g., for scientific instruments)\n*   Automation and event-based computing\n*   Big data stacks and big data ecosystems\n*   File and storage systems, I/O, and data management\n*   Scientific applications, algorithms, tools, and technologies\n*   Scientific workflows and distributed computing paradigms (e.g., FaaS)\n*   Blockchain technologies in science\n*   Fault tolerance, resilience, and security\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nThe conference is now soliciting full papers (8 pages excluding references) that present previously unpublished research achievements or eScience experiences and solutions.  Submitted papers should use the IEEE 8.5×11 manuscript guidelines: double-column text using single-spaced 10-point font on 8.5×11-inch pages. All submissions will be single-blind peer-reviewed. Selected full papers will receive a slot for an oral presentation. Accepted posters will be presented during a poster reception. Accepted full papers will be published in the IEEE conference proceedings. Rejected full papers can be re-submitted for a poster or workshop presentation.\n\nSubmitted papers may also be posted on preprint servers (e.g., arXiv).\n\nAt least one author of each accepted paper must register as an author at the full registration rate. Each author registration can be applied to only one accepted submission.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of the paper. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the paper that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content. Authors are fully responsible for all content they submit.
