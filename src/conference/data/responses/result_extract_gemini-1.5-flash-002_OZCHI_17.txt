  "Call for Papers": "# OzCHI 2025: Call for Papers\n\nOzCHI 2025 is the 37th Australian Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The conference will be held from **November 29 to December 3, 2025**, at **The University of Sydney, Darlington NSW, Sydney, Australia.**\n\n## Theme\n\n**Generative Intelligences, Planetary Futures**\n\n## Call for Papers and Late-Breaking Work\n\nOzCHI 2025 invites original contributions on all topics related to human-computer interaction (HCI), interaction design, and interactive technologies. We welcome submissions from design, engineering, social science, creative industries, and other related disciplines.\n\nThis Call for Papers invites Long Papers as well as Late-Breaking Work submissions. The paper contributions should address current practices, discuss theoretical approaches, or present novel research through relevant case studies, design processes, and community and industry examples. Submissions to both categories will be double-anonymous, peer-reviewed, and published in the conference proceedings.\n\n### Long Papers\n\nLong Papers should present original research and mature work in HCI and interaction design. These papers may describe investigations of user needs or contexts of use, lab-based evaluations or field deployments of prototypes, or other design-led or empirical investigations examining the relationship between people and technology.\n\n*   Authors are encouraged to submit a paper of length proportional to its contribution. The average length of OzCHI papers is approximately 7,000â€“8,000 words, excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices.\n*   Submissions of 12,000 words or more will be considered excessively long and could be desk rejected.\n*   Accepted long papers will be presented in person at the conference and included in the ACM Digital Library's conference proceedings. At least one author must register with OzCHI and present the paper in person. Remote and pre-recorded presentations will not be offered as part of OzCHI 2025.\n\n### Late-Breaking Work\n\nLate-breaking work (LBW) submissions present emerging ideas that would benefit from discussion with members of the HCI community. These submissions may include initial findings from new research, experiences of reflective practitioners, and first drafts of novel concepts and approaches.\n\n*   Contributions should be up to 5,000 words in the single-column ACM format and anonymized for peer review.\n*   Accepted LBW will be presented as a poster during the conference and included in the conference proceedings at the ACM Digital Library. At least one author must register with OzCHI and present the poster in person.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nDates are given in Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone. The deadline for submission is 11:59 PM AoE on the specified date.\n\n*   **Long Paper Submission deadline:** June 2, 2025\n*   **Long Paper Notification of acceptance:** July 23, 2025\n*   **LBW Submission deadline:** August 4, 2025\n*   **LBW Notification of acceptance:** September 23, 2025\n\n## Preparing and Submitting Your Paper\n\n### Step 1: Download the ACM Master Template\n\n*   LaTeX users download the template [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-sig-proceedings-template/qrvprkdbxrnw) or use the [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-sig-proceedings-template/qrvprkdbxrnw).\n*   Word users download the template [here](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx).\n\nPlease ensure that you use the correct template. The single-column format must be used for the reviewing phase. Using different templates or formats may result in desk rejection.\n\n### Step 2: Write Your Paper\n\n*   Clearly explain the research question addressed, research methods and tasks, findings or results, and contributions of the work.\n*   Your paper should consist of original work not previously published or concurrently under consideration for any other conference, workshop, journal, or other publication with an ISBN, ISSN, or DOI number.\n*   Authors should ensure their work and writing are as inclusive as possible; where this is not possible, they should be acknowledged.\n*   Be anonymized for peer review.\n*   Authors should acknowledge the use of generative AI in the creation of their content, including specifying the AI tools used and the extent of their contribution to the research, writing, or design process.\n\n### Step 3: Complete Submission\n\nMake your submission via the Precision Conference system.\n\n## Selection Process\n\nAn international panel will double-anonymously review Long Papers and LBW. Based on the full text of the submission, the panel will evaluate them for significance, originality, and clarity of writing.\n\n## Awards\n\nAwards are presented to the highest quality papers and reviews:\n\n*   Gitte Lindgaard Award (Best Paper)\n*   Steve Howard Award (Best Student Paper)\n*   Best Reviewer Award (for the top 3 reviewers, based on quality and quantity of reviews)\n\n## Contact\n\n**Long Paper Chairs**\n\n*   Nadia Pantidi (Victoria University of Wellington)\n*   Thuong Hoang (Deakin University)\n*   Marius Hoggenmueller (The University of Sydney)\n*   [longpapers.chair@ozchi.org](mailto:longpapers.chair@ozchi.org)\n\n**Late-Breaking Work Chairs**\n\n*   Glenda Caldwell (Queensland University of Technology)\n*   Benjamin Tag (The University of New South Wales)\n*   Josh Andres (The Australian National University)\n*   [lbw.chair@ozchi.org](mailto:lbw.chair@ozchi.org)"
