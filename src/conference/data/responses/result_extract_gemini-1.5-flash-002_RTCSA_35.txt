  "Call for Papers": "# RTCSA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 31st IEEE International Conference on Embedded and Real-Time Computing Systems and Applications (RTCSA 2025) will be held in **Singapore from August 20-22, 2025**.\n\nRTCSA serves as a pivotal platform for experts from both academia and industry, fostering advancements in technology and theory for time-sensitive applications. The conference’s scope encompasses all applications where temporal aspects need to be considered. Cyber-physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), embedded systems, and fog/edge/cloud computing are just notable examples. RTCSA is especially open to new and emerging topics such as the application of machine learning in designing and analyzing embedded and real-time systems, strategies for achieving real-time machine learning, resource management in autonomous systems, and more.\n\n## Tracks\n\nRTCSA 2025 seeks papers that describe original research in the following areas:\n\n*   **REAL-TIME SYSTEMS TRACK**\n*   **IoT, CPS, AND EMERGING APPLICATIONS TRACK**\n*   **EMBEDDED SYSTEMS TRACK**\n*   **New at RTCSA'25: Industry Session**\n\n## Important Dates\n\n(All times are UTC-12, or \"anywhere on earth\", unless otherwise stated.)\n\n*   **Abstract Submission Deadline:** April 5, 2025\n*   **Full Paper Submission Deadline:** April 5, 2025\n*   **Acceptance Notification:** May 7, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready Submission Deadline:** June 5, 2025\n*   **Conference Date:** August 20-22, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nBoth research and industry papers are solicited. The submitted manuscript must describe original work not previously published and not concurrently submitted elsewhere. Abstract submission is a prerequisite for full paper submission.\n\n*   **Full Paper format:** technical content must fit within 10 pages; references and acknowledgements can be arranged in 2 additional pages.\n*   **Short Paper format:** technical content must fit within 6 pages; references and acknowledgements can be arranged in 2 additional pages.\n*   Both types of submission must be formatted according to the IEEE conference proceedings format (two-columns, single-space, 10pt).\n*   Submitted papers are subject to single-blind reviews.\n\nAccepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore, subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements.\n\nBy submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one author will register at full registration rate to the conference and present the paper in person.\n\n## Organizing Team\n\n*   **General chairs:**\n    *   Rui Tan | Nanyang Technological University, Singapore\n    *   Xue (Steve) Liu | McGill University, Canada\n*   **Program chairs:**\n    *   Mitra Nasri (Real-Time Systems Track) | Eindhoven University of Technology, The Netherlands\n    *   Abusayeed Saifullah (IoT, CPS, and emerging applications Track Track) | Wayne State University, US\n    *   Wei Zhang (Embedded Systems Track) | Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong SAR"
