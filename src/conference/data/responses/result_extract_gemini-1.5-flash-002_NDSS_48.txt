  "Call for Papers": "# USENIX Security '25: Call for Papers\n\nThe 34th USENIX Security Symposium will be held on **August 13–15, 2025, in Seattle, WA, USA**.\n\nThe USENIX Security Symposium brings together researchers, practitioners, system programmers, and others interested in the latest advances in the security and privacy of computer systems and networks.\n\n## Main Changes from Previous Editions\n\n*   Two submission cycles instead of three.\n*   New open science policy: Research results should be available to the public or explain why this is not possible. The artifact evaluation process is adjusted to accommodate this.\n*   New guidelines for ethics considerations.\n*   Extra page for mandatory discussion of ethics considerations and compliance with open science policy.\n*   Revisions are reviewed within the same submission cycle instead of the next.\n*   New approach to presenting accepted papers (see the [public RFC](https://github.com/USENIX-Security-2025/conference-format) about the plans for this new model).\n\n## Important Dates\n\nNew in 2025, there will be two submission cycles.\n\n### Cycle 1\n\n*   Paper submissions due: September 4, 2024\n*   Early reject notification: October 15, 2024\n*   Rebuttal period: November 18–25, 2024\n*   Notification to authors: December 11, 2024\n*   Shepherding/revision period: December 12, 2024–January 16, 2025\n*   Artifacts due for availability verification: January 16, 2025\n*   Shepherding/revision author notification: January 23, 2025\n*   Final papers due: January 30, 2025\n\n### Cycle 2\n\n*   Paper submissions due: January 22, 2025\n*   Early reject notification: March 4, 2025\n*   Rebuttal period: April 7–14, 2025\n*   Notification to authors: April 30, 2025\n*   Shepherding/revision period: May 1, 2025–May 29, 2025\n*   Artifacts due for availability verification: May 29, 2025\n*   Shepherding/revision author notification: June 5, 2025\n*   Final papers due: June 12, 2025\n\n## Symposium Topics\n\nRefereed paper submissions are solicited in all areas relating to systems research in security and privacy. This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; USENIX Security is interested in all aspects of computing systems security and privacy.\n\n## New Topics\n\n*   Meta-science in Security and Privacy\n*   Replication and Reproduction\n*   Systematization of Knowledge\n\n## Research Ethics\n\nAuthors of all submissions must consider and discuss the ethics of their work.\n\n## Open Science\n\nThis year, USENIX Security introduces a new open science policy, aiming to enhance the reproducibility and replicability of scientific findings: Authors are expected to openly share their research artifacts by default.\n\n## Artifact Evaluation\n\nArtifact evaluation will take place in two phases: Artifacts will be evaluated for availability after paper acceptance and before the final papers are due; artifacts will be evaluated for functionality and reproducibility after final papers are due.\n\n## Conference Attendance and Publishing Accepted Papers\n\nPapers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented during the Symposium and published in the Symposium Proceedings. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it.\n\n## Paper Submission Policies and Instructions\n\nSee the [USENIX Security '25 Submission Policies and Instructions](/conference/usenixsecurity25/submission-policies-and-instructions) page for details.\n\n## New Approach to Presentation of Papers\n\nMotivated by rising conference costs and increasing numbers of submitted and accepted papers, USENIX Security '25 will implement a new approach to presenting accepted papers and fostering interactions at the conference.\n\n## Symposium Organizers\n\n*   **Program Co-Chairs:**\n    *   Lujo Bauer, Carnegie Mellon University\n    *   Giancarlo Pellegrino, CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security\n*   **Program Vice Co-Chairs:**\n    *   Giulia Fanti, Carnegie Mellon University\n    *   Marco Guarnieri, IMDEA Software Institute\n    *   Olya Ohrimenko, The University of Melbourne\n    *   Cristina Onete, Université de Limoges, XLIM, and CNRS 7252\n    *   Brad Reaves, North Carolina State University\n    *   Nuno Santos, INESC-ID and Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon\n    *   Ben Stock, CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security\n    *   Yuan Tian, University of California, Los Angeles\n    *   Daniel Votipka, Tufts University\n*   **Ethics Committee Chair:** Tadayoshi Kohno, University of Washington\n*   **Artifact Evaluation Committee Co-Chairs:**\n    *   Aurore Fass, CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security\n    *   Phani Vadrevu, Louisiana State University\n*   **Artifact Evaluation Publication Chair:** Tiago Heinrich, Max Planck Institute for Informatics"
