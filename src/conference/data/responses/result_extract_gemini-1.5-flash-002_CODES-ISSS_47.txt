CODES+ISSS 2025 will be held in Taipei, Taiwan from September 28 to October 3, 2025 as part of Embedded Systems Week (ESWEEK).",
  "Call for Papers": "# CODES+ISSS 2025: Call for Full-Length Papers\n\nThe International Conference on Hardware/Software Codesign and System Synthesis (CODES+ISSS) is the premier conference in system-level design, hardware/software co-design, modeling, analysis, and implementation of modern embedded systems, cyber-physical systems, and internet-of-things, from system-level specification and optimization to synthesis of system-on-chip hardware/software implementations. CODES+ISSS is part of Embedded Systems Week (ESWEEK), the premier event covering all aspects of hardware and software design for smart, intelligent, and connected computing systems.\n\n## Journal-Integrated Publication Model\n\nAccepted full papers will be published in the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems. Accepted LBR papers will be published in IEEE Embedded Systems Letters. Journal-track papers must be up to 20 pages in ACM one-column format, including references. LBR must be up to 4 pages in IEEE format.\n\n## In-Person Presentation Requirement\n\nAn accepted paper will be removed from the journal (TECS or ESL) and the technical program unless both of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) One author of the accepted paper must register at the full conference (author registration) rate, and (2) An author of the accepted paper must present (in-person) the paper in the conference.
