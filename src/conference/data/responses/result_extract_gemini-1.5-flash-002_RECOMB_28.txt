  "Call for Papers": "# RECOMB 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 29th Annual International Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology (RECOMB 2025) will be held at **Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea from April 26-29, 2025**.\n\nRECOMB 2025 aims at bridging the computational, mathematical, statistical, and biological sciences, and bringing together researchers, professionals, students, and industrial practitioners from all over the world for interaction and exchange of new developments in all areas of bioinformatics and computational biology.\n\n## Topics\n\nPapers reporting on original research (both theoretical and applied) in all areas of computational molecular biology are suitable for submission. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Molecular sequence analysis\n*   Sequencing and genotyping technologies\n*   Gene regulation and epigenomics\n*   Transcriptomics\n*   Single-cell omics\n*   Metagenomics and microbiome analysis\n*   Population genetics and statistical genomics\n*   Evolution and comparative genomics\n*   Structure and function of non-coding RNAs\n*   Computational proteomics and proteogenomics\n*   Computational structural biology\n*   Computational metabolomics\n*   Protein structure and function\n*   Biological networks and network biology\n*   Computational systems biology\n*   Multimodal data integration in biological research\n*   Computational approaches to understanding human disease\n*   Data privacy and security in biomedical research\n*   Bioimaging and molecular and cellular imaging analysis\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions should represent original, previously unpublished work. The Program Committee will rigorously review submitted papers. Selected papers will be accepted for presentation at the conference. Accepted abstracts will be published as a proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNBI) series from Springer-Verlag.\n\n*   Authors who prefer not to publish their papers in the LNBI proceedings must submit a four-page extended abstract and submit the full paper to preprint servers (arXiv.org or bioRxiv.org) by the camera-ready version deadline.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract/paper registration deadline:** October 16, 2024, 11:59 PM AoE\n*   **Full paper submission deadline:** October 25, 2024, 11:59 PM AoE (updates to registered abstracts only)\n*   **Author notification:** December 16, 2024\n*   **Final proceedings version of accepted papers due:** February 15, 2025\n\n## Submission Process\n\nPlease submit your papers through EasyChair at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=recomb2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=recomb2025).\n\n## Formatting Instructions\n\n*   **Main paper format:** All paper submissions must be in PDF format. The maximum length is 10 Letter pages, including all figures/tables and their captions, using a minimum font size of 10pt and 1-inch margins. An additional title page containing the paper title, author list, and abstract is permitted. The bibliography does not count toward the page limit.\n*   **Optional Appendix:** If necessary, an Appendix can be submitted as Supplementary Material in a single PDF file. There is no page limit for the Appendix, but please note that reviewing the Appendix is at the discretion of the reviewers.\n*   **Source code availability:** If the paper involves the development of new software or analysis methods, the source code should be made publicly accessible via a GitHub repository. The link to this repository must be clearly indicated in the paper.\n\n## Journal Publication\n\nRECOMB is partnering with *Cell Systems*, *Genome Research*, and the *Journal of Computational Biology*. Authors of selected accepted papers will be invited to submit a revised version of their paper for a special issue in one of the partnering journals. These journals will require some expansion of the RECOMB accepted papers. Preprint server submissions are allowed without restrictions. Submissions to peer-reviewed journals other than the partnering ones are also allowed; however, authors should note that 'double-dipping' is not permitted.\n\n## Contact\n\nPlease email Sriram Sankararaman, Program Committee Chair of RECOMB 2025, at [sriram@cs.ucla.edu](mailto:sriram@cs.ucla.edu) about any questions related to the submissions."
