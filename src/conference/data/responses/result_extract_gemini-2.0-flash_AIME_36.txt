  "Call for Papers": "# AIME 2025: Call for Submissions\n\nThe 23rd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME 2025) will be hosted by the **University of Pavia, Italy on June 23-26, 2025**.\n\nThis special edition will celebrate 40 years from the first AIME conference, held in Pavia in 1985.\n\nAIME 2025 will offer the unique opportunity for researchers and other healthcare and AI experts to present significant theoretical, methodological, and applied results related to the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine.\n\n## Scope\n\nContributions to theory and methods should present or analyze novel AI theories or methodologies for solving problems in the biomedical field. They may propose new theories and methods or extensions of existing ones. In either case, the work should demonstrate its utility for solving biomedical problems and highlight its contribution to the underlying theoretical foundations. In addition, it should discuss assumptions, limitations, and novelty with respect to the state of the art.\n\nContributions addressing systems and applications should describe the development, implementation or evaluation of innovative, AI-based tools and systems in the biomedical application domain. These papers should both link the work to the underlying theory and either analyze the potential benefits for solving biomedical problems or provide empirical evidence of benefits in clinical practice.\n\nThe scope of the conference includes, but is not limited to, the following areas:\n\n*   Machine learning and big data analytics\n*   Natural language processing\n*   Document classification and information retrieval\n*   Large language models and their biomedical applications\n*   AI for biomedical imaging\n*   AI for signal processing and time series analysis\n*   Foundational models and zero/few shots learning\n*   Multimodal learning and information fusion\n*   Data and knowledge integration, graph neural networks\n*   Visual analytics in biomedicine\n*   Bayesian networks, fuzzy logic and reasoning under uncertainty\n*   Temporal and spatial representation and reasoning\n*   Biomedical ontologies and terminologies\n*   Knowledge-based reasoning in biomedicine\n*   Clinical decision support systems\n*   Healthcare processes and workflow management\n*   Computerized clinical practice guidelines and protocols\n*   Patient engagement support (personal healthcare record)\n*   Explainable AI\n*   Precision medicine\n*   AI solutions for ambient assisted living, telemedicine, and e-health\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   Submission opening: October 1, 2024\n*   Abstract submission deadline: January 27, 2025\n*   Paper submission deadline: February 3, 2025\n*   Notification of acceptance: April 8, 2025\n*   Camera-ready submission deadline: April 20, 2025\n*   Main conference: June 23-26, 2025\n\n## Submission\n\nPapers should be submitted to the [AIME 2025 Easy Chair Website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aime2025).\n\nAuthors are asked first to submit an abstract (maximum 250 words), the full paper may be uploaded up to one week later (please see Important Dates above).\n\nThe conference features regular papers in three categories (please note if you are a student submitting a paper):\n\n*   Full-length research papers (up to 10 pages, including references)\n*   Short papers (max 5 pages, including references), describing a short research project with preliminary results or late-breaking results (work-in-progress)\n*   Demo papers (max 5 pages, including references), describing a demonstration of implemented systems\n\nAll accepted papers (full, short & demo) will be published in the conference proceedings, which will be published as part of Springer’s Lecture Notes in AI series.\n\nPapers should be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS format and one of the categories (Full paper, Short paper, Demo paper) must be selected at the time of submission. Authors should follow [Springer’s guidelines for authors](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, to prepare their papers. Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are also available in Overleaf. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their submissions.\n\n## Publication\n\nThe proceedings will be published by Springer as part of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI), a subseries of LNCS dedicated to artificial intelligence research.\n\n## Awards\n\nThe Mario Stefanelli award is given to the best student paper, according to the conference steering committee, based on the quality of both the paper and oral presentation at the conference.\n\nThe Marco Ramoni award is given to the best regular paper, according to the conference steering committee, based on the scientific quality of the paper.\n\nAIME Rising Star award is aimed at younger colleagues running their labs with recent breakthrough papers in the area. If you would like to nominate someone for this award, please email your proposal to [annette.ten.teije@vu.nl](mailto:annette.ten.teije@vu.nl) and [robertmo@bgu.ac.il](mailto:robertmo@bgu.ac.il) by March 1st.\n\n## Student Travel Grants\n\nWe will offer six travel grants to students who are authors of accepted papers (full or short) and who will present their work during the AIME 2025 conference. Each grant will cover travel costs up to EUR 500.00 (if these costs are less than EUR 500.00, the actual amount will be covered).\n\nApplicants should send the title of their accepted paper, formal proof of student status, and an electronic copy or scan of their tickets by email to all three addresses [lucia.sacchi@unipv.it](mailto:lucia.sacchi@unipv.it), [riccardo.bellazzi@unipv.it](mailto:riccardo.bellazzi@unipv.it) and [blaz.zupan@fri.uni-lj.si](mailto:blaz.zupan@fri.uni-lj.si), with a CC copy to [silvia.ferrari@pragmacongressi.it](mailto:silvia.ferrari@pragmacongressi.it), with the subject line “AIME 2025 Student travel grants”.\n\n## Co-Chairs of AIME 2025\n\n*   Blaž Zupan, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia (Program Committee Chair)\n*   Riccardo Bellazzi, University of Pavia, Italy (Local Organization Chair)\n*   Lucia Sacchi, University of Pavia, Italy (Local Organization Chair)\n*   José M. Juarez, Universidad de Murcia, Spain (Doctoral Consortium Chair)"
