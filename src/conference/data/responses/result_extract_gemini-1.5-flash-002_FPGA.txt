  "Call for Papers": "# ISFPGA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 33rd ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (ISFPGA 2025) will be held in **Monterey, California, USA, from February 27 to March 1, 2025** at the **Monterey Marriott**.\n\n## Paper Submissions\n\nWe solicit research papers related to the following areas:\n\n*   **FPGA Architecture:** Architectures for programmable logic fabrics or their components, including routing, flexible logic cells, embedded blocks (memory, DSP, processors), and I/O interfaces. Novel commercial architectures and architectural features.\n*   **FPGA Circuit Design:** Circuits and layout techniques for the design of FPGAs. Impact of future process and design technologies on FPGAs as well as novel memory or nano-scale devices. Methods for analyzing and improving static and dynamic power consumption, power and clock distribution, yield, manufacturability, security, reliability, and testability.\n*   **CAD for FPGAs:** Algorithms for synthesis, technology mapping, logic and timing optimization, clustering, placement, and routing of FPGAs. Novel design software for system-level partitioning, debug, and verification. Algorithms for modeling, analysis, and optimization of timing and power.\n*   **High-Level Abstractions and Tools for FPGAs:** General-purpose and domain-specific languages, tools, and techniques to facilitate the design, debugging, and verification of FPGA-based applications and systems. Novel hardware/software co-design and high-level synthesis methodologies enabling digital signal processing, compute acceleration, networking, machine learning, and embedded systems.\n*   **FPGA-based and FPGA-like Computing Engines:** Systems and software for compiled accelerators, reconfigurable/adaptive computing, and rapid-prototyping. Programmable overlay architectures implemented using FPGAs.\n*   **Applications and Design Studies:** Implementation of novel designs on FPGAs establishing state-of-the-art in high-performance, low-power, security, or high-reliability. Designs leveraging unique capabilities of FPGA architectures or demonstrating significant improvements over alternative programmable technologies (e.g., CPU, GPU). Design studies or architecture explorations enabling improvement of FPGA architectures.\n*   **AI/ML for and on FPGAs:** Architectures and implementations of FPGA-based processors for AI/ML algorithms, such as Small Language Models and Large Language Models. Novel uses of AI models to aid in the design and programming of FPGAs.\n\n## Submission Categories\n\nResearch submissions can be in either of two categories:\n\n*   **Regular:** At most 10 pages (excluding references), for a regular presentation at the conference.\n*   **Short:** At most 6 pages (excluding references), for a brief presentation.\n\nA paper submitted as either regular or short will only be considered in that category and may include artifacts if desired (see below for more details on artifact submission and evaluation).\n\n## Submission Process\n\nSubmissions of all types should be made in the form of an English language PDF file. Papers should use the sigconf ACM format template posted at [http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template/](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template/).\n\n*   **Abstracts Due:** October 1, 2024\n*   **Submissions Due:** October 8, 2024 (No Extensions)\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://fpga25.hotcrp.com/](https://fpga25.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll submission deadlines are with respect to 11:59 pm Anywhere on Earth (UTC -12)\n\n*   **Abstracts Due (All Papers):** October 1, 2024 (No Extensions)\n*   **Submissions Due (All Papers):** October 8, 2024 (No Extensions)\n*   **Rebuttal Period (All Papers):** November 11â€“18, 2024\n*   **Notification of Acceptance (All Papers):** November 30, 2024\n*   **Camera-Ready Submission Due:** December 31, 2024\n*   **Conference:** February 27 - March 1, 2025"
