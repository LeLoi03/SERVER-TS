  "Summary": "The Empirical Software Engineering International Week 2025 (ESEIW 2025) and the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025) will be held jointly in Honolulu, Hawai, USA, from September 29 to October 3, 2025. ESEM is the premier conference for presenting research results related to empirical software engineering.",
  "Call for Papers": "# ESEM 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025) will be held from **September 29 to October 3, 2025 in Honolulu, Hawai, USA** as part of the Empirical Software Engineering International Week 2025 (ESEIW 2025).\n\n## ESEM - Technical Track\n\nThe ESEM technical papers track features submissions that describe original, unpublished work in software engineering and software measurement, with a strong empirical foundation. Papers in this track should communicate fully developed research and related results. Strong emphasis should be given to the methodological aspects of the research and the assessment of the validity of the contributions.\n\n### General Scope of Submissions\n\nSubmissions should not be under consideration for publication or presentation elsewhere. In addition to the specific scope of this track, submissions may address any aspect of software engineering but must tackle the problem from an empirical perspective and using a rigorous empirical method, including:\n\n*   Empirical studies using qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods\n*   Cross- and multi-disciplinary methods and studies\n*   Formal experiments and quasi-experiments\n*   Case studies, action research, ethnography and field studies\n*   Survey research\n*   Simulation studies\n*   Artifact studies\n*   Data mining using statistical and machine learning approaches\n*   Secondary and tertiary studies including:\n    *   Systematic literature reviews and rapid reviews, that include a strong synthesis part\n    *   Meta-analyses, and qualitative, quantitative or structured syntheses of studies\n    *   Replication of empirical studies and families of studies\n\n### Topics\n\n*   Evaluation and comparison of software models, tools, techniques, and practices\n*   Modeling, measuring, and assessing product or process quality and productivity\n*   Continuous software engineering\n*   Software verification and validation, including analysis and testing\n*   Engineering of software systems which include machine learning components and data dependencies\n*   Applications of software engineering to different types of systems and domains (e.g. IoT, Industry 4.0, Context-awareness systems, Cyber-physical systems)\n*   Human factors, teamwork, and behavioral aspects of software engineering\n\n### Important Dates\n\nAll dates are end of the day, anywhere on earth (AoE)\n\n*   Abstract (mandatory): April 18th, 2025\n*   Submission: April 25th, 2025\n*   Notification: June 6th, 2025\n*   Camera-ready: June 27th, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions to this track are limited to 10 pages excluding references and 12 pages with references and must be submitted through EasyChair by selecting the track “Technical Papers.”\n\nAll submissions must be written in English and must be submitted via EasyChair in PDF format, and they must be formatted according to the standard IEEE template in conference mode ([https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)) or in Overleaf ([https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/ieee-official](https://www.overleaf.com/gallery/tagged/ieee-official)).\n\n## Open Science Policy\n\nOpenness in science is key to fostering progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. We expect authors to include a data availability statement in their submissions that either provides links to the open data/replication package or that explains why data cannot be disclosed.\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esem25](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esem25)"
