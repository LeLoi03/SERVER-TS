  "Call for Papers": "# IJCCI 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe IJCCI 2025 conference brings together researchers, engineers, and practitioners in the areas of Fuzzy Computation, Evolutionary Computation, and Neural Computation, complemented by the transversal area of Explainable AI.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe purpose of IJCCI is to bring together researchers, engineers, and practitioners in the areas of Fuzzy Computation, Evolutionary Computation, and Neural Computation, complemented by the transversal area of Explainable AI. IJCCI is composed of four co-located conferences, each specialized in at least one of the aforementioned main knowledge areas.\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nAuthors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics. Each paper should clearly indicate the nature of its technical/scientific contribution, and the problems, domains, or environments to which it is applicable. To facilitate the double-blind paper evaluation method, authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors, including the authors’ personal details, the acknowledgments section of the paper, and any other reference that may disclose the authors’ identity.\n\nOnly original papers should be submitted.  Authors are advised to read INSTICC's ethical norms regarding plagiarism and self-plagiarism thoroughly before submitting and must make sure that their submissions do not substantially overlap work which has been published elsewhere or simultaneously submitted to a journal or another conference with proceedings. Papers that contain any form of plagiarism will be rejected without reviews.\n\nAuthors can submit their work in the form of a Regular Paper, representing completed and validated research, or as a Position Paper, portraying a short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue discussing ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures, or results of scientific research focused on one of the conference topic areas. All papers must be submitted through the online submission platform PRIMORIS and should follow the instructions and templates that can be found under Guidelines and Templates. After the paper submission has been successfully completed, authors will receive an automatic confirmation e-mail.\n\n## Publications\n\nAll accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and on digital support. SCITEPRESS is a member of CrossRef ([http://www.crossref.org/](http://www.crossref.org/)) and every paper on our digital library is given a DOI (Digital Object Identifier). The proceedings will be submitted for indexation by Google Scholar, DBLP, EI, IET, Semantic Scholar, JST, Norwegian Register for Scientific Journals and Series, Web of Science / Conference Proceedings Citation Index, Mathematical Reviews, SCImago, SCOPUS, and zbMATH.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll dates refer to AOE time, i.e., \"Anywhere on Earth\"\n\n**Joint Conference:**\n\n*   **Regular Papers Paper Submission:** May 19, 2025\n*   **Authors Notification:** July 17, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready and Registration:** July 31, 2025\n\n**Position Papers / Regular Papers:**\n\n*   **Paper Submission:** June 26, 2025\n*   **Authors Notification:** July 31, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready and Registration:** September 5, 2025\n\n**Workshops:**\n\n*   **Workshop Proposal:** May 27, 2025\n\n**Special Sessions:**\n\n*   **Special Session Proposal:** May 27, 2025\n\n**Tutorials:**\n\n*   **Tutorial Proposal:** September 11, 2025\n\n**Demos:**\n\n*   **Demo Proposal:** September 11, 2025\n\n**Panels:**\n\n*   **Panel Proposal:** September 11, 2025\n\n**Abstracts Track:**\n\n*   **Abstract Submission:** July 31, 2025\n*   **Authors Notification:** September 8, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready and Registration:** September 17, 2025\n\n## Conference Chair\n\nJoaquim Filipe, Polytechnic Institute of Setúbal / INSTICC, Portugal\n\n## Keynote Speaker\n\nLuís Paulo Reis, University of Porto, Portugal"
