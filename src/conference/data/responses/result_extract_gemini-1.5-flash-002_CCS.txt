  "Call for Papers": "# ACM CCS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2025) will be held in **Taipei, Taiwan, from October 13-17, 2025**.\n\nCCS seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice.\n\n## Review Cycles\n\nCCS has two review cycles in 2025. For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:\n\n*   **Accept:** Papers will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference, possibly after making minor changes with the oversight of a shepherd.\n*   **Minor revision:** Papers are considered promising but need some minor additional work. Authors will be given the opportunity to resubmit such papers, with appropriate revisions.\n*   **Reject:** Papers are declined for inclusion in the conference. Papers rejected from the first review cycle may not be submitted again to the second review cycle.\n\nAuthors of each accepted paper must ensure that at least one author registers for the conference and that their paper is presented in-person at the conference if at all possible.\n\n## Paper Submission Information\n\n*   All submissions must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the corresponding deadline.\n*   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings.\n*   All submissions should be properly anonymized.\n*   Authors may submit up to a maximum of 7 papers for Cycle B.\n*   For papers that might raise ethical concerns, authors are expected to convince reviewers that proper procedures have been followed, and due diligence has been made to minimize potential harm.\n*   Submitted papers may be rejected for being out of scope, at the discretion of the PC chairs.\n*   No modifications to the author list on a paper may be made after submission.\n\n## Mandatory Reviewing\n\nAuthors submitting 3 papers or more may be required to submit reviews for other papers at CCS 2025. Authors who fall into this category will be requested to provide information for review matching and complete an attestation for reviewing ethics. Authors failing to provide the requested information may see their paper desk-rejected.\n\n## Withdrawing Policy\n\nA paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors, the paper cannot be withdrawn.\n\n## Paper Format\n\nSubmissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format using \"sigconf\" 2-column format, no more than 12 pages long, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.\n\n## Providing Artifacts at Submission Time\n\nSubmissions whose claimed contributions rely on artifacts (e.g., code, models, data sets) are expected to make these accessible to the reviewers, unless there are good reasons not to, in which case these reasons must be mentioned in the submission.\n\n## Optional Artifact Evaluation\n\nACM CCS will introduce an optional artifact evaluation (AE) process. All authors of accepted papers are encouraged to submit artifacts for AE. Each artifact submitted will be reviewed by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC); a special call for artifacts will follow.\n\n## Conference Tracks\n\nACM CCS Conference features a multi-track format. At the time of submission, authors must select one track, which should be the most relevant to the topic of the paper.  The chairs may decide to move a paper to another track.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe conference requires cooperation from both authors and program-committee members to ensure a fair review process. For this purpose, authors must report all program-committee members who, in their opinion, have a conflict of interest.\n\n## Policy for Peer-Review Integrity\n\nAll SIGSAC-sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. All authors, PC members, and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n### First Review Cycle\n\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** January 2, 2025\n*   **Full paper submission deadline:** January 9, 2025\n*   **Notification of early-rejection papers:** February 10, 2025\n*   **Author rebuttal period:** March 3-6, 2025\n*   **Rebuttal deadline:** March 6, 2025\n*   **Author notification:** March 28, 2025\n\n### Second Review Cycle\n\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** April 7, 2025\n*   **Full paper submission deadline:** April 14, 2025\n*   **Notification of early-rejection papers:** May 16, 2025\n*   **Author rebuttal period:** June 5-10, 2025\n*   **Rebuttal deadline:** June 10, 2025\n*   **Author notification:** July 1, 2025\n\n## Submission Sites\n\n*   Cycle A: [https://ccs2025a.hotcrp.com/](https://ccs2025a.hotcrp.com/)\n*   Cycle B: [https://ccs2025b.hotcrp.com/](https://ccs2025b.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nACM CCS is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our community. If you have suggestions, concerns, or complaints related to biases or sexual harassment, we encourage you to reach out to the Program Chairs."
