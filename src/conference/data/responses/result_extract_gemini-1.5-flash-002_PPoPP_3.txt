  "Call for Papers": "# PPoPP 2025: Call for Papers\n\nPPoPP 2025, the 30th ACM SIGPLAN Annual Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming, will be held in **Las Vegas, Nevada, USA (collocated with CC 2025, CGO 2025, and HPCA 2025), from March 1-5, 2025**.\n\n## Scope\n\nPPoPP is the premier forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including theoretical foundations, techniques, languages, compilers, runtime systems, tools, and practical experience. In the context of the symposium, “parallel programming” encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multi-threaded, heterogeneous, clustered, and distributed systems; grids; datacenters; clouds; and large-scale machines).\n\nGiven the rise of parallel architectures in the consumer market (desktops, laptops, and mobile devices) and data centers, PPoPP is particularly interested in work that addresses new parallel workloads and issues that arise out of extreme-scale applications or cloud platforms, as well as techniques and tools that improve the productivity of parallel programming or work towards improved synergy with such emerging architectures.\n\n## Specific Topics of Interest\n\nSpecific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):\n\n*   Languages, compilers, and runtime systems for parallel programs\n*   Concurrent data structures\n*   Development, analysis, or management tools\n*   Fault tolerance for parallel systems\n*   Formal analysis and verification\n*   High-performance libraries\n*   Middleware for parallel systems\n*   Machine learning for parallel systems\n*   Parallel algorithms\n*   Parallel applications\n*   Parallel frameworks\n*   Parallel programming for deep memory hierarchies\n*   Parallel programming theory and models\n*   Performance analysis, debugging, and optimization\n*   Productivity tools for parallel systems\n*   Software engineering for parallel programs\n*   Synchronization and concurrency control\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Papers should report on original research relevant to parallel programming and should contain enough background materials to make them accessible to the entire parallel programming research community.\n*   PPoPP submissions will be evaluated based on their technical merit and accessibility.\n*   Submissions should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, compare to the existing body of work on the topic, and explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions and results towards addressing the problem.\n*   Submissions should strive to be accessible both to a broad audience and to experts in the area.\n\n### Paper Submission\n\n*   Conference submission site: [https://ppopp25.hotcrp.com](https://ppopp25.hotcrp.com)\n*   All submissions must be made electronically through the conference website and include an abstract (100–400 words), author contact information, the full list of authors and their affiliations.\n*   Full paper submissions must be in PDF format printable on both A4 and US letter-size paper.\n*   All papers must be prepared in ACM Conference Format using the 2-column acmart format: use the SIGPLAN proceedings template acmart-sigplanproc-template.tex for Latex, and interim-layout.docx for Word.\n*   Papers should contain a maximum of 10 pages of text (in a typeface no smaller than 10pt) or figures, NOT INCLUDING references. There is no page limit for references.\n*   Appendices are not allowed, but authors may submit supplementary material, such as proofs or source code (PDF or ZIP format).\n*   Submission is double-blind.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nDeadlines expire at midnight anywhere on earth (AoE):\n\n*   **Full paper submission:** August 16, 2024\n*   **Author response period:** October 23 – 25, 2024\n*   **Author notification:** November 11, 2024\n*   **Artifact submission to AE committee:** November 18, 2024\n*   **Artifact notification by AE committee:** January 6, 2025\n*   **Final paper due:** January 10, 2025"
