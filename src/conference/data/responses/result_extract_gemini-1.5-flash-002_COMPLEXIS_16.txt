  "Call for Papers": "# COMPLEXIS 2024: Call for Papers\n\nCOMPLEXIS – The International Conference on Complexity, Future Information Systems and Risk – aims at becoming a yearly meeting place for presenting and discussing innovative views on all aspects of Complex Information Systems.\n\n## Scope\n\nCOMPLEXIS seeks papers reporting research work, applications, or case studies on topics indicated below in the section “Conference Areas”. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools, and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Both technological and social-oriented papers are accepted. All papers must describe original work, not previously published or submitted to another conference. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of COMPLEXIS under an ISBN, and will be indexed by major indexes. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance, and originality. Both full research reports (regular papers) and work-in-progress reports (position papers) are welcome. There will be both oral and poster sessions.\n\n## Conference Areas\n\nEach of these topic areas is expanded below, but the sub-topics list is not exhaustive. Papers may address one or more of the listed sub-topics, although authors should not feel limited by them. Unlisted but related sub-topics are also acceptable, provided they fit in one of the following main topic areas:\n\n1.  COMPLEXITY IN INFORMATICS AND NETWORKING\n2.  COMPLEXITY IN BIOLOGY AND BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING\n3.  COMPLEXITY IN SOCIAL SCIENCES\n4.  COMPLEXITY IN RISK AND PREDICTIVE MODELING\n5.
