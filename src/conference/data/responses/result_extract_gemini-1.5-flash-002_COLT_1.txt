  "Call for Papers": "# COLT 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 38th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2025) will take place **June 30th-July 4th, 2025 in Lyon, France.**\n\nWe invite submissions of papers addressing theoretical aspects of machine learning, broadly defined as a subject at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and applied mathematics. We strongly support an inclusive view of learning theory, including fundamental theoretical aspects of learnability in various contexts, and theory that sheds light on empirical phenomena.\n\n## Topics\n\nThe topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Design and analysis of learning algorithms\n*   Statistical and computational complexity of learning\n*   Optimization methods for learning, including online and stochastic optimization\n*   Theory of artificial neural networks, including deep learning\n*   Theoretical explanation of empirical phenomena in learning\n*   Supervised learning\n*   Unsupervised, semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation\n*   Learning geometric and topological structures in data, manifold learning\n*   Active and interactive learning\n*   Reinforcement learning\n*   Online learning and decision-making\n*   Interactions of learning theory with other mathematical fields\n*   High-dimensional and non-parametric statistics\n*   Kernel methods\n*   Causality\n*   Theoretical analysis of probabilistic graphical models\n*   Bayesian methods in learning\n*   Game theory and learning\n*   Learning with system constraints (e.g., privacy, fairness, memory communication)\n*   Learning from complex data (e.g., networks, time series)\n*   Learning in neuroscience, social science, economics, and other subjects\n\nSubmissions by authors who are new to COLT are encouraged. While the primary focus of the conference is theoretical, authors are welcome to support their analysis with relevant experimental results.\n\n## Paper Awards\n\nCOLT will award both best paper and best student paper awards. To be eligible for the best student paper award, the primary contributor(s) must be full-time students at the time of submission.\n\n## Dual Submissions Policy\n\nConferences: In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings may not be submitted to COLT.\n\nJournals: In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to journals may not be submitted to COLT.\n\n## Rebuttal Phase\n\nAs in previous years, there will be a rebuttal phase during the review process. Initial reviews will be sent to authors before final decisions have been made. Authors will have an opportunity to address the issues brought up in the reviews.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n(All dates are in 2025.)\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** February 6, 5:00 PM EST\n*   **Author notification:** On or before May 2\n*   **Conference dates:** June 30â€“July 4\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n### Formatting and Anonymization\n\n*   Formatting: This year, submissions are limited to 12 PMLR formatted pages, excluding references. An additional supplementary file may be uploaded that can include unlimited appendices.\n*   Anonymization: Submissions should be suitable for double-blind reviewing; in particular, submissions should NOT include author names or other identifying information.\n\n### Submitting Your Paper\n\nPapers should be submitted through CMT: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/COLT2025/](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/COLT2025/)\n\n**Deadline for submissions:** February 6, 2025, 5 pm EST"
