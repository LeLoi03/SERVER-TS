  "Call for Papers": "# CRITIS 2024: Call for Papers\n\nThe 19th International Conference on Critical Information Infrastructures Security (CRITIS 2024) was held in **Rome, Italy, from September 18th-20th, 2024**.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nCRITIS 2024 welcomes submissions focused on Critical (Information) Infrastructure Security aimed at addressing the challenges and solutions in defending our vital systems against emerging threats and vulnerabilities.  Research topics focusing on information exchange security and securing information infrastructures in various ways are encouraged. Papers focusing on complex safety & security, digital twins, technology forecasting, monitoring, foresight, and scouting for C(I)IP are welcome in a special TechWatch & TechForecast track. Papers, testbeds, datasets reports, and industrial/practical experience reports on critical infrastructure protection are especially welcome.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines below are AoE (Anywhere on Earth):\n\n*   **Invited Session Deadline:** May 31, 2024\n*   **Regular Paper Submission:** May 31, 2024\n*   **Ongoing Research Paper Submission:** June 30, 2024\n*   **Notification of acceptance - Regular Papers:** July 7, 2024\n*   **Notification of acceptance - Ongoing Research Papers:** July 15, 2024\n*   **Paper re-submission for inclusion in the pre-proceedings:** September 1, 2024\n*   **Final version (for LNCS):** December 1, 2024\n\n## CRITIS 2024 Topics\n\nTopics for CRITIS 2024 include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Protection of Cyber-Physical/Cyber-Physical Human Systems and Industrial Control Systems\n*   Analytics, Strategic Management, (C(I)IP Organization)\n*   Security Awareness & Crisis Management for C(I)IP, Human Factors and Critical Services\n*   Future, TechWatch & Forecast for C(I)IP and Services Oriented Approaches, Explainable AI and Digital Twins\n*   Safety & Security: Complex Vulnerability Analysis\n*   Intelligence Analysis & Quantum Intelligence\n*   Legal Aspects and Ethical Perspectives\n*   Climate change implications in Critical Infrastructures and services\n*   Natural Threats to Critical Infrastructures\n\n## Paper Submission & Guidelines\n\nAll contributions must be submitted via EasyChair ([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=critis2024](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=critis2024)).  Paper designated as \"full paper\" will be included in the post-proceedings published in Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).\n\n*   **Full papers:** scientific research papers, surveying works, and industrial experiences describing significant C(I)IP advances. Papers should be no longer than 20 pages, including bibliography and well‐marked appendices.\n*   **Short papers:** early results or work in progress with initial findings. Papers should be 4 to 6 pages long, including bibliography and well‐marked appendices. Short papers will be presented as posters and will NOT be included in the post-proceedings.\n\nAll papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. All paper submissions must contain a title, a short abstract, and a list of keywords. All submissions will be subjected to a thorough double‐blind review by at least three reviewers.
