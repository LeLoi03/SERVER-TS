  "Summary": "The ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (ISS) is postponed to 2026 due to a lack of bids for hosting the 2025 conference.  Accepted articles for 2025 will be published in a special issue of PACM HCI, aimed for release in fall 2025. Authors of all accepted submissions will be invited to present their work in person at ACM ISS 2026.",
  "Call for Papers": "# ACM ISS 2025: Call for Contributions\n\nThe ACM International Conference on Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (ISS) is postponed to 2026. Accepted articles will be published in a special issue of PACM HCI, aimed for release in fall 2025.  Authors of all accepted submissions will be invited to present their work in person at ACM ISS 2026.\n\n## Call for Papers: PACM HCI Special Issue\n\nThe ACM PACM HCI Interactive Surfaces and Spaces (ISS) track welcomes contributions on a wide range of topics relating to interactive surfaces and spaces as well as novel interface technologies, including (but not limited to):\n\n*   Large display interfaces and multi-display environments\n*   Gesture-based interfaces (hands, finger, body)\n*   Multimodal interfaces\n*   Tangible user interfaces\n*   Novel interaction techniques and paradigms\n*   Interaction with mobile and body-worn devices\n*   Different materials and form factors: curved, sand, water, …\n*   Interactive 3D spaces (Mixed Reality and Augmented Reality, mid-air displays, …)\n*   Large scale and outdoor interactive spaces (projected interfaces, drones, …)\n*   Interactive architecture\n*   Beyond traditional surfaces: shape-changing and actuated surfaces, body-related\n*   Interactive information visualization/data presentation\n*   Software engineering methods and frameworks\n*   Social aspects and protocols related to interacting with surfaces and spaces\n*   Interactive surfaces and spaces that support group work or social interaction\n*   Hardware, including sensing and input technologies with novel capabilities, and results from maker communities\n*   Human-centered design and methodologies related to interactive surfaces and spaces\n*   Empirical evaluations of novel interactive surfaces and/or spaces designs\n*   Evaluations of deployed interactive surfaces and/or spaces in specific domains (public spaces, education, science, business, entertainment, health, art, homes, etc.)\n\n## Publication Model: PACM HCI Journal\n\nFull papers are selected using a refereed process, meeting the ACM’s highest requirements for rigorous review by the ISS Editorial Board, its associate editors, and peer experts. Papers accepted in any round of submission will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACM HCI), [https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci).\n\nAccepted papers are invited to present at the ACM ISS 2026 conference in Oct/Nov 2026. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required. ACM ISS 2026 will likely be a hybrid event where both in-person and remote participation is supported.\n\n## Important Dates (AoE)\n\n**First round 2025:**\n\n*   Submission due: March 14, 2025\n*   Notifications to authors: May 9, 2025\n*   Minor revisions due: May 30, 2025\n*   Final decisions to authors: June 20, 2025\n*   Camera-ready due: July 18, 2025\n\n**Second round 2025:**\n\n*   Submission due: TBD\n*   Notifications to authors: TBD\n*   Minor revisions due: TBD\n*   Final decisions to authors: TBD\n*   Camera-ready due: TBD\n\n## Submission Process\n\nSubmissions will be done through [http://new.precisionconference.com](http://new.precisionconference.com)\n\n## Publication Fees\n\nFor all accepted papers, regardless of conference attendance, at least one author must register for the ACM ISS 2026 conference in the corresponding author category and pay a registration fee for the work to be published in PACM HCI.\n\n## Call for Bids: Hosting Future ISS Conferences\n\nWe are soliciting expressions of interest for chairing and hosting the ACM Interactive Surfaces and Spaces conference in 2026, 2027, or 2028.  The deadline for bids is May 9, 2025. Please contact [steering@iss.acm.org](mailto:steering@iss.acm.org) for more information."
