  "Summary": "The 22nd European Conference on Multi-Agent Systems (EUMAS 2025) will be organized on September 3-5, 2025, by the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computers at the National University of Science and Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest, Romania. EUMAS 2025 is an EURAMAS-designated event and aspires to be the primary European forum for researchers interested in the theory and practice of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems.",
  "Call for Papers": "# EUMAS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 22nd European Conference on Multi-Agent Systems (EUMAS 2025) will be held in **Bucharest, Romania from September 3-5, 2025**.\n\nEUMAS 2025 welcomes original, unpublished papers, including improved versions of extended abstracts or rejected papers from AAMAS, AAAI, and IJCAI 2025.  The submission should describe work that has not been previously published, accepted for publication, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal.\n\nAll submissions will be peer-reviewed in a single-blind fashion. Submission length depends upon the track that you submit to. Additional pages may be used for references and, if needed, a clearly marked appendix. It should be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS format.\n\nAuthors must submit their papers through the [OpenReview submission site](https://openreview.net/group?id=EUMAS/2025/Conference) as a single PDF file.\n\n## Tracks\n\nThis year, EUMAS is accepting submissions across the following tracks:\n\n### Main Track (15 pages + references)\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to: Action and Planning; Adaptation and Learning; Agent Architectures; Agent Programming Languages; Agent Development Methodologies and Tools; Agent-Based Simulations and Modeling; Agent Organizations and Institutions; Agent-oriented Software Engineering; Agents and Complex Systems; Applications of Multi-agent Systems; Argumentation; Automated negotiation; Biologically inspired approaches; Cognitive Models; Collective and Swarm Intelligence; Collective Intentionality; Communication Cooperation, and Coordination; Computational Social Choice; Deep Reinforcement Learning in Multi-Agent Domains; Economic Models; Electronic Commerce; Ethical behavior of multi-agent systems; Formal Modelling; Game-Theoretic Methods; Human-Agent Interaction; Logics for Multi-Agent Systems; Logics for Strategic Reasoning; Machine Learning for Multi-Agent Systems; Multi-Agent Learning; LLM powered AI Agents; Multi-agent architectures for XAI; Explainable planning; Explainable negotiation protocols and strategies; Explainable user/agent profiling; Multi-Robot Systems; Negotiation; Self-organization; Semantic Web Agents; Social Networks; Socio-technical Systems; Theories of Agency; Trust and Reputation; Verification; Virtual Agents; Voting and Judgment Aggregation Models for Multi-Agent Systems\n\n### Agent Toolkits Community Session (15 pages + reference)\n\nThis track aims to provide a forum for researchers involved in developing agent/MAS toolkits and platforms, or that are using them for the development of applications, to exchange ideas, make proposals, suggest challenges, report interesting use cases, and so on—any aspect that could be of interest in the engineering and using Agent Toolkits.\n\n### Demonstrators (5 pages + references)\n\nThis track aims to provide opportunities for participants from academia and industry to present their latest developments in agent-based systems. Demonstrations of interest include both applications of multi-agent systems and tools that support developers in the specification, design, implementation, and testing of agent systems.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper Submission Deadline:** May 16, 2025 (AoE, UTC-12)\n*   **Author Notification:** June 30, 2025 (AoE, UTC-12)\n*   **Camera Ready Papers:** July 18, 2025 (AoE, UTC-12)\n*   **EUMAS Conference:** September 3-5, 2025"
