  "Call for Papers": "# SANER 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe IEEE International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER 2025) will be held from **March 4-7, 2025 at Polytechnique Montréal in Montréal, Québec, Canada.**\n\nSANER is the premier event on the theory and practice of recovering information from existing software and systems. The event explores innovative methods to extract the many kinds of information that can be recovered from software, software engineering documents, and systems artifacts, and examines innovative ways of using this information in system renewal and program understanding.\n\n## Tracks\n\nSANER will feature technical research paper sessions, workshops, an early research achievements track, an industry paper track, a tool demonstration track, and a dedicated track on negative results in software analysis, evolution, and reengineering.\n\n*   Research Papers\n*   Industrial Track\n*   Early Research Achievement (ERA) Track\n*   Short Papers and Posters Track\n*   Reproducibility Studies and Negative Results (RENE) Track\n*   Registered Report Track\n*   Tool Demo Track\n*   Journal First Track\n*   Tutorials Track\n*   Workshops\n*   Student Volunteers\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   AI for Software Engineering\n*   Software Engineering for AI\n*   Generative AI and LLMs\n*   Software Tools for Software Evolution and Maintenance\n*   Software Analysis, Parsing, and Fact Extraction\n*   Software Reverse Engineering and Reengineering\n*   Program Comprehension\n*   Software Evolution Analysis\n*   Software Architecture Recovery and Reverse Architecting\n*   Program Transformation and Refactoring\n*   Mining Software Repositories and Software Analytics\n*   Software Visualization\n*   Software Reconstruction and Migration\n*   Software Maintenance and Evolution\n*   Program Repair\n*   Software Release Engineering, Continuous Integration and Delivery\n*   Empirical studies on all the above topics\n*   Education related to all of the above topics\n*   Legal aspects\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nResearch papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n\n*   Soundness\n*   Significance\n*   Novelty\n*   Verifiability\n*   Presentation\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nSubmitted papers must have been neither previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop. All submissions must come in PDF format and conform, at the time of submission, to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines. Papers must comply with the IEEE Policy on Authorship. All submissions must be in English.\n\nSubmissions should not exceed 12 pages (the last 2 pages for references only) and should be uploaded electronically in PDF format via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saner2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saner2025).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** October 4, 2024 AoE\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** October 13, 2024 AoE\n*   **Notifications:** November 29, 2024 AoE\n*   **Camera Ready:** December 27, 2024 AoE\n\n## Special Issue\n\nAuthors of selected research papers accepted at SANER 2025 will be invited to submit revised, extended versions of their manuscripts for a special issue featured by Springer’s Empirical Software Engineering Journal (EMSE)."
