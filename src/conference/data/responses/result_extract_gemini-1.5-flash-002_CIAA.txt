The conference concerns research on all aspects of implementation and application of automata and related structures, including theoretical aspects.\n\n## Topics\n\nWe solicit papers on all aspects of implementation and application of automata and related structures, including theoretical aspects, including but not limited to:\n\n*   Algorithms on automata\n*   Automata and logic\n*   Bioinformatics\n*   Complexity of automata operations\n*   Compilers\n*   Computer-aided verification\n*   Concurrency\n*   Data structure design for automata\n*   Data and image compression\n*   Design and architecture of automata software\n*   Digital libraries\n*   DNA, molecular, and membrane computing\n*   Document engineering\n*   Editors, environments\n*   Experimental studies and practical experiences\n*   Industrial applications\n*   Natural language processing\n*   Networking\n*   New algorithms for manipulating automata\n*   Object-oriented modeling\n*   Pattern-matching\n*   Quantum computing\n*   Speech and speaker recognition\n*   Structured and semi-structured documents\n*   Symbolic manipulation environments for automata\n*   Teaching\n*   Text processing\n*   Techniques for graphical display of automata\n*   VLSI\n*   Viruses, related phenomena\n*   World-wide-web\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions must be written in LaTeX using the LNCS LaTeX2e style and must not exceed 12 single-spaced pages, excluding the title page and the references. If the authors believe that more details are essential to substantiate the main claims, they may include a clearly marked appendix that will be read at the discretion of the program committee. Simultaneous submissions of papers to journals or any other conference with published proceedings or submitting previously published papers is not allowed. Only electronic submission of PDF documents is possible.\n\nAuthors should submit their contributions through Easychair.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** May 3rd\n*   **Notification:** June 20th\n*   **Final version:** June 30th\n\n## Publication\n\nCIAA 2025 proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).\n\n## Special Issue\n\nExtended versions of selected papers from the conference will be invited for consideration in a special issue of the International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science (IJFCS).\n\n## Invited Speakers\n\n*   Marie-Pierre Béal, Université Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée, France\n*   Dirk Nowotka, University of Kiel, Germany\n*   Alberto Policriti, University of Udine, Italy\n\n## Contact\n\nAll questions should be addressed to [ciaa2025@unipa.it](mailto:ciaa2025@unipa.it)"
