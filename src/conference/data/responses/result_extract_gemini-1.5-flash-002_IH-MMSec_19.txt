  "Call for Papers": "# ACM IH&MMSec 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 13th ACM Workshop on Information Hiding and Multimedia Security (ACM IH&MMSec 2025) will be held in **San Jose, California, USA, from June 18-20, 2025**.\n\nThe IH&MMSec workshop solicits novel papers documenting research, industrial, or government practice in information hiding and multimedia security.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nSubmitted papers should address security and privacy aspects in relation to multimedia host signals (including images, audio, videos, texts, network traffic, etc.):\n\n*   Forensics and counter-forensics\n*   Steganography and steganalysis\n*   Covert and subliminal channels\n*   Watermarking and fingerprinting\n*   Networks and protocols\n*   Anonymity and privacy\n*   Biometrics\n*   Deep fake analysis\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to, the use or advances of the following methods:\n\n*   Information, coding, and complexity theory\n*   Game and decision theory\n*   Statistical modeling\n*   Machine learning and deep learning\n*   Adversarial machine learning\n*   DNN watermarking\n*   Deep learning security\n*   Secure Signal Processing\n*   Benchmarking and replication\n*   Obfuscation and privacy-preserving systems\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAuthors are invited to submit either short papers (4-6 pages, including references, for preliminary yet interesting results) or full papers (10-12 pages, including references, with general and detailed research contributions). Submissions must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference. Manuscripts must be properly anonymized for double-blind review.\n\nThe accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Authors and co-authors must also observe the ACM Publications Policies and Procedures ([https://www.acm.org/publications/policies](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies)), as well as provide valid ORCID IDs ([https://orcid.org](https://orcid.org)).\n\n## Formatting Instructions\n\nThe submitted technical papers must be written in English. Short papers must present 4-6 pages (including references), while full papers must present 10-12 pages (including references). Submissions must follow the new ACM conference template (\"sigconf\" style) and must be provided in PDF format. Submissions not meeting these requirements will risk being desk rejected, without any consideration of their merits.\n\nAll submissions must be anonymized. Authorsâ€™ names and affiliations must not appear in the paper. Obvious self-references must be properly obfuscated to avoid identification.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nPaper submission will be handled by CMT: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/13IHMMSec2025/Submission/Index](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/13IHMMSec2025/Submission/Index)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Deadline for special session proposals:** December 6, 2024 and December 13, 2024\n*   **Submission site opens:** January 10, 2025\n*   **Submissions are due:** February 14, 2025 and February 28, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notification:** April 12, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready submission due:** May 2, 2025\n*   **Workshop:** June 18-20\n\n## Special Events\n\nWe are glad to announce SAFE: Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation Challenge. For more details, see [Special Events](Special Events).\n\nWe are glad to announce that two Special Sessions are selected, each offering available positions!"
