I cannot find information about the International Conference on Pairing-based Cryptography (Pairing) in the provided text.  The text describes the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) and lists several other IACR conferences (Asiacrypt, Crypto, Eurocrypt, CHES, FSE, PKC, TCC, Real World Crypto), but does not mention a conference specifically called "International Conference on Pairing-based Cryptography".
