  "Call for Papers": "# CLUSTER 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing (CLUSTER 2025) will be held in **Edinburgh, United Kingdom, from September 2-5, 2025**.\n\nCLUSTER 2025 is the 27th edition of the IEEE Cluster conference series and is being held in cooperation with SIGHPC.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe solicit high-quality original work that advances the state-of-the-art in clusters and closely related fields.  Authors must indicate the primary topic area of their submissions from the four topic areas provided below. In addition, they may optionally rank their paper relative to the overall set of topics. Transversal and emerging topics such as AI for HPC, HPC for AI, quantum computing, accelerators, and many others, are welcome within the respective areas even if they are not mentioned explicitly.\n\n**Area 1: Application, Algorithms, and Libraries**\n\n*   HPC and Big Data application studies on large-scale clusters\n*   Applications at the boundary of HPC and Big Data\n*   New applications for converged HPC/Big Data clusters\n*   Application-level performance and energy modeling and measurement\n*   Novel algorithms on clusters\n*   Hybrid programming techniques in applications and libraries (e.g., MPI+X)\n*   Cluster benchmarks\n*   Application-level libraries on clusters\n*   Effective use of clusters in novel applications\n*   Performance evaluation tools\n\n**Area 2: Architecture, Network/Communications, and Management**\n\n*   Node and system architecture for HPC and Big Data clusters\n*   Architecture for converged HPC/Big Data clusters\n*   Energy-efficient cluster architectures\n*   Packaging, power and cooling\n*   Accelerators, reconfigurable and domain-specific hardware\n*   Heterogeneous clusters\n*   Interconnect/memory architectures\n*   Single system/distributed image clusters\n*   Administration, monitoring and maintenance tools\n\n**Area 3: Programming and System Software**\n\n*   Cluster system software/operating systems\n*   Programming models for converged HPC/Big Data/Machine Learning systems\n*   System software supporting the convergence of HPC, Big Data, and Machine Learning processing\n*   Cloud-enabling cluster technologies and virtualization\n*   Energy-efficient middleware\n*   Cluster system-level protocols and APIs\n*   Cluster security\n*   Management of local, center-wide and disaggregate resources and jobs\n*   Programming and software development environments on clusters\n*   Fault tolerance and high-availability\n*   Administration, monitoring and maintenance tools\n\n**Area 4: Data, Storage, and Visualization**\n\n*   Cluster architectures for Big Data storage and processing\n*   Middleware for Big Data management\n*   Cluster-based cloud architectures for Big Data\n*   Storage systems supporting the convergence of HPC and Big Data processing\n*   File systems and I/O libraries\n*   Support and integration of non-volatile memory\n*   Visualization clusters and tiled displays\n*   Big Data/Large scale visualization tools\n*   Big Data application studies on cluster architectures\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the following Xplore layout, page limit, and font size: single-spaced, 2-column numbered pages in IEEE format (8.5x11-inch paper, margins in inches – top: 0.75, bottom: 1.0, sides:0.625, and between columns:0.25, main text: 10pt).\n\nSubmissions are required to be no more than 10 pages (excluding references).\n\nPapers will be reviewed dual-anonymous. Author names and affiliations should NOT be included in the submitted paper. For additional guidelines read the [double anonymous review policy](https://clustercomp.org/2025/dual_anonymous.html).\n\nLaTeX and Word Templates are available [here](https://clustercomp.org/2025/templates.html).\n\nPlease submit your paper via the [online submission system](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/ieeecluster/).\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE).\n\n*   **Submission site open:** February 3, 2025\n*   **Full Papers due:** April 25, 2025\n*   **Paper Acceptance Notification:** July 4, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready deadline:** August 8, 2025\n*   **Conference:** September 2–5, 2025\n\n## Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text\n\nThe use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in a paper (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE publication. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the paper that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content.\n\nThe use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. In this case, disclosure as noted above is recommended.\n\nPlease also refer to the [IEEE Submission Policies](https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/author-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-policies/)."
