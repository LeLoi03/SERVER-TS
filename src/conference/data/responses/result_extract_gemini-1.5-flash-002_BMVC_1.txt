  "Summary": "The British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) is the British Machine Vision Association's (BMVA) annual conference on machine vision, image processing, and pattern recognition. The 36th BMVC will be held from 24th-27th November 2025 in Sheffield, UK.",
  "Call for Papers": "# BMVC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 36th British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) will be held from **November 24th - 27th, 2025 in Sheffield, UK.**\n\nBMVC is one of the major international conferences on computer vision and related areas. It is organised by the British Machine Vision Association (BMVA).\n\n## Topics\n\nAuthors are invited to submit high-quality papers in image processing, computer vision, machine learning, and related areas for BMVC 2025. Topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   3D from X\n*   3D Shape modeling and processing\n*   Action and event understanding\n*   Adversarial attack and defense\n*   Architecture and Space Design\n*   Biometrics\n*   Brave new ideas\n*   Computational Photography and Photogrammetry\n*   Computer vision theory\n*   Datasets and Evaluation\n*   Deep learning architectures and techniques\n*   Document analysis and understanding\n*   Embodied vision: Active agents; simulation\n*   Explainable AI\n*   Fairness, privacy, ethics, social-good, transparency, accountability in vision\n*   Generative models\n*   Humans: Face, Gestures, Pose and Body Movement\n*   Human-in-the-loop computer vision\n*   Image Retrieval\n*   Low-level and Physics-based Vision\n*   Machine learning (other than deep learning)\n*   Medical and Biological Image Analysis\n*   Motion estimation and tracking\n*   Multimodal learning\n*   Recognition for X\n*   Representation Learning\n*   RGBD sensors and analytics\n*   Scene Analysis and Understanding\n*   Segmentation, grouping and shape analysis\n*   Self-, semi-, meta-, unsupervised learning\n*   Transfer, low-shot, continual, long-tail learning\n*   Video analysis and Understanding\n*   Vision and audio\n*   Vision and graphics\n*   Vision and language\n*   Vision and robotics\n*   Vision applications and systems\n*   Visual reasoning and logical representation\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Submitted papers should not exceed **nine pages** (references are excluded), and appendices should be submitted via the supplementary information.\n*   Further information can be found in the [Author Guidelines](/authors/author-guidelines/) and [Submit your Paper](/authors/submit-your-paper/) pages.\n*   The submission portal is available via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=bmva.org/BMVC/2025/Conference).\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** May 16, 2025 (23:59 GMT)\n\n## Reviewing Process\n\nEach paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. The Area Chair will provide a meta-review, summarizing the reviewersâ€™ points and recommending paper decisions. Due to the anticipated volume of papers for BMVC 2025, there will be NO extension granted to the submission deadline. All authors are asked to be prepared to review papers.\n\n## Contact\n\nAny queries to the Programme Chairs should be sent to [programmechairs.bmvc2025@bmva.org](mailto:programmechairs.bmvc2025@bmva.org)."
