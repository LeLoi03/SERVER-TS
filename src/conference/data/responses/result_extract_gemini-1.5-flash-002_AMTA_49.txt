  "Call for Papers": "# AMTA 2024: Call for Papers and Presentations\n\nThe 16th biennial AMTA conference was held from **Monday, September 30, 2024, through Wednesday, October 2, 2024**, at the **Renaissance Schaumburg Convention Center in Chicago, Illinois, USA**.\n\nAMTA brings together researchers, practitioners, and providers of MT and related cross-lingual technology from academia, industry, and government. The conference included keynote talks, panel discussions, individual presentations, and demonstrations from technology providers.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nAll versions of abstracts, papers, and slide decks must be submitted via the [SUBMISSION WEBSITE](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AMTA2024). This site requires an easy-to-perform registration as an author.\n\n### Research Papers\n\nResearch papers submitted for peer review must be submitted via the “Main Conference – Research (Peer Review)” track on the [SUBMISSION WEBSITE](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AMTA2024).\n\n*   Papers should not be longer than 8 pages of content (for references, unlimited pages are allowed; appendices may also extend beyond the page limit, though the main paper should be as self-contained as possible and reviewers are not required to read the appendices).\n*   Accepted papers will receive an additional two pages in which they can add content in response to reviewer requests if needed.\n*   The papers must follow the style guides ([PDF](https://amtaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AMTA2024.pdf), [LaTeX](https://amtaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AMTA2024.zip), [Word](https://amtaweb.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/AMTA2024.docx)) and be submitted in PDF format.\n*   Research track papers must represent new work that has not been previously published.\n\n### Presentation Proposals\n\nProposals for presentations must be submitted via the “Main Conference – Presentation Proposals” track on the [SUBMISSION WEBSITE](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AMTA2024).\n\n*   Please submit a 250 to 500-word abstract describing your presentation topic along with a 100 word or less biography of the proposed speaker(s).\n*   Presentations in the form of slide decks are also acceptable and should be submitted as PDFs.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest might include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Latest advances in MT\n*   Using Large Language Models for translation, transcreation, and other cross-lingual use cases\n*   Training Data: data sources, extraction, alignment, and cleaning of corpora, terminology, data augmentation, metadata extraction, multimodal data, etc.\n*   Adaptation and customization of MT models or LLMs for cross-lingual use cases\n*   Augmenting MT with ML, NLP, or generative AI\n*   Comparative evaluation of MT systems\n*   MT for low-resource languages\n*   Model distillation, compression, and on-device MT\n*   MT in production scenarios, robustness and deployment issues\n*   MT for multiple modalities (speech, sign language, video, etc.)\n*   MT for real-time communication (chats, social networks, etc.)\n*   Integration of MT and related cross-lingual technologies in translation and localization pipelines\n*   Output quality estimation and evaluation: tools, methods, and metrics, such as human evaluations, automatic scoring, and automatic annotation of MT output\n*   Detecting and preventing catastrophic errors in output\n*   Measuring fairness, bias, and transparency in output\n*   Post-editing and human-in-the-loop methods: New approaches, successes and failures, applicability to different content-types, etc.\n*   The interaction of language professionals (translators and interpreters) with MT and generative AI tools and output\n*   Advanced MT fine-tuning and enhancement: including pre- and post-processing; controlling style, tone of voice, gender\n*   Interactive and real-time adaptive MT systems: including advanced approaches to leverage TM and end-user feedback\n*   Business Cases: making the business case for adopting MT and related cross-lingual technologies to drive business requirements\n*   Ethics, policy, and regulatory trends concerning the use of MT or generative AI for cross-lingual use cases\n*   Cross-language information retrieval\n*   Source text improvement: improving the source content destined for MT through automatic tools such as grammar correction, guidelines, and NLP\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** June 14, 2024, 23:59 Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12)\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** July 19, 2024\n*   **Final “camera-ready” papers for proceedings:** August 16, 2024\n\n## Contact\n\nFor questions concerning the submission of peer-reviewed papers, please write an email to [mtresearchers@amtaweb.org](mailto:mtresearchers@amtaweb.org).\n\nFor questions concerning the presentation proposals, please write an email to [presentation_proposals@amtaweb.org](mailto:presentation_proposals@amtaweb.org).\n\nFor any other questions, please contact [organizing.committee@amtaweb.org](mailto:organizing.committee@amtaweb.org)."
