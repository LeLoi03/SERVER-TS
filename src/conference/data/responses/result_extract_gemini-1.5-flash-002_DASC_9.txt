  "Call for Papers": "# DASC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 23rd IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing (DASC 2025) will be held as a **hybrid conference** (in-person and virtual) in **Hakodate City, Hokkaido, Japan from October 21-24, 2025**.\n\nDASC 2025 aims to bring together computer scientists, industrial engineers, and researchers to discuss and exchange theoretical and implementation results, novel designs, work-in-progress, experience, case studies, and trend-setting ideas in the areas of dependability, security, trust, and/or autonomic computing, and autonomous systems.\n\n## Tracks and Topics\n\n### For Regular Papers\n\n*   **Track 1. Dependability, Reliability, and Fault Tolerance**\n*   **Track 2. Security, Privacy, and Trust in Systems and Networks**\n*   **Track 3. Autonomic Computing and Self-Adaptive Systems**\n*   **Track 4. AI, Machine Learning, and Advanced Computational Methods**\n*   **Track 5. Industrial Applications and Case Studies**\n\n### For WiP/Workshop/Special Session Papers\n\n*   **WiP (Work-in-Progress) Track:** This track covers all the topics for regular papers but is aimed at papers that have an original but not fully validated proposal.\n*   **Workshop/Special Session Tracks:** DASC workshops and special sessions are listed [here](https://cyber-science.org/2025/dasc/acceptworkshops/).\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nAuthors are invited to submit their original research work that has not been previously submitted or published in any other venue. All regular, Work-in-Progress (WiP), workshop, special session, and poster papers must be submitted via the EDAS system.\n\n*   **Regular papers:** should present substantial, original, completed, and unpublished work. Wherever applicable, concrete evaluation and/or analysis should be included.\n*   **Work-in-Progress (WiP) papers:** should present original, ongoing, and unpublished work with preliminary results. The paper should include the current status, initial findings, and expected contributions of the work.\n*   **Poster papers:** should present original, unpublished work with innovative ideas, preliminary results, or ongoing research. The paper should include key findings, methodology, and future directions.\n*   **Workshop papers:** should present original, unpublished work associated with the theme of a specific workshop. Novel ideas, methods, or applications related to the workshop scope, as well as concrete evaluation and/or analysis, should be included.\n*   **Special Session (SS) papers:** should present substantial, original, completed, and unpublished work that focuses on emerging topics, specific research domains, or interdisciplinary areas. Significant contributions to advancing the state of the art in the targeted research domain or interdisciplinary field should be included.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Workshop/SS Proposal Due:** May 10, 2025\n*   **Regular Paper Due:** June 10, 2025\n*   **WiP/Workshop/SS Paper Due:** June 20, 2025\n*   **Author Notification:** August 11, 2025\n*   **Paper Registration Due:** September 5, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready Submission Due:** September 12, 2025\n\n## Publication\n\nAll accepted papers in the main tracks, workshops, special sessions, and poster sessions will be published in the IEEE Computer Society proceedings (IEEE-DL and EI indexed). Best Paper Awards will be presented to high-quality papers. Selected papers will be recommended for publication in prestigious journals ([Special Issues](https://cyber-science.org/2025/special-issues/))."
