  "Call for Papers": "# IEEE SMC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 2025 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC) will be held in **Vienna, Austria from October 5-8, 2025.**\n\nThe theme of the IEEE SMC 2025 conference is **“Navigating Frontiers: Smart Systems for a Dynamic World”.**\n\n## Overview\n\nThe IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC) is the flagship conference of the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society. It provides an international forum for researchers, educators, and practitioners to learn, share knowledge, report most recent innovations and developments, and exchange ideas and advances in all aspects of systems science and engineering, human-machine systems, and cybernetics.\n\n## Paper Types\n\n*   **Regular Papers:** Papers (regular length of up to 6 pages) with max. 2 overlength pages (including paper title, authors and affiliations, figures, and references) for an extra fee.\n*   **Special Sessions Papers:** Special Sessions provide a focused discussion of new and innovative topics. Special Session proposers should download the special session proposal template and submit the completed proposal to the Special Session Chairs. Special Session organizers should collect at least six papers.\n*   **Work-in-Progress and Industrial Papers:** These contributions are intended to show work-in-progress and to promote contributions from industries on technology development, innovations, and implementations.\n*   **Workshop Papers:** These contributions are intended to promote contributions from applied research and applications, including work in progress, and facilitate increased collaboration between industrial and academic members of the IEEE SMC community.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAuthors must adhere to the IEEE conference written paper format (including paper title, authors and affiliations, figures, and references) and they must submit the draft version of the paper for review before the due submission deadlines (see dates below).  These are submitted through the PaperCept submission system: [https://conf.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl](https://conf.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl)\n\nIEEE is very strict about the requirements for PDF files for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. We strongly recommend using the set of templates in MS Word and LaTeX format provided by IEEE. Letter page size should be used. Please use them to create your paper, but don’t modify the style or the format under any circumstances.\n\n*   [IEEE-ConfPaper-Template-Word.doc](call-for-papers.html?file=files/content/test-files/IEEE-ConfPaper-Template-Word.doc&cid=541)\n*   [IEEE-ConfPaper-Template-LaTeX.zip](call-for-papers.html?file=files/content/test-files/IEEE-ConfPaper-Template-LaTeX.zip&cid=541)\n\n## Topics\n\nContributions to theory and practice, including but not limited to, the following technical areas, are invited:\n\n*   **Cybernetics (CYB)**\n*   **Human-Machine Systems (HMS)**\n*   **Systems Science & Engineering (SSE)**\n\n(A full list of topics is available on the conference website.)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Special Session Proposal Deadline:** March 5, 2025\n*   **Tutorial and Workshop Proposal Deadline:** March 5, 2025\n*   **Notification of Special Session, Tutorial, and Workshop Acceptance:** March 17, 2025\n*   **Deadline for Regular and Special Session Paper Submission:** April 20, 2025\n*   **Deadline for Work in Progress and Industry Paper and Workshop Contribution Submission:** May 9, 2025\n*   **Deadline for Travel Grants:** May 9, 2025\n*   **Acceptance Notification of Papers:** June 6, 2025\n*   **Final Camera-ready Submission of Papers:** June 30, 2025\n*   **Deadline for Early Bird Rate Registration (author and non-author):** July 18, 2025\n*   **Deadline for Late Registration (non-author):** September 26, 2025"
