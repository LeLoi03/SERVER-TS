  "Call for Papers": "# GPCE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE 2025) is a programming languages conference focusing on techniques and tools for code generation, language implementation, and product-line development. GPCE 2025 is the 24th edition of the conference and will be co-located with ECOOP 2025 in **Bergen, Norway, from June 30 to July 4, 2025**.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nGPCE seeks conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and technical contributions to its topics of interest, which include but are not limited to:\n\n*   Program transformation, staging\n*   Macro systems, preprocessors\n*   Program synthesis\n*   Code-recommendation systems\n*   Domain-specific languages\n*   Generative language workbenches\n*   Language embedding, language design\n*   Domain engineering\n*   Software product lines, configurable software\n*   Feature interactions\n*   Applications and properties of code generation\n*   Language implementation\n*   AI/ML techniques for generative programming\n*   Generative programming for AI/ML techniques\n*   Low code / no code approaches\n\n## Paper Categories\n\nGPCE solicits four kinds of submissions:\n\n*   **Full Papers:** Reporting original and unpublished results of research that contribute to scientific knowledge for any GPCE topic. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography.\n*   **Short Papers:** Presenting unconventional ideas or new visions in any GPCE topics. Short paper submissions must not exceed 6 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text “(Short Paper)” appended to their titles.\n*   **Tool Demonstrations:** Presenting tools for any GPCE topic. Submissions must provide a tool description not exceeding 6 pages excluding bibliography and a separate demonstration outline including screenshots also not exceeding 6 pages. Tool demonstration submissions must have the text “(Tool Demonstration)” appended to their titles.\n*   **Generative Pearl:** An elegant essay about generative programming. Generative Pearl submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text “(Generative Pearl)” appended to their titles.\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nThe submission page is [https://gpce25.hotcrp.com/](https://gpce25.hotcrp.com/).\n\nAll submissions must use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”. Be sure to use the latest LaTeX templates and class files, the SIGPLAN sub-format, and 10-point font. Consult the sample-sigplan.tex template and use the document-class `\\documentclass[sigplan,anonymous,review]{acmart}`.\n\nTo increase fairness in reviewing, GPCE uses the double-blind review process.\n\n## ACM Artifact Badges\n\nStarting the 2024 edition, authors can apply for an ACM Artifact Badge.
