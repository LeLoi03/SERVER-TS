It covers the design process, test, and tools for design automation of electronic products ranging from integrated circuits to distributed large-scale systems. This includes both hardware and embedded software design issues. The conference scope also includes the elaboration of design requirements and new architectures for challenging application fields such as sustainable computing, smart societies and digital wellness, secure systems, autonomous systems and smart industry, and state-of-the-art applications of artificial intelligence.\n\n## Special Days on Emerging Topics\n\nThe scientific research track is complemented by a set of sessions focusing on emerging topics bringing new challenges to the community, with presentations and interactions on interesting and timely issues. \n\n## Topic Areas for Submission\n\nWithin the scope of the conference, the main areas of interest are organized in the following tracks. Submissions can be made to any of the track topics. \n\n*   **Track D:** Design Methods and Tools\n*   **Track A:** Application Design\n*   **Track T:** Test and Dependability\n*   **Track E:** Embedded Systems Design\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nAll manuscripts for any technical topic of the D, A, T, and E tracks must be submitted for review electronically, following the instructions below.\n\n*   The accepted file format is PDF.\n*   Submissions must not exceed 6 pages in length, plus one extra page only for references.\n*   All submitted papers should be formatted as close as possible to the final format: A4 pages or Letter sheets, double-column, single-spaced, Times or equivalent font of minimum 10pt, avoid the use of type-3 fonts. Do not use baseline stretch to compress text. Paper templates are available on the DATE website for your convenience.\n*   DATE follows a double-blind review process. To support it, submissions must not include authors’ names. In addition, prior work by the same authors should be referenced in full and it should be discussed in such a way that it does not disclose that the work is from the same authors.\n*   Submissions simultaneously under review or accepted by another conference, symposium, or journal will be rejected.\n*   The deadline to submit papers is Sunday, September 15, 2024 AoE. The full paper must be uploaded at the latest by Sunday, September 22, 2024 AoE. Otherwise, the initial submission will be automatically withdrawn. \n*   The contact author of a submitted paper will be notified of acceptance or rejection by Tuesday, November 19, 2024 AoE. In case of acceptance, authors need to prepare a final, camera-ready manuscript by Friday, January 17, 2025 AoE.\n*   It is mandatory that at least one author of each accepted paper attends the session where the paper is discussed and presents the work as requested; otherwise, the paper will be deleted from the proceedings afterwards.\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://softconf.com/date25/conference/](https://softconf.com/date25/conference/)\n\n## Contact\n\n**Programme Chair:** Theocharis Theocharides, University of Cyprus, CY ([papers@date-conference.com](mailto:papers@date-conference.com))"
