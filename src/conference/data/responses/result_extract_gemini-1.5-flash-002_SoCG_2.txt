  "Call for Papers": "# SoCG 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 41st International Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG 2025) will be held in **Kanazawa, Japan, from June 23–27, 2025**, as part of the Computational Geometry (CG) Week.\n\nWe invite high-quality submissions that describe original research on computational problems in a geometric and/or topological setting. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Design, analysis, and implementation of geometric algorithms and data structures\n*   Computational complexity of geometric problems\n*   Implementation and experimental evaluation of geometric algorithms and heuristics\n*   Discrete and combinatorial geometry\n*   Computational topology, topological data analysis, and topological combinatorics\n*   Applications of computational geometry or topology in any field\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstracts and paper registration due:** November 26, 2024 (23:59 AoE)\n*   **Papers due:** December 3, 2024 (23:59 AoE)\n*   **Notification of acceptance/rejection:** February 6, 2025\n*   **Final versions of accepted papers due:** April 11, 2025\n*   **Symposium:** June 23–27, 2025\n\n## Paper Types\n\nWhen writing or evaluating a SoCG paper, it is important to keep in mind that there are different types of contributions, each with its own strengths. To ensure that a submission is evaluated on its own merits, authors will need to identify the main strengths of their submission, as captured by four possible paper types. PC members and external reviewers will be asked to take into account these paper types together with their associated evaluation criteria when they evaluate a paper. There are no quotas for the paper types, and submissions can be labeled with more than one paper type at the time of submission:\n\n*   **Mathematical Foundations:** A typical paper will contain theorems and proofs describing new results in discrete or combinatorial geometry, discrete differential geometry or topology, or in topological combinatorics.\n*   **Algorithmic Complexity:** A typical paper will contain algorithms, data structures, theorems, proofs, or lower bound constructions describing new results on computational geometry problems.\n*   **Experiments and Implementation:** A typical paper will make a clear contribution to the implementation and evaluation of geometric algorithms.\n*   **Applications:** A typical paper will describe the modeling and algorithmic choices made when developing or adapting computational geometry techniques for an application area.\n\n## Double Blind and PC Submissions\n\nSoCG will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process, and will allow PC members (other than the PC chairs) to submit to the conference as well. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way.\n\n## Format\n\nSubmissions must be formatted in accordance with the LIPIcs proceedings guidelines. Authors are required to use the LaTeX class file [socg-lipics-v2021.cls](https://computational-geometry.org/documents/socg-lipics-v2021.cls) (V0.9, Sep 19, 2022), with the option “anonymous”. Submissions must not exceed 500 lines, excluding front matter (title), references, and a clearly marked appendix.\n\n## Contents of the Submission\n\nPapers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract, which begins with the title of the paper, as well as a short abstract. This should be followed by the main body of the paper that begins with a precise statement of the problem considered, a succinct summary of the results obtained (emphasizing the significance, novelty, and potential impact of the research), and a clear comparison with related work.\n\n## Appendix and Additional Data\n\nAll details needed to verify the results must be provided. Supporting materials, including proofs of theoretical claims and experimental details, that do not fit in the 500-line limit should be given in an appendix. If more appropriate, the full version may be given as the appendix. In both cases, however, the authors should include in the main part specific pointers to the relevant locations in the appendix.\n\n## Previous or Simultaneous Submissions\n\nResults previously published or accepted for publication in the proceedings of another conference cannot be submitted. Simultaneous submissions of the results to another conference with published proceedings are not allowed.\n\n## Accepted Papers\n\n*   **Presentation:** An author of each accepted paper is expected to attend the symposium and present the paper (approximately 20 minutes).\n*   **Best paper award:** An accepted paper may be selected as the best paper.\n*   **Best student paper award:** An accepted paper may be selected as the best student paper.\n*   **Best student presentation award:** Based on the feedback from the audience, a presentation during the symposium by a student may be selected as the best student presentation.\n\n## Invited papers and special issues\n\nAuthors of the best paper will be invited to submit an extended version of their paper to the Journal of the ACM, and authors of one (or more) most highly ranked papers may be invited to submit their full paper to the journal TheoretiCS. Authors of a selection of accepted papers from the symposium will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to special issues of Discrete & Computational Geometry and Journal of Computational Geometry.\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Mikkel Abrahamsen, University of Copenhagen\n*   Oswin Aichholzer, Graz University of Technology (co-chair)\n*   Hugo Akitaya, University of Massachusetts Lowell\n*   Mark de Berg, Eindhoven University of Technology\n*   Sujoy Bhore, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay\n*   Ahmad Biniaz, University of Windsor\n*   Håvard Bakke Bjerkevik, SUNY Albany\n*   Gerth Stølting Brodal, Aarhus University\n*   Hsien-Chih Chang, Dartmouth College\n*   Siu-Wing Cheng, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology\n*   Vida Dujmović, University of Ottawa\n*   David Eppstein, University of California, Irvine\n*   Emily Fox, University of Texas at Dallas\n*   Jie Gao, Rutgers University\n*   Dan Halperin, Tel Aviv University\n*   Tao Hou, University of Oregon\n*   Francis Lazarus, Université Grenoble Alpes\n*   Chih-Hung Liu, National Taiwan University\n*   Daniel Lokshtanov, University of California Santa Barbara\n*   Anna Lubiw, University of Waterloo\n*   Amir Nayyeri, Oregon State University\n*   Eunjin Oh, Pohang University of Science and Technology\n*   Tim Ophelders, Utrecht University and TU Eindhoven\n*   Irene Parada, UPC BarcelonaTech\n*   Rahul Saladi, Indian Institute of Science\n*   Patrick Schnider, University of Basel and ETH Zürich\n*   Raimund Seidel, Saarland University\n*   Don Sheehy, North Carolina State University\n*   Shakhar Smorodinsky, Ben-Gurion University\n*   Jonathan Spreer, University of Sydney\n*   Takeshi Tokuyama, Kwansei Gakuin University\n*   Torsten Ueckerdt, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology\n*   Pavel Valtr, Charles University\n*   Kasturi Varadarajan, University of Iowa\n*   Haitao Wang, University of Utah (co-chair)\n*   Jinhui Xu, University at Buffalo\n*   Jie Xue, New York University Shanghai\n\n## Contact\n\nThe local organizing committee can be contacted at [socg25@ml.jaist.ac.jp](mailto:socg25@ml.jaist.ac.jp)."
