  "Call for Papers": "# SETTA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 11th International Symposium on Dependable Software Engineering: Theories, Tools and Applications (SETTA 2025) will be held at **St Catherine's College, University of Oxford, from December 1-3, 2025**.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of the SETTA symposium is to bring international researchers together to exchange research results and ideas on bridging the gap between formal methods and software engineering. It aims at academic excellence and its objective is to become a flagship conference on formal software engineering in Asia. 2025 is the first time the conference is being held outside its traditional home region.\n\n## Topics and Scope\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Requirements specification and analysis\n*   Formalisms for modeling, design and implementation\n*   Model checking, theorem proving, and decision procedures\n*   Scalable approaches to formal system analysis\n*   Formal approaches to simulation, run-time verification, and testing\n*   Integration of formal methods into software engineering practice\n*   Contract-based engineering of components, systems, and systems of systems\n*   Formal and engineering aspects of software evolution and maintenance\n*   Parallel and multicore programming\n*   Embedded, real-time, hybrid, probabilistic, and cyber-physical systems\n*   Mixed-critical applications and systems\n*   Formal aspects of service-oriented and cloud computing\n*   Safety, reliability, robustness, and fault-tolerance\n*   Dependability of smart software and systems\n*   Empirical analysis techniques and integration with formal methods\n*   Applications and industrial experience reports\n*   Software tools to assist the construction or analysis of software systems\n*   Trustworthy and explainable AI\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nPeer-reviewed research papers will be published in the SETTA 2025 proceedings as a volume in Springer's LNCS series. Submissions should not exceed 16 pages (excluding references) in the LNCS format. Please follow Springerâ€™s [author instructions](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) or use the template on Overleaf.\n\nSETTA 2025 employs double-blind reviewing. Submissions should not contain authors' names or other identifying factors.  Papers should be submitted electronically through the submission website: [https://setta2025.hotcrp.com/](https://setta2025.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Important Dates (AoE)\n\nSETTA 2025 will accept submissions in two rounds. All deadlines are at 23:59 AoE.\n\n*   **Paper Submission Deadline (Round 1):** April 30, 2025\n*   **Notification (Round 1):** June 16, 2025\n*   **Paper Submission (Round 2):** August 20, 2025\n*   **Notification (Round 2):** October 8, 2025"
