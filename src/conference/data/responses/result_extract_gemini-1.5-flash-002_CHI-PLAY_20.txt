  "Call for Papers": "# CHI PLAY 2025: Call for Full Papers\n\nThe Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI PLAY) is the international and interdisciplinary conference (by ACM SIGCHI) for researchers and professionals across all areas of play, games, and human-computer interaction (HCI).\n\nCHI PLAY 2025 will be held in **Pittsburgh, USA, from October 13–16, 2025**.\n\n## Submission Details\n\nThe PACMHCI GAMES track is the premier international venue for research in interactive digital games and play. Papers are published in the ACM Journal PACMHCI, in the GAMES track, and accepted papers are invited to present at the CHI PLAY conference series.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe invite authors to submit their best research on all topics relevant to player-computer interactions and digital play.  Submissions should present original and mature research work. High-quality, elaborated case studies and practice reports with generalizable findings will also be considered. We invite contributions across a variety of research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including, but not limited to:\n\n*   Novel input or output technologies for games and play\n*   Studies that contribute to our understanding of player experience of digital play\n*   Innovative game mechanics and playful interactions\n*   Theoretical contributions on digital play and games\n*   Accessible and inclusive design of player-computer interactions\n*   Esports, live streaming, and spectator experiences\n*   Advances in digital game user research, game evaluation methods, and methods for conducting games research\n*   Psychology and typologies of digital games and players\n*   Studies of applied, serious, and persuasive digital games (e.g., games and play for health, well-being, and learning)\n*   Gamification and motivational design\n*   Virtual and augmented reality in games and play\n*   New tools for digital game creation and co-creation that directly affect player experience and/or player-computer interactions\n*   Game analytics and novel visualizations of player-computer interactions\n*   Developer experiences and studies of developers of digital games\n*   Applications of human-centered game AI with implications for HCI games research (e.g., AI for digital game development or AI to improve player-computer interactions)\n*   Critical and reflexive approaches to digital games & play design and experience\n*   Gaming industry case studies\n\n## Important Dates\n\n(all times are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth or AoE)\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** February 19, 2025\n*   **Notifications given (accept with minor revisions/revise and resubmit/reject):** April 14, 2025\n*   **Revisions due:** June 2, 2025\n*   **Final notifications given:** July 4, 2025\n\n## Submission Process Details\n\nPACMHCI GAMES uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: [https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions). Select “SIGCHI” as the Society and “CHI PLAY” as the Conference/Journal to make a new submission.\n\n## Formatting and Length\n\nPACMHCI GAMES uses ACM Journals Primary Article Template: [https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates)\n\n## Anonymous Review Policy\n\nPapers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements.\n\n## ACM Policy on Use of Generative AI in Submissions\n\nAll authors should be aware of the ACM Policy on Authorship, which articulates the authorized use of generative AI in submitted works.\n\n## ACM Publications Policy\n\nBy submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.\n\n## Video Figures\n\nVideo figures are mandatory for submissions that draw from custom-built games or systems that are not freely available (e.g., novel systems, interaction techniques, game designs, mechanics, or envisionments).\n\n## Presenting at the CHI PLAY Conference\n\nAccepted papers will be invited to present at the ACM CHI PLAY conference in Fall 2025. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required for publication in PACM HCI."
