  "Call for Papers": "# W2GIS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 22nd International Symposium on Web and Wireless Geographical Information Systems (W2GIS 2025) will be held in **Mexico City, Mexico, on September 8-9, 2025**.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nW2GIS 2025 invites high-quality submissions of three types of contributions: full papers, work-in-progress papers, and showcase papers. More details are available on the [Call for Papers](/view/w2gis-2025/call-for-papers) page.\n\n## Doctoral Symposium\n\nW2GIS 2025 will also feature a Doctoral Symposium, providing a valuable platform for PhD students to receive feedback and guidance from well-known researchers and industry experts. More details are available on the [Doctoral Symposium](/view/w2gis-2025/doctoral-symposium) page.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence, big data, and social networks within GIS presents new opportunities for urban planning, transportation, and sustainability.  As the conference takes place for the first time in Mexico City and Central America, a key focus is to explore how GIScience, combined with these technologies, can address emerging environmental problems in urban contexts, particularly in relation to sustainable development goals.\n\nTopics to be addressed include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Geospatial databases and spatio-temporal data management\n*   Mobile spatial interaction and movement analysis\n*   Spatial search, GeoWeb search engines and services\n*   Location-based social networks\n*   Spatial social networks\n*   On-line spatial data mining\n*   GeoSensor data acquisition, processing, management and analysis\n*   Smart environments, Internet of Things and ambient spatial intelligence\n*   Exploratory cartography and Web and wireless geo interfaces\n*   GIS visualization techniques for Web and mobile location-based applications\n*   Cyber-geography & augmented reality\n*   Map personalization and adaptation\n*   3D modelling of cityscapes for location-based services\n*   Ubiquitous and wireless GIS\n*   Security, privacy, and usability issues of Web and wireless environments\n*   Semantic geospatial Web and interoperability\n*   User studies and evaluations of online geoservices\n*   Indoor and outdoor wayfinding and navigation\n*   Crowdsourcing and volunteered geographic information\n*   Telematics, GIS and location-based applications\n*   LBS and transportation applications\n*   Wireless-based location-aware applications\n*   Integration of AI and LLMs\n\n## Submission Types\n\nWe invite submissions of three types of contributions:\n\n*   **Full papers:** to present scientific results (limited to 16 pages)\n*   **Short papers:** to present ongoing work (limited to 10 pages)\n*   **Industry papers:** for works with a larger focus on industrial impact and at least one author with an industrial affiliation (10 to 16 pages)\n*   **Showcase papers:** for live presentations of research prototypes and products (limited to 4 pages)\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nAuthors are invited to submit full, original, unpublished research papers. Each paper must be written in English, submitted in PDF format, and formatted using the Springer camera-ready templates available at the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science website. All contributions must be uploaded through the submission site at [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=w2gis2025).\n\n## Dissemination\n\nAccepted papers will be published in the Springer LNCS series. Best selected papers will be invited to submit an expanded version for consideration in a special issue of a well-established international journal.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** March 23, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** May 20, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready copy due:** June 5, 2025\n*   **Author registration deadline:** July 25, 2025\n*   **Early-bird registration:** May 25, 2025"
