  "Call for Papers": "# PST 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 22nd Annual International Conference on Privacy, Security, and Trust (PST 2025) will be held in **Fredericton, Canada, from August 26-28, 2025** in a **hybrid format**.\n\nPST provides a premier forum for sharing advances in cybersecurity research and security applications.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nHigh-quality papers in all PST-related areas that, at the time of submission, are not under review and have not already been published or accepted for publication elsewhere are solicited.  Authors MUST ensure to select the track (Privacy, Security, or Trust) most relevant to their research when submitting their paper. Accepted papers will be accepted as ‘regular’ papers up to 10 pages, or ‘short’ papers of up to 6 pages including references. Up to 2 additional pages will be allowed in each category with over-length charges. Every additional page has a cost of $100.00 (CND). The standard IEEE two-column conference format should be used for all submissions.  The conference proceedings will be submitted for inclusion in IEEE Xplore.\n\nAt least one author of an accepted paper must register by July 1, 2025. Accepted (short or regular) papers will be published in the proceedings.\n\n## Double-blind Submission\n\nReviewing will be double-blind: the reviewers will not know the identities of the authors. It will be up to the authors to ensure the proper anonymization of their paper.  For effective anonymization, please follow these guidelines:\n\n*   Do not include any author's name or affiliation in the title.\n*   Do not include any acknowledgments.\n*   Refer to your own published work in the third person.\n*   If you cite own papers that are not widely available (e.g., a paper currently under review), use anonymous author names in the citation.\n\n## List of Topics\n\n*   Privacy Preserving / Enhancing Technologies\n*   Critical Infrastructure Protection\n*   Network and Wireless Security\n*   Cloud Security, Web Security and Privacy\n*   Internet of Things (IoT) Security and Privacy\n*   Operating Systems Security\n*   Intrusion Detection / Prevention Technologies\n*   Secure Software Development and Architecture\n*   PST Challenges in e-Services, e.g. e-Health, e-Government, e-Commerce\n*   Digital Forensics\n*   Security Analytics and Data Mining\n*   Cryptographic Technologies\n*   Recommendation, Reputation and Delivery Technologies\n*   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities, Continuous Authentication\n*   Security and Privacy Challenges in Blockchain and its Applications\n*   Trust Technologies, Technologies for Building Trust in e-Business Strategy\n*   Observations of PST in Practice, Society, Policy and Legislation\n*   Digital Rights Management\n*   Identity and Trust Management\n*   Human Computer Interaction and PST\n*   Biometrics, National ID Cards, Identity Theft\n*   Implications of, and Technologies for, Lawful Surveillance\n*   Privacy, Traceability, and Anonymity\n*   Trust and Reputation in Self-Organizing Environments\n*   Anonymity and Privacy vs. Accountability\n*   Access Control and Capability Delegation\n*   Generative AI security, privacy, and trust\n*   Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Protocols\n*   Quantum Cryptography beyond QKD\n*   Post-quantum cryptography\n\n## PST Special Sessions\n\nPST 2025 also organizes an Emerging Technologies and Trends Special Session.\n\n## Journal Special Issue\n\nA Special Issue of Cryptography aims to showcase cutting-edge research presented at PST2025, with a focus on cryptographic techniques and their role in addressing contemporary challenges in privacy, security, and trust. More details on the issue and submission details are available [here](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cryptography/special_issues/M81T8HF4DD).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper Submission:** April 30, 2025 (11:59 pm AoE)\n*   **Acceptance Notification:** June 1, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready:** July 1, 2025\n*   **Author Registration:** July 1, 2025\n*   **Early-Bird Registration Ends:** August 1, 2025\n*   **Conference Date:** August 26-28, 2025\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pst2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pst2025)"
