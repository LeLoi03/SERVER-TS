  "Call for Papers": "# PACBB'25: Call for Papers\n\nThe 19th International Conference on Practical Applications of Computational Biology & Bioinformatics (PACBB'25) will be held at the **University of Lille in Lille, France, from June 25th-27th, 2025**.\n\nPACBB aims to promote interaction among the scientific community to discuss applications of Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence (CS/AI) with an interdisciplinary character, exploring the interactions between sub-areas of CS/AI, Bioinformatics, Chemoinformatics, and Systems Biology.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe success of Bioinformatics in recent years has been prompted by research in Molecular Biology and Molecular Medicine. These initiatives gave rise to an exponential increase in the volume and diversification of data, including nucleotide and protein sequences and annotations, high-throughput experimental data, biomedical literature, among many others. Systems Biology is a related research area that has been replacing the reductionist view that dominated Biology research in the last decades, requiring the coordinated efforts of biological researchers with those related to data analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulation, and optimization. The accumulation and exploitation of large-scale databases prompt for new computational technology and for research into these issues. In this context, many widely successful computational models and tools used by biologists in these initiatives, such as clustering and classification methods for gene expression data, are based on Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence (CS/AI) techniques. In fact, these methods have been helping in tasks related to knowledge discovery, modeling, and optimization tasks, aiming at the development of computational models so that the response of biological complex systems to any perturbation can be predicted.\n\n## Topics\n\nPACBB welcomes contributions reporting substantial, original, and previously unpublished work in all areas of Bioinformatics, Chemoinformatics, and Systems Biology.
