  "Call for Papers": "# AiML 2024: Call for Papers\n\nThe 15th International Conference on Advances in Modal Logic (AiML 2024) will be held in **Prague, Czech Republic, from August 19-23, 2024.** AiML 2024 will be co-located with the 21st International Conference on Relational and Algebraic Methods in Computer Science (RAMiCS 2024).\n\n## Topics\n\nWe invite submissions on all aspects of modal and related logic, including (but not limited to):\n\n*   proof theory, semantics or automated deduction\n*   applications of modal logic\n*   history of modal logic\n*   philosophy of modal logic\n*   computational or theoretical aspects\n*   specific instances and variations of modal logic (description logics, modal logics over non-boolean bases, dynamic logics and other process logics, epistemic and deontic logics, modal logics for agent-based systems, modal logic and game theory, modal logic and grammar formalisms, provability and interpretability logics, spatial and temporal logics, hybrid logic, intuitionistic logic, substructural logics, computationally light fragments of all such logics)\n\n## Paper Submissions\n\nThere will be two types of submissions for AiML 2024:\n\n1.  **Full papers:** for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference.\n2.  **Short presentations:** intended for presentation at the conference but not for the published proceedings.\n\nBoth types of papers should be submitted electronically using the EasyChair submission page: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aiml2024](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aiml2024)\n\n### Full Papers\n\nAuthors are invited to submit full papers reporting on original research and not submitted elsewhere.  The submissions should be at most 15 pages (references excluded), with an optional technical appendix of up to 5 pages, together with a plain-text abstract of 100-200 words. The submissions must be typeset in LaTeX, using the AiML LaTeX template.  Authors must submit a plain-text abstract via EasyChair by the abstract deadline prior to full submission of their paper.\n\n### Short Presentations\n\nSubmissions of extended abstracts of up to 5 pages plus references are also welcome and will be subject to reviewing.  Accepted submissions will be made available at the conference, and authors will have the opportunity to give short presentations (of up to 15 minutes).\n\nAt least one author of each accepted paper or short presentation must register for and attend the conference.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstracts of full papers submission:** March 15, 2024\n*   **Full papers submission:** March 29, 2024\n*   **Full papers notification:** May 20, 2024\n*   **Short presentations submission:** May 30, 2024\n*   **Short presentations notification:** June 14, 2024\n*   **Final versions of full papers and short presentations:** June 21, 2024\n*   **Registration deadline:** July 23, 2024\n*   **Conference:** August 19â€“22, 2024\n\n## Programme Committee Chairs\n\n*   Agata Ciabattoni (TU Wien)\n*   David Gabelaia (TSU Razmadze Mathematical Institute)\n\n## Webpages\n\n*   AiML 2024: [https://www.cs.cas.cz/aiml2024/](https://www.cs.cas.cz/aiml2024/)\n*   AiML Series: [http://www.aiml.net/](http://www.aiml.net/)\n*   RAMiCS 2024: [https://ramics-conf.github.io/2024/](https://ramics-conf.github.io/2024/)\n\n## Enquiries\n\nE-mail enquiries should be directed to the PC chairs:\n\n*   [agata@logic.at](mailto:agata@logic.at)\n*   [gabelaia@gmail.com](mailto:gabelaia@gmail.com)"
