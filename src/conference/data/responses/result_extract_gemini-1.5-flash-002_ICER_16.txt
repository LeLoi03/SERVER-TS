  "Call for Papers": "# ICER 2025: Call for Research Papers\n\nThe 21st annual ACM Conference on International Computing Education Research (ICER) aims to gather high-quality contributions to the Computing Education Research discipline. The “Research Papers” track invites submissions describing original research results related to any aspect of teaching and learning computing, from introductory through advanced material. Submissions are welcome from across the research methods used in Computing Education Research and related fields.\n\n## Aims and Scope\n\nEach contribution will be assessed based on:\n\n*   the appropriateness and soundness of its methods\n*   its relevance to teaching or learning computing, and\n*   the depth of its contribution to the community’s understanding of the question at hand.\n\n## Research Areas of Interest\n\n*   design-based research, learner-centered design, and evaluation of educational technology supporting computing knowledge or skills development\n*   discipline based education research (DBER) about computing, computer science, and related disciplines\n*   informal learning experiences related to programming and software development (all ages)\n*   learnability of programming languages and tools for learning programming and computing concepts\n*   learning analytics and educational data mining in computing education contexts\n*   learning sciences work in the computing content domain\n*   measurement instrument development and validation (e.g., concept inventories, attitudes scales, etc.) for use in computing disciplines\n*   pedagogical environments fostering computational thinking\n*   psychology of programming\n*   rigorous replication of empirical work, relevant to computing education, to compare with or extend previous empirical research results\n*   professional development for computing educators at all levels\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nSubmit at the [ICER 2025 HotCRP site](https://icer2025.hotcrp.com).\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll submission deadlines are “anywhere on Earth” (AoE, UTC-12).\n\n*   **Titles, abstracts, and authors due:** Friday, March 14th, 2025\n*   **Full paper submission deadline:** Friday, March 21st, 2025\n*   **Decisions announced:** Thursday, May 15th, 2025\n*   **“Conditional Accept” revisions due:** Thursday, May 29th, 2025\n*   **“Conditional Accept” revisions approval notification:** Thursday, June 5th, 2025\n*   **Final versions due to TAPS:** Wednesday, June 11th, 2025\n*   **ICER 2025 Conference:** Sunday, August 3rd through Wednesday, August 6th 2025\n*   **Published in the ACM Digital Library:** The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date will be the first day of the conference. The official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.\n\n## Submission Format and Publication Workflow\n\nPapers submitted to the research track of ICER have to be prepared according to the ACM TAPS workflow system. The submission template is either the single-column Word Submission Template or the single-column LaTeX (using the “manuscript,review,anonymous” style).\n\nThe publication template is either the single-column Word Submission Template or LaTeX template using “sigconf” and “manuscript” styles in acmart.\n\n## Submission Length\n\nAuthors may submit papers up to 18 pages (in the single-column format) excluding references. Authors who feel the 18 pages are insufficient can request up to 3 additional pages.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nWe strongly recommend reading and following the [SIGCSE list of tips to make your paper accessible](https://sigcse2025.sigcse.org/info/accessibility-tips-for-authors).\n\n## Abstracts\n\nA good abstract should summarize the question your paper asks and what answers it found.\n\n## Acceptance and Conditional Acceptance\n\nAll papers recommended for acceptance after the Senior PC meetings are either accepted or conditionally accepted. For conditionally-accepted papers, meta-reviews will indicate one or more minor revisions that are necessary for final acceptance.\n\n## ACM Publications Policies\n\nBy submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).\n\n## Policy on Use of AI in Paper Writing\n\nThe use of AI to check or improve spelling, grammar or within-sentence phrasing is permitted in writing ICER papers and does not need to be declared. The use of AI to generate images for figures is permitted but must be declared in the paper. The use of AI to generate multi-sentence portions of text is not permitted at ICER, and the chairs may desk-reject papers that they believe have been written using AI tools.\n\n## Contact\n\nAll questions about this call should go to the ICER 2025 program committee chairs at [pc-chairs@icer.acm.org](mailto:pc-chairs@icer.acm.org)."
