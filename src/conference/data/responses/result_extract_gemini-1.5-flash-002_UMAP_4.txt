  "Call for Papers": "# UMAP 2025: Call for Full and Short Papers\n\nThe 33rd International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization (ACM UMAP 2025) is the premier international conference bringing together research in AI and HCI to support effective human-AI collaboration via interactive systems that can model, adapt, and personalize to their users. UMAP 2025 will be held **in person in New York, USA, from June 16-19, 2025**.\n\n## Theme\n\nThe theme of ACM UMAP 2025 is **“Shaping Personalization and FATE (Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, and Ethics) in Human-Centered Generative AI.”**\n\n## Submission Types\n\nUMAP 2025 encourages two types of submissions:\n\n*   **Long papers:** (8 pages at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) should report on substantial contributions of lasting value.  Each accepted long paper will be included in the main conference proceedings and presented in a plenary session as part of the main conference program.\n*   **Short papers:** (4 pages at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper. Each accepted short paper will be included in the main conference proceedings and presented either as an oral presentation or at a poster session as part of the main conference program.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract submission:** January 23, 2025\n*   **Paper submission:** January 30, 2025\n*   **Rebuttal phase:** March 3-9, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** March 26, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready papers:** April 7, 2025\n*   **Registration deadline for authors:** April 7, 2025\n*   **Conference:** June 16-19, 2025\n\n**Note:** The submission deadline is at 11:59 pm AoE (Anywhere on Earth) time.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Recommender systems\n*   Data mining techniques for user modeling, adaptation, and personalization\n*   Generative AI techniques for user modeling, adaptation, and personalization\n*   Large Language Models and Natural Language Processing methods for user modeling, adaptation, and personalization\n*   Knowledge graphs, Linked Data, and semantics for user modeling, adaptation, and personalization\n*   Intelligent user interfaces\n*   Intelligent and personalized e-learning applications and educational games\n*   Personalized behavior change and persuasive applications\n*   Modeling and adapting to human affective states\n*   Virtual assistants, conversational agents, personalization in augmented reality\n*   Group modeling and collaborative team formation\n*   Ethical issues of personalization and human-centered AI systems: Privacy, Fairness, Accountability, Transparency\n*   Creativity in User Modeling, Adaptation, and Personalization\n*   Sustainability-aware methods and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for user modeling, adaptation, and personalization\n*   Personalized approaches for preventing eco-chambers, user manipulation, and disinformation\n*   Research methods and reproducibility\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAll submissions must be written in English. Papers should be submitted electronically, in PDF format, through the EasyChair submission system: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2025), by selecting the “UMAP25 Full and Short Papers” track.\n\n## Review Process\n\nACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process. Submissions not abiding by anonymity requirements will be desk rejected. Reviewers will evaluate papers based on their significance, originality, rigor, and contribution to the field.  ACM UMAP 2025 will introduce a new rebuttal stage during evaluation.\n\n## Registration and Presentation Policy\n\nEach accepted paper must be accompanied by a distinct full author registration, completed by the early registration date cut-off. Each accepted paper must be presented in person to be included in the conference proceedings, published by ACM, and available via the ACM Digital Library.\n\n## Ethical & Human Subjects Considerations\n\nACM UMAP expects papers to include a discussion of the ethical considerations, as well as the impact of the presented work and/or its intended application, where appropriate. ACM UMAP further expects all authors to comply with ethical standards and regulatory guidelines associated with human subjects research, including research involving human participants and research using personally identifiable data.\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n*   Cataldo Musto, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Italy\n*   Julita Vassileva, University of Saskatchewan, Canada\n\n## Contact Information\n\n[umap2025-program@um.org](mailto:umap2025-program@um.org)"
