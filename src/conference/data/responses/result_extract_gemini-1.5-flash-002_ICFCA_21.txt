  "Call for Papers": "# CONCEPTS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 2nd International Joint Conference on Conceptual Knowledge Structures (CONCEPTS 2025) will be held in **Cluj-Napoca, Romania from September 8th-12th, 2025**.\n\nCONCEPTS is a merger of three conferences: CLA, ICCS, and ICFCA.\n\n## Topics and Scope\n\nMain topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Fundamental aspects of Formal Concept Analysis (e.g., FCA theory, concept lattices, algorithms and computational complexity)\n*   Conceptual graphs, graph-based models for human reasoning\n*   Knowledge spaces and learning spaces\n*   Fuzzy, relational, and/or triadic conceptual structures\n*   Conceptual knowledge acquisition, management, exploration, analysis and/or visualization\n*   Probabilistic or approximative approaches to conceptual knowledge\n*   Bridging conceptual structures to information sciences, artificial intelligence, data mining, machine learning, information retrieval, database theory, software engineering, and other areas of computer science\n*   Ontologies, semantic web, knowledge graphs, in particular their relation to conceptual knowledge structures such as concept lattices and conceptual graphs.\n*   Conceptual structures in natural language processing and linguistics\n*   Understanding real-world data and modeling real-world phenomena with conceptual structures (e.g., applications in digital humanities, cybersecurity, biology, medicine, social network analysis)\n*   Psychology, philosophy, and conceptual structures\n\n## Submission Details\n\nSubmissions are invited on significant, original (previously unpublished) research on the topics of the conference:\n\n*   **Journal-track papers:** Up to 26 pages, to be published in a special issue of the International Journal of Approximate Reasoning (IJAR).\n*   **Regular papers:** Up to 16 pages\n*   **Short papers:** Up to 8 pages. Both regular and short papers will be published by Springer in the LNAI series as a proceedings volume.\n\nAll submissions will be subject to single-blind peer review. Accepted papers have to be presented at the conference on-site. Therefore, at least one author per paper has to register timely and attend the conference on-site.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n### Journal-Track Submissions\n\n*   **Full paper submission:** March 23, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Paper reviews sent to authors:** May 9, 2025\n*   **Revised submission:** June 2, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** July 6, 2025\n\nManuscripts must be submitted via the International Journal of Approximate Reasoning online submission system (Editorial Manager®): [https://www.editorialmanager.com/ija/default2.aspx](https://www.editorialmanager.com/ija/default2.aspx). Please select the article type “VSI: CONCEPTS 2025” when submitting your manuscript online.\n\n### Regular and Short Papers\n\n*   **Abstract submission:** March 24, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Full paper submission:** April 7, 2025 (AoE) Firm deadline\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** May 21, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready papers due:** June 5, 2025\n\nSubmission link: [https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/concepts2025](https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/concepts2025).
