  "Summary": "PDP is a premier European and international conference that comprehensively addresses all facets of parallel and distributed processing.  The 2025 PDP Conference will be held in Turin, Italy, from March 12-14, 2025, and will offer a high-quality program featuring research papers, special sessions, and stimulating keynote speakers. Proceedings will be published by Conference Publishing Services and submitted for indexing in Scopus.",
  "Call for Papers": "# PDP 2025: Call for Papers\n\nPDP is among the prime European and International conferences covering all aspects of parallel and distributed processing, ranging from theory to practice, from small to the largest parallel and distributed systems and infrastructures, from fundamental computational problems to full-fledged applications, from architecture, compiler, language and interface design and implementation, to tools, support infrastructures, and application performance aspects.\n\n## Conference Topics\n\nWe invite submissions of high-quality, novel and original research results in areas of parallel and distributed computing including but not limited to:\n\n*   **Algorithms:** resource-aware and power-efficient algorithms; real-time and fault-tolerant distributed/parallel algorithms; graph and network algorithms\n*   **Applications:** numerical and scientific applications with multi-level parallelism; applications with computations over irregular domains; models and methods to enhance functional/non-functional application characteristics\n*   **Data-centric Processing:** scientific workflows; large-scale data processing; large-scale data management; scalable and next-generation storage systems; I/O performance tuning, benchmarking, and middleware; FAIR/opendata systems\n*   **Distributed AI:** Federated Learning; Distributed Learning; AI at scale; training of LLMs; benchmarking for AI workloads\n*   **Distributed Computing:** cluster, grid, fog/edge, mobile and cloud systems; Service-oriented processing; stochastic and approximate computing; cost, security, energy, and other non-functional requirements models and frameworks\n*   **Parallel Computing:** accelerator-based systems inc. GPU, FPGA, neuromorphic, and post-CMOS devices; embedded parallel systems; dependability, survivability, and fault-tolerance; methodologies, benchmarking/metrics, and performance analysis and tools\n*   **Programming Models and Tools:** programming languages, compilers, middleware, and OS; libraries, runtime, and systems software; notations; performance prediction and analysis; simulation and modeling of parallel/distributed systems\n*   **HPC state of practice:** Managing systems and storage; managing facilities; HPC project management; moving, managing and sharing data HPC in the cloud; networking and cybersecurity; HPC training and education strategies; application workflows; system benchmarking\n*   **Systems and Architectures:** high data throughput and streaming architectures; memory organization; service-oriented architectures; heterogeneous and hybrid systems; resource management; post-CMOS architectures including quantum, neuromorphic, and others\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper abstracts (main track):** November 5, 2024, 23:59 AOE\n*   **Full paper submission (main track):** November 12, 2024, 23:59 AOE\n*   **Author notification (main track):** December 20, 2024, 23:59 AOE\n*   **Camera ready full papers (all tracks):** January 27, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions must be in PDF format and should not exceed 8 pages for long papers and 4 pages for short contributions. The page limit includes references and authors’ biographies.\n\nAll submissions must follow the IEEE Conference proceedings format (IEEEtran, double-column, 10pt) at [https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).\n\nAt submission time, the authors must choose the type of submission, indicating whether they intend to submit to the Main track or a specific Special Session. The review process is double-blind and all papers need to be “best-effort” anonymized. We strongly encourage making code and data available anonymously (e.g., in an anonymous GitHub repository via Anonymous GitHub or in a Dropbox folder).\n\nSubmissions will be evaluated by at least three reviewers based on relevance, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity. All accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings volume published by Conference Publishing Services ([https://ieeecps.org](https://ieeecps.org)). At least one author of an accepted paper must register for the conference and present in person their paper at the conference venue in Turin.\n\nSubmissions should be made through the CMT system at the following [link](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PDP2025/Submission/Index)."
