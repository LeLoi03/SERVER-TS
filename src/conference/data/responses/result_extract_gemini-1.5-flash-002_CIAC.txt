  "Call for Papers": "# CIAC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 14th International Symposium on Algorithms and Complexity (CIAC 2025) will take place from **June 10 to June 12, 2025, at LUISS University, Rome, Italy.**\n\n## Topics\n\nAuthors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished research on algorithms and complexity. Typical areas include:\n\n*   Algorithm design and analysis\n*   Sequential, parallel, and distributed algorithms\n*   Data structures\n*   Computational and structural complexity\n*   Lower bounds and limitations of algorithms\n*   Randomized and approximation algorithms\n*   Parameterized algorithms and parameterized complexity classes\n*   Smoothed analysis of algorithms\n*   Alternatives to the worst-case analysis of algorithms (e.g., algorithms with predictions)\n*   On-line computation and competitive analysis\n*   Streaming algorithms\n*   Quantum algorithms and complexity\n*   Algorithms in algebra, geometry, number theory, and combinatorics\n*   Computational geometry\n*   Algorithmic game theory and mechanism design\n*   Algorithmic economics (including auctions and contests)\n*   Computational learning theory\n*   Computational biology and bioinformatics\n*   Algorithmic issues in communication networks\n*   Algorithms for discrete optimization (including convex optimization)\n*   Algorithm engineering\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAuthors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper with at most 15 pages, excluding the title page and the references. The title page consists of the title of the paper and the abstract. The first section of the paper should start on the next page. The usage of the LNCS style file is mandatory. Submissions should be anonymized according to the double-blind review policy. Late submissions and submissions not in the correct format will not be considered.\n\nSubmissions will be through EasyChair ([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025)).\n\nSimultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed. At least one author of each accepted paper will have to register for the conference.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Deadline for submissions:** November 22, 2024 (AoE)\n*   **Author notification:** January 31, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready due:** February 14, 2025\n\n## Awards\n\nTwo selected papers will receive the Best Paper Award, sponsored by Springer."
