  "Call for Papers": "# DX 2025: Call for Papers and Participation\n\nThe 36th International Conference on Principles of Diagnosis and Resilient Systems (DX’25) will take place in **Nashville, TN, from September 22nd to 24th, 2025.**\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nUntil 2023, the focus of the DX workshop series has been on the principles and applications of diagnosis, i.e., identifying root causes for encountered issues and unexpected scenarios, as well as on related techniques, such as prognostics, planning, and control. Moving forward as a conference, we expanded our focus on diagnosis in 2024 to include particularly interesting topics related to resilience, which is the intrinsic ability of a system to sustain its required operations when impacted by expected and unexpected contingencies that were potentially not considered during the system design. We are interested in papers covering resilient design, operational resilience, and related approaches spanning monitoring, anomaly detection, diagnosis, control, planning, and verification of systems.\n\nThe annual DX conference is a forum to present state-of-the-art research and experience reports, exchange and discuss emerging ideas, debate current issues, and envision future challenges. Relevant research areas include topics that relate to diagnosis, resilient design, and operational resilience, including but not limited to:\n\n*   Anomaly and fault detection\n*   Fault and root cause isolation\n*   Prognosis\n*   Fault-tolerant, fault-adaptive, and resilient control\n*   Reconfiguration, planning, and intelligent decision-making\n*   Verification and debugging at design and run-time\n*   Explanation, validation, and certification\n\nWe welcome evidence-driven position papers, theory papers, experience reports, and papers that span across multiple research and application domains that, in the context, cover digital, logical, analog, mechanical, cyber-physical, biological, ecological, ethical, economical, and social systems and processes. In the 2025 DX edition, we are particularly interested in model-driven and data-driven approaches (including deep learning and LLM-based algorithms) and submissions that combine and/or compare model- and data-driven approaches.\n\n## DX Competition (DXC’25)\n\nThe DX’25 organization committee is proud to announce that there will be a DXC’25 competition. The DXC’25 will feature challenges related to solving diagnosis problems in three application domains, where the participants may choose to tackle the challenges of one, two, or all three domains:\n\n*   A combustion engine\n*   A steam line system\n*   A liquid propulsion rocket engine\n\n## Doctoral Consortium\n\nAll PhD students working on relevant topics are encouraged to submit a description of their research to be considered for a special session focusing on mentoring their PhD research.\n\n## Encore Papers\n\nFor recent publications in journals and major conferences (e.g., AAAI, IJCAI, ECAI, ISSRE, ICSE, and KR) relevant to DX, we welcome the submission of extended abstracts related to the publication, which must also include a discussion of the connection to DX topics.\n\n## Resubmissions\n\nPapers from venues without archival proceedings (e.g., workshops, ArXiv, etc.) may be resubmitted to DX, but in addition to the requirements for the respective track (full/short/…), there are requirements specific to resubmissions that have to be adhered to.\n\n## Paper Length and Submissions\n\n*   Full papers are limited to 20 pages (including references and appendices) in the Dagstuhl Open Access Series in Informatics format.\n*   Short papers must be no longer than 14 pages.\n*   Doctoral Consortium submissions must be no longer than 16 pages.\n*   Papers describing DXC’25 challenge solutions may be submitted as long or short papers (14-20 pages).\n*   Extended abstracts corresponding to Encore Papers must be no longer than 6 pages.\n*   Industry-related submissions that do not fall into any other category are limited to 12 pages.\n\nAll papers must be submitted electronically via EasyChair as PDF files and must adhere to the submission guidelines as advertised on this conference website. The submissions will be peer-reviewed, and accepted papers will be scheduled for oral or poster presentations. While the authors are encouraged to state their preference in the presentation format at submission time, the decision is at the discretion of the conference chairs.\n\nBy submitting a paper, all authors agree that for each accepted paper, at least one of the authors will register for the conference and attend in person (attending the conference virtually is not acceptable). PhD candidates must attend the conference and present their accepted Doctoral Consortium entries. Please note that a registration accounts for one accepted paper only. Exceptions require the organizers’ consent, and for up to one additional paper, an additional fee will be applied to cover publication costs. Please note that the registration fees are not refundable.\n\nThe program committee reserves the right to reject without review submissions that exceed the page limits, violate the specified submission guidelines on the conference website, or are submitted in formats other than PDF. All submissions must be made through the conference EasyChair site.\n\n## DX Competition (DXC’25)\n\nThe DX’25 organization committee is proud to announce that there will be a DX competition, where the contestants can enter their solutions for addressing diagnosis problems in three benchmarks. The evaluations will be provided before the DX paper submission deadline, so that the contestants can incorporate their results into corresponding papers.\n\n*   The LiU-ICE benchmark covers some challenging problems of fault diagnosis of technical systems.\n*   The SLIDe (Steam Line Intrusion Detection) benchmark is devoted to evaluating diagnostic algorithms.\n*   The LUMEN (Liquid Upper stage demonstrator Engine) benchmark focuses on the fuel turbopump subsystem of the rocket engine.\n\nFor more information about the benchmark, we refer the interested reader to the [DXC’25 repository](https://vehsys.gitlab-pages.liu.se/dx25benchmarks/), where we offer detailed information about the challenges and also about how to enter the competition. Please note that the submission deadline will be April 21st (extended), and we aim to hold office hours where contestants may ask questions about the tracks periodically. Please do not hesitate to contact any of the individual benchmark chairs or the co-chairs for the competition to discuss questions that you might have about the competition. Feedback will be provided around May 1st, so that it can be integrated into your complementing paper submission to the DX conference (deadline May 8th). We would appreciate if you would reach out to us by April 1st about your interest in participating in the competition.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAoE (UTC-12h)\n\n*   **Submission open:** April 8, 2025\n*   **DX competition submission deadline (extended):** April 21, 2025\n*   **Submissions Deadline:** May 8, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notification:** June 10, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready:** July 1, 2025\n*   **Author registration deadline:** July 1, 2025\n*   **Final registration deadline:** August 1, 2025"
