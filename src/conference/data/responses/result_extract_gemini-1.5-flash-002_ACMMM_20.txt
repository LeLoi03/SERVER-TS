Our focus lies in promoting research that is inherently multimedia or multimodal in nature. While papers that involve unimedia/unimodal processing will not necessarily be rejected, papers that make multimedia/multimodal research contributions will be preferred for publication in the conference proceedings. Out-of-scope submissions may be desk-rejected.\n\n## Paper Format\n\nSubmitted papers (.pdf format) must use the ACM Article Template ([https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)).\n\n## Policy on Authorship and Generative AI Tools\n\nGenerative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work.\n\n## Length\n\nSubmitted papers may consist of up to 8 pages. Up to two additional pages may be added for references. The reference pages must only contain references. Overlength papers will be rejected without review. Optionally, you may upload supplementary material that complements your submission (50Mb limit).\n\n## Blinding\n\nPaper submissions must conform with the “double-blind” review policy. This means that the authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the names of the authors.\n\n## Originality\n\nPapers submitted to ACM Multimedia must be the original work of the authors. They may not be simultaneously under review elsewhere.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor any questions, please contact the Technical Program Chairs: [tpc@acmmm2025.org](mailto:tpc@acmmm2025.org)"
