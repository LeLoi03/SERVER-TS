  "Call for Papers": "# EuroS&P 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 10th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P 2025) will be held in **Venice, Italy, from June 30 to July 4, 2025**.\n\nEuroS&P is a premier forum for computer security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nWe solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security or privacy, as well as Systematization of Knowledge papers that systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning widely-held beliefs. Papers without a clear connection to security or privacy will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.\n\n### Anonymous Submission\n\nPapers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing their identity in the text. When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. Any source code or other material (e.g., data sets) which requires hosting must use anonymous services. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.\n\n### Page Limit and Formatting\n\nPapers shall not exceed 13 pages of body text, with unlimited additional pages for references and appendices.  Papers must be typeset in LaTeX in A4 format (not \"US Letter\") using the IEEE conference proceeding template. Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf).\n\n### Systematization of Knowledge Papers\n\nWe solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix \"SoK:\" in the title on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions, the emphasis will be on their value to the community.\n\n### Proactive Prevention of Harm\n\nWe expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out their research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to adequately discuss such potential harms within the body of the submission may result in rejection of a submission, regardless of its quality and scientific value.\n\n### Open Science Expectations\n\nOur expectation for Euro S&P is that researchers will maximize the scientific and community value of their work by making it as open as possible. All submissions must therefore include a clear statement on Data Availability (as a separate appendix which does not count towards the page limit) that explains how the artifacts needed to reproduce their work will be shared, or an explanation of why they will not be shared.\n\n### Plagiarism and Duplicate Submission\n\nAll submissions must be original work. Plagiarism (whether of others or self) will be grounds for rejection. Simultaneous submission of the same or substantially similar paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection.\n\n### Revision Option\n\nEuroS&P features the option to revise papers for which the program committee sees a path for revision that is likely to lead to acceptance. If authors who are invited to do so wish to submit a revised paper, they must do so within four weeks of the notification. Revised papers will be re-reviewed by the same reviewers who reviewed the original submission.\n\n### New in 2025: Per-Reviewer Responses\n\nEuroS&P 2025 will feature per-reviewer responses. Reviewers will be asked to provide a limited set of explicit questions that the response should focus on. Authors are then expected to solely focus on the questions as well as factual errors.\n\n### Returning from 2024: Meta Reviews\n\nEuroS&P 2025 will feature a publicly available meta-review for each accepted paper. This meta-review will outline the PCâ€™s main reasons for accepting the paper and may also contain limitations the PC identified.\n\n## Paper Awards\n\nOutstanding papers will be selected by the program committee for paper awards.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE = UTC-12h).\n\n*   **Research Papers**\n    *   Registration deadline (incl. topics and abstracts): October 21, 2024 (Monday)\n    *   Submission deadline: October 24, 2024 (Thursday)\n    *   Early rejection notification: December 11, 2024 (Wednesday)\n    *   R1 Rebuttal period: December 12 - 16, 2024 (Monday)\n    *   R2 Rebuttal period: January 20 - 23, 2025 (Monday to Thursday)\n    *   Author Notification: February 13, 2025 (Thursday)\n    *   Submission of revised papers: March 20, 2025 (Thursday)\n    *   Revision Decisions: April 3, 2025 (Thursday)\n    *   Camera-ready deadline: tentatively: April 17, 2025 (Thursday)\n*   **Conference:** Venice, Italy | June 30 - July 4, 2025\n\n## Conference Submission Server\n\nPapers must be submitted at [https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org](https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org) and may be updated at any time until the submission deadline expires."
