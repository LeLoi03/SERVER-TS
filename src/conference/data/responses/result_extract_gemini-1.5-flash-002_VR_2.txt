  "Call for Papers": "# IEEE VR 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 32nd IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces (IEEE VR 2025) will be held in **Saint-Malo, France, from March 8-12, 2025.**\n\nIEEE VR 2025 seeks original, high-quality papers in all areas related to virtual reality (VR), including augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and 3D user interfaces (3DUIs).\n\nThis year there is a single submission deadline for a unified review process for both the IEEE TVCG and the conference-only papers. The possible outcomes are:\n\n*   Accept as IEEE TVCG paper, with presentation at IEEE VR 2025\n*   Accept as IEEE VR 2025 conference paper, with presentation at IEEE VR 2025\n*   Accept as IEEE VR 2025 poster\n*   Reject\n\n## Important Dates\n\nEach deadline is 23:59:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth) == GMT/UTC-12:00 on the stated day, no matter where the submitter is located. The submission deadlines will be strictly enforced. Requests for extensions will not be honored.\n\n*   **September 11, 2024:** Abstracts due (REQUIRED)\n*   **September 18, 2024:** Submissions due\n*   **December 10, 2024:** Initial notifications\n*   **January 6, 2025:** Revised submissions due\n*   **January 13, 2025:** Final notifications\n*   **January 20, 2025:** Camera-ready materials due\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions will be accepted through Precision Conference Solutions:\n\n[https://new.precisionconference.com/vr25a](https://new.precisionconference.com/vr25a)\n\n**IMPORTANT:** IEEE VR 2025 uses a DOUBLE-BLIND review process. Failure to anonymize submissions will result in desk rejection.\n\nEach research paper should provide a contribution covering one or more of the following categories: methodological, technical, applications, and systems.\n\n*   Methodological papers\n*   Technical papers\n*   Application papers\n*   System papers\n\nEach paper should include an evaluation of its contributions, such as user studies, benchmarking, and/or comparison with existing systems/techniques/methods.\n\n**Submission Length:** We welcome paper submissions between 4 and 9 pages, not including references. Submissions may include an additional 2 pages of references. Supplementary materials should be provided in a separate file. Authors are encouraged to submit videos to aid the program committee in reviewing their submissions.\n\nAll paper submissions must be formatted using the IEEE Computer Society VGTC conference format ([https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/)). Accepted papers and posters will have to be formatted by the authors according to the relevant camera-ready guidelines.\n\n## Topics\n\nIEEE VR 2025 seeks contributions in VR/AR/MR and 3DUI including, but not limited to, the following topics:\n\n*   360° video\n*   3D and volumetric display and projection technology\n*   3D authoring\n*   3D user interfaces\n*   Accessibility of immersive interfaces\n*   Audio interfaces and rendering\n*   Collaborative interactions\n*   Computer graphics techniques\n*   Crowd simulation\n*   Cybersickness\n*   Diversity and gender issues\n*   Embodied agents, virtual humans and (self-)avatars\n*   Ethical issues\n*   Evaluation methods\n*   Haptic interfaces and rendering\n*   Human factors and ergonomics\n*   Immersive analytics and visualization\n*   Immersive applications and games\n*   Input devices\n*   Locomotion and navigation\n*   Mediated and diminished reality\n*   Mobile, desktop or hybrid 3DUIs\n*   Modeling and simulation\n*   Multi-user and distributed systems\n*   Multimodal capturing and reconstruction\n*   Multimodal/cross-modal interaction and perception\n*   Multisensory interfaces and rendering\n*   Perception and cognition\n*   Presence, body ownership, and agency\n*   Redirection\n*   Software architectures, toolkits, and engineering\n*   Teleoperation and telepresence\n*   Therapy and rehabilitation\n*   Touch, tangible and gesture interfaces\n*   Tracking\n*   User experience and usability\n*   XR technology infrastructure\n\n## Review Process\n\nThe review process will have two cycles:\n\n### Review Cycle I\n\nSubmissions will be assigned to two members of the VR 2025 International Program Committee (IPC): a coordinator (primary) and a secondary reviewer. Submissions that violate the submission guidelines or that receive low review scores from the coordinator and the secondary reviewer will be early rejected. This stage of the review process will be double-blind. We will strive to have all other submissions receive a total of at least three reviews.\n\n### Review Cycle II\n\nThe revision of each conditionally accepted paper will be reviewed by its coordinator, who will make a final recommendation regarding acceptance. Should the conditions for acceptance not be met, the paper will be rejected.\n\n## Additional Guidelines\n\n*   Abstract Submission\n*   Ethics and Responsibility\n*   Participant Diversity\n*   Review Duties for Authors\n*   Presentation at the Conference\n*   Submission Language\n*   Previous Publication and Plagiarism\n*   AI-generated Text\n*   Submission Anonymity\n*   Pre-dissemination through public online repositories\n*   Videos\n\n## Contacts\n\n**Technical Papers Chairs:**\n\n*   Daisuke Iwai, University of Osaka, Japan\n*   Luciana Nedel, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil\n*   Tabitha Peck, Davidson College, USA\n*   Voicu Popescu, Purdue University, USA"
