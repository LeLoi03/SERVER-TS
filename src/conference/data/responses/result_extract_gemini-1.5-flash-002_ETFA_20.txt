  "Call for Papers": "# ETFA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 30th IEEE International Conference on Emerging Technologies and Factory Automation (ETFA 2025) will be held in **Porto, Portugal, from September 9-12, 2025.**\n\nETFA 2025 is the flagship event of the IEEE IES Technical Committee on Factory Automation (TCFA) and a premier event sponsored by the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society.  It aims at bringing together the international community to present the latest research results, share new ideas and engineering breakthroughs, and discuss state-of-the-art challenges and future directions in technology and innovation in the broad domain of Automation with a focus on Industrial and Factory Automation.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\n*   Adaptive and Intelligent Control Systems\n*   Advanced Motion Control\n*   Autonomous Robotic Systems, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning\n*   Automotive Control and Transportation Systems\n*   Biomechatronics and Bioengineering Systems\n*   Compliant and Soft Robotics\n*   Haptics and Human-Robot Interaction\n*   Industry Applications, Information Technology, and Advanced Manufacturing\n*   Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and Nanotechnologies\n*   Network-based Control Systems and Applications\n*   Sensors and Actuators\n*   Smart Materials and Structures\n*   Visual Servo Systems, Machine Vision, and Image Processing\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Special Session Proposal Deadline:** February 13, 2025\n*   **Notifications for proposed Special Sessions:** February 21, 2025\n*   **Deadline for Workshop proposals:** February 28, 2025\n*   **Notifications for proposed Workshop:** March 14, 2025\n*   **Deadline for regular and SS papers submission:** April 18, 2025\n*   **Notifications for submitted papers:** May 23, 2025\n*   **Deadline for Work-in-Progress and Workshops papers submission:** May 30, 2025\n*   **Notifications for submitted WiP and Workshops papers:** June 20, 2025\n*   **Deadline for submitting final versions:** July 4, 2025\n\n## Manuscript Submission\n\n### Initial Author Instructions - Full Paper Preparation, Technical Tracks, Special Session and Workshop Papers\n\nAuthors are invited to submit full regular papers (6-8 pages) of their work, reporting original research using the online submission system. Regular papers are typically 6-8 pages long, and are anyway limited to a maximum of eight (8) pages. Submissions of papers shorter than 5 pages may be automatically rejected.\n\nThe author must submit the draft version of the paper for review before the due submission deadline. Authors of accepted papers must submit the final paper version according to the deadline, register for the conference, and attend to present their paper(s). The maximum length for final papers is 8 pages without exceptions.\n\nIEEE is strict about the requirements for PDF files for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. We strongly recommend using the set of templates in MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE. Please use them to create your paper, without modifying the style or format under any circumstances. A4 page size is preferred, and letter size can also be used.\n\nUse of the IEEE PDF eXpress service will only be required and made available for the final version of accepted papers. This service allows you to transform your document from text editor to PDF format, as well as checking the conformance of any PDF file to IEEE formatting rules. The number of attempts provided to each author is limited in number, so reserve its use for the final version of your paper. When using this service, the conference ID will need to be specified - the ETFA 2025 conference ID will be made public once the submission of final papers opens.\n\nPlease ensure that you submit only original work that has not been previously published or copyrighted.  The Conference will be using the CrossCheck automated screening system to verify the originality of papers. Submitted works may be compared to over 20 million articles in databases worldwide. Papers that violate IEEE's publication principles may be summarily rejected. If the violation is deemed severe, disciplinary actions may also be taken by IEEE.\n\n### Initial Author Instructions - Work-In-Progress Papers, Technical Tracks and Special Session Papers\n\nThe submissions in the Work in Progress papers category describe research that has not yet produced the results required for a regular paper, but that due to its novelty and potential impact deserves to be shared with the community at an early stage. These submissions need to follow the guidelines for the regular and special session but are limited to four (4) pages (total length including references).\n\nWiP contributors are expected to give a short presentation of their work and to prepare a poster for the discussion forum that will take place after the presentations. More specifically, each WiP paper shall be presented by one of the authors in a very short oral presentation of 3 minutes, without any ensuing discussion, in its respective session.\n\nAccepted and presented papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings and in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.\n\n## Submission System Instructions\n\nIn case you already have an account with the IEC submission system, you can submit a paper to ETFA2025 [here](https://confcomm.ieee-ies.org/app/general/conferences/ETFA25/initial-submission).\n\nWhen submitting papers in the submission system, please select the correct track:\n\n*   TT01 ... TT11 – technical tracks (regular papers)\n*   SS01 … SS12 – special sessions (regular papers)\n*   WS01, WS02, WS03 – workshops based on solicited papers (regular papers)\n*   WIP TT01 … WIP TT11 – technical tracks (work-in-progress papers)\n*   WIP SS01 … WIP SS12 – special sessions (work-in-progress papers)\n\nPapers are solicited for regular Technical Tracks and Special Session tracks both as Regular papers and Work in progress (WiP) papers. Workshops based on solicited papers are instead accepting only regular papers (no WiP submissions will be accepted).\n\n## General Chairs\n\nLuis Almeida, Marina Indri ([etfa2025@fe.up.pt](mailto:etfa2025@fe.up.pt))"
