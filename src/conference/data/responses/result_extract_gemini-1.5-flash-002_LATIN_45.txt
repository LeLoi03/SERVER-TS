  "Call for Papers": "# LATIN 2024: Call for Papers\n\nThe Latin American Theoretical Informatics Symposium (LATIN 2024) took place in **Puerto Varas, Chile, from March 18 to 22, 2024**.\n\n## Venue\n\nPuerto Varas is located in the South of Chile, in the Los Rios Region. It is known for the scenic views of Osorno Volcano and Lake Llanquihue, its location near popular tourist destinations like the Vicente Perez Rosales National Park, and its German colonial architecture. Puerto Varas is a popular destination for outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, and skiing.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission:** October 9, 2023\n*   **Author notification:** December 20, 2023\n*   **Camera-ready:** January 8, 2024\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions are limited to fifteen (15) single-column letter-size pages in Springer LNCS format ([http://www.springer.com/la/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](http://www.springer.com/la/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)). This page limit includes figures and references, but it does not include an optional appendix. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be placed in the appendix, which will be read by the program committee members at their discretion. In particular, appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paperâ€™s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.\n\nThe conference employs a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Papers should be submitted electronically via the EasyChair submission system at [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=latin2024](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=latin2024).\n\nSimultaneous submission of papers to any other conference with published proceedings, as well as the submission of previously published papers, is not allowed. Papers must be written in English. For each accepted paper, at least one author must register and attend the symposium (in person) to present it. Moreover, an author cannot register for multiple papers. That is, each accepted paper must have its own registrant."
