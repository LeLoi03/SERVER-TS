  "Call for Papers": "# ITCS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 16th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) conference will take place at **Columbia University from January 7 - January 10, 2025**.\n\nITCS seeks to promote research with innovative or bold agendas, which could be conceptual, technical, or methodological, and whose message will advance and inspire the greater theory community. The program committee welcomes papers introducing a new concept, model, or understanding; opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas; introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies, or new applications of known techniques; putting forth a bold, even if preliminary, vision or line of attack; or unearthing novel or surprising connections between different topics.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** September 3, 2024 (04:59 pm PDT)\n*   **Submission deadline:** September 5, 2024 (04:59 pm PDT)\n*   **Notification to authors:** November 2, 2024\n*   **Conference dates:** January 7-10, 2025\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nAuthors should register and submit their paper via the [hotcrp submission site](https://itcs2025.hotcrp.com/) by the above strict deadlines. The font size should be at least 11 point, and the paper should be single column. Beyond these, there are no formatting requirements. Authors are required to submit a COI declaration upon submission.\n\n## Review Process\n\nThe conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. (Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.)\n\n## Prior, Simultaneous, and Subsequent Submissions\n\nResults published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS. Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed. Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences.\n\n## Online Posting\n\nAuthors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the arXiv, the ECCC, or the Cryptology ePrint archive. It is generally expected that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers, with proofs, available before the conference begins.\n\n## Accepted Papers\n\nAll the talks are expected to be in person. The talks in the conference will not be recorded, and instead, the authors of each paper will be asked to upload a 20-25 minute talk, which will be posted online.\n\n## Graduating Bits\n\nParticipants near to graduation (on either side) will be given an opportunity to present (in 2-3 minutes) their results, research, plans, personality, and so on during the \"Graduating bits\" session. Details on how to participate will be provided closer to the conference date.\n\n## Awards\n\nThe committee may award a \"best student paper\" award.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nITCS is committed to an inclusive conference experience, respectful of all participants, and free from any discrimination or harassment.\n\n## Proceedings\n\nThe accepted papers will be published by LIPIcs in the electronic proceedings of the conference.\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Ittai Abraham, Intel\n*   Sepehr Assadi, University of Waterloo\n*   Andris Ambainis, University of Latvia\n*   Prabhanjan Ananth, University of California, Santa Barbara\n*   Srinivasan Arunachalam, IBM Research\n*   Hadley Black, University of California, San Diego\n*   Adam Bouland, Stanford University\n*   Eshan Chattopadhyay, Cornell University\n*   Lijie Chen, University of California, Berkeley\n*   Rishabh Goyal, University of Wisconsin-Madison\n*   Prahladh Harsha, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research\n*   Aayush Jain, Carnegie Mellon University\n*   Rahul Jain, National University of Singapore\n*   Michael Kapralov, École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne\n*   Robert Kleinberg, Cornell University\n*   Vasilis Kontonis, University of Texas at Austin\n*   Pravesh Kothari, Princeton University\n*   Ravi Kumar, Google Research\n*   Jason Li, Carnegie Mellon University\n*   Daniel Lokshtanov, University of California, Santa Barbara\n*   Pasin Manurangasi, Google Research\n*   Raghu Meka, UCLA (Chair)\n*   Dor Minzer, Massachussetts Institute of Technology\n*   Chinmay Nikhre, University of Washington, Seattle\n*   Shayan Oveis Gharan, University of Washington, Seattle\n*   Prasad Raghavendra, University of California, Berkeley\n*   Guy Rothblum, Apple\n*   Shubhangi Saraf, University of Toronto\n*   Sushant Sachdeva, University of Toronto\n*   Tselil Schramm, Stanford University\n*   Sahil Singla, Georgia Institute of Technology\n*   Srikanth Srinivasan, University of Copenhagen\n*   Avishay Tal, University of California, Berkeley\n*   Roei Tell, University of Toronto\n*   Christos Tzamos, University of Athens\n*   David Wajc, Technion\n*   Ryan Williams, Massachussetts Institute of Technology\n*   Jiapeng Zhang, University of Southern California"
