  "Call for Papers": "# ISNCC'25: Call for Papers\n\nThe 12th International Symposium on Networks, Computers and Communications (ISNCC'25) will be held in **Paris, France, from October 27 to 30, 2025.**  The conference is hosted by the **ESIEE PARIS - University Gustave Eiffel, France**, organized under the patronage of the **European Space Agency (ESA)** and technically sponsored by **IEEE** and the **IEEE Communications Society**.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nISNCC'25 covers theoretical and practical aspects related to Deep Space and Satellite Communications, Information Systems, Communication Networks, Computing Technologies, the future of the internet, the Internet of Things, Smart Cities, and Smart Factories.  The symposium has fifteen tracks. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n1.  Deep Space Exploration and Long-Distance Communication\n2.  5G exploitation and 6G Vision: State of Art and Key Technologies\n3.  Internet of Everything and Sensor Networks\n4.  Next-Generation Networking and Internet\n5.  Trust, Security and Privacy\n6.  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n7.  Data Science and Big Data Systems Engineering\n8.  Cloud Computing, Networking and Storage\n9.  Wireless and Mobile Communications & Networking\n10. Green Communication Systems and Networks\n11. Satellite Communications and Space Internet\n12. Antenna Systems, Propagation and RF Design\n13. Signal Processing and Communication Systems Theory\n14. Computer vision and Applications\n\n## PhD Students' Forum and Industrial Forum\n\nA separated Track called \"PhD Students' Forum\" provides an opportunity for research students to showcase their original yet incomplete ‘work-in-progress’. Also, an \"Industrial Forum\" is foreseen to give particular visibility and emphasis to applied research and industrial developments. For this track, preparing a full paper is not mandatory, but the same slot for presentation at the conference will be guaranteed.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n*   **Submission Deadline:** April 13, 2025\n*   **Authors' Notification:** August 17, 2025\n*   **Early Registration Deadline:** September 14, 2025\n*   **Late Registration Deadline:** September 28, 2025\n*   **Final Manuscript Due:** September 28, 2025\n\nSubmit your paper(s) via EDAS: [https://edas.info/N33590](https://edas.info/N33590)\n\nEach additional paper (2nd and onward) will be charged 50% of the full registration fee for the same author registrant.\n\n## Publication\n\nAccepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements."
