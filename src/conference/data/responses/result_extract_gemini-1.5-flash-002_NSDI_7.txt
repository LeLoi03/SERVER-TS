  "Call for Papers": "# NSDI '25: Call for Papers\n\nThe 22nd USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI '25) will be held on **April 28–30, 2025, in Philadelphia, PA, USA.**\n\nNSDI focuses on the design principles, implementation, and practical evaluation of networked and distributed systems. Our goal is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community to foster a broad approach to addressing overlapping research challenges.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nNSDI '25 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines: Spring and Fall. Any paper submitted to one of these deadlines and accepted during the subsequent reviewing period will be presented at the conference and will appear as part of the proceedings.  In the meantime, authors are permitted to advertise their papers as accepted by NSDI, for example, listing them on CVs.\n\n### Spring Deadline\n\n*   **Paper titles and abstracts due:** Tuesday, April 30, 2024, 11:59 pm US EDT\n*   **Full paper submissions due:** Tuesday, May 7, 2024, 11:59 pm US EDT\n*   **Notification to authors:** Wednesday, July 24, 2024\n*   **Final paper files due:** Tuesday, October 15, 2024\n\n### Fall Deadline\n\n*   **Paper titles and abstracts due:** Thursday, September 12, 2024, 11:59 pm US EDT\n*   **Full paper submissions due:** Thursday, September 19, 2024, 11:59 pm US EDT\n*   **Notification to authors:** Tuesday, December 10, 2024\n*   **Final paper files due:** Thursday, March 6, 2025\n\n## Overview\n\nNSDI provides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further the knowledge and understanding of the networked systems community as a whole, continue a significant research dialog, or push the architectural boundaries of network services.\n\n## Topics\n\nNSDI invites any innovative solution for a significant problem involving networked systems, including topics from within the following list:\n\n*   Highly available and reliable networked systems\n*   Security and privacy of networked systems\n*   Distributed storage, caching, and query processing systems\n*   Sustainable, low-energy, and low-carbon networked systems\n*   Cloud/multi-tenant systems\n*   Mobile and embedded/sensor applications and systems\n*   Systems aspects of networking hardware and physical layer communication technologies*\n*   Network and workload measurement systems\n*   Self-organizing, autonomous, and federated networked systems\n*   Managing, debugging, and diagnosing problems in networked systems\n*   Virtualization and resource management for networked systems\n*   Experience with deployed networked systems\n*   Networked systems for big data\n*   Testing and/or verification applied to networked systems\n*   Networked systems for machine learning (ML) and ML for networked systems\n\n*Physical and physical-sensing papers with no clear contributions to the design of systems or the networking stack will be considered out of scope.\n\n## Two Deadlines\n\nNSDI '25 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines. Any paper submitted to one of these deadlines and accepted during the subsequent reviewing period will be presented at the conference and will appear as part of the proceedings.\n\n## One-Shot Revision\n\nEach paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. Such a revision decision includes a summary of the paper's merits and a list of necessary changes that are required for the paper to be accepted at NSDI.\n\n## Policy on NSDI Resubmissions\n\nPapers rejected from one of these deadlines cannot be submitted to the immediate next deadline.\n\n## Extensions of Workshop Papers\n\nWork that extends an author's previous workshop paper is welcome, but the paper should (a) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation and (b) explain the differences between the NSDI submission and the prior workshop paper.\n\n## Resubmission of SIGCOMM '24 and HotNets '25 Papers\n\nAuthors are free to submit SIGCOMM '24 rejected papers to NSDI '25 spring and significant extensions of HotNets '25 accepted papers to NSDI '25 fall, provided that the notifications from these conferences occur before the full paper submission deadlines for NSDI.\n\n## Operational Systems Track\n\nNSDI '25 also solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with large-scale, operational systems and networks.\n\n## What to Submit\n\nNSDI '25 is double-blind, meaning that authors should make a good faith effort to anonymize papers. Note that the operational track papers have different rules as described above.\n\n## On the Use of Generative AI\n\nWhile we acknowledge that generative AI is seamlessly included in many editing packages, e.g., Grammarly, and thus often hard to detect, authors must not submit papers generated entirely by generative AI.\n\n## Policies\n\n*   Simultaneous submissions\n*   Extensions on workshop papers\n*   Update of August 27, 2024: Online technical reports\n\n## Conflicts\n\nAt submission time, you must provide information about conflicts with PC members.\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\nPapers describing experiments with users or user data should follow the basic principles of ethical research.\n\n## Processes for Accepted Papers\n\nIf your paper is accepted and you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa to attend the conference, please contact [conference@usenix.org](mailto:conference@usenix.org) as soon as possible.\n\n## Best Paper Awards\n\nAwards will be given for the best paper(s) at the conference.\n\n## Community Award\n\nTo encourage broader code and data sharing within the NSDI community, the conference will also present a \"Community Award\" for the best paper whose code and/or data set is made publicly available by the final paper deadline.\n\n## Submission Form\n\n[https://nsdi25fall.usenix.hotcrp.com/](https://nsdi25fall.usenix.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Program Co-Chairs\n\n*   Theophilus A. Benson, Carnegie Mellon University\n*   Radhika Niranjan Mysore, VMware Research Group"
