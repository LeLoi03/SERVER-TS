  "Call for Papers": "# SPIRE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 32nd International Symposium on String Processing and Information Retrieval (SPIRE 2025) will be held in **London, UK, from September 8-11, 2025**.\n\nSPIRE covers research in all aspects of string processing, information retrieval, computational biology, and related applications.\n\n## Scope\n\nSPIRE 2025 covers research in all aspects of string processing, information retrieval, computational biology, and related applications. Typical topics of interest include (but are not limited to):\n\n*   **String Processing:** string pattern matching, text indexing, data structures for string processing, text compression, compressed data structures, compressed string processing, text mining, 2D pattern matching, automata based string processing, combinatorics on words.\n*   **Computational Biology:** algorithms for DNA sequencing, assembly, alignments, read error correction, metagenomics, transcriptomics, gene and regulatory element recognition, motif finding, pangenomics, variants discovery, phylogenetics, genome rearrangements.\n*   **Information Retrieval:** Retrieval models and ranking. Theoretical models and foundations of IR. Efficiency and scalability topics in IR. Knowledge acquisition in IR. Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for IR. Knowledge representation and reasoning for IR. User-centric aspects of IR. IR Evaluation. Fairness, accountability, transparency in IR. Domain-specific IR applications. Web search.\n\n## Submissions\n\nSPIRE 2025 invites submissions in two categories:\n\n*   **Long papers:** Up to 12 pages, excluding references and optional appendices.\n*   **Short papers:** Up to 6 pages, excluding references and optional appendices.\n\nPapers should be submitted electronically via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spire2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=spire2025)\n\n## Publication\n\nThe proceedings of SPIRE 2025 will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. The use of LNCS templates is mandatory.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Papers deadline:** June 5, 2025 AoE (firm deadline)\n*   **Abstract deadline:** May 29, 2025 AoE\n*   **Notifications:** July 17, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready due:** TBC\n*   **Early bird registration:** TBC\n*   **SPIRE:** September 8 to 10, 2025\n*   **Workshop on Compression, Text, and Algorithms (WCTA):** September 11, 2025\n\n## General Chairs\n\n*   Golnaz Badkobeh, City St George’s, University of London, UK\n*   Ricardo Baeza-Yates, EAI, Northeastern University & University of Chile\n\n## Program Committee Chairs\n\n*   Golnaz Badkobeh, City St George’s, University of London, UK\n*   Jakub Radoszewski, University of Warsaw, Poland\n*   Nicola Tonellotto, University of Pisa, Italy"
