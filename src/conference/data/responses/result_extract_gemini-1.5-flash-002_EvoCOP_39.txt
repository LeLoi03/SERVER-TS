  "Call for Papers": "# EvoCOP 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 25th European Conference on Evolutionary Computation in Combinatorial Optimisation (EvoCOP 2025) will be held in **Trieste, Italy, from April 23-25, 2025**, as part of EvoStar.\n\nEvoCOP brings together researchers working on applications and theory of evolutionary computation methods and other metaheuristics for solving difficult combinatorial optimisation problems appearing in various industrial, economic, and scientific domains.\n\n## Areas of Interest\n\nEvoCOP welcomes submissions in all experimental and theoretical aspects of evolutionary computation and other metaheuristics to combinatorial optimization problems, including (but not limited to) the following areas:\n\n*   Applications of metaheuristics to combinatorial optimization problems\n*   Theoretical developments\n*   Neighbourhoods and efficient algorithms for searching them\n*   Variation operators for stochastic search methods\n*   Constraint-handling techniques\n*   Parallelisation and grid computing\n*   Search space and landscape analyses\n*   Comparisons between different (also exact) methods\n*   Automatic algorithm configuration and design\n\n### Prominent examples of metaheuristics include (but are not limited to):\n\n*   Evolutionary algorithms\n*   Estimation of distribution algorithms\n*   Swarm intelligence methods such as ant colony and particle swarm optimization\n*   Artificial immune systems\n*   Local search methods such as simulated annealing, tabu search, variable neighborhood search, iterated local search, scatter search and path relinking\n*   Hybrid methods such as memetic algorithms\n*   Matheuristics (hybrids of exact and heuristic methods)\n*   Hyper-heuristics and autonomous search\n*   Surrogate-model-based methods\n\n**Notice:** Continuous/numerical optimization is *not* part of the topics of interest of EvoCOP. Interested authors might consider submitting to other EvoStar conferences such as EvoApplications.\n\n## Submission Details\n\nAccepted papers will be published by Springer Nature in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Submissions must be original and not published elsewhere. They will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The reviewing process will be double-blind, so please omit information about the authors in the submitted paper. Submit your manuscript in Springer LNCS format.\n\n*   **Page limit:** 14 + unlimited references pages OR 6 + unlimited references pages\n*   If your paper has at most 6 pages of content (plus additional pages for references), then we consider it a short paper. If your paper has between 7 and 14 pages of content (plus additional pages for references), then we consider it as a full paper. In case of acceptance, a short paper will get a shorter time slot for presentation at EvoCOP than a full paper; exact durations are yet to be decided.\n\n## Submission Deadline\n\n**November 1, 2024 AoE** (extended to November 15, 2024 AoE)\n\nFollow [these instructions](https://www.evostar.org/2025/submit-paper/) to submit a paper.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **EvoApps Special Session Proposals:** September 8, 2024\n*   **Submission deadline:** November 15, 2024 AoE (extended)\n*   **Notification to authors:** January 10, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready submission:** January 24, 2025\n*   **Author's mandatory registration:** February 26, 2025\n*   **Early registration deadline:** March 19, 2025\n*   **Late-Breaking Abstracts submission deadline:** April 13, 2025\n*   **EvoStar Conference:** April 23-25, 2025\n\n## Conference Chairs\n\n*   Markus Wagner | Monash University, Australia | markus.wagner(at)monash.edu\n*   Martin Krejca | Ecole Polytechnique, France | martin.krejca(at)polytechnique.edu"
