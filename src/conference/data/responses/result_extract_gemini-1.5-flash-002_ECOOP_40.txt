  "Call for Papers": "# ECOOP 2025: Call for Papers\n\nECOOP 2025 will be held in **Bergen, Norway, from June 30 to July 4, 2025.**\n\nECOOP is Europe’s longest-standing annual Programming Languages conference, bringing together researchers, practitioners, and students to share their ideas and experiences in all topics related to programming languages, software development, systems and applications. ECOOP welcomes high-quality research papers relating to these fields in a broad sense.\n\n## Tracks\n\n*   Technical Papers\n*   Artifact Evaluation\n*   Colocated Events & Workshops\n*   Doctoral Symposium\n\n## Call for Papers: Technical Papers\n\nECOOP solicits innovative solutions to real problems as well as evaluations of existing solutions. Authors are asked to pick one of the following categories:\n\n*   Research\n*   Replication\n*   Experience\n*   Pearls/Brave New Ideas\n\n## Submissions\n\nSubmission must not have been published, or have major overlap with previous work.  Proceedings are published in open access by Dagstuhl LIPIcs in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs LaTeX-style template. To reduce friction when resubmitting, ACM’s PACMPL and TOPLAS formatted papers can be submitted as such (with the understanding that if accepted, they will be reformatted).\n\nECOOP uses double-anonymous reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must omit author names and institutions, and use the third person when referencing the authors’ own work.\n\nThere is no page limit on submissions, but authors must understand that reviewers have a fixed time budget for each paper, so the length of the feedback is likely to be unaffected by length. Brevity is a virtue. Authors also have to consider that the camera-ready version must be (at most) 25 pages in LIPIcs format (not including references).\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are AoE (UTC-12h).\n\n*   **Round 1 Submissions:** January 6, 2025\n*   **Nominations for the 2025 Dahl-Nygaard junior and senior prizes:** January 31, 2025\n*   **Round 1 Notification:** February 28, 2025\n*   **Round 1 Author response deadline:** February 17-19, 2025\n*   **Round 1 revision deadline:** March 19, 2025\n*   **Round 2 Submissions:** March 5, 2025\n*   **Round 2 Notification:** April 25, 2025\n*   **Round 2 Author response deadline:** April 8-10, 2025\n*   **Artifact Evaluation Artifact submission deadline (firm):** April 28, 2025\n*   **Early Registration:** May 28, 2025\n*   **Main conference:** June 30 - July 2, 2025\n*   **Workshops / Colocated Events:** July 3 - 4, 2025\n*   **Doctoral Symposium:** July 3, 2025\n*   **PLSS 2025:** July 4, 2025\n*   **VORTEX Workshop:** July 4, 2025\n*   **DEBT Workshop:** July 4, 2025\n*   **FTfJP Workshop:** July 3, 2025\n*   **GPCE Abstract Submission:** March 26, 2025\n*   **GPCE Paper Submission (Extended):** April 9, 2025\n*   **GPCE Review Notification:** May 9, 2025\n*   **GPCE Author Response:** May 12, 2025\n*   **GPCE Final Notification:** May 19, 2025\n*   **Artifact Evaluation Artifact kick-the-tires discussion:** May 5-6, 2025\n*   **Artifact Evaluation Artifact author notification:** May 19, 2025\n*   **Artifact Evaluation Artifact camera-ready submission (DARTS):** May 26, 2025\n*   **Doctoral Symposium Author notification:** May 15, 2025\n*   **Doctoral Symposium Camera-ready submission:** June 12, 2025\n*   **PLF+PLAID Author notification:** May 5, 2025\n*   **PLSS Author Notification:** May 16, 2025\n*   **VORTEX Author notification:** May 16, 2025\n*   **DEBT Author notification:** May 16, 2025\n*   **FTfJP Notification:** May 21, 2025\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://ecoop25.hotcrp.com](https://ecoop25.hotcrp.com)\n\n## Contact\n\nUse the [ECOOP Technical Papers contact form](https://2025.ecoop.org/contact2/ecoop-2025-technical-papers)."
