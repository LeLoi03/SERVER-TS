  "Call for Papers": "# NeurIPS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) will be held at the **San Diego Convention Center from December 2nd through 7th, 2025**.\n\nNeurIPS is an interdisciplinary conference that brings together researchers in machine learning, neuroscience, statistics, optimization, computer vision, natural language processing, life sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, and other adjacent fields.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper Submissions Open:** April 3, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Paper Abstract Submission Deadline:** May 11, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Full Paper Submission Deadline:** May 15, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth) (all authors must have an OpenReview profile when submitting)\n*   **Paper Supplemental Material Submission Deadline:** May 22, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Paper Author Notifications:** September 18, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Paper Camera Ready Deadline:** October 23, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Competition Proposal Submission Deadline:** April 13, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Competition Proposal Submission Notification:** May 11, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Datasets and Benchmarks - Abstract Submission Deadline:** May 11, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Datasets and Benchmarks - Full Paper Submission and Co-author Registration:** May 15, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Datasets and Benchmarks - Supplementary materials submission deadline:** May 22, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Datasets and Benchmarks - Author Notification:** September 18, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Datasets and Benchmarks - Camera ready:** October 23, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Expo Calls Open:** July 1, 2025 06:00 AM PDT*\n*   **Registration Open:** February 27, 2025 02:00 PM UTC\n*   **Early Registration Deadline:** October 11, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe invite submissions presenting new and original research on topics including but not limited to the following:\n\n*   Applications (e.g., vision, language, speech and audio, Creative AI)\n*   Deep learning (e.g., architectures, generative models, optimization for deep networks, foundation models, LLMs)\n*   Evaluation (e.g., methodology, meta studies, replicability and validity, human-in-the-loop)\n*   General machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, online, active, etc.)\n*   Infrastructure (e.g., libraries, improved implementation and scalability, distributed solutions)\n*   Machine learning for sciences (e.g., climate, health, life sciences, physics, social sciences)\n*   Neuroscience and cognitive science (e.g., neural coding, brain-computer interfaces)\n*   Optimization (e.g., convex and non-convex, stochastic, robust)\n*   Probabilistic methods (e.g., variational inference, causal inference, Gaussian processes)\n*   Reinforcement learning (e.g., decision and control, planning, hierarchical RL, robotics)\n*   Social and economic aspects of machine learning (e.g., fairness, interpretability, human-AI interaction, privacy, safety, strategic behavior)\n*   Theory (e.g., control theory, learning theory, algorithmic game theory)\n\n## Submission Site\n\nThe site will start accepting submissions on April 3, 2025.\n\nOur OpenReview portal is: [https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference)\n\n## Paper Formatting Instructions\n\nAll submissions must be in PDF format. The main text of a submitted paper is limited to nine content pages, including all figures and tables. Additional pages containing references, checklist, and the optional technical appendices do not count as content pages. If your submission is accepted, you will be allowed an additional content page for the camera-ready version.\n\nYou must format your submission using the [NeurIPS 2025 LaTeX style file](https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2025/Styles.zip).\n\n## Paper Checklist\n\nAuthors are required to complete a [paper checklist](https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist).\n\n## Technical Appendices and Supplementary Material\n\nTechnical appendices and supplementary material may be submitted with the paper submission before the full submission deadline, or as a separate PDF in the ZIP file below before the supplementary material deadline.\n\n## Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\nThe NeurIPS policy for use of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be found [here](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM).\n\n## Double-blind Reviewing\n\nAll submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. This policy applies to any supplementary or linked material as well, including code.\n\n## Ethics Review\n\nReviewers and ACs may flag submissions for [ethics review](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines).\n\n## Preprints\n\nThe existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other online repositories, personal websites, social media) will not result in rejection.\n\n## Dual Submissions\n\nSubmissions that are substantially similar to papers that the authors have previously published or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed venues with proceedings or journals may not be submitted to NeurIPS.\n\n## Anti-collusion\n\nNeurIPS does not tolerate any collusion whereby authors secretly cooperate with reviewers, ACs or SACs to obtain favorable reviews.\n\n## Author Responses\n\nAuthors will have one week to view and respond to initial reviews. Author responses may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy.\n\n## Publication of Accepted Submissions\n\nReviews, meta-reviews, and any discussion with the authors will be made public for accepted papers (but reviewer, area chair, and senior area chair identities will remain anonymous). Camera-ready papers will be due in advance of the conference.\n\n## Contemporaneous Work\n\nFor the purpose of the reviewing process, papers that appeared online after March 1st, 2025 will generally be considered \"contemporaneous\".\n\n## Other Tracks\n\nSimilarly to earlier years, we will host multiple tracks, such as datasets and benchmarks, competitions, tutorials as well as workshops, in addition to the main track for which this call for papers is intended.\n\n## Financial Aid\n\nEach paper may designate up to one (1) NeurIPS.cc account email address of a corresponding student author who confirms that they would need the support to attend the conference, and agrees to volunteer if they get selected."
