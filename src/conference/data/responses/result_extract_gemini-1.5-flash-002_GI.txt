  "Call for Papers": "# IEEE Global Internet (GI) Symposium 2024: Call for Papers\n\nThe 29th IEEE Global Internet (GI) Symposium 2024 will be held in **Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from November 27-29, 2024** in conjunction with the IEEE International Conference on Cloud Networking 2024.\n\nThe GI Symposium provides a top forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss advances in current and future internet and internet-related technologies. The focus is on experimental systems over the internet and the design of future global internet technologies, such as Information-Centric Networking (ICN), Software-Defined Networking (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV), network slicing, Artificial-Intelligence-based intelligent internet, industrial internet, and vehicular and drone networks, especially on a global internet scale. The GI symposium also has a special focus on measurements-related aspects, besides the emerging technologies.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Routing, switching and addressing\n*   Future Internet and next-generation network architectures\n*   Information-centric networking, Software-defined networking, and network function virtualization\n*   Wireless Internet and Internet technologies for 5G/6G\n*   Datacenter network architectures and performance\n*   Integration of in-network computation, cloud, and edge/fog computing\n*   Next-generation Internet applications in the cloud continuum\n*   Machine learning, data mining, and big data analytics for intelligent Internet\n*   Space-air-ground integrated network\n*   Quantum Internet and quantum networking\n*   Internet of Things, Machine-to-Machine, sensor, and vehicular/drone networks\n*   Industrial Internet and time-sensitive and deterministic networks\n*   Integrating blockchain with distributed Internet edges\n*   Energy-efficient green communications\n*   Geo-distributed applications, consistency, and latency challenges\n*   Content delivery and management\n*   Internet exchanges, remote peering, and peer-to-peer networks\n*   Internet structure and analysis\n*   Network-aware applications\n*   Real-world Measurements and deployments\n*   Distributed systems and novel distributed Internet applications\n*   Online social networking\n*   Internet measurement, modeling, and visualization\n*   Large-scale network operations, management, and performance monitoring\n*   Trust, security, privacy, and blockchain for the Internet\n*   Anomaly, intrusion, and attack detection\n*   Accountability, reliability, and resiliency for networks\n*   Economic aspects of the Internet and network neutrality\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nPapers must be no more than 6 pages (IEEE two-column format, 10 pt) in total, including references and figures, and follow the IEEE template. Submitted papers should be unpublished work and should not be under review in any other conference or journal. Papers must show author names and affiliations, and be submitted in PDF with all non-standard fonts embedded. Papers must be self-contained and written in English. Accepted papers will appear in the symposium proceedings published by IEEE and be submitted to IEEE Xplore Digital Library. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register and present the work in the symposium.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** September 30, 2024 (FIRM)\n*   **Acceptance notification:** October 16, 2024\n*   **Camera-ready submission:** October 21, 2024\n*   **Workshop date:** November 29, 2024"
