  "Call for Papers": "# EPIA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe EPIA Conference on Artificial Intelligence will take place from **October 1st to 3rd, 2025**, at the **University of Algarve, Faro, Portugal.**\n\nEPIA 2025 is organized around thematic tracks intended to foster an active exchange of ideas within specific sub-areas of AI. Prospective authors should select the thematic track most appropriate for their paper.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** May 23, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Notification of paper acceptance:** July 4, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready papers deadline:** July 14, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Conference:** October 1-3, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nPapers should be prepared according to the Springer LNAI format, using either a LaTeX or a Word template, with a maximum of 12 pages, including references.  However, authors should consider any track-specific details in their submission.\n\nEPIA 2025 will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for, has already been published in, or has already been accepted for publication in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. Authors of EPIA 2025 submissions are also not permitted to submit their paper to a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings during the EPIA 2025 review period.  These restrictions do not apply to workshops and similar specialized presentations without formally published proceedings.\n\nSubmitted papers will be subject to a double-blind review process and will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the respective thematic track program committee. It is the responsibility of the authors to remove names and affiliations from the submitted papers, and to take reasonable care to assure anonymity during the review process. Authors should also follow the standards as set out in the Springer Nature code of conduct ([https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct)).\n\nAll accepted papers will be published by Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, provided that at least one author is registered in EPIA2025 by the early registration deadline. Each accepted paper is required to be presented by one of the authors in a track session.\n\n## Thematic Tracks\n\n*   [AI and Creativity](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/tt-ai-and-creativity/)\n*   [AI for Architecture, Engineering and Conservation](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/tt-ai-for-architecture-engineering-and-conservation/)\n*   [Ambient Intelligence and Affective Environments (AmIA)](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/tt-ambient-intelligence-and-affective-environments/)\n*   [Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture (AIoTA)](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/artificial-intelligence-and-iot-in-agriculture-aiota/)\n*   [Artificial Intelligence and Law](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/tt-artificial-intelligence-and-law/)\n*   [Artificial Intelligence for Industry and Societies (AI4IS)](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/tt-artificial-intelligence-for-industry-and-societies-ai4is/)\n*   [Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM)](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/tt-artificial-intelligence-in-medicine-aim/)\n*   [Artificial Intelligence in Power and Energy Systems (AIPES)](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/tt-artificial-intelligence-in-power-and-energy-systems-aipes/)\n*   [Artificial Intelligence in Transportation Systems (AITS)](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/tt-artificial-intelligence-in-transportation-systems-aits/)\n*   [Ethics and Responsibility in AI](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/tt-ethics-and-responsibility-in-ai/)\n*   [Fuzzy Data Analysis and Applications](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/tt-fuzzy-data-analysis-and-applications/)\n*   [Generative AI – Foundations and Applications](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/tt-generative-ai-foundations-and-applications/)\n*   [Knowledge Discovery and Business Intelligence](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/tt-knowledge-discovery-and-business-intelligence/)\n*   [Knowledge Representation and Reasoning](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/tt-knowledge-representation-and-reasoning/)\n*   [Natural Language Processing, Text Mining and Applications (NLP-TeMA)](https://epia2025.ualg.pt/tt-natural-language-processing-text-mining-and-applications-nlp-tema/)\n\n## Contact\n\nFor questions, contact [epia2025@ualg.pt](mailto:epia2025@ualg.pt)."
