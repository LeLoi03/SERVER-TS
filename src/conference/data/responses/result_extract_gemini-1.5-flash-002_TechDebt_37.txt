  "Call for Papers": "# TechDebt 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 8th International Conference on Technical Debt (TechDebt 2025) will be held in **Ottawa, Ontario, Canada from April 27-28, 2025**, co-located with ICSE 2025.\n\nThe TechDebt conference series is the premier event to bring together leading software engineering researchers, practitioners, educators, and tool developers to discuss approaches for managing various types of Technical Debt (TD), to share experiences and best practices, and to identify key challenges for industry and academia.\n\n## Tracks\n\nTechDebt 2025 invites submissions to the following tracks:\n\n*   Industry Track\n*   Technical Papers\n*   Journal First\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n### Investigations on Specific Technical Debt Types\n\n*   Specific technical debt types (e.g., test debt, build debt, architectural debt)\n*   Less studied kinds of technical debt (e.g., requirement, documentation, security debt)\n*   Other types of debt (e.g., social debt, process debt)\n*   Debt in specific domains (e.g., AI-based systems, mobile applications)\n\n### Case Studies and Practical Experiences\n\n*   Case studies on successful and unsuccessful technical debt management practices\n*   Case studies on the remediation of technical debt in real-world projects\n*   Experiences from industry on managing and paying down technical debt\n*   Empirical evidence on the effectiveness of technical debt management tools and approaches\n\n### Tools and Approaches for Managing Technical Debt\n\n*   Tools, demos, and libraries to identify, assess, and manage technical debt\n*   Methods and frameworks for identifying, monitoring, and managing technical debt\n*   Decision frameworks for prioritizing debt items against features and other debts\n*   Estimation of technical debt principal and interest\n*   Quality assurance practices to minimize and address technical debt\n\n### Human and Organizational Factors\n\n*   Human factors in managing technical debt (e.g., team dynamics, communication challenges)\n*   Stakeholder perspectives and concerns about technical debt\n*   The impact of organizational culture and processes on technical debt accumulation and repayment\n\n### Emerging Trends in Technical Debt Research\n\n*   Use of artificial intelligence and machine learning for technical debt management\n*   Software visualization techniques for technical debt identification and monitoring\n*   New trends in technical debt for AI-driven systems and mobile applications\n*   The role of software economics in shaping technical debt decisions\n\n### Position and Vision Papers\n\n*   Position and vision papers offering novel perspectives on technical debt\n*   New conceptual frameworks and metrics to study technical debt and its evolution\n\n## Paper Categories\n\nWe invite submissions of papers to the Technical Track in any areas related to the theme and goal of the conference in the following categories:\n\n*   **Research Papers:** (up to 10 pages, plus 2 pages for references only) Innovative and significant original research in the field\n*   **Experience Papers:** (up to 10 pages, plus 2 pages for references only) Experiences, case studies, challenges, problems, and solutions gathered from industrial contexts.\n*   **Short Papers:** (up to 5 pages, plus 2 pages for references only) Early stages of research, new ideas, visions, and/or reflections; or technical debt-related tools.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\n*   Novelty\n*   Rigor\n*   Relevance\n*   Verifiability and Transparency\n*   Presentation\n\n## Junior Program Committee\n\nTechDebt 2025 proudly introduces a Junior Program Committee (Junior PC), which operates alongside the main program committee to enhance the review process and mentor the next generation of researchers.\n\n## Submission Process\n\nTechDebt 2025 uses a doubly anonymous reviewing model for the Technical Track. Papers must be submitted electronically via the TechDebtConf2025 HotCRP site: [https://techdebt2025.hotcrp.com](https://techdebt2025.hotcrp.com).\n\n## Open Science Policy\n\nOpenness in science is key to fostering progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. We strongly encourage authors to make data available upon submission (either privately or publicly) and especially upon acceptance (publicly).\n\n## Accepted Papers and Attendance Expectations\n\nAfter acceptance, the list of paper authors cannot be changed under any circumstances, and the list of authors on camera-ready papers must be identical to those on submitted papers. After acceptance, paper titles cannot be changed except by permission of the Program Co-Chairs, and only then when referees recommend a change for clarity or accuracy with paper content. If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to register for TechDebt 2025 and present the paper.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract deadline:** November 8, 2024\n*   **Paper deadline:** November 15, 2024\n*   **Author notification:** January 10, 2025\n*   **Camera ready deadline:** January 31, 2025\n\n## Mentoring Program\n\nAuthors can make use of the Mentoring Program to offer mentorship to help bring new researchers to the community and assist those who would like to improve their papers by getting independent advice to ensure that papers are consistent with the existing technical debt body of work, focus on critical open challenges, and are accessible to everyone. Check out the [Mentoring Program](https://conf.researchr.org/info/TechDebt-2025/mentoring-program) here.\n\n## Program Committee Co-Chairs\n\n*   Maria Teresa Baldassarre, University of Bari, Italy\n*   Roberto Verdecchia, University of Florence, Italy"
