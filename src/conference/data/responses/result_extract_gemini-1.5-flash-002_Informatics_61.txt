  "Call for Papers": "# IEEE ISI 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 2025 IEEE International Conference on Intelligence and Security Informatics (ISI 2025) will be held in **Hong Kong, China, from July 12-13, 2025.**\n\n## Overview\n\nIntelligence and security informatics (ISI) is an interdisciplinary field involving academic researchers and industry professionals. The IEEE ISI Conference aims to advance our understanding of the interrelationships between technology, humans, organizations, and security.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nISI 2025 invites submissions from academic researchers, IT professionals, security and analytics professionals, industry consultants, and practitioners. Research relevant to artificial intelligence security, LLM security, and human behavior in security contexts is strongly encouraged. All accepted papers will be included in the proceedings at IEEE Xplore.\n\n## Potential Topics\n\n*   **Artificial Intelligence Security:** Adversarial example methods, robustness defense research, malicious attack detection, transferability of machine learning, privacy-preserving machine learning, decentralized data processing, fairness evaluation metrics, AI applications in cybersecurity, intrusion detection, AI bias identification, generative AI governance, legal responsibility of AI systems, human-AI interaction security, etc.\n*   **LLM Security:** Adversarial prompt research, data privacy protection methods, bias detection metrics, fairness analysis methods, transparency in LLM-based decision making, ethical implications of LLM development, privacy leakage from training datasets, content moderation, security of fine-tuning LLM, misuse of LLM, human-LLM interaction risks, etc.\n*   **Security Analytics and Threat Intelligence:** Threat pattern models, real-time situational awareness, intrusion and cybersecurity threat detection, cyber-physical-social system security, computing and networking infrastructure protection, crime analysis, threat forecasting, surveillance, information security management standards, information systems security policies, mobile and cloud computing security, big data analytics for cybersecurity, machine learning for cybersecurity, transportation intelligence and security, etc.\n*   **Resilient Cyber Infrastructure Design and Protection:** Data science and analytics, data representation and fusion, criminal/intelligence information extraction, data sharing and information visualization, web-based intelligence monitoring, spatial-temporal data analysis, criminal/intelligence machine learning, cyber attack and/or bio-terrorism tracking, digital forensics, financial and accounting fraud analysis, consumer-generated content, social network analysis, authorship analysis, security-related analytical methodologies, etc.\n*   **Human Behavior and Factors in Security Applications:** Behavior issues in information systems security, HCI and user interfaces, social impacts of crime, measuring the effectiveness of security interventions, citizen and employee education and training, understanding user behavior, human behavior modeling, etc.\n*   **Organizational, National, and International Security Applications:** Best practices in security protection, information sharing policy and governance, privacy, security, and civil liberties issues, emergency response and management, disaster prevention, protection of transportation and communications infrastructure, communication and decision support, accounting and IT auditing, etc.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference.\n*   The expected length of the manuscript is 6 pages. A page charge needs to be paid if your final paper is over this page limit. A maximum of 2 additional pages is allowed, but at an extra cost per page.\n*   The submission format is PDF that follows IEEE publication format (see the template at [IEEE â€“ Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)).\n*   Papers should be submitted through the Papercept submission and review system: [https://its.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl](https://its.papercept.net/conferences/scripts/start.pl) (find ISI 2025 in the 2025 conference list).\n*   To upload the final manuscript, at least one of the authors listed on the paper must register for the conference.\n*   Each accepted paper must be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper must register the conference as an IEEE member before the early registration deadline.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission Open:** February 1, 2025\n*   **Submission Deadline:** March 31, 2025, 11:59 PM (Pacific Time)\n*   **Acceptance Notification:** May 1, 2025\n*   **Final Paper Deadline:** May 15, 2025\n*   **Early Registration Deadline:** May 15, 2025\n*   **Conference Dates:** July 12-13, 2025"
