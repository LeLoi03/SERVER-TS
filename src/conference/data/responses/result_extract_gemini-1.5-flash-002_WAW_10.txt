The workshop aims to further the understanding of networks that arise in theoretical as well as applied domains and to stimulate the development of high-performance and scalable algorithms that exploit these networks.",
  "Call for Papers": "# WAW 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 20th Workshop on Modelling and Mining Networks (WAW 2025) will be held at **Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania, from June 30 to July 3, 2025**.\n\nWAW 2025 invites original research papers and abstracts on all aspects of algorithmic and mathematical research in the areas pertaining to the graph and hypergraph theory and applications. We especially encourage submission of papers that espouse the view of complex data as networks.\n\n## Submission Areas\n\nSubmissions are invited in, but not limited to, the following areas:\n\n*   **Algorithms:** graph and hypergraph algorithms, clustering, collaborative filtering, routing optimization.\n*   **Analysis:** structural properties, visualization, patterns, communities, discovery, flow simulation.\n*   **Data Models:** graph and hypergraph models, evolution, trust and reputation networks.\n*   **Topics:** Web, social networks, transportation networks, economic interactions, communication networks, recommender networks, citation networks, Wikipedia, biological networks, blogs, p2p.\n*   **Applications:** web mining, social and business applications, routing & transportation, web search and ranking.\n*   **Theory:** properties of random graphs models that are used to model complex networks, higher-order structures, network geometry, temporal networks and dynamics, dynamic processes such as polarization, social learning, contagions.\n\n## Paper Submission\n\n*   Papers must be formatted according to Springer LNCS style.\n*   The maximum length of papers is 15 pages, but shorter papers are welcome.\n*   Acceptance of papers will be based on the reviews provided by the program committee members.\n*   The workshop proceedings will be published as a Springer LNCS volume.\n*   Talks associated with proceedings papers will be 30 minutes.\n\n## Abstract Submission\n\n*   Abstracts are a maximum of one page, may be in any style, and must be pdf files.\n*   They should include the title, speakers, and a summary of research.\n*   All abstracts related to the conference areas will be evaluated by the program committee.\n*   Accepted abstracts will be published on the conference website (but not published in the proceedings).\n*   Talks associated with abstracts will be 20 minutes.\n\nPapers must be submitted via [Easy Chair](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=waw2025). Abstracts should be sent via email (as attachment, PDF file) to [mindaugas.bloznelis@mif.vu.lt](mailto:mindaugas.bloznelis@mif.vu.lt). (Confirmation will be sent via e-mail; please do not submit abstracts via Easy Chair.)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Full paper submission:** February 1, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** March 1, 2025\n*   **Final version due:** April 1, 2025"
