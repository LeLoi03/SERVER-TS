  "callForPapers": "# PODS 2025: Call for Research Papers\n\nThe Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management. The 2025 conference will be held in **Berlin, Germany**.\n\n## Mission\n\nThe PODS community provides a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques, and solutions for data management challenges in our data-driven society. It develops new ways of advancing data management to reflect the rich landscape of data requirements in applications nowadays. Our goal is to develop solutions that ensure high levels of efficiency, scalability, usability, expressiveness, robustness, security, clarity, and privacy, among others. The PODS community is an open space where researchers from various areas related to the principles of computer science can discuss, interact, and propose solutions to problems in data management.\n\n## Scope\n\nPODS seeks scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application, and system building in the context of data management. Such articles might be based, among others, on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks, providing experimental work, or a rigorous analysis of important industry artifacts. PODS pays special attention to those papers that help in the urgent process of integrating data management techniques within broader computer science.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Database processing: Query evaluation, query optimization, schema management, distributed data processing, approximate data processing\n*   Database design: Data models, query languages, schemas, constraints\n*   Database access: Data structures, access methods, concurrency, transactions\n*   Data quality: Data consistency, data cleaning, data discovery, data exploration\n*   Data analysis: Data mining, machine learning, information extraction, data streams\n*   Uncertainty: Incomplete data, inconsistent data, probabilistic data\n*   Interoperability: Mappings and views, data integration, data exchange, ontology-based data access\n*   Responsible data management: Access control, privacy, security, verification, ethical aspects of data management\n*   Human-database interaction: data summarization, data visualization, explanation for database queries\n*   Connections between database principles and other disciplines\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025)\n\n## Submission Format\n\n*   The submission format for PODS 2025 is different from that of previous years, for compatibility with the PACMMOD format of the PODS publications.\n*   LaTex users must format their submission using the standard ACM \"acmsmall\" proceedings stylesheet: https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template\n*   They must use the following class declaration: \\documentclass[acmsmall,review,anonymous]{acmart}\n*   A submission can be up to **15 pages**, not including references, plus unlimited space for references.\n*   Papers that are longer than 15 pages or do not cohere with the required format style risk rejection without consideration of their merits.\n*   The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere.\n*   Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms and accepted papers will be published in a PODS 2025 issue of the PACMMOD (https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod) journal.\n*   PODS will apply a double-blind reviewing process.\n\n## Double-anonymous reviewing\n\n*   Author names and institutions must be omitted.\n*   References to the authorsâ€™ own related work should be in the third person.\n*   Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed.\n*   Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would.\n\n## Merit-based acceptance\n\nThe paper selection will be merit-based. The program committee will judge the work based on originality, quality, clarity of presentation, relevance to the field, and technical depth.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n### FIRST SUBMISSION PHASE:\n\n*   **Abstract:** May 31, 2024\n*   **Submission:** June 7, 2024\n*   **Rebuttal:** July 29 - August 1, 2024\n*   **Initial notification:** August 12, 2024\n*   **Revision submission:** August 26, 2024\n*   **Final notification:** September 2, 2024\n\n### SECOND SUBMISSION PHASE:\n\n*   **Abstract:** December 2, 2024\n*   **Submission:** December 9, 2024\n*   **Rebuttal:** February 3-7, 2025\n*   **Initial notification:** February 14, 2025\n*   **Revision submission:** February 28, 2025\n*   **Final notification:** March 7, 2025\n\nAll deadlines end at 5 PM Pacific Time.",
