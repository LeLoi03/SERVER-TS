  "Call for Papers": "# APLAS 2025: Call for Submissions\n\nThe 23rd Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems (APLAS 2025) will be held from **October 27-30, 2025 at the International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore (IIIT Bangalore) in Bengaluru, India.**\n\n## Scope\n\nWe solicit submissions in the form of regular research papers describing original scientific research results, including system development and case studies.  Solicited topics include:\n\n*   **Programming paradigms and styles:** functional, object-oriented, probabilistic, logic, constraint programming; extensible programming languages; programming languages for systems code; novel programming paradigms;\n*   **Methods and tools to specify and reason about programs and languages:** programming techniques; meta-programming; domain-specific languages; proof assistants; type systems; dependent types; program logics, static and dynamic program analysis; language-based security; model checking; testing;\n*   **Programming language foundations:** formal semantics; type theory; logical foundations; category theory; automata; effects; monads and comonads; recursion and corecursion; continuations and effect handlers; program verification; memory models; abstract interpretation;\n*   **Methods and tools for implementation:** compilers; program transformations; rewriting systems; partial evaluation; virtual machines; refactoring; intermediate languages; run-time environments; garbage collection and memory management; tracing; profiling; build systems; program synthesis;\n*   **Concurrency and distribution:** process algebras; concurrency theory; session types; parallel programming; service-oriented computing; distributed and mobile computing; actor-based languages; verification and testing of concurrent and distributed systems;\n*   **Applications and emerging topics:** programming languages and PL methods in education, security, privacy, database systems, computational biology, signal processing, graphics, human-computer interaction, computer-aided design, artificial intelligence and machine learning; case studies in program analysis and verification.\n\n## Submission Information\n\nSubmissions should not exceed 17 pages, excluding bibliography, in the Springer LNCS format. The LaTeX template is available at [Springer’s Information for Authors](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). The accepted papers will be allowed one extra page to accommodate reviewers’ feedback.\n\nAdditional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. However, the paper must be understandable without the appendix. Reviewers are not obligated to review it.\n\nSubmitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers must be written in English. Accepted papers must be presented at the conference.\n\n## Reviewing Process\n\nAPLAS uses a light double-blind reviewing process, with a rebuttal phase, to address factual errors and minor misunderstandings. Reviewers will not see author names until they submit a review. Therefore, the authors must:\n\n*   Omit your names and institutions\n*   Refer to your prior work in the third person\n*   Omit the acknowledgments\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission Deadline:** May 31, 2025\n*   **Author Response Period:** July 7 - 9, 2025\n*   **Acceptance Notification:** July 18, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready Deadline:** August 31, 2025\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://aplas25.hotcrp.com/](https://aplas25.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Alex Potanin (PC Chair), Australian National University, Australia\n*   Alexander Bakst, Certora, United States\n*   Swarnendu Biswas, IIT Kanpur, India\n*   Andreea Costea, TU Delft, Netherlands\n*   Meenakshi D'Souza, IIIT Bangalore, India\n*   Jeffrey S.
