  "Call for Papers": "# IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P) 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for presenting developments in computer security and electronic privacy since 1980. The 2025 Symposium will be held on **May 12-14, 2025**, with workshops on **May 15, 2025**, both at the **Hyatt Regency San Francisco** in **San Francisco, CA**.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nWe solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in any aspect of security or privacy. Papers may present advances in the theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and measurement of secure systems. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\n*   Applied cryptography\n*   Attacks with novel insights, techniques, or results\n*   Authentication, access control, and authorization\n*   Blockchains and distributed ledger security\n*   Cloud computing security\n*   Cyber physical systems security\n*   Distributed systems security\n*   Economics of security and privacy\n*   Embedded systems security\n*   Formal methods and verification\n*   Hardware security\n*   Hate, Harassment, and Online Abuse\n*   Human-centered security and privacy\n*   Intrusion detection and prevention\n*   Machine learning and computer security\n*   Malware and unwanted software\n*   Network security and measurement\n*   Operating systems security\n*   Privacy-enhancing technologies, anonymity, and censorship\n*   Program and binary analysis\n*   Protocol security\n*   Security and privacy metrics\n*   Security and privacy policies\n*   Security architectures\n*   Security for at-risk populations\n*   Software supply chain security\n*   Systems security\n*   User studies for security and privacy\n*   Web security and privacy\n*   Wireless and mobile security/privacy\n\n## Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers\n\nWe solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form.\n\n## Submission Deadlines & Decisions\n\nFor each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:\n\n*   **Accept:** Papers will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference.  Papers will immediately be published, open access, in the Computer Society’s Digital Library.\n*   **Reject:** Papers are declined for inclusion in the conference. Rejected papers must wait for one year from the date of original submission to resubmit to IEEE S&P.\n*   **Public Meta-Reviews:** All accepted papers will be published with a meta-review that lists: (a) the reasons the PC decided to accept the paper and (b) concerns the PC has with the paper. Authors will be given the option to write a response to the meta-review which will be published as part of the meta-review.\n\n## Symposium Event (Important Changes)\n\nEach accepted paper will have: (a) a short talk presentation and (b) a poster presentation immediately following the talk session containing the paper. All accepted papers are required to present both a short talk and a poster.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12).\n\n### First Deadline\n\n*   Paper submission deadline: June 6, 2024\n*   Early-reject notification: July 22, 2024\n*   Rebuttal period (interactive): August 19 - August 30, 2024\n*   Rebuttal text due: August 26, 2024\n*   Acceptance notification: September 9, 2024\n*   Camera-ready deadline: October 18, 2024\n\n### Second Deadline\n\n*   Paper submission deadline: November 14, 2024\n*   Early-reject notification: January 20, 2025\n*   Rebuttal period (interactive): February 17 - February 28, 2025\n*   Rebuttal text due: February 24, 2025\n*   Acceptance notification: March 10, 2025\n*   Camera-ready deadline: April 18, 2025\n\n## Resubmission of Rejected Papers\n\nRejected papers must wait one year before resubmission to IEEE S&P.\n\n## Instructions for Paper Submission\n\nAll submissions must be original work. Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection.\n\n## Anonymous Submission\n\nPapers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nDuring submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members.\n\n## Research Ethics Committee\n\nIEEE S&P 2025 has a research ethics committee (REC) that will check papers flagged by reviewers as potentially including ethically fraught research.\n\n## Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure\n\nWhere research identifies a vulnerability, we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users.\n\n## Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research\n\nSubmissions that describe experiments that could be viewed as involving human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:\n\n*   Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable.\n*   Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect.\n\n## Financial and Non-financial Competing Interests\n\nIn the interests of transparency, the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy requires authors and PC members to declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in relation to the work described.\n\n## Page Limit and Formatting\n\nSubmitted papers may include up to 13 pages of text and up to 5 pages for references and appendices, totaling no more than 18 pages. Papers must be formatted for US letter (not A4) size paper. All submissions must use the IEEE “compsoc” conference proceedings template.\n\n## Withdrawing Policy\n\nA paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper cannot be withdrawn.\n\n## Authorship Policy\n\nChanges to the authorship list (adding or removing authors) are not permitted after paper submission. Changes to the authors’ affiliation after paper acceptance are not permitted without PC chairs’ approval.\n\n## Conference Submission Server\n\n*   First deadline: [https://cycle1.sp2025.ieee-security.org/](https://cycle1.sp2025.ieee-security.org/)\n*   Second deadline: [https://cycle2.sp2025.ieee-security.org/](https://cycle2.sp2025.ieee-security.org/)\n\n## Publication and Presentation\n\nAuthors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication clearances. One of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference.\n\n## Program Committee Chairs\n\n*   William Enck | North Carolina State University\n*   Cristina Nita-Rotaru | Northeastern University\n\n## REC Chairs\n\n*   René Mayrhofer | Johannes Kepler University Linz\n*   Blase Ur | University of Chicago"
