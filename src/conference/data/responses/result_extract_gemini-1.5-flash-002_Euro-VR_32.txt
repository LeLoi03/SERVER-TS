  "Summary": "The Driving Simulation Conference Europe 2025 XR will be held in Stuttgart, Germany, from September 24-26, 2025. This conference gathers driving simulation specialists from the industrial and academic communities as well as commercial simulation providers.  The exhibition is coming back towards more than 40 professional exhibitors and up to 400 on site participants. With about 80 speakers in scientific and industrial product solution sessions, keynotes, tutorials and round tables, you will get the latest trends in XIL (MIL, SIL, HIL, DIL, VIL, CIL) and XR simulation for ADAS, automotive HMI and driving simulation design, motion sickness and rendering, as well as connected and autonomous vehicle verification and validation.",
  "Call for Papers": "# DSC 2025 Europe XR: Call for Scientific Papers\n\nThe Driving Simulation Conference Europe 2025 XR will be held from **September 24th to 26th, 2025 in Stuttgart, Germany**.\n\nThis conference gathers driving simulation specialists from the industrial and academic communities as well as commercial simulation providers. The exhibition is coming back towards more than 40 professional exhibitors and up to 400 on-site participants.\n\n## Topics\n\nTopics will include the state of the art in driving simulation technology, research, and developments, extended with progressively merging virtual reality (VR) developments. This year's program will also give an enlarged place for simulation tools for autonomous and connected vehicles along with advanced driving assistance system (ADAS) applications. Human factors and motion rendering will remain a traditional axis of the conference.\n\n## Tracks\n\nYou can submit your abstract in one of the following tracks:\n\n*   Perception and Human Factors\n*   Motion Cueing and Control\n*   Simulation Design and Architecture\n*   Product Solution & Poster\n*   Virtual Prototyping\n*   Scenario Modeling and Authoring Tools\n*   Train, drone, boat and flight simulators\n*   Training and Validation\n*   Virtual Reality for Driving Simulation\n*   ADAS, Autonomous & Connected Vehicles\n*   AI & High-Performance Computing\n*   Connected Objects (IoT) in Driving Simulation\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Call for Papers:** October 1, 2024\n*   **Abstract submission deadline for scientific paper and poster:** December 31, 2024\n*   **Abstract acceptance notification for scientific papers and poster:** February 15, 2025\n*   **Full-length scientific paper and poster abstract submission deadline:** April 15, 2025\n*   **Product solution paper submission deadline:** April 15, 2025\n*   **Registration for DSC 2025 opens:** May 1, 2025\n*   **Preliminary program online:** May 15, 2025\n*   **Final acceptance notification:** June 1, 2025\n*   **Final scientific and product solution papers due:** July 15, 2025\n*   **Final poster and poster abstract due:** July 15, 2025\n*   **Early bird registration deadline:** July 31, 2025\n*   **Final paper presentations (.ppt) due:** August 31, 2025\n*   **DSC 2025 Europe XR:** September 24-26, 2025\n\n## Download Call for Papers\n\n[Download here the DSC 2025 Call for Scientific Papers](https://dsc2025.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DSC2025_Call-for-Papers.pdf)"
