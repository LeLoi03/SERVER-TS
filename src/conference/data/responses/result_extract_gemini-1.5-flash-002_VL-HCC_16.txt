  "Call for Papers": "# VL/HCC 2025: Call for Research Papers\n\nThe IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC 2025) will take place from **October 6-10, 2025, in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA** at the **Duke Energy Hall: James B. Hunt Jr. Library at North Carolina State University**.\n\n## Scope and Topics\n\nWe solicit original, unpublished research papers on computing technologies for modeling, programming, communicating, and reasoning, which are easier to learn, use, or understand by humans than the current state-of-the-art. Papers should focus on efforts to design, formalize, implement, or evaluate those technologies and languages.  Empirical papers that validate current proposed solutions with rigorous scientific means (i.e., empirical studies, controlled experiments, rigorous case studies, etc.) are also welcome.\n\nAreas of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Visual languages\n*   Human aspects and psychology of software development and language design\n*   End-user development, adaptation and programming\n*   Representations for computation\n*   Model-driven development\n*   Debugging, program comprehension, code review\n*   Explainable ML/AI\n*   Human-Centric AI-based tools\n*   Low-Code/No-Code paradigm\n*   Education and Computational thinking\n\n### Special Emphasis for 2025: Human-AI Collaboration\n\nWe seek research that highlights the situations in which human-AI interactions enhance, or degrade, the human experience in computing. Papers describing positive, negative, and unclear impacts are all welcome.\n\n## Paper Submissions\n\nWe invite two kinds of papers:\n\n*   Full-length papers (up to 10 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements)\n*   Short papers (up to 5 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements)\n\nAll accepted papers, whether full or short, should be complete, self-contained, archival contributions. Papers do not have to reach the maximum page limit, but they should be of an appropriate length for the content.\n\nPapers could be research findings, industry experience reports, replication studies, or vision papers. Please select the appropriate page length for the content of your paper. Papers must be submitted using the IEEE two-column conference paper format. Be sure to use the current IEEE conference paper format (which was updated in 2019), and to select the “US letter” template.\n\n## Submission Process\n\nPapers should be submitted via the EasyChair system: [https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vlhcc2025](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vlhcc2025)\n\nTo facilitate the assigning of papers to reviewers, authors should submit paper abstracts via EasyChair at least 1 week prior to the paper submission deadline (see Important Dates below). The abstract must be no longer than 250 words.\n\nAll submissions will be reviewed by members of the Program Committee in a double-anonymous review process. Authors will then receive the reviews for their submissions and will be able to answer them in a rebuttal phase. Only after this step will the PC make a final decision about the acceptance of the submissions.\n\nAt least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for VL/HCC 2025 and present the paper at the conference. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference, including IEEE Xplore Digital Library, if the paper is not presented by the author at the conference.\n\n## Publication\n\nThe proceedings of IEEE VL/HCC are published in digital form by the IEEE Computer Science Society and archived in the IEEE Digital Library with an official ISBN number. Accepted papers will be available to conference attendees via the IEEE Open Preview program in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are AoE (UTC-12h)\n\n*   **Abstracts only:** May 9, 2025\n*   **Submission deadline:** May 16, 2025\n*   **Rebuttal phase:** June 30 - July 3, 2025\n*   **Notification:** July 18, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready:** August 8, 2025\n*   **Conference:** October 6-10, 2025\n\n## Contact\n\n*   Emerson Murphy-Hill (Microsoft, USA, [captain.emerson@gmail.com](mailto:captain.emerson@gmail.com))\n*   Katie Stolee (North Carolina State University, USA, [ktstolee@ncsu.edu](mailto:ktstolee@ncsu.edu))"
