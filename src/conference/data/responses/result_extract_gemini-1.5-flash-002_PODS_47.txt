  "Summary": "The annual ACM SIGMOD/PODS Conference is a leading international forum for database researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences. The 2025 conference will be held in Berlin, Germany, on June 22 - 27, 2025.",
  "Call for Papers": "# PODS 2025: Call for Research Papers\n\nThe Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management.\n\nThe 2025 conference will be held in **Berlin, Germany**.\n\n## Mission\n\nThe PODS community aims to provide a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques, and solutions for the data management challenges that continually arise in our data-driven society. It develops new ways of advancing data management to reflect the rich landscape of data requirements in applications nowadays. Our goal is to develop solutions that ensure high levels of efficiency, scalability, usability, expressiveness, robustness, security, clarity, and privacy, among others.\n\n## Scope\n\nPODS seeks scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application, and system building in the context of data management. Such articles might be based, among others, on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks that deserve further exploration, providing experimental work that sheds light on the scientific foundations of the discipline, or a rigorous analysis of important industry artifacts.\n\n## Topics\n\nTopics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Database processing\n*   Database design\n*   Database access\n*   Data quality\n*   Data analysis\n*   Uncertainty\n*   Interoperability\n*   Responsible data management\n*   Human-database interaction\n*   Connections between database principles and other disciplines\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025)\n\n## Submission Format\n\n**Important:** The submission format for PODS 2025 is different from that of previous years, for compatibility with the PACMMOD format of the PODS publications.\n\nLaTeX users must format their submission using the standard ACM \"acmsmall\" proceedings stylesheet: [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)\n\nThey must use the following class declaration: `\\documentclass[acmsmall,review,anonymous]{acmart}`\n\nA submission can be up to 15 pages, not including references, plus unlimited space for references. Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, of unlimited length, that should be incorporated at submission time; online appendices are not allowed. However, an appendix will be read at the discretion of the program committee. Papers that are longer than 15 pages or do not cohere with the required format style risk rejection without consideration of their merits. The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere, including the formal proceedings of other symposia or workshops.\n\n## Double-anonymous reviewing\n\nPODS 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous reviewing process. This means that submissions must adhere to the following:\n\n*   Author names and institutions must be omitted.\n*   References to the authorsâ€™ own related work should be in the third person.\n*   Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n**FIRST SUBMISSION PHASE (All Deadlines are 5 PM Pacific Time):**\n\n*   Abstract: May 31, 2024\n*   Submission: June 7, 2024\n*   Rebuttal: July 29 - August 1, 2024\n*   Initial notification: August 12, 2024\n*   Revision submission: August 26, 2024\n*   Final notification: September 2, 2024\n\n**SECOND SUBMISSION PHASE (All Deadlines are 5 PM Pacific Time):**\n\n*   Abstract: December 2, 2024\n*   Submission: December 9, 2024\n*   Rebuttal: February 3-7, 2025\n*   Initial notification: February 14, 2025\n*   Revision submission: February 28, 2025\n*   Final notification: March 7, 2025"
