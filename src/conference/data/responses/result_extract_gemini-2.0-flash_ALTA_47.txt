  "Call for Papers": "# ALTA 2024: Call for Papers\n\nThe 22nd Annual Workshop of the Australasian Language Technology Association (ALTA) will be held in a hybrid format at the Australian National University, Canberra, from December 2 to 4, 2024.\n\nThe hybrid format gives participants a valuable opportunity to attend either in-person or online.\n\n## Topics\n\nALTA invites the submission of papers and presentations on all aspects of NLP and CL, including, but not limited to:\n\n*   Commonsense Reasoning\n*   Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics\n*   Dialogue and Interactive Systems\n*   Discourse and Pragmatics\n*   Efficient Methods for NLP\n*   Ethics in NLP\n*   Information Extraction\n*   Information Retrieval and Text Mining\n*   Interpretability, Interactivity and Analysis of Models for NLP\n*   Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond\n*   Language Modeling and Analysis of Language Models\n*   Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics\n*   Machine Learning for NLP\n*   Machine Translation\n*   Multilinguality and Linguistic Diversity\n*   Natural Language Generation\n*   NLP Applications\n*   Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation\n*   Question Answering\n*   Resources and Evaluation\n*   Semantics: Lexical, Sentence level, Document Level, Textual Inference, etc.\n*   Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining\n*   Speech and Multimodality\n*   Summarisation\n*   Syntax, Parsing and their Applications\n\n## Submission Format\n\nWe invite submissions of three different formats:\n\n1.  Original Research Papers\n2.  Abstract-based Presentations\n3.  Industry Demonstrations\n\n### (1) Original Research Papers\n\nWe invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of NLP and CL.\n\n*   Long papers should be 7-8 pages\n*   Short papers should be 3-4 pages.\n*   Both short and long papers may include unlimited pages of references.\n\nAccepted papers will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site.\n\n*   Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly, submitted papers should not include the identity of the author(s).\n*   Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.\n\n### (2) Abstract-based Presentations\n\nTo encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialization of international results, we invite 1-2 page presentation abstracts. The organizers may offer the opportunity to give an oral or poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site.\n\nSubmissions should include the presentation title and abstract, the name of the presenter, any publications relating to the work, and any information on collaboration with the local ALTA community.\n\nAbstracts will not be published in the proceedings but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent, and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged.\n\n### (3) Industry Demonstrations\n\nTo encourage industry participation and networking opportunities, we are thrilled to announce a track for industry demonstrations, which provides an exciting opportunity for industry researchers to showcase their NLP applications. You should submit a proposal that is 1-2 pages long, containing (1) a description of the software, tools or applications that will be presented and how NLP techniques are used to address a specific problem and (2) a brief introduction of your organization. The proposals will be reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to select demonstrations that best align with the interests of the ALTA community.\n\n## Multiple Submission Policy\n\nOriginal research papers under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We require that you declare at submission that your paper has been submitted to another venue and identify the venue.\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nAuthors should [submit their papers via OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ALTA.asn.au/2024/Workshop) using the ‘‘ALTA 2024 Workshop Submission’’ button.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Call for Problems for the ALTA 2024 Shared Task closes:** Friday, June 7, 2024\n*   **Submission deadline for short/long papers, presentation abstracts and industry demonstrations:** September 27, 2024 (23:59 Anywhere On Earth UTC-12)\n*   **Author notification:** November 6, 2024\n*   **Camera-ready deadline:** November 12, 2024 (23:59 Anywhere On Earth UTC-12)\n*   **Proceedings ready:** Saturday, November 30, 2024\n*   **Conference (Tutorial):** Monday, December 2, 2024\n*   **Main conference:** 3 December and 4 December 2024"
