  "Call for Papers": "# INLG 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 18th International Natural Language Generation Conference (INLG 2025) will be held from **October 29 to November 2, 2025**, at the **Vietnam Institute for Advanced Study in Mathematics in Hanoi, Vietnam**.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nINLG 2025 solicits papers on any topic related to NLG. General topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Large Language Models (LLMs) for NLG\n*   Evaluation and error analysis of NLG systems\n*   Explainability and Trustworthiness of NLG systems\n*   Generalizability of NLG systems\n*   Bias and fairness in NLG systems\n*   Thinking models for NLG\n*   Affect/emotion generation\n*   Analysis and detection of automatically generated text\n*   Cognitive modeling of language production\n*   Computational efficiency of NLG models\n*   Content and text planning\n*   Corpora and resources for NLG\n*   Ethical considerations of NLG\n*   Grounded language generation\n*   Lexicalisation\n*   Multimedia and multimodality in generation\n*   Natural language understanding techniques for NLG\n*   NLG and accessibility\n*   NLG in speech synthesis and spoken language models\n*   NLG in dialogue systems and chatbots\n*   NLG for human-robot interaction\n*   NLG for low-resourced languages\n*   NLG for real-world applications\n*   Paraphrasing, summarization, and translation\n*   Personalisation and variation in text\n*   Referring expression generation\n*   Storytelling and narrative generation\n*   Surface realization\n*   System architectures\n\n## Submission Types\n\nThree kinds of papers can be submitted:\n\n*   **Long papers:** (up to 8 pages of content, plus unlimited pages of ethical considerations, supplementary material statements, and references. The final versions will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages))\n*   **Short papers:** (up to 4 pages, plus unlimited pages of ethical considerations, supplementary material statements, and references. The final versions will be given one additional page of content (up to 5 pages))\n*   **Demo papers:** (no more than 2 pages, including references. Authors must be willing to present a demo of their system during INLG 2025)\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions should follow [ACL Author Guidelines](https://www.aclweb.org/adminwiki/index.php?title=ACL_Author_Guidelines) and policies for submission, review, and citation, and be anonymized for double-blind reviewing.

If your work raises any ethical issues, you should include an explicit discussion of those issues.  You may find [this checklist](https://aclrollingreview.org/responsibleNLPresearch/) of use.\n\nAuthors are strongly encouraged to ensure that their work is reproducible; see, e.g., [this reproducibility checklist](https://2021.aclweb.org/calls/reproducibility-checklist/). Papers involving any kind of experimental results (human judgments, system outputs, etc.) should incorporate a data availability statement into their paper.\n\n## Submission Procedure\n\nTo submit a long or short paper to INLG 2025, authors can either submit directly or commit a paper previously reviewed by ARR via the [same paper submission site](https://softconf.com/p/inlg2025/).\n\n*   **Direct submissions:** Deadline July 14, 2025, 11:59:59 AOE\n*   **Committing an ARR paper:** Deadline August 7, 2025, 11:59:59 AOE. Last eligible ARR paper submission deadline for INLG 2025 is May 19, 2025.\n\nDemo papers should be submitted directly through the INLG 2025 paper submission site by July 24, 2025, 11:59:59 PM AOE.\n\n## Awards\n\nINLG 2025 will present several awards to recognize outstanding achievements in the field:\n\n*   Best Long Paper Award\n*   Best Short Paper Award\n*   Best Demo Paper Award\n*   Best Evaluation Award\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12)\n\n*   START system regular paper submission deadline: July 14, 2025\n*   ARR commitment to INLG deadline via START system: August 7, 2025\n*   START system demo paper submission deadline: July 24, 2025\n*   Notification: August 21, 2025\n*   Camera ready: September 15, 2025\n*   Conference: October 29 - November 2, 2025"
