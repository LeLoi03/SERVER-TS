  "Summary": "MobiCom 2025 is the thirty-first in a series of annual conferences sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE dedicated to addressing the challenges in the areas of mobile computing and wireless and mobile networking. The MobiCom conference series serves as a highly selective, premier international forum addressing networks, systems, algorithms, and applications that support mobile computers and wireless networks.",
  "Call for Papers": "# MobiCom 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design, and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems, and applications.\n\n## MobiCom 2025 Emphasis\n\nMobiCom 2025 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work.\n\n## Special Category: Challenge, Experience, and Verification Papers\n\nMobiCom 2025 will have a separate category for challenge, experience, and verification papers. These are full papers that provide detailed technical insights from real-world deployments, especially in settings that are not easy for most in the community to duplicate (e.g., due to scale).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Summer Deadlines**\n    *   Abstract Registration: August 29, 2024 23:59 AoE\n    *   Paper Submission: September 5, 2024 23:59 AoE\n    *   Early Notification: October 25, 2024\n    *   Final Notifications: December 10, 2024\n*   **Winter Deadlines**\n    *   Abstract Registration: March 11, 2025 23:59 AoE\n    *   Paper Submission: March 18, 2025 23:59 AoE\n    *   Early Notification: May 10, 2025\n    *   Final Notifications: June 24, 2025\n\n## Topics\n\nWe invite submissions on a wide range of mobile computing, mobile systems, mobile applications, and wireless networking research, including but not limited to the following:\n\n*   Edge and cloud computing\n*   Embedded and energy-harvesting systems\n*   Backscatter communication and wireless power\n*   Implantable and wearable computing\n*   Millimeter-wave and terahertz communications\n*   Mobile health\n*   Applications of machine learning (on-device ML, federated/decentralized ML) to mobile/wireless research\n*   Transfer learning and domain adaptation for mobile applications\n*   Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI for mobile and wireless systems\n*   Next generation of mobile networks (5G, 6G and beyond)\n*   Mobile web, video, virtual reality, augmented reality and other applications\n*   Novel applications of wireless signals\n*   Practical quantum applications and systems (quantum sensing, quantum programming, quantum machine learning, etc.)\n*   Vehicular, robotic and drone-based networking\n*   Communication with reconfigurable and intelligent reflective surfaces, meta materials, and flexible surfaces\n*   Satellite networks and integrated satellite-terrestrial networks\n*   Security and privacy issues/solutions for mobile/wireless systems\n*   Sensing with radio, light, sound, and acoustics\n*   Smart cities and smart spaces (e.g. smart factories, smart workspace, smart agriculture, urban mobility)\n*   Ubiquitous computing and mobile human-computer interaction\n*   Underwater networking and sensing\n*   Visible light communications\n*   Wireless localization and tracking\n*   Reducing carbon footprint of wireless networks and mobile devices\n\n## Two Deadlines, Early Notification, and One-shot Revision\n\nMobiCom 2025 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nAll paper submissions will be handled electronically at the [MobiCom 2025 paper submission website](https://mobicom25.hotcrp.com/).\n\n## Submission Policy\n\nIn addition to the formatting requirements, all authors are expected to make sure that their paper complies with the following submission policies:\n\n*   Previous Publications\n*   No Simultaneous Submissions\n*   Double-blind Submissions\n*   Conflict of Interest (CoI)\n*   Previous Submissions\n*   Processes for Conditionally Accepted Papers\n\n## Awards\n\nAll accepted regular papers will be considered for the Best Paper Award.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor questions, please contact the Program Co-Chairs, Ganesh Ananthanarayanan and Kate Lin, at [mobicom25-pc-chairs@acm.org](mailto:mobicom25-pc-chairs@acm.org)."
