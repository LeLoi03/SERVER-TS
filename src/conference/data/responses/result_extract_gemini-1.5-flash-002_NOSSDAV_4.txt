  "Call for Papers": "# NOSSDAV 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 35th edition of the Workshop on Network and Operating System Support for Digital Audio and Video (NOSSDAV 2025) will take place from **March 31st to April 3rd, 2025 in Stellenbosch, South Africa**.\n\nNOSSDAV is a workshop with a long-standing tradition focusing on both emerging and established multimedia systems research topics, especially high-risk/high-return ideas. The single-track format brings together academic and industry researchers and practitioners to engage in fruitful and constructive discussions.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nNOSSDAV encourages papers identifying fundamental open problems in multimedia systems research, advocating new radical ideas, or offering counterarguments or critiques on the existing state of the art. NOSSDAV prefers exciting—even-if-incomplete—papers or reports on promising ideas that may be supported by well-reasoned arguments. NOSSDAV takes a broad perspective on all areas of multimedia systems. Authors are especially encouraged to submit papers with real-world experimental results and datasets. This includes new ideas relating to (but not limited to):\n\n*   Virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and immersive systems\n*   Deep learning approaches to improve multimedia delivery and processing\n*   Cloud architectures for multimedia coding and processing\n*   Wireless, mobile, IoT, and embedded systems for multimedia applications\n*   Medical, surveillance, and autonomous driving multimedia systems\n*   Network-distributed media processing\n*   Networked GPUs/TPUs, graphics, and virtual environments\n*   Audio/Image/Video Analytics Systems\n*   System Support for Multimedia Interaction with humans\n*   Internet-Scale Multimedia Systems\n*   Large-language Model and AI-Generated Multimedia Systems\n\n## Submission Process\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit an electronic version of full papers, in PDF format, up to six (6) printed pages plus one (1) page solely for references in length (double-column ACM style format) at the workshop website. Authors must prepare their papers in a way that preserves the anonymity of the authors (double blind).\n\n*   **Submit by:** January 17th, 2025\n*   **Notifications on:** February 14th, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready on:** February 21st, 2025\n\n## Online Submission\n\n[https://nossdav2025.hotcrp.com/](https://nossdav2025.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n*   Xiaofei Wang (Tianjin University, China) [xiaofeiwang AT tju.edu.cn]\n*   Bo Han (George Mason University, United States of America) [bohan AT gmu.edu]\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Abdelhak Bentaleb, Concordia University, Canada\n*   Amr Rizk, Leibniz University Hannover, Germany\n*   Arvind Narayanan, AT&T Labs - Research, United States of America\n*   Ali Cengiz Beğen, Özyeğin University, Turkey\n*   Baochun Li, University of Toronto, Canada\n*   Bo Chen, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA\n*   Carsten Griwodz, University of Oslo, Norway\n*   Chao Qiu, Tianjin University, China\n*   Cheng-Hsin Hsu, National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan\n*   Cheng Zhang, Tianjin University of Finance and Economics, China\n*   Christian Timmerer, Alpen-Adria-Universität Klagenfurt, Austria\n*   Débora Muchaluat-Saade, Universidade Federal Fluminense, Brazil\n*   Di Wu, Sun Yat-sen University, China\n*   Eddie Kohler, Harvard University, United States of America\n*   Farzad Tashtarian, Alpen-Adria-Universität, Austria\n*   Gregor Schiele, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany\n*   Guanyu Gao, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, China\n*   Haihan Duan, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen China\n*   Huaming Wu, Tianjin University, China\n*   Irene Viola, CWI, The Netherlands\n*   Jeroen van der Hooft, Ghent University, Belgium\n*   Jesus Gutierrez, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain\n*   Jiayi Meng, The University of Texas at Arlington, USA\n*   Mallesham Dasari, Carnegie Mellon University, United States of America\n*   Maria Torres Vega, KU Leuven, Belgium\n*   Markus Fiedler, Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH), Sweden\n*   Mathis Engelbart, TU Munich, Germany\n*   Matti Siekkinen, Aalto University, Finland\n*   Mea Wang, University of Calgary, Canada\n*   Mengbai Xiao, Shandong University, China\n*   Michael Zink, UMass Amherst, United States of America\n*   Michael Rudolph, University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany\n*   Michael Seufert, University of Augsburg, Germany\n*   Mohamed Hefeeda, Simon Fraser University, Canada\n*   Nils Aschenbruck, Universität Osnabrück, Germany\n*   Ralf Steinmetz, TU Darmstadt, Germany\n*   Ravi Prakash, University of Texas at Dallas, United States of America\n*   Roberto Azevedo, Disney Research, Switzerland\n*   Silvia Rossi, CWI, The Netherlands\n*   Songqing Chen, George Mason University, United States of America\n*   Stefano Petrangeli, Adobe, United States of America\n*   Takuya Fujihashi, Osaka University, Japan\n*   Tianchi Huang, Sony Group Corporation\n*   Tim Wauters, Ghent University, Belgium\n*   Tobias Hossfeld, UWUE Wuerzburg, Germany\n*   Wei Cai, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen China\n*   Wei Tsang Ooi, National University of Singapore, Singapore\n*   Wojciech Mazurczyk, Warsaw University of Technology, Poland\n*   Xinggong Zhang, Peking University, China\n*   Yao Liu, Rutgers University, United States of America\n*   Yi Zhao, Tsinghua University, China\n*   Yong Liu, New York University, United States of America\n*   Zhisheng Yan, George Mason University, United States of America"
