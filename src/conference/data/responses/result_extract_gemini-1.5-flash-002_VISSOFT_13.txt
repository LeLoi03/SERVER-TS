  "Call for Papers": "# VISSOFT 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe thirteenth IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization (VISSOFT 2025) will be co-located with ICSME in 2025.\n\n## Software Visualization\n\nSoftware visualization is a broad research area whose general goal is to enhance and promote the theory, realization, and evaluation of approaches to visually encode and analyze software systems, including software development practices, evolution, structure, and software runtime behavior. Software visualization is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing on theories and techniques from areas such as information visualization, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, and data science, and applying these in the software engineering domain.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include but are not limited to the visualization of:\n\n*   Software Engineering data (source code, dependencies, repositories, developer social networks, mobile app reviews, documentation, runtime logs, and DevOps data)\n*   Software development activities (design, requirements engineering, software maintenance, program comprehension, software performance, software testing, and debugging)\n*   Software analytical approaches based on data science concepts\n*   Empirical evaluations of software visualizations, including eye-tracking studies\n*   Tools, techniques, and frameworks that include visual programming languages\n*   Interactive and immersive techniques and algorithms related to software development\n*   Integrating tools with development environments\n*   Industrial experience with using software visualization\n*   Techniques used in Software Engineering Education\n*   Application of trendy techniques such as Machine Learning and AI-assisted models (Large Language Models, Large Multi-Modal Models with Software)\n*   Application of techniques such as Augmented and Virtual Reality, and Sonification, to software engineering activities\n\n## Submission Types\n\nVISSOFT features several submission tracks:\n\n### Research Track\n\n*   A paper submitted to the Research Track must describe an in-depth and mature research result relevant to software visualization.\n*   The content of a technical paper can be a maximum of 10 pages long (including all figures, tables, and appendices). The 10-page limit does not include the bibliography (limited to two additional pages).\n*   The submission of a video (up to 5 minutes) is highly encouraged.\n*   Authors are encouraged to archive their artifacts in a reproduction package in an open access archive.\n\n### NIER Track (New Ideas and Emerging Results)\n\n*   NIER contributions have a limit of 5 pages (including bibliography).\n*   NIER contributions describe work-in-progress and preliminary, exciting ideas and results.\n\n### Tools Track\n\n*   Tools Track papers describe the design or actual utilization of software visualization tools.\n*   Short tool papers (up to 4 pages + 1 page bibliography) usually just describe the presented tool and will be evaluated mostly in terms of novelty and interest.\n*   Long tool papers (up to 10 pages + 2 pages bibliography) are expected to present a user evaluation.\n*   The submission of a video (up to 5 minutes in length) is mandatory.\n*   Authors are encouraged to archive their artifacts in a reproduction package in an open access archive.\n\n### Artifact Evaluation Track\n\nWe invite authors of papers accepted to VISSOFT to submit artifacts associated with those papers for evaluation. More information is available at the ICSME 2025 webpage.\n\n### Journal-First Track\n\nAuthors of papers that meet specific criteria (accepted by a relevant journal, published between July 1, 2023, and July 11, 2025, etc.) are invited to submit a one-page presentation proposal.\n\n### Poster Track\n\nThe poster track of VISSOFT accepts two-page documents that embody a succinct description of work that has been done.\n\n### Visualization Challenge Track (NEW!)\n\nThe Visualization Challenge track of VISSOFT 2025 provides an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to contribute their expertise focused on the Linux kernel.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll dates refer to midnight 23:59:59 AoE.\n\n### Research, NIER, and Tools Track | Journal-First, and Poster Track\n\n*   **Paper Abstract:** May 16, 2025\n*   **Paper Submission:** May 23, 2025 (Research, NIER, Tools Tracks); July 11, 2025 (Journal-First, Poster Track)\n*   **Paper Notification:** July 4, 2025 (Research, NIER, Tools Tracks); July 16, 2025 (Journal-First, Poster Track)\n\n### Visualization Challenge Track\n\n*   **Abstract Submission:** June 13, 2025\n*   **Notification:** June 17, 2025\n*   **Short Paper Submission:** July 11, 2025\n*   **Feedback from PC Chairs:** July 16, 2025\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vissoft2025](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vissoft2025)"
