  "Call for Papers": "# ICPE 2025: Call for Contributions\n\nThe ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE) is the leading international forum for presenting and discussing novel ideas, innovations, trends, and experiences in the field of performance engineering. ICPE 2025 will be held at **York University in Toronto, Canada, from May 5-9, 2025**.\n\n## Scope\n\nTodayâ€™s systems are complex, rely increasingly on dynamic distributed architectures, and raise continuously important challenges related to end-to-end performance management. This applies equally to emerging domains, such as systems of systems, interconnected and embedded systems, distributed data and intelligence, machine learning environments, human-centered computing, non-von Neumann architectures, cloud/edge/fog infrastructures, data streaming, and social networks, and also to traditional domains, such as web-based, data centers, mobile and wireless systems, and real-time systems. As a result, our systems become more complex and, therefore, more difficult to engineer and understand. We need to manage this complexity so that our systems remain reliable, trustworthy, and performant.\n\nICPE brings together researchers and practitioners to report state-of-the-art and in-progress research on performance engineering of software, networks, and systems, including but not limited to performance modeling, analysis, measurement, benchmark design, and run-time performance management. The focus is both on classical metrics such as response time, throughput, resource utilization, and (energy) efficiency and on the relationship of such metrics to other system properties, including but not limited to scalability, elasticity, availability, reliability, cost, sustainability, security, and privacy.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\n*   Performance Measurement and Empirical Evaluation\n*   Performance Benchmarking\n*   Performance Modeling of Software and Systems\n*   Design and Development Processes\n*   Run-time Performance Management and Adaptation\n*   Platform-Related Optimizations\n\n## Systems of Interest\n\n*   Cyber-physical domain, IoT, industrial internet\n*   Networked and embedded systems\n*   Advanced computer architectures, including non-von Neumann\n*   Communication networks, wireless and mobile\n*   Peer-to-peer environments, ad-hoc networks\n*   Machine learning and AI-based systems\n*   SOA, microservices, web-based environments\n*   Big data systems, stream, and graph processing\n*   HPC systems, cloud, edge, grid, and fog\n*   Social networks, multimedia systems, and applications\n\n## Types of Submissions\n\nICPE caters to a wide range of submission types with eight distinct submission tracks:\n\n*   Research Track\n*   Industry Track\n*   Journal-First Track\n*   Artifact Evaluation Track\n*   Data Challenge Track\n*   Emerging Research Track\n*   Industry Presentation Track\n*   Posters and Demonstrations Track\n*   Tutorials Track\n*   Workshops Track\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 11:59 PM AoE (Anywhere on Earth)\n\n### Research Track\n\n*   Abstract submission (optional): October 25, 2024\n*   Paper submission: November 1, 2024\n*   Notification: December 20, 2024\n*   Camera-ready version: March 12, 2025\n\n### Industry Track\n\n*   Abstract submission (optional): October 25, 2024\n*   Paper submission: November 1, 2024\n*   Notification: December 20, 2024\n*   Camera-ready version: March 12, 2025\n\n### Workshops Track\n\n*   Proposal submission: October 11, 2024\n*   Notification: October 18, 2024\n*   Camera-ready version: March 19, 2025\n\n### Artifact Track\n\n*   Proposal submission: January 15, 2025\n*   Notification: February 28, 2025\n*   Camera-ready version: March 19, 2025\n\n### Poster and Demo Track\n\n*   Paper submission: January 20, 2025\n*   Notification: February 10, 2025\n*   Camera-ready version: March 19, 2025\n\n### Industry Presentation Track\n\n*   Submission: February 2, 2025\n*   Author Notification: February 23, 2025\n\n### Tutorial Track\n\n*   Paper submission: January 20, 2025\n*   Notification: February 10, 2025\n*   Camera-ready version: March 19, 2025\n\n### Data Challenge Track\n\n*   Paper submission: January 20, 2025\n*   Notification: February 10, 2025\n*   Camera-ready version: March 19, 2025\n\n### Journal First Track\n\n*   Paper submission: January 20, 2025\n*   Notification: February 1, 2025\n\n### Emerging Research Track\n\n*   Paper submission: January 26, 2025\n*   Camera-ready version: March 19, 2025"
