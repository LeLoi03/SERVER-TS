The contributions should address research questions that relate to one of the topics listed above.  We particularly encourage:\n\n1.  Contributions that introduce and evaluate technological innovations (e.g., new techniques, tools, methods, or software).\n2.  Empirical studies (e.g., quantitative data on the effects of novel approaches in technical, social, or economic terms).\n3.  Systematic surveys of emerging technologies and competing paradigms.\n4.  Case studies of the trustworthiness of information systems in various application areas.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Submissions for full papers must not exceed 18 pages (including the list of references) in the final camera-ready paper style. The program chairs may decide to accept some of the submissions as short papers (which would then need to be shortened to 11 pages).\n*   Submitted papers must be written in English, laid out according to the final camera-ready formatting instructions, and be submitted in electronic form in PDF format.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Conference Date:** October 20 - 22, 2025\n*   **Regular Papers Paper Submission:** July 7, 2025\n*   **Authors Notification:** September 4, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready and Registration:** September 12, 2025\n\n## Publications\n\nAll accepted complete papers will be published by Springer in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference. The proceedings will be abstracted/indexed in DBLP, Google Scholar, EI-Compendex, INSPEC, Japanese Science and Technology Agency (JST), Norwegian Register for Scientific Journals and Series, Mathematical Reviews, SCImago, Scopus, and zbMATH. LNCS volumes are also submitted for the inclusion in ISI Proceedings.\n\n## Special Sessions\n\n*   [Demo Track of CoopIS 2025 - CoopIS-DT](https://coopis.scitevents.org/CoopIS-DT.aspx)\n*   [Early Research Achievement - CoopIS-ERA](https://coopis.scitevents.org/coopis-ERA.aspx)\n\n## Conference Co-Chairs\n\n*   Mohamed Sellami, Institut Polytechnique de Paris - Télécom SudParis, SAMOVAR, France\n*   Ali Ouni, École de Technologie Supérieure (ÉTS Montreal), Canada\n\n## Program Co-Chairs\n\n*   Cinzia Cappiello, Politecnico di Milano, Italy\n*   Olaf Hartig, Linkoeping University, Sweden\n\n## Publicity Chairs\n\n*   Mehdi Acheli, Telecom SudParis, France\n*   Bader Alkhazi, Kuwait University, Kuwait\n*   Mahi Begoug, École de Technologie Supérieure, Canada\n*   Saoussen Cheikhrouhou, ReDCAD, ENIS, University of Sfax, Tunisia\n*   Raula Gaikovina Kula, University of Osaka, Japan"
