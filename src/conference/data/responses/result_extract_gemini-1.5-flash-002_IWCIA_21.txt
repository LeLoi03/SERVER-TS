  "Call for Papers": "# IWCT 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 14th International Workshop on Combinatorial Testing (IWCT 2025) will be held in conjunction with ICST 2025 in **Naples, Italy, from March 31 to April 4, 2025**.\n\nThe workshop focuses on combinatorial methods in testing, which can target software, systems-of-systems, or other domains. The workshop welcomes academic research submissions as well as industrial experience reports.\n\n## Keynote Speaker\n\nDr. Juraj Somorovsky, Professor at Paderborn University (Germany), will give a keynote titled “Lessons learned from systematic security testing of TLS”.\n\n## Topics for Submissions\n\nTopics of interest for submissions include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Combinatorial testing workflow\n*   Modeling the input space for CT\n*   Efficient algorithms to generate test plans\n*   Determination of expected system behavior for each test case\n*   Executing CT test plans\n*   Combinatorial testing based fault localization\n*   Implementation of CT in existing testing infrastructures\n*   Handling changes in test requirements\n*   Real-world experience in deployment of combinatorial testing\n*   Empirical studies and feedback from practical applications of CT\n*   CT targeting AI/ML-based systems\n*   CT targeting security, including hardware and chip security\n*   CT targeting autonomous, concurrent and real-time systems\n*   CT targeting cloud computing systems and use of combinatorial methods in cloud architecture\n*   CT targeting feature models for software product lines\n*   CT targeting other domains\n*   Applicability of combinatorial testing\n*   Comparison and combination of CT with other dynamic verification methods\n*   Investigation of historical records of failures\n*   Methodology used for test space modeling and determination of interaction coverage requirements\n*   Evaluation and return of investment metrics\n*   Discussion of challenges and open problems in the application of CT in an industrial setting\n*   Combinatorial and complementing methods\n*   Combinatorial analysis of existing test plans\n*   Test plan reduction and completeness\n*   CT and coverage metrics\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nEach submission (in any category) must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines ([https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)). All papers will be reviewed by at least three members from the program committee. If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to attend the workshop in-person with an author registration and present the paper for it to be published in the ICST 2025 workshop proceedings.\n\n### Full and Short Papers\n\nWe invite submissions for full papers (up to 10 pages, including references) as well as short papers (up to 4 pages, including references). Accepted papers in these two categories – full and short – will be part of the proceedings of IWCT 2025.\n\n### Journal-First\n\nThe aim of the Journal-First (JF) submission category is to further enrich the program of IWCT, as well as to provide an overall more flexible path to publication and dissemination of original research that is within the scope of IWCT. A submission in this category must adhere to the following criteria:\n\n*   It should be clearly within the scope of the workshop.\n*   It should be recent: it should have been accepted and made publicly available in a journal (online or in print) by January 1, 2023, or more recently.\n*   It has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, Journal-First tracks of other conferences or workshops.\n*   The submission has to be in the form of a 2-page extended abstract and has to provide a concise summary of the published journal paper.\n\n### Posters\n\nIn addition to the traditional program topics from the past years, we offer a low-threshold opportunity – especially targeting industry – to present activities within the scope of the workshop to the participants of IWCT. A tool demonstration can be given alongside a poster.\n\n## Important Dates (AoE (UTC-12h))\n\n*   **Submission deadline (all categories):** January 10, 2025\n*   **Notification:** February 3, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready submission (all categories):** March 8, 2025\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icst2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icst2025) (Please select track ‘IWCT 2025’)\n\n## Contact\n\n[iwct2025@sba-research.org](mailto:iwct2025@sba-research.org)"
