Authors are invited to electronically submit original research contributions or experience reports in English. DEXA will accept submissions of both short (up to 6 pages) and full papers (up to 15 pages including references and appendixes). DEXA reserves the right to accept submitted full papers only as short papers, in which papers describe interesting and innovative ideas which still require further technical development.\n\n## Submission Procedure\n\nAuthors should first consult [Springer’s authors’ instructions](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and use the proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers.\n\nPapers submission will be managed using [HotCRP](https://dexa2025.iiwas.org). To submit a paper, create an account or sign in if you already have an account.\n\n## Review Process\n\nSubmitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. Duplicate submissions are not allowed and will be rejected immediately without further review.\n\n## Accepted Papers\n\nAll accepted conference papers will be published in a volume of \"Lecture Notes in Computer Science\" (LNCS) by Springer. Authors of all accepted papers must sign a Springer copyright release form. Papers are accepted with the understanding that at least one author will register for the conference to present the paper. Selected high-quality papers, after revision and extension, will be invited to be published in a special issue of Knowledge and Information Systems (KAIS), Springer (IF=3.2), and Data & Knowledge Engineering (DKE), Elsevier (IF=2.7).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission:** April 10, 2025 (Sharp & Final)\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** May 14, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready copies due:** June 14, 2025\n*   **Authors Registration deadline:** June 14, 2025\n*   **Conference days:** August 25-27, 2025\n\n## Contact\n\nFor further inquiries, please contact [dexa2025@iiwas.org](mailto:dexa2025@iiwas.org)."
