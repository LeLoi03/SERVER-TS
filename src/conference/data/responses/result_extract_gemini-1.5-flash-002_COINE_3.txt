  "Summary": "The International Workshop on Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms and Ethics for Governance of Multi-Agent Systems (COINE) will be co-located with AAMAS 2025 in Detroit, Michigan, USA, on May 20, 2025.  The workshop brings together researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, and agents aware of norms, policies, and ethics.",
  "Call for Papers": "# COINE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe International Workshop on Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms and Ethics for Governance of Multi-Agent Systems (COINE 2025) will be co-located with AAMAS 2025 in **Detroit, Michigan, USA, from May 19-23, 2025.** ([https://aamas2025.org/](https://aamas2025.org/))\n\n## Overview\n\nThe growing pervasiveness of “open systems” raises a range of challenges and opportunities for developing technologies in the area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS). In open MAS, artificial and human autonomous agents, their modes of interaction, and the pursued goal of the system may change over time. The view of coordination and control has to be expanded to consider not only an agent-centric perspective but societal and organization-centric views as well. Moreover, in the case of open multi-agent systems, the autonomy of the agents can work against the effectiveness of the system and of the society. There is therefore a need for tools and techniques for articulating interactions in order to make MAS more effective in attaining collective goals, aligning agent behaviors with shared human values, and more trustworthy, predictable, and understandable for humans.\n\nCoordination, organizations, institutions, norms, and ethics are five key governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. COINE is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe invite submissions that address any of the following aspects:\n\n*   Mathematical, logical, computational, philosophical, legal, and pragmatic issues related to the issues above\n*   Modeling, animation, and simulation techniques for open MAS\n*   Tools, prototypes, and actual working systems\n*   Topics investigating the relationship between COINE and the rapidly evolving AI landscape (e.g., including LLMs and Generative AI)\n*   Topics exploring the value-aligned problems within MAS in the COINE domain\n*   Experimental investigation of the effectiveness of COINE technologies\n*   Challenging or innovative ideas relevant to the field\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission:** February 25th, 2025 AoE (EXTENDED)\n*   **Author notifications:** March 21st, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready deadline:** April 22nd, 2025 AoE\n*   **Workshop:** May 20th, 2025\n\n## Instructions for Authors\n\n*   For preparation of papers, please follow the instructions for authors available at the Springer LNCS Web page.\n*   We solicit three types of papers in the LNCS format:\n    *   Full research papers (16 pages, excluding references)\n    *   Short research papers (10 pages, excluding references) – These ‘early-innovation’ papers are work-in-progress papers and these will be reviewed with an emphasis on novelty/originality of the idea.\n    *   Blue sky ideas (up to 16 pages, excluding references) – These papers have the same scope of the blue sky ideas track of AAMAS 2025 ([https://aamas2025.org/index.php/conference/calls/call-for-blue-sky-ideas/](https://aamas2025.org/index.php/conference/calls/call-for-blue-sky-ideas/)), focussing on the COINE topics\n*   All papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format.\n*   For submission of papers, please use the OpenReview.net site at: [https://openreview.net/group?id=ifaamas.org/AAMAS/2025/Workshop/COINE](https://openreview.net/group?id=ifaamas.org/AAMAS/2025/Workshop/COINE)\n\n## Proceedings\n\nAs with previous COIN(E) workshops, COINE intends to publish post-proceedings in Springer’s LNCS series (pending confirmation). Authors will be invited to submit revised and extended versions of their paper for consideration in these post-proceedings. Revised papers must take into account the discussion held during the workshop; hence, only papers that are presented during the workshop will be considered for inclusion in the post-proceedings volume."
