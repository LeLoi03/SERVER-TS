  "Call for Papers": "# IVCNZ 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 40th International Conference on Image and Vision Computing New Zealand (IVCNZ 2025) will be held in **Wellington, New Zealand from November 19-21, 2025**.\n\nIVCNZ is a long-standing and leading international conference focusing on all aspects of computer vision, image processing, computer graphics, virtual and augmented reality, visualization, and human-computer interaction (HCI) applications within these fields.\n\n## Relevant Topics\n\nRelevant topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   3D imaging\n*   Artificial intelligence for computer vision\n*   Augmented and virtual reality\n*   Automated visual surveillance\n*   Biomedical imaging and visualization\n*   Biologically inspired vision systems\n*   Biometrics\n*   Calibration techniques\n*   Computer graphics\n*   Enhancement of video and still images\n*   Face recognition\n*   Feature detection and extraction\n*   Geometric modeling in vision and graphics\n*   Image analysis and understanding\n*   Image-based rendering\n*   Image compression and coding\n*   Medical imaging\n*   Motion tracking and analysis\n*   Motion synthesis and control\n*   Multimedia information retrieval\n*   Object recognition\n*   Pattern recognition and classification\n*   Reconstruction techniques\n*   Rendering and scientific visualization\n*   Scientific visualization\n*   Security image processing\n*   Shape recovery from multiple images\n*   Sonar and acoustical imaging\n*   Stereo image analysis\n*   Machine vision real-world applications\n*   Image and video generation\n*   3D scene understanding and reconstruction\n*   Vision-language models\n*   Image and video understanding with multimodal inputs\n*   Cross-modal fusion and reasoning\n*   Multimodal representation learning\n*   Multimedia applications\n*   Image and video inpainting and super-resolution\n\n## Submission\n\nIn submitting a paper, the authors warrant that should the paper be accepted, the final paper will be prepared in time for inclusion into the published proceedings and that one of the authors will attend the conference and present the paper. The proceedings will be published after the conference â€“ we endeavor to submit to IEEE Xplore; the committee reserves the right to withdraw any paper from the proceedings that is not presented at the conference.\n\nThe conference will consist of a mix of oral and poster sessions. No distinction will be made between the two types of presentation in the proceedings: authors may request the type of presentation they consider most appropriate for their paper; however, the final decision will be made by the program committee.\n\nSee the submission page [here](https://ecs.wgtn.ac.nz/Events/IVCNZ2025/CallForPapers).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper Submission Deadline:** August 21, 2025\n*   **Notification:** October 8, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready:** October 16, 2025\n*   **Early Registration:** October 16, 2025\n*   **Conference:** November 19-21, 2025"
