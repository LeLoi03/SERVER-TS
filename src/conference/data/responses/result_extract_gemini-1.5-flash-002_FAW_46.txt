  "Call for Papers": "# IJTCS-FAW 2024: Call for Papers\n\nThe International Joint Conference on Theoretical Computer Science – Frontier of Algorithmic Wisdom (IJTCS-FAW 2024) was held on **July 29 – July 31, 2024**, hosted by **The Hong Kong Polytechnic University**.\n\n## Submission Tracks\n\nThe following tracks were open to submission:\n\n*   Track A: The 18th Conference on Frontiers of Algorithmic Wisdom\n*   Track B: Blockchain Theory and Technology\n*   Track C: Computational Economics and Algorithmic Game Theory\n\n## Normal Submission\n\nAuthors were invited to submit an extended abstract of no more than 12 pages, excluding references and the front page(s), presenting original research on the theory of computer science. Submissions must be formatted in the LNCS style. All submissions must be submitted via EasyChair to the appropriate track of the conference, using the following link: [EasyChair Submission Link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijtcsfaw2024)\n\nThe proceedings of the conference were published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.\n\n## Resubmission Opportunity\n\nThis year, a special opportunity was introduced for authors whose submissions were previously rejected from sister conferences that sent out notification emails between January 1, 2024, and April 20, 2024 (such as EUROCRYPT 2024, ICALP 2024, IJCAI 2024, FUN 2024, SPAA 2024, WWW 2024, etc.). This allowed authors to resubmit their work to IJTCS-FAW with a later deadline (April 20, 2024) and a lighter review process.  Authors were required to update their manuscripts, addressing the comments provided by previous reviewers, and adapt them to adhere to the style guidelines of IJTCS-FAW. All submitted material underwent a check with the sister conference and was reviewed by members of the IJTCS-FAW program committee.\n\n## Submission Requirements for Resubmissions\n\n*   All resubmissions must be based on a rejected submission from a sister conference with notification between January 1, 2024, and April 20, 2024, and the (weak) majority of the review must be non-negative.\n*   The submission must be relevant to one of the three submission tracks (A, B, C).\n*   Authors must submit in one PDF document:\n    *   Their original submission to the sister conference\n    *   All review scores and reviews (including the meta-review) from the sister conference\n    *   The IJTCS-FAW submission (the revised submission), in the same format and with the same restrictions as were required for submissions to IJTCS-FAW\n    *   An at most one-page long cover letter that describes how the IJTCS-FAW submission addresses the comments in the previous reviews, and a concise statement of why the submission is relevant for one of the three tracks (A, B, and C) of IJTCS-FAW.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Normal Submission deadline:** April 8, 2024\n*   **Resubmission deadline:** April 20, 2024\n*   **Notification:** May 15, 2024\n\n## Awards\n\n*   The Best Paper Award\n*   The Best Student Paper Award\n\n## Special Issue\n\nAfter the conference, selected papers will be invited to special issues in: Theoretical Computer Science, Journal of Combinatorial Optimization, Blockchain Journal, and Theory of Computing Systems."
