The 30th annual ACM conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE 2025) will take place at **Radboud University, Nijmegen, Netherlands, from June 30 to July 2, 2025**.

## Paper Tracks

Papers presented at ITiCSE address aspects of computing education, that is, the education of students who are studying computing.  A mandatory abstract submission is required for all papers and is due a week before the deadline for full papers. When making a submission, you will be asked to place it in one of three tracks:

*   **Computing education research:** papers that define research questions, describe the data gathering and the methods used to address the questions, present the results, and discuss the contribution to knowledge about the teaching and learning of computing;
*   **Experience reports and tools:** papers that describe computing education experiences, including tools that have been developed for use in computing education, in sufficient detail for others to see whether their use was beneficial and to be able to adopt them if required;
*   **Position papers and proposals:** papers articulating original and well-argued positions on aspects of computing education, or proposals for work that is in its early stages; while these papers should be well situated in the literature, they need not report on work that has been completed; however, they must offer something of value to the community.

All papers should explicitly state their motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and where there is an intervention contain an analysis of the effectiveness of the intervention.

## Submitting the Abstract

Your abstract can be up to 250 words and **must be submitted by the paper abstract deadline** (see the sidebar for these dates). The abstract will be plain text — not, for example, a PDF.

## Anonymous Version for Review

The paper submitted for review must be a fully anonymous version so as to allow the authors an unbiased review. The anonymous version should have ALL identifying references to the authors removed. Submissions that fully use the page limit, without leaving space for these items, will be rejected on the grounds of exceeding the page limit.

Papers are expected to stand alone, and not to require the reading of supplementary information. For this reason, they should not include links to additional material, such as a demonstration of software being introduced.

## Ethical Status of Data Collection

Any submission that makes use of data from human participants must clearly indicate whether approval has been granted for the use of that data, by what authority, and what the approval covers.

## Formatting the Paper

The paper is limited to a maximum of six pages plus one page for references.  For details regarding the mandatory formatting requirements, see [Formatting requirements](https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/#formatting) on the [Call for Participation](https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/) page.

## Important Dates

*   **Mandatory abstract submission:** January 12, 2025
*   **Full paper submission:** January 19, 2025
*   **Author notification:** March 3, 2025
*   **Camera ready deadline:** November 16, 2025

## Submitting the Paper

Follow the instructions on [Submission process](https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/#process) at the foot of the [Call for Participation](https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/) page.

Please note: ITiCSE 2025 will be a face-to-face conference. Registration, attendance in person, presentation, and discussion are mandatory for at least one author, otherwise, your publication cannot be included in the proceedings.

SIGMETRICS is the flagship conference of the ACM special interest group for the computer systems performance evaluation community. The conference solicits papers on the design, modeling, measurement, and performance analysis of computer systems.","# ACM SIGMETRICS 2025: Call for Papers

The 2025 ACM SIGMETRICS conference will be held at **Stony Brook University, New York, USA, on June 9-13, 2025**.

We solicit papers on the design, modeling, measurement, and performance analysis of computer systems. A good submission typically focuses on a well-motivated problem in computer systems, proposes a principled solution using modeling, measurement, and performance analysis, and empirically validates the solution through simulations and/or implementation.

## Tracks

SIGMETRICS 2025 uses ""soft"" tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers. All submissions, regardless of the selected track, will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed below when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element.

*   **Learning:** Papers in this track make progress on either (i) the design and analysis of machine learning and AI algorithms, broadly defined, or (ii) the application of tools from machine learning and AI, broadly defined, to the design, control, and optimization of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems.
*   **Measurement & Applied Modeling:** Papers in this track make an empirical or applied contribution. They often either (i) draw significant insights from real or synthetic data through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources; and/or (ii) propose and apply a new model or simulation tool to capture real-world phenomena.
*   **Systems:** Papers in this track make a contribution to the design, implementation, and/or practical evaluation of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. A good submission to this track will make a contribution to the modeling and performance analysis of the system prior to empirical validation.
*   **Theory:** Papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new analysis techniques.

## Important Dates

There are three submission opportunities over the course of the year. Deadlines are hard and at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth).

## Reviewing Process

Papers invited to present at the SIGMETRICS conference are journal papers accepted to the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). The reviewing process for submissions is a hybrid of the traditional conference and journal models in computer science. There are three possible outcomes from the first round of submission:

*   **Accept with Shepherding:** Every accepted paper will be shepherded.
*   **Reject:** If the paper is rejected it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper.
*   **Resubmit:** For papers that are close to the acceptance threshold, but require a major revision prior to acceptance, the 12-month resubmission ban is waived and a resubmit option is offered.

## Policies

*   Anonymity guidelines
*   Publication of a pre-submission version
*   Substantive title and abstract
*   Original research
*   Simultaneous submissions
*   Shepherding process
*   Opting out of POMACS publication

## Ethical Considerations

Papers describing experiments with users or user data should follow the basic principles of ethical research.

## Diversity and Inclusiveness

We provide inclusivity and accessibility guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation."
