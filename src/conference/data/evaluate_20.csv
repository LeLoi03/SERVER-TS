The 18th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM 2025) will take place in **Hannover, Germany from March 10th-14th, 2025**.

WSDM is a highly selective conference that includes invited talks, as well as refereed full papers. WSDM publishes original, high-quality papers related to search and data mining on the Web and the Social Web, with an emphasis on practical yet principled novel models of search and data mining, algorithm design and analysis, economic implications, and in-depth experimental analysis of accuracy and performance.

## Call for Papers

Original papers emphasizing novel algorithmic approaches are particularly encouraged. Application-oriented papers that make innovative technical contributions to research are welcome. Visionary papers on new and emerging topics are particularly encouraged.

Authors are explicitly discouraged from submitting papers that do not clearly present their contribution with respect to previous works, that contain only incremental results, and that do not provide significant advances over existing approaches.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are 11:59 pm anywhere on earth.
