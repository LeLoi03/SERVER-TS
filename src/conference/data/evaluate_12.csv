## Submission Guidelines

Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication. Submissions must be at most 12 (full papers) or 6 (short papers) single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages with 10-pt font size (override default font of 9-pt) in two-column format, including figures and tables.  As for references, submissions may include as many pages as needed.

All submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found here. LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (sigconf option), with the 10-pt font (override default font of 9-pt). Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions.  Although submission is double-blind, the existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the conference submission system.

Papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze nonpublic data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), should briefly describe how the research protocol addresses ethical considerations and whether their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects.

The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM) is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI).

## About the Symposium

ISAIM seeks submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled lessons learned from the development of the application.

Work that will have been published as of January 2024 should not be submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the previously published work. However, the ISAIM web site proceedings are not archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review elsewhere at the time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM.

Authors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in an archival special volume of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and unpublished to be considered for the special volume.

## Paper Submissions

Please select [Paper Submissions](submissions.html) from the sidebar for instructions on how to submit a paper.

Any questions regarding paper submissions should be sent to the Program Committee Chairs (Claudio Gentille and Aldo Pacchiano) at [isaim-l@lists.ou.edu](mailto:isaim-l@lists.ou.edu).

The 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025) will take place between **July 22-26, 2025 in Palermo, Italy**.

## Theme

“AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future”

The AIED 2025 conference centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education. By harnessing AI’s capacity to personalize learning experiences, educators can address the diverse needs of students and mitigate educational disparities, particularly among underserved and marginalized communities. This year’s theme also underscores the critical importance of ethical AI integration, ensuring that these advanced technologies are deployed responsibly to uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and privacy.

## Tracks

For its main paper submissions, AIED 2025 solicits empirical and theoretical papers relating to both AI and education in the following lines of research and application, which represent our research tracks:

*   Track 1 – AIED architectures and tools
*   Track 2 – Machine learning and Generative AI
*   Track 3 – Learning, teaching and pedagogy
*   Track 4 – Human-centered design and design-based research
*   Track 5 – Teaching AI
*   Track 6 – Ethics, Equity, and AIED in Society
*   Track 7 – Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modelling for Education

## Submission Instructions

We invite the following main submissions to the conference, to be submitted directly to one of the above research tracks:

*   **Full paper submission:** Full papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Full papers will be presented as long oral talks. Papers submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper.
*   **Short paper submission:** Short papers are expected to describe novel and interesting results to the overall community at large. The goal is to give novel but not necessarily mature work a chance to be seen by other researchers and practitioners and to be discussed at the conference. Short papers will be presented as short oral talks.

Submissions must follow Springer policies on publication (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process): [https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v](https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v).

## Review Process

All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the program committee, followed by a metareview conducted by a senior member of the program committee (all double-masked) to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation.

## Anonymity

The review process will be double-masked, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous. To this end, authors should:

*   Eliminate all information that could lead to their identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, projects and/or systems)
*   Cite own prior work (if needed) in the third person
*   Eliminate acknowledgments and references to funding sources

Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.

### Experience Papers

Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience.

### Replicability Studies

ISSTA would like to encourage researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artefacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs.

Replicability Studies will be evaluated according to the following standards:

*   Depth and breadth of experiments
*   Clarity of writing
*   Appropriateness of conclusions
*   Amount of useful, actionable insights
*   Availability of artefacts

We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artefacts the study is built on, and to submit those artefacts to the artefact evaluation. Artefacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA.

At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references. Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review. The page limit is strict.

Papers must be submitted electronically through the ISSTA 2025 submission site: [https://issta2025.hotcrp.com](https://issta2025.hotcrp.com).

## Double-anonymous Reviewing

ISSTA 2025 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way.

## Open Science Policy and “Data Availability” Section

ISSTA has adopted an open science policy. Upon submission, authors are asked to make their code, data, etc. available to the program committee or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. While sharing the data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, it will inform the program committee’s decision. We ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named “Data Availability” after the Conclusion section.

The 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2025) will be held in **São Paulo, Brazil, from October 21-24, 2025**.

ISSRE is the leading conference on software reliability and focuses on approaches, techniques, and tools for assessing, predicting, and improving the reliability, safety, and security of software systems.

## Research Track

The research track at ISSRE 2025 invites high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results. ISSRE solicits submissions in three categories:

1.  **REG papers:** (Regular research papers) Describe a novel contribution to the reliability of software systems. Novelty should be argued via concrete evidence and appropriate positioning within the state of the art. REG papers are also expected to clearly explain the validation process and its limitations.
2.  **PER papers:** (Practical experience reports) Provide an in-depth exposition of practical experiences, ideally performed by a collaboration of researchers and industry practitioners. The key contribution should be lessons learned from the application of known research tools and methods related to ISSRE topics, or new knowledge acquired through empirical studies.
3.  **TAR papers:** (Tools and artifacts) Describe a new tool or artifact. Tool-focused TAR papers must present either a new tool or novel and substantial extensions to an existing tool. They should include a description of (i) the theoretical foundations, (ii) the design and implementation aspects, and (iii) experiments with realistic case studies. Making the tool publicly available is strongly encouraged. Artifact-focused TAR papers should cover (i) a working copy of the software and (ii) experimental data sets.
