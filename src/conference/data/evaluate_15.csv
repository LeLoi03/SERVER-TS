## Paper Formatting Instructions

All submissions must be in PDF format. The main text of a submitted paper is limited to nine content pages, including all figures and tables. Additional pages containing references, checklist, and the optional technical appendices do not count as content pages. If your submission is accepted, you will be allowed an additional content page for the camera-ready version.

You must format your submission using the [NeurIPS 2025 LaTeX style file](https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2025/Styles.zip).

## Paper Checklist

Authors are required to complete a [paper checklist](https://neurips.cc/public/guides/PaperChecklist).

## Technical Appendices and Supplementary Material

Technical appendices and supplementary material may be submitted with the paper submission before the full submission deadline, or as a separate PDF in the ZIP file below before the supplementary material deadline.

## Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)

The NeurIPS policy for use of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be found [here](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/LLM).

## Double-blind Reviewing

All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy. This policy applies to any supplementary or linked material as well, including code.

## Ethics Review

Reviewers and ACs may flag submissions for [ethics review](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines).

## Preprints

The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other online repositories, personal websites, social media) will not result in rejection.

## Dual Submissions

Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that the authors have previously published or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed venues with proceedings or journals may not be submitted to NeurIPS.

## Anti-collusion

NeurIPS does not tolerate any collusion whereby authors secretly cooperate with reviewers, ACs or SACs to obtain favorable reviews.

## Author Responses

Authors will have one week to view and respond to initial reviews. Author responses may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy.

## Publication of Accepted Submissions

Reviews, meta-reviews, and any discussion with the authors will be made public for accepted papers (but reviewer, area chair, and senior area chair identities will remain anonymous). Camera-ready papers will be due in advance of the conference.

## Contemporaneous Work

For the purpose of the reviewing process, papers that appeared online after March 1st, 2025 will generally be considered ""contemporaneous"".

## Other Tracks

Similarly to earlier years, we will host multiple tracks, such as datasets and benchmarks, competitions, tutorials as well as workshops, in addition to the main track for which this call for papers is intended.

## Financial Aid

Each paper may designate up to one (1) NeurIPS.cc account email address of a corresponding student author who confirms that they would need the support to attend the conference, and agrees to volunteer if they get selected."

The New Security Paradigms Workshop (NSPW 2025) will be held on **August 24-27, 2025, in Aerzen, Germany.**

NSPW is an invitation-only workshop for researchers in information security and related disciplines.  The focus is on work that challenges dominant approaches and perspectives in computer security.

## Theme: Trusting

The theme for NSPW 2025 is **Trusting**. Relevant topics include:

*   Novel paradigms for conceptualising trust and trusting in computer security
*   Trust decisions in a world of deepfakes and misinformation
*   Detection of breach of trust, intrusion and misinformation
*   Trust boundaries and threat modeling
*   Trust in changing threat landscapes and technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence
*   Trust evaluation
*   Social configuration of trust and mistrust in organisations
*   Trust and mistrust as methodological problems in studies of computer security
*   The consequences of not trusting
*   Audits and certifications
*   Authentication and authorization
*   Reputation systems and reviewer/recommender systems
*   Anomaly detection
*   Formal verification and testing
*   Privacy
*   Decentralized trust
*   Zero trust architectures
*   Human, social and organisational understandings of trust in technologies

Other interpretations of trusting are welcome.

## Submission Types

NSPW 2025 invites three types of submissions:

*   **Regular submissions:** present a new approach (paradigm) to a security problem or critique existing approaches.  The change in approach should be the focus, not the research results.
*   **Theme Submissions:** focused on “Trusting” and should explain the connection with the theme in the justification statement.
*   **Implementation Submissions:** explore implementing previous NSPW submissions.  These submissions should clearly cite which previous work(s) is being referenced and how the current submission extends beyond the original scope.

## Submission Instructions

*   All submissions are treated as confidential.
*   NSPW does not accept previously published or concurrently submitted papers.
*   **Due Date:** April 25, 2025
*   **Response Date:** May 30, 2025
*   **Format:** PDF format, 6-15 pages, ACM “sigconf” formatting
*   **Submission System:** [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025)

Each paper requires two separate EasyChair submissions:

1.  Cover page with authors’ names, affiliation, and the participation statement
2.  Anonymous PDF paper with a justification statement

The participation statement must specify which author(s) will attend upon acceptance/invitation, that all authors will engage in good faith with the feedback given in the review and revision periods, and that all authors will abide by the NSPW code of conduct.  The justification statement briefly explains why the submission is appropriate for NSPW and the chosen submission category. The justification statement will not appear in the final publication. Submissions that do not include both statements risk rejection without review.

## Publication

Depending on publication venue, there may be open access publication fees.  Further details regarding publication will be forthcoming.

## Social Contract and Code of Conduct

The process for paper submission, revision, presentation, and publication at NSPW is different from many other security conferences. Accepted papers are shepherded and revised before the workshop; this revised version is then presented and discussed in an hour-long session. After the workshop, the final version is produced, incorporating the discussions and feedback. Acceptance to the workshop is conditional on engagement with this process.

All participants must commit to a “social contract"": no one arrives late, no one leaves early, no electronic distractions (including laptops, tablets, and mobile devices), attend all sessions of the 2.5-day program, share meals in a group setting, and comply with the code of conduct. The workshop is preceded by an evening reception allowing attendees to meet each other beforehand.

NSPW is making arrangements for (some) child care during the event. If any potential attendee wants to take advantage of this or has questions, please email [general-chairs@nspw.org](mailto:general-chairs@nspw.org).

The submission, review, and workshop phases of NSPW are all governed by the NSPW code of conduct: [https://www.nspw.org/conduct](https://www.nspw.org/conduct)."

## Two Deadlines

NSDI '25 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines. Any paper submitted to one of these deadlines and accepted during the subsequent reviewing period will be presented at the conference and will appear as part of the proceedings.

## One-Shot Revision

Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. Such a revision decision includes a summary of the paper's merits and a list of necessary changes that are required for the paper to be accepted at NSDI.

## Policy on NSDI Resubmissions

Papers rejected from one of these deadlines cannot be submitted to the immediate next deadline.

## Extensions of Workshop Papers

Work that extends an author's previous workshop paper is welcome, but the paper should (a) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation and (b) explain the differences between the NSDI submission and the prior workshop paper.

## Resubmission of SIGCOMM '24 and HotNets '25 Papers

Authors are free to submit SIGCOMM '24 rejected papers to NSDI '25 spring and significant extensions of HotNets '25 accepted papers to NSDI '25 fall, provided that the notifications from these conferences occur before the full paper submission deadlines for NSDI.

## Operational Systems Track

NSDI '25 also solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with large-scale, operational systems and networks.

## What to Submit

NSDI '25 is double-blind, meaning that authors should make a good faith effort to anonymize papers. Note that the operational track papers have different rules as described above.

## On the Use of Generative AI

While we acknowledge that generative AI is seamlessly included in many editing packages, e.g., Grammarly, and thus often hard to detect, authors must not submit papers generated entirely by generative AI.

## Policies

*   Simultaneous submissions
*   Extensions on workshop papers
*   Update of August 27, 2024: Online technical reports

## Conflicts

At submission time, you must provide information about conflicts with PC members.

## Ethical Considerations

Papers describing experiments with users or user data should follow the basic principles of ethical research.

## Processes for Accepted Papers

If your paper is accepted and you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa to attend the conference, please contact [conference@usenix.org](mailto:conference@usenix.org) as soon as possible.

## Best Paper Awards

Awards will be given for the best paper(s) at the conference.

## Community Award

To encourage broader code and data sharing within the NSDI community, the conference will also present a ""Community Award"" for the best paper whose code and/or data set is made publicly available by the final paper deadline.

Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities, and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.

## The Character of Onward! Papers

Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

## Selection Process

Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double-blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.

Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission.

## Instructions for Authors

For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.

Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.

## Submission Site

[https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/](https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/)

## Concurrent Submissions

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.

## Policy on Double-Blind Review

Onward! 2025 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:

*   Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc.) from the author block of the first page of the paper.
*   To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person.
*   To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements.

After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.

## Policy on Authorship Changes

Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.

## Format

Submissions should use [ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/) and 10-point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.

## Page Limit

To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self-contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)

## Publication

**AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:** The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## Important Dates

AoE (UTC-12h)

*   **Submission deadline:** April 24, 2025
*   **First-round notification:** June 6, 2025

The 19th International Conference on Practical Applications of Computational Biology & Bioinformatics (PACBB'25) will be held at the **University of Lille in Lille, France, from June 25th-27th, 2025**.

PACBB aims to promote interaction among the scientific community to discuss applications of Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence (CS/AI) with an interdisciplinary character, exploring the interactions between sub-areas of CS/AI, Bioinformatics, Chemoinformatics, and Systems Biology.

## Scope

The success of Bioinformatics in recent years has been prompted by research in Molecular Biology and Molecular Medicine. These initiatives gave rise to an exponential increase in the volume and diversification of data, including nucleotide and protein sequences and annotations, high-throughput experimental data, biomedical literature, among many others. Systems Biology is a related research area that has been replacing the reductionist view that dominated Biology research in the last decades, requiring the coordinated efforts of biological researchers with those related to data analysis, mathematical modeling, computer simulation, and optimization. The accumulation and exploitation of large-scale databases prompt for new computational technology and for research into these issues. In this context, many widely successful computational models and tools used by biologists in these initiatives, such as clustering and classification methods for gene expression data, are based on Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence (CS/AI) techniques. In fact, these methods have been helping in tasks related to knowledge discovery, modeling, and optimization tasks, aiming at the development of computational models so that the response of biological complex systems to any perturbation can be predicted.

The 2025 ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation (PEPM 2025) will be held on **January 21, 2025**, at the **Curtis Hotel Denver** in **Denver, Colorado, USA**.

## Scope

PEPM 2025 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular:

*   Semantics based and machine-learning based program synthesis and program optimization.
*   Modeling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications.

More generally, topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation.
*   Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation.
*   Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation.
*   Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security.

## Submission Guidelines

Three kinds of submissions will be accepted:

1.  **Regular Research Papers:** should describe new results, and will be judged on originality, correctness, significance, and clarity. Regular research papers must not exceed 12 pages.
2.  **Short Papers:** may include tool demonstrations and presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of interesting academic, industrial, and open-source applications that are new or unfamiliar. Short papers must not exceed 6 pages.
3.  **Talk Proposals:** may propose lectures about topics of interest for PEPM, existing work representing relevant contributions, or promising contributions that are not mature enough to be proposed as papers of the other categories. Talk Proposals must not exceed 2 pages.

References and appendices are not included in page limits. Appendices may not necessarily be read by reviewers. Both kinds of submissions should be typeset using the two-column ‘sigplan’ sub-format of the new ‘acmart’ format available at: [http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/](http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/).

Submissions are handled electronically via HotCRP: [https://pepm25.hotcrp.com](https://pepm25.hotcrp.com)

Reviewing will be single-blind. Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the two co-chairs).

Accepted regular research papers will appear in formal proceedings published by ACM, and be included in the ACM Digital Library. Accepted short papers do not constitute formal publications and will not appear in the proceedings.

At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the workshop (physically or virtually) to present the work. In the case of tool demonstration papers, a live demonstration of the described tool is expected.

The IFIP PERFORMANCE 2025 conference will be held at the **Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on November 11-14, 2025.**

This conference aims to bring together researchers interested in understanding and improving the performance of computing and communication systems using state-of-the-art quantitative models and solution techniques.

## Important Dates

*   **Submission site opens:** May 1, 2025
*   **Abstract submission:** May 25, 2025
*   **Full paper submission:** June 1, 2025
*   **Notification to authors:** July 30, 2025

## Topics of Interest

We invite submissions of research papers focusing on algorithm design, mathematical analysis and modeling, simulation, and measurement techniques for computer systems and communication networks. We particularly welcome contributions that introduce novel performance evaluation methods or creatively apply existing techniques to predict or gain insights into key design trade-offs across a wide range of computing, networked, and cyber-physical systems.

## Paper Submission

The IFIP Performance 2025 conference accepts submissions in two categories:

*   **Regular papers:** 20 pages
*   **Short papers:** 10 pages

### Format of Regular Paper Submissions

Regular papers should not exceed 20 pages for technical content, including all tables and figures (references are excluded from the page limit). Authors are recommended to use the Elsevier article class `elsarticle.cls` (with the 3p document class option) to prepare their manuscript and BibTeX to generate their bibliography. See also the guide for authors: [https://www.elsevier.com/journals/performance-evaluation/0166-5316/guide-for-authors](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/performance-evaluation/0166-5316/guide-for-authors).

Authors may include an appendix (of unrestricted length) but only to justify the technical correctness of the claims stated in the main paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. However, the appendix should serve as supplementary material only, as reviewers will evaluate the novelty and significance of the submission based on the main content of the paper and are not obligated to review the appendix.

### Format of Short Paper Submissions

Short papers are limited to 10 pages for technical content, including all tables and figures (references are excluded from the page limit). Authors may include an appendix (of unrestricted length) but only to justify the technical correctness of the claims stated in the main paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. However, the appendix should serve as supplementary material only, as reviewers will evaluate the novelty and significance of the submission based on the main content of the paper and are not obligated to review the appendix.

Accepted short papers will be published in a special ACM Performance Evaluation Review (PER) issue. Please find the style files [here](https://performance2025.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/1).

### Instructions for All Submissions

Papers must be submitted through the hotCRP platform ([https://performance2025.hotcrp.com/](https://performance2025.hotcrp.com/)) in printable PDF form. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review.

All submissions will be reviewed using a double-blind review process. The identity of authors and referees will not be revealed to each other.

## Tracks

IFIP Performance uses “soft” tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions. Regardless of the selected track, all submissions will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element.

*   Learning
*   Measurement & Applied Modelling
*   Systems
*   Theory

## Ethical Considerations

Papers describing experiments with users or user data should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence, minimal risk, voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues.

## Diversity & Inclusiveness

As part of our efforts to foster diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or conference presentation."

PLDI is the premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research.","# PLDI 2025: Call for Papers

The 46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 2025) will be held in **Seoul, South Korea from Monday, June 16 to Friday, June 20, 2025**.

PLDI is the premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research, covering the areas of design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance.

## Scope

PLDI welcomes outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all in scope for PLDI.

## Evaluation Criteria and Process

Reviewers will evaluate submissions for accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. The selection of papers will be made in two rounds of reviewing. In the first round, reviewers will assess the papers according to the quality criteria listed above. Authors will be given several days to compose a written response to the reviews received in the first round. At the end of the first round, the Review Committee will conditionally accept a subset of the submissions and all other submissions will be rejected. In the second round, authors of conditionally-accepted papers will be given an opportunity to improve specific aspects of the research and the paper, as identified by the reviewers.  The Review Committee will make final decisions regarding (conditional) acceptance and rejection.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

Author names and affiliations must be omitted from submissions. If a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in the third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized.

## Submission Site Information

The submission site will be at [https://pldi25.hotcrp.com/](https://pldi25.hotcrp.com/). Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no deadline for submitting abstracts.

## Declaring Conflicts

When submitting a paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).

## Formatting Requirements

Each paper should have no more than 20 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the ACM Proceedings format. Use of a different format is grounds for summary rejection. PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the [SIGPLAN author information page](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/).

## Supplementary Material

Authors are welcome to provide supplementary material if that material supports the claims in the paper. Such material may include proofs, experimental results, and/or data sets. This material should be uploaded at the same time as the submission. Reviewers are not required to examine the supplementary material but may refer to it if they would like to find further evidence supporting the claims in the paper.

Supplemental material cannot be included in the main submission text. All appendices must be submitted as supplemental material, not as part of the main submission PDF.

## Plagiarism and Concurrent Work

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere.

## Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers.

## Open Access and Copyright

As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support liberal open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license.

## Publication Date

All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library or the first day of the conference, whichever is sooner.

## Presentations

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work at PLDI. Authors who need financial assistance for travel to the conferences should apply for a grant from the SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (PAC) program.

## Submission Page

[https://podc25.hotcrp.com](https://podc25.hotcrp.com)

## Paper Submission

A submitted paper should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A submission should strive to be accessible to a broad audience, as well as having sufficient details for experts in the area.

### Regular Papers

A regular paper must report on original research that has not been previously published. It is not permitted to submit the same material concurrently to journals or conferences with proceedings.

### Brief Announcements

A brief announcement may describe work in progress or work presented elsewhere. A brief announcement may also report on original research results that can be fully presented in the limited space available. The title of a brief announcement must begin with “Brief Announcement: ”.

## Submission Format

All submissions should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Alternatively, papers can also be submitted by using the official ACM Master article LaTeX template acmart.cls, version 1.80 or greater, using the following documentclass instruction: `\documentclass[acmsmall,nonacm,anonymous]{acmart}`. The template is available at [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

## Double-blind Reviewing

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way.

## Conflict of Interest

Indications of conflicts of interest will be required in the submission form.

## Publication

Accepted regular papers of up to 10 pages and brief announcements of up to 3 pages in two-column ACM proceedings format will be included in the conference proceedings. They must be formatted with the ACM Master templates using `\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}`.

If more space than available in the proceedings for an accepted paper is needed, a full version must be available publicly, e.g., on arXiv, by the due date for the proceedings version, and the proceedings version must refer to this.

It is expected that papers that are published at PODC 2025 are presented by one of the authors in person at the conference. In exceptional circumstances (e.g., because of visa issues), a limited number of exceptions can be approved by the PC chair. A paid conference registration by one of the authors of each accepted paper will be required in any case.

The 2025 conference will be held in Berlin, Germany, on June 22 - 27, 2025.","# PODS 2025: Call for Research Papers

The Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management.

The 2025 conference will be held in **Berlin, Germany**.

## Mission

The PODS community aims to provide a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques, and solutions for the data management challenges that continually arise in our data-driven society. It develops new ways of advancing data management to reflect the rich landscape of data requirements in applications nowadays. Our goal is to develop solutions that ensure high levels of efficiency, scalability, usability, expressiveness, robustness, security, clarity, and privacy, among others.

## Scope

PODS seeks scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application, and system building in the context of data management. Such articles might be based, among others, on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks that deserve further exploration, providing experimental work that sheds light on the scientific foundations of the discipline, or a rigorous analysis of important industry artifacts.

## Topics

Topics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to:

*   Database processing
*   Database design
*   Database access
*   Data quality
*   Data analysis
*   Uncertainty
*   Interoperability
*   Responsible data management
*   Human-database interaction
*   Connections between database principles and other disciplines

## Submission Site

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025)

## Submission Format

**Important:** The submission format for PODS 2025 is different from that of previous years, for compatibility with the PACMMOD format of the PODS publications.

LaTeX users must format their submission using the standard ACM ""acmsmall"" proceedings stylesheet: [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)

They must use the following class declaration: `\documentclass[acmsmall,review,anonymous]{acmart}`

A submission can be up to 15 pages, not including references, plus unlimited space for references. Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, of unlimited length, that should be incorporated at submission time; online appendices are not allowed. However, an appendix will be read at the discretion of the program committee. Papers that are longer than 15 pages or do not cohere with the required format style risk rejection without consideration of their merits. The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere, including the formal proceedings of other symposia or workshops.

## Double-anonymous reviewing

PODS 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous reviewing process. This means that submissions must adhere to the following:

*   Author names and institutions must be omitted.
*   References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person.
*   Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed.

## Important Dates

**FIRST SUBMISSION PHASE (All Deadlines are 5 PM Pacific Time):**

*   Abstract: May 31, 2024

The 52nd ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL 2025) will take place in **Denver, Colorado, from January 19-25, 2025**.

## Scope

POPL is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

POPL 2025 will use a full double-blind reviewing process. This means that identities of authors will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted papers.

## Evaluation Process

POPL 2025 will have five Associate Chairs who will help the PC Chair monitor reviews, solicit external expert reviews for submissions when there is not enough expertise on the committee, and facilitate reviewer discussions.

As in previous years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to reviews. Responses are optional. A response must be concise, addressing specific points raised in the reviews; in particular, it must not introduce new technical results. Reviewers will write a short reaction to these author responses.

## Submission Site Information

The submission site is [https://popl25.hotcrp.com](https://popl25.hotcrp.com).

Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline.

The submission deadline is **11:59 PM July 11, 2024**, anywhere on earth.

## Conflicts of Interest

For each submission, the authors must make sure that they properly declare all potential conflicts of interest for all of the authors of that submission.

## Submission Guidelines

Each paper should have no more than 25 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the PACMPL format (specifically, the `acmart` LaTeX class with `acmsmall` option).

Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and the ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent paper submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar forums of publication are not allowed.

## Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers

Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be invited to formally submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process.

## Copyright, Publication, and Presentation

As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support libre open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license.

## Distinguished Paper Awards
