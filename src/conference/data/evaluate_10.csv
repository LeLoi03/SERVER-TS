The ACM/SPEC International Conference on Performance Engineering (ICPE) is the leading international forum for presenting and discussing novel ideas, innovations, trends, and experiences in the field of performance engineering. ICPE 2025 will be held at **York University in Toronto, Canada, from May 5-9, 2025**.

## Scope

Today’s systems are complex, rely increasingly on dynamic distributed architectures, and raise continuously important challenges related to end-to-end performance management. This applies equally to emerging domains, such as systems of systems, interconnected and embedded systems, distributed data and intelligence, machine learning environments, human-centered computing, non-von Neumann architectures, cloud/edge/fog infrastructures, data streaming, and social networks, and also to traditional domains, such as web-based, data centers, mobile and wireless systems, and real-time systems. As a result, our systems become more complex and, therefore, more difficult to engineer and understand. We need to manage this complexity so that our systems remain reliable, trustworthy, and performant.

ICPE brings together researchers and practitioners to report state-of-the-art and in-progress research on performance engineering of software, networks, and systems, including but not limited to performance modeling, analysis, measurement, benchmark design, and run-time performance management. The focus is both on classical metrics such as response time, throughput, resource utilization, and (energy) efficiency and on the relationship of such metrics to other system properties, including but not limited to scalability, elasticity, availability, reliability, cost, sustainability, security, and privacy.

## Topics of Interest

*   Performance Measurement and Empirical Evaluation
*   Performance Benchmarking
*   Performance Modeling of Software and Systems
*   Design and Development Processes
*   Run-time Performance Management and Adaptation
*   Platform-Related Optimizations

## Systems of Interest

*   Cyber-physical domain, IoT, industrial internet
*   Networked and embedded systems
*   Advanced computer architectures, including non-von Neumann
*   Communication networks, wireless and mobile
*   Peer-to-peer environments, ad-hoc networks
*   Machine learning and AI-based systems
*   SOA, microservices, web-based environments
*   Big data systems, stream, and graph processing
*   HPC systems, cloud, edge, grid, and fog
*   Social networks, multimedia systems, and applications

## Types of Submissions

ICPE caters to a wide range of submission types with eight distinct submission tracks:

*   Research Track

The 45th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (IEEE ICDCS 2025) will be held in **Glasgow, Scotland, UK, from July 20-23, 2025**.

## Scope

The conference is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners to present, discuss, and exchange cutting-edge ideas and the latest findings on topics related to all aspects of distributed computing systems.

## Tracks

Papers can be submitted to one of the following tracks:

*   Cloud Computing
*   Distributed Algorithms
*   Big Data, Models & Systems
*   Distributed Fault Tolerance
*   Distributed OS and Middleware
*   Edge Computing
*   IoT + CPS
*   Mobile Computing
*   Security, Privacy and Trust
*   Blockchains/Databases
*   Distributed Systems for AI/ML
*   AI/ML for Distributed Systems
*   Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures

## Paper Submission

The Paper strand provides the opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.

Papers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. All paper submissions should follow the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template ([https://template-selector.ieee.org/](https://template-selector.ieee.org/)). Each submission can have up to eleven (11) pages (including figures, tables, appendices, and references). Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review.

The paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content. To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymized GitHub repository with all source code, scripts, and data needed for the reproduction of their results.

For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference in-person to present their work on-site. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.

Note that the authors should adhere to ethics and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer to IEEE Code of Ethics and [IEEE Policy of AI-Generated Text](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/#ai-generated-text).

## Evaluation

Submissions that are not in compliance with the required submission format or that are out of the scope of the conference will be desk-rejected without being reviewed. All submissions that meet the submission criteria and fit the scope of the conference will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.

## Paper Submission

Please use the following link to submit to the research track: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsme2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsme2025)

Submitted papers must comply with IEEE plagiarism policy and procedures. Papers submitted to ICSME 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration for ICSME 2025. Submitting the same paper to different tracks of ICSME 2025 is also not allowed. ICSME 2025 will use a double anonymous reviewing process.

## Paper Format

Papers must strictly adhere to the two-column IEEE conference proceedings format. Papers must not exceed 10 pages (including figures and appendices) plus up to 2 pages that contain ONLY references. All submissions must be in PDF and must be submitted online by the deadline via the ICSME 2025 EasyChair link.

## Special Issue

Authors of select papers from the research track will be invited to submit extended versions of their work to a special issue of the Springer International Journal of Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE).

## Author Response Period

ICSME 2025 will offer an author response period. During this period, the authors will have the opportunity to inspect the reviews and answer specific questions raised by the program committee.

## Early Decisions

ICSME 2025 will make early decisions: If reviewers already decide that a paper can be accepted in its current state without requiring any further input from the authors, the authors will receive an “Accept” decision at the beginning of the author response period and will not be required to submit a response. Conversely, if the paper is perceived to be in a highly deficient state by the reviewers, leading them to conclude that the authors’ response is unlikely to alter their evaluation significantly, the authors will receive a “Reject” decision at the beginning of the author response period and will not be asked to submit a response. All other papers will receive a “Response Recommended” notification at the beginning of the author response period. However, as customary, it is still up to the authors to decide if they want to submit an author response.

## Publication and Presentation

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. All authors of all accepted papers will be asked to complete an electronic IEEE Copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing their camera-ready versions. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper at the conference.

## Open Science Policy

ICSME encourages open science. Sharing of data sets, replication packages, or preprints is expected to be the default, and non-sharing needs to be justified.

## Important Dates

All submission dates are at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth)

### Early Submissions

Authors are invited to consider early submissions (deadline May 9, 2025). In the early submission round, only papers submitted as full/regular papers will be considered, and they will go through a full peer-review process. An early submitted paper that is accepted will be included in the proceedings. An early submitted paper that is rejected can be still revised and submitted to the normal submission round by the given deadline. If the authors of an early submitted paper that is rejected decide to resubmit their paper to the normal submission round, they will have to include an appendix (maximum 2 pages) describing how they have addressed the comments received by the reviewers from the early submission.

### Regular Submissions

Authors are welcome to submit papers to the regular submission round by the given deadline. To do so, they need to submit an abstract by July 1, 2025. After the regular submission deadline, the papers resubmitted from the early submission round and those submitted only to the regular submission round will undergo the same review process as other submissions. The decisions made from this regular review procedure will be final, and no resubmission will be permitted afterwards.

## Keynote Talk

**Keynote by Tommi Mikkonen (University of Jyväskylä, Finland)**

**Title:** AI-assisted Development — Next-Generation Software Reuse?

**Summary:** Software development is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and the increasing reliance on generative software reuse. These emerging technologies are reshaping every stage of the software development lifecycle, from specification and design to testing and deployment. Traditionally, software reuse involved developers leveraging existing libraries, frameworks, and components, carefully integrating them into new systems while maintaining a deep understanding of their functionality. However, this paradigm is shifting as AI-driven approaches gain traction. While this transformation offers significant advantages—such as faster development cycles, reduced effort, and automated optimization—it also introduces new challenges. One of the most pressing concerns is that software engineers may increasingly rely on AI-generated code without fully comprehending its underlying logic, structure, or potential vulnerabilities. In this keynote, we explore the impact of AI-driven software reuse and highlight some key questions that need to be addressed.

The conference aims to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of research related to the foundational aspects of Information Retrieval (IR), including new or improved models of relevance, ranking, representation, information needs, and evaluation.  ICTIR 2025 welcomes both regular and SIGIR Revise-and-Resubmit (SIGIR-RR) submissions.","# ICTIR 2025: Call for Papers

The 11th ACM SIGIR International Conference on Innovative Concepts and Theories in Information Retrieval (ICTIR 2025) will be held on **July 18, 2025, in Padua, Italy**.

ICTIR 2025 invites submissions with substantial and original research on innovative and foundational contributions to the field of Information Retrieval.  This includes original research on the theoretical aspects of Information Retrieval, topics from neighboring fields with a strong and clear connection to Information Retrieval, and novel approaches and methods for developing, improving, and evaluating models related to the field of Information Retrieval.

## Special Theme: “LLMs + IR, what could possibly go wrong?”

ICTIR 2025 especially welcomes research papers related to the theme: “LLMs + IR, what could possibly go wrong?”  This theme focuses on the long-term relationship between LLMs and IR. We are seeking both innovative and foundational technical research papers and discussion papers that methodologically study this theme by providing impactful perspectives, opinions, or positions on the matter.

## Submission Types

New to ICTIR, we welcome two types of submissions:

*   **Regular**
*   **SIGIR-Revise-and-Resubmit (SIGIR-RR)** submissions (for revised manuscripts of papers submitted to but not accepted by SIGIR 2025)

## Double-blind Reviewing

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any obvious way.  However, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference.
*   The page limit is 9 pages in ACM SIGIR style, excluding the references and the optional appendix.
*   Submissions will be evaluated based on the merits of their contents, not on the number of pages.
*   Submissions must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 9 pages in length (including figures, tables, proofs, acknowledgments, and any content except references and optional appendices), with unrestricted space for references, in the current ACM two-column conference format.
*   Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via OpenReview: [https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/SIGIR/ICTIR/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/SIGIR/ICTIR/2025/Conference)

## Presentation at the Conference

At least one author of an accepted paper must register and present the work at ICTIR 2025.  The works will be presented either as a long or short talk, with an optional poster presentation or invitation to the panel.

## Key Dates

*   **Paper submission deadline:** Thursday, April 24, 2025 (or two weeks after the SIGIR 2025 full paper notification deadline, whichever is later)
*   **Notification of acceptance:** Thursday, June 5, 2025

The 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025) will take place between **July 22-26, 2025 in Palermo, Italy**.

## Theme

“AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future”

The AIED 2025 conference centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education. By harnessing AI’s capacity to personalize learning experiences, educators can address the diverse needs of students and mitigate educational disparities, particularly among underserved and marginalized communities. This year’s theme also underscores the critical importance of ethical AI integration, ensuring that these advanced technologies are deployed responsibly to uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and privacy.

## Tracks

For its main paper submissions, AIED 2025 solicits empirical and theoretical papers relating to both AI and education in the following lines of research and application, which represent our research tracks:

*   Track 1 – AIED architectures and tools
*   Track 2 – Machine learning and Generative AI
*   Track 3 – Learning, teaching and pedagogy
*   Track 4 – Human-centered design and design-based research
*   Track 5 – Teaching AI
*   Track 6 – Ethics, Equity, and AIED in Society
*   Track 7 – Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modelling for Education

## Submission Instructions

We invite the following main submissions to the conference, to be submitted directly to one of the above research tracks:

*   **Full paper submission:** Full papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Full papers will be presented as long oral talks. Papers submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper.
*   **Short paper submission:** Short papers are expected to describe novel and interesting results to the overall community at large. The goal is to give novel but not necessarily mature work a chance to be seen by other researchers and practitioners and to be discussed at the conference. Short papers will be presented as short oral talks.

Submissions must follow Springer policies on publication (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process): [https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v](https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v).

## Review Process

All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the program committee, followed by a metareview conducted by a senior member of the program committee (all double-masked) to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation.

## Anonymity

The review process will be double-masked, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous. To this end, authors should:

*   Eliminate all information that could lead to their identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, projects and/or systems)
*   Cite own prior work (if needed) in the third person
*   Eliminate acknowledgments and references to funding sources

## Important Dates (full and short papers, main submission)

*   **Submissions open:** December 20, 2024
*   **Abstracts due:** February 12, 2025
*   **Papers due:** February 19, 2025
