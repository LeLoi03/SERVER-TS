The CASC workshop series has been running for over two decades to explore the interaction of computer algebra and scientific computing. CASC 2025 will be held in **Dubai, The United Arab Emirates, from November 24 – 28, 2025**.

## Scope

The topics addressed in the workshop cover:

1.  The theory of symbolic computation and its implementation in computer algebra systems.
2.  All other areas of scientific computing in regards to their benefit from or use of computer algebra methods and software.
3.  Applications of the above throughout the natural sciences and engineering.

We welcome papers on both fundamental research and implementation issues. We also accept survey papers but these MUST BE CLEARLY LABELLED as such in the title.

## Conference Participation Options

We encourage wide participation at the workshop. We offer a variety of participation options:

1.  **Participation with an accompanying paper in LNCS:**
    *   CASC has a long-running relationship with the Springer book series Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) to publish conference proceedings.
    *   Work submitted here should contain an original research result.
    *   Submissions should be prepared in the LNCS style and not exceed 20 pages. Survey papers may have up to 25 pages.
2.  **Participation with abstract only:**
    *   Participants may opt to submit an extended abstract instead. These should have at least 2 and at most 4 pages in the LNCS style. They must contain the main results of the talk (without proofs).
    *   They will be lightly reviewed and distributed locally at the conference.
    *   We see three main audiences for this option:
        *   Those who wish to talk on previously published work (in which case that work should be clearly cited in the abstract).
        *   Those whose work is not yet ready for publication, but wish to receive feedback.
        *   Those who plan to submit a journal paper on the work shortly.

## Accompanying Topical Collection of Mathematics in Computer Science

CASC has formed a relationship with the Springer Birkhäuser journal Mathematics in Computer Science (MCS) for an ongoing series of topical collections on topics presented at CASC workshops. Work submitted here must be of journal quality and will be reviewed to the usual standards of MCS. Submission will be opened after the conference for authors of extended abstracts presented at that year's conference.

## Format

Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper and an abstract of 1-2 paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. A submission must contain within its first 10 pages a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including discussion of its importance, prior work, and an outline of key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims (similar to the content of a brief oral presentation). There is no bound on the total length of a submission, but material other than the abstract, references, and the first 10 pages is considered as supplementary and will be read at the committee's discretion.

Submissions should include proofs of all central claims. The submission should be in single-column format, use at least 11-point font, at least 1-inch margins, and at least single-spacing between lines. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Instructions for formatting camera-ready versions will be communicated to the authors of accepted papers.

## Review Process

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. (Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.)

## Publication

*   **Online posting:** Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the [Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity](http://eccc.hpi-web.de/eccc) or the arXiv.
*   **Proceedings:** The conference proceedings will be published under a Creative Commons BY license in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series.
*   **Presentation:** Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the conference. The program committee will determine time allocations for presentations (between 15 and 45 minutes).

## Awards

*   **EATCS Luca Trevisan award for the CCC best student paper:** This award will be given to the best paper written solely by one or more students as judged by the program committee.
*   **Best paper award:** This award will be given to the best paper submitted to the conference as judged by the program committee.
*   **Special journal issue:** The program committee will invite full versions of a select number of conference submissions to a special issue of the journal *Computational Complexity*.

CCS 2025 will be held in Taipei, Taiwan from October 13-17, 2025.","# ACM CCS 2025: Call for Papers

The 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) will be held in **Taipei, Taiwan from October 13-17, 2025.**

CCS seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice.

## Review Cycles

CCS has two review cycles in 2025. For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:

*   **Accept:** Papers will be accepted for publication and presentation at the conference, possibly after minor changes.
*   **Minor revision:** Papers are promising but need minor additional work. Authors will be given the opportunity to resubmit.
*   **Reject:** Papers are declined.

Papers rejected from the first review cycle may not be submitted again to the second review cycle.

## Paper Submission Information

*   All submissions must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the corresponding deadline.
*   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings.
*   All submissions should be properly anonymized.
*   Authors may submit up to a maximum of 7 papers for Cycle B.

## Mandatory Reviewing

Authors submitting 3 papers or more may be required to submit reviews for other papers at CCS 2025. Authors who fall into this category will be requested to provide information for review matching and complete an attestation for reviewing ethics. Authors failing to provide the requested information may see their paper desk-rejected.

## Withdrawing Policy

A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper cannot be withdrawn.

## Paper Format

Submissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format using ""sigconf"" 2-column format, no more than 12 pages long, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.

The Cognitive Science Society invites members and non-members to submit their work for individual oral and poster presentations, as well as contributed symposia, for CogSci 2025. The conference will be held from **July 30 – August 2, 2025**, at the **Marriott Marquis in San Francisco, CA**.  CogSci 2025 will be fully hybrid.

## Submission Categories

There are three categories of main conference submissions:

*   Research papers (presented as talks or posters)
*   Contributed symposia
*   Member abstracts

## Submission Guidelines

*   All submissions (with the exception of abstract-only publications) must be made electronically as PDF files using the templates provided.
*   All files must be uploaded via the PCS submission portal: [https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login?society=cogsci](https://new.precisionconference.com/user/login?society=cogsci)
*   Abstracts may only be submitted as plain text.
*   All authors, primary and secondary, must have a current PCS submission portal account.

## Evaluation Criteria

*   Initial paper submissions and member abstracts should follow the double-blind reviewing policy, or they will be rejected directly.
*   Deviating from the submission templates will result in a desk rejection.
*   All submissions must be uploaded via the PCS submission portal: [https://new.precisionconference.com/cogsci](https://new.precisionconference.com/cogsci)

## Double-Blind Review Procedures

All submissions must be anonymized. No information that would reveal author identity should be included.  Submissions that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected.

## Submission Formats

### Paper Submissions

Submitted research papers may be no more than six pages long, with an unlimited number of pages for references, and must use the two-column format. Reviews of paper submissions will be double-blind; thus, the submissions must be anonymized.
