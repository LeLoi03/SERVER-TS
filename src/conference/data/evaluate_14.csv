The 22nd International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence (MDAI 2025) will be held in **València, Spain, from September 15-18, 2025**.

## Aims and Goals

In MDAI, we are particularly interested in the different facets of decision processes in a broad sense. This includes model building and all kinds of mathematical tools for data aggregation, information fusion, and decision making; tools to help decision in data science problems (including e.g., statistical and machine learning algorithms as well as data visualization tools); and algorithms for data privacy and transparency-aware methods so that data processing processes and decisions made from them are fair, transparent, explainable, and avoid unnecessary disclosure of sensitive information.

The MDAI conference includes the following tracks:

*   Human decision making
*   Aggregation functions
*   Data science and machine learning
*   Data privacy
*   Graphs and (social) networks
*   Information security

## Submission and Publication

Original technical contributions are sought. Contributions will be selected on the basis of their quality. Papers should not exceed 12 pages in total (using LNCS/LNAI style).

Proceedings with accepted papers will be published in the LNAI/LNCS series (Springer-Verlag) and distributed at the conference. Besides, papers that, according to the evaluation of the referees, are not suitable for the LNAI but that have some merits will be published in some additional proceedings (with ISBN) and scheduled in the MDAI program. Direct submission to these other proceedings is also possible.

## Important Dates

*   **LNAI Submission deadline:** April 12, 2025

## Program Chairs' Policy

The Program Chair(s) are responsible for the paper selection process and do not submit papers to avoid potential bias. Program Committee members and the Organizing Committee, including the General Chair(s), are allowed to submit papers because of double-blind reviewing and conflict-of-interest declaration and enforcement. The rationale for explicitly allowing General Chair(s) to submit is that they do not participate in the paper selection process, nor are they involved in the Program Chair and Program Committee selection process.

## Theme & Goals

With the steep increase in empirical studies and the advent of secondary studies that aggregate their results, a main concern is their quality. The workshop aims to increase awareness of the importance of quality and appropriateness in the methods applied during the different stages of software engineering empirical studies to yield reliable results and to disseminate this knowledge to the broader SE community. This year, we are placing a special emphasis on Machine Learning (ML). We encourage submissions that explore the integration and application of ML techniques throughout the empirical process.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

*   Issues with the motivation and definition of appropriate research questions.
*   Issues with the operationalization, e.g., missing standard metrics.
*   Issues with the systematic identification of threats to validity and how to address them.
*   Issues selecting an appropriate study design and the consequences of that selection.
*   Issues with drawing appropriate conclusions from the findings and generalizing them.
*   Issues with aggregating results from individual studies.
*   Issues with reproduction, replication, or families of studies.
*   Issues with quantitative, qualitative approaches and combined approaches.
*   Issues with understanding failures and successes: lessons learned.

## Paper Categories

*   **Technical papers (6-8 pages including references):** formally describe studies, explain how they were designed and executed to overcome challenges, highlight concrete results, and describe any advances to the state-of-the-art.
*   **Experience reports / Work in progress (4-6 pages including references):** describe the experience in conducting studies and lessons learned that address methodological issues.
*   **Vision / Position papers (2-4 pages including references):** describe new directions in conducting empirical studies including convincing arguments supported by clear rationale.
*   **Panel proposals (1-2 pages including references):** discuss hot topics about conducting empirical studies.

Papers must describe original work that has not been submitted to or presented at other forums (although the studies described may have been). Accepted papers will be published in the ICSE workshop proceedings.

## Submission Information

Submissions will be made via HotCRP. Papers must be formatted according to [ICSE 2025 guidelines](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2025/icse-2025-research-track#submission-process). Please note that WSESE does not follow a double-anonymous review process.

The MobiCom conference series serves as a highly selective, premier international forum addressing networks, systems, algorithms, and applications that support mobile computers and wireless networks.","# MobiCom 2025: Call for Papers

The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design, and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems, and applications.

## MobiCom 2025 Emphasis

MobiCom 2025 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. The review process will take both cases into account as intellectual merit and novelty can be found in techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work.

## Special Category: Challenge, Experience, and Verification Papers

MobiCom 2025 will have a separate category for challenge, experience, and verification papers. These are full papers that provide detailed technical insights from real-world deployments, especially in settings that are not easy for most in the community to duplicate (e.g., due to scale).

*   **Final Notifications:** May 29, 2025
*   **Camera-ready:** June 19, 2025

## Preparing the Submission

### Novelty

The submission must be original work. It cannot have been published elsewhere nor be under concurrent review for publication by another conference or journal.

### Length

Typical page length is 4000 and 9000 words (excluding references and appendix), but any page length is allowed as long as the paper contribution is commensurate. If the paper is more than 12,000 words, we may reject it if no justification is provided. References and the appendix do not count toward the paper length. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a submission relative to its length, so papers with a length disproportionate to their contribution will likely be rejected. Shorter, more focused papers are encouraged and will be reviewed appropriately. The abstract has to be a paragraph of 150 words or less.

### Formatting

Papers must be in English. Authors are required to use the single-column ACM Manuscript template. Submission preparation is described on the ACM Primary Template website.

### Anonymity

All submissions need to be fully anonymized. This includes any appendices or supplemental material as well as a potential acknowledgments section. Citations to the authors’ own previous work are NOT allowed to be anonymized. This allows reviewers to ensure all previous research has been taken into account. However authors should refer to their own prior work in the third person.

### Supplementary Materials

All videos and supplementary material must be anonymized. Videos can be of any length and should include closed captions and audio descriptions; see Accessible Presentation Guide. Other supplementary material may include, for example, survey text, experimental protocols, source code, and data, all of which can help others replicate the work. Authors should submit any non-video supplementary material as a single .zip file, including a README file with a description of the materials. Reviewers should be able to access the contribution of the paper solely based on the main PDF submission. That is, the paper submission must stand independently without the supplementary material.

### Accessibility

Authors are required to follow SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission. If authors have questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs via [diversity2025@mobilehci.acm.org](mailto:diversity2025@mobilehci.acm.org) early in the writing process.

### Use of Generative AI

Authors must adhere to the ACM Policy on Authorship regarding the use of generative AI in submissions. Authors are responsible for all content produced (including plagiarism, misrepresentation, or fabrication) by these tools and must disclose their use.

## Submitting

### Submission Platform

Submissions are facilitated via the Precision Conference System (PCS).

### Metadata Integrity

Changes in author names are not allowed after the submission deadline; there are no exceptions. Changes to the order of authors are allowed only before the camera-ready deadline. The metadata is crucial to the integrity of the review process and author representation.

## Selection Process

We use a refereed process, i.e., an editorial board and a set of external reviewers will review the submitted papers.

## Upon Acceptance

### Publication

The paper publication is archival, i.e., accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library as part of the Proceedings of ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACMHCI).

### Presentation Format

Upon acceptance, we will invite authors to present their papers at the conference.

### Conference Registration

For each accepted paper, at least one author must register for the MobileHCI 2025 conference by the early bird registration deadline.

### Demo

The Demo Chairs might invite authors of accepted papers to participate in the demo session. For this, authors have to submit an additional document describing the technical requirements for the demo.

Full papers are expected to describe new techniques and/or novel research results, to have a high degree of technical rigor, and to be evaluated scientifically. Short papers are expected to discuss controversial issues in the field or present interesting or thought-provoking ideas that are not yet fully developed. Submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

*   **Soundness:** How well the paper’s contributions address the research questions posed and are backed by a thorough application of relevant research procedures.
*   **Relevance:** The extent to which the paper successfully argues or illustrates that its contributions help bridge a significant knowledge gap or tackle a crucial practical issue within the field of software engineering.
*   **Novelty:** How original the paper’s contributions are in comparison to existing knowledge or how significantly they contribute to the current body of knowledge. Note that this doesn’t discourage well-motivated replication studies.
*   **Presentation:** How well-structured and clear the paper’s argumentation is, how clearly the contributions are articulated, the legibility of figures and tables, and the adequacy of English language usage. All papers should comply with the formatting instructions provided.
*   **Replicability:** The extent to which the paper’s claims can be independently verified through available replication packages and/or sufficient information included in the paper to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how a proposed technique works.

## Junior PC

MSR 2025 will once again integrate junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!

The main goal is to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members.

## Submission Process

Submissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template. Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the [submission site](https://msr2025-technical.hotcrp.com/) by the submission deadline. However, we encourage authors to submit at least the paper abstract and author details well in advance of the deadline, to leave enough time to properly enter conflicts of interest for anonymous reviewing.

*   All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version. The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance).
*   Submissions must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions.
*   By submitting to MSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ.
*   Papers submitted to MSR 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2025. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases.
*   By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including [ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).
*   Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID.
*   The MSR 2025 Technical Track will employ a double-anonymous review process.
*   By submitting to MSR 2025, authors acknowledge that they conform to the [authorship policy of the ACM](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship), and [the authorship policy of the IEEE](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/definition-of-authorship/).
*   Submissions should also include a supporting statement on the data availability, per the Open Science policy below.
*   Authors will have a chance to see the reviews and respond to reviewer comments before any decision about the submission is made.

## Open Science Policy

The MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. We expect all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility, replicability, and/or recoverability of the studies, provided that there are no ethical, legal, technical, economic, or sensible barriers preventing the disclosure.

The International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction (MPC) aims to promote the development of mathematical principles and techniques that are demonstrably practical and effective in the process of constructing computer programs.

MPC 2019 was held in **Porto, Portugal from 7-9 October 2019**, co-located with the International Symposium on Formal Methods, FM 2019.

## Scope

MPC seeks original papers on mathematical methods and tools put to use in program construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to support for program construction in programming languages and systems. Typical areas include type systems, program analysis and transformation, programming language semantics, security, and program logics. The notion of a 'program' is interpreted broadly, ranging from algorithms to hardware.

Theoretical contributions are welcome, provided that their relevance to program construction is clear. Reports on applications are welcome, provided that their mathematical basis is evident. We also encourage the submission of 'programming pearls' that present elegant and instructive examples of the mathematics of program construction.

## Submission

Submission was in two stages:

*   Abstracts (plain text, maximum 250 words) were submitted by May 7, 2019.
*   Full papers (pdf, formatted using the llncs.sty style file for LaTeX) were submitted by May 10, 2019. There was no prescribed page limit, but authors should strive for brevity.

Both abstracts and papers were submitted using [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mpc20190).

Papers had to present previously unpublished work and not be submitted concurrently to any other publication venue. Submissions were evaluated by the program committee according to their relevance, correctness, significance, originality, and clarity. Each submission should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work. Accepted papers had to be presented in person at the conference by one of the authors.

The proceedings of MPC 2019 were published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Authors of accepted papers were expected to transfer copyright to Springer for this purpose. After the conference, authors of the best papers from MPC 2019 and MPC 2015 were invited to submit revised versions to a special issue of Science of Computer Programming (SCP).

## Overview

NAACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. NAACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results.

As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.

## Submission Topics

NAACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas:

*   Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics
*   Dialogue and Interactive Systems
*   Discourse and Pragmatics
*   Efficient/Low-resource Methods for NLP
*   Ethics, Bias, and Fairness
*   Generation
*   Human-centered NLP
*   Information Extraction
*   Information Retrieval and Text Mining
*   Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP
*   Language Modeling
*   Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics
*   Machine Learning for NLP
*   Machine Translation
*   Multilinguality and Language Diversity
*   Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond
*   Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation
*   Question Answering
*   Resources and Evaluation
*   Semantics: Lexical, Sentence-level, Textual Inference and Other areas
*   Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining
*   Speech recognition, text-to-speech and spoken language understanding
*   Summarization
*   Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing / ML
*   NLP Applications

### Special Theme: NLP in a Multicultural World

Current NLP tools and models, especially LLMs, require vast amounts of data to train. However, the data used often favors only a handful of over-represented languages, and even for these majoritarian languages only some of the existing geographical or cultural varieties are considered, leaving a large tail of under-represented languages, varieties, and cultures that have had considerably less attention from the NLP community. In this year’s theme track we would like to focus on work providing support to the vibrant multicultural world we live in. We welcome papers in the following non-exhaustive list of topics:

*   Cultural localization of language models.
*   New NLP applications to support people from diverse cultures.
*   Revitalization or refunctionalization of endangered or sleeping languages.
*   Analysis of cultural biases in language models.
*   Historical considerations and diachronic analysis.

## Submission Details

Both long and short paper submissions should follow all of the [ARR submission requirements](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#paper-submission-information), including:

*   Long Papers (8 pages)
*   Short Papers (4 pages)
*   Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers’ comments.

## Review Process

NAACL 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference.

## Presentation at the Conference

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options.

## Submission Guidelines

### Novelty

The submission must be original work. It cannot have been published elsewhere nor be under concurrent review for publication by another conference or journal. Papers should be grounded in existing literature and knowledge and written for an interdisciplinary audience.

### Length and Contribution

Submissions can be of variable length. The paper length must match the contribution. Using the single-column format, the maximum length for a full paper is 16 pages (excluding references) and the maximum length for a short paper is 7 pages (excluding references).

Successful full-paper submissions typically represent significant empirical, theoretical, or methodological advances in the field. Successful short-paper submissions offer more focused contributions with a smaller scope; they are not intended to be work-in-progress reports. Instead, they should offer complete, rigorously developed work with a solid contribution to the field.

### Formatting

Submissions must be in PDF format. Papers must be in English. All references must be complete, accurate, accessible, and conform to the ACM Publication Format. Authors are required to use the single-column ACM Manuscript template.

For LaTeX, use the correct templates (Overleaf or LaTeX templates) found on ACM's ""[Preparing your article for LaTeX](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-latex)"" page, using `\documentclass[manuscript, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart}` style for the document.

For Word, use the correct submission template found on ACM's ""[Preparing your article for Word](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word)"" page, i.e., ""submission template"".

The TAPS workflow used is described on ACM's ""[ACM's TAPS workflow page](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow)"".

### Anonymity

All submissions need to be fully anonymized. This includes any appendices or supplemental material, as well as a potential acknowledgements section. Citations to the authors’ own previous work are NOT allowed to be anonymized.  However, authors should refer to their own prior work in the third person. Papers that violate the anonymization policy will be desk rejected.

### Supplementary Material

All videos and supplementary material must be anonymized. Authors should submit any non-video supplementary material as a single .zip file, including a README file with a description of the materials.

Authors are encouraged to submit an optional video of a maximum of 6 minutes to support their submission. Authors are encouraged to follow the Accessible Presentation Guide. To ensure reviewers can view the supplementary video, authors should use the H.264 encoding and the MP4 file format. The bit rate of videos can be lowered to accommodate the upload limits of EasyChair (max. 50 MB per file).

### Accessibility

Authors are required to follow SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission ([https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/](https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/)). Papers flagged as inaccessible by a reviewer will be reassigned.

### Use of Generative AI

Authors must adhere to the ACM Policy on Authorship ([https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship)) regarding the use of generative AI in submissions. Authors are responsible for all content produced by these tools and must disclose their use.

### Submitting

Submissions are facilitated via the EasyChair platform. Authors may submit and edit their materials until the submission deadline. Should authors encounter any difficulties, technical problems, or questions about this process, please contact the Paper chairs via [papers2025@mum-conf.org](mailto:papers2025@mum-conf.org).

### Metadata Integrity

Changes in author names are not allowed after the submission deadline; there are no exceptions. Changes to the order of authors are allowed only before the camera-ready deadline.

### Selection Process

Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous double-blind review process. Each submitted paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. There will be a single round of reviews with three potential outcomes: desk rejects, rejection, and conditional acceptance. No rebuttal phase is planned.

### Upon Acceptance

#### Publication

Accepted papers will appear in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library.

#### Presentation Format

Accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Authors with accepted publications will be informed closer to the conference about the duration of their assigned slot and the timing of their presentation.

#### Conference Registration

For each accepted paper, full registration for the MUM 2025 conference is required by the early bird registration deadline.
