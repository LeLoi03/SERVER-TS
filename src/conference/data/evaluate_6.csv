The 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025) will take place between **July 22-26, 2025 in Palermo, Italy**.

## Theme

“AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future”

The AIED 2025 conference centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education. By harnessing AI’s capacity to personalize learning experiences, educators can address the diverse needs of students and mitigate educational disparities, particularly among underserved and marginalized communities. This year’s theme also underscores the critical importance of ethical AI integration, ensuring that these advanced technologies are deployed responsibly to uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and privacy.

## Tracks

For its main paper submissions, AIED 2025 solicits empirical and theoretical papers relating to both AI and education in the following lines of research and application, which represent our research tracks:

*   Track 1 – AIED architectures and tools
*   Track 2 – Machine learning and Generative AI
*   Track 3 – Learning, teaching and pedagogy
*   Track 4 – Human-centered design and design-based research
*   Track 5 – Teaching AI
*   Track 6 – Ethics, Equity, and AIED in Society
*   Track 7 – Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modelling for Education

## Submission Instructions

We invite the following main submissions to the conference, to be submitted directly to one of the above research tracks:

*   **Full paper submission:** Full papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Full papers will be presented as long oral talks. Papers submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper.
*   **Short paper submission:** Short papers are expected to describe novel and interesting results to the overall community at large. The goal is to give novel but not necessarily mature work a chance to be seen by other researchers and practitioners and to be discussed at the conference. Short papers will be presented as short oral talks.

Submissions must follow Springer policies on publication (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process): [https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v](https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v).

## Review Process

All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the program committee, followed by a metareview conducted by a senior member of the program committee (all double-masked) to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation.

## Anonymity

The review process will be double-masked, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous. To this end, authors should:

*   Eliminate all information that could lead to their identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, projects and/or systems)
*   Cite own prior work (if needed) in the third person
*   Eliminate acknowledgments and references to funding sources

## Awards

There will be a Best Student Paper Award as well as a Best Paper Award, both sponsored by EATCS. In order for a paper to be considered for the Best Student Paper Award, all of its authors are required to be students at the time of submission.

## Submission Guidelines

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper. Submissions must be formatted in accordance with the LIPIcs proceedings guidelines and may not exceed 500 lines of text. Authors must use the LaTeX class file `socg-lipics-v2021.cls`.  For a quick start, duplicate this [Overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/project/63f274925f9a1a60b575f59b).

Proofs omitted due to the line constraint must be placed in an appendix. This appendix will be read by the program committee members at their discretion.  Appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.

These guidelines are strict: submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk being rejected without consideration of their merits.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors.  Any references to the authors' own related work should be in the third person.

## Conflict of Interest

When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members. A CoI is limited to the following categories:

*   Family member or close friend.
*   Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years.
*   Person with the same affiliation.
*   Involved in an alleged incident of harassment.
*   Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter).
*   Frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.

## Paper Submission and Proceedings

Papers should be submitted electronically via the [EasyChair submission system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esa2025). The ESA 2025 proceedings will be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series."

See the [special sessions](https://www.esann.org/special-sessions) page for details about the special sessions organized during ESANN 2025.

## Talks and Posters

Accepted papers are presented either as talks or posters. Authors may indicate their preference at submission; however, as ESANN is a single-track conference, the number of slots for talks is limited. All poster presentations are coupled to a one-minute spotlight oral presentation during a plenary session.

There is no difference in scientific quality between talks and posters. The reviewing and selection processes are identical. In addition, all full papers are published in the same way in the proceedings, regardless of the mode of presentation.

## Manuscript Submission

### Initial Author Instructions - Full Paper Preparation, Technical Tracks, Special Session and Workshop Papers

Authors are invited to submit full regular papers (6-8 pages) of their work, reporting original research using the online submission system. Regular papers are typically 6-8 pages long, and are anyway limited to a maximum of eight (8) pages. Submissions of papers shorter than 5 pages may be automatically rejected.

The author must submit the draft version of the paper for review before the due submission deadline. Authors of accepted papers must submit the final paper version according to the deadline, register for the conference, and attend to present their paper(s). The maximum length for final papers is 8 pages without exceptions.

IEEE is strict about the requirements for PDF files for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. We strongly recommend using the set of templates in MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE. Please use them to create your paper, without modifying the style or format under any circumstances. A4 page size is preferred, and letter size can also be used.

Use of the IEEE PDF eXpress service will only be required and made available for the final version of accepted papers. This service allows you to transform your document from text editor to PDF format, as well as checking the conformance of any PDF file to IEEE formatting rules. The number of attempts provided to each author is limited in number, so reserve its use for the final version of your paper. When using this service, the conference ID will need to be specified - the ETFA 2025 conference ID will be made public once the submission of final papers opens.

Please ensure that you submit only original work that has not been previously published or copyrighted.  The Conference will be using the CrossCheck automated screening system to verify the originality of papers. Submitted works may be compared to over 20 million articles in databases worldwide. Papers that violate IEEE's publication principles may be summarily rejected. If the violation is deemed severe, disciplinary actions may also be taken by IEEE.

### Initial Author Instructions - Work-In-Progress Papers, Technical Tracks and Special Session Papers

The submissions in the Work in Progress papers category describe research that has not yet produced the results required for a regular paper, but that due to its novelty and potential impact deserves to be shared with the community at an early stage. These submissions need to follow the guidelines for the regular and special session but are limited to four (4) pages (total length including references).

WiP contributors are expected to give a short presentation of their work and to prepare a poster for the discussion forum that will take place after the presentations. More specifically, each WiP paper shall be presented by one of the authors in a very short oral presentation of 3 minutes, without any ensuing discussion, in its respective session.

Accepted and presented papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings and in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.

## Submission System Instructions

In case you already have an account with the IEC submission system, you can submit a paper to ETFA2025 [here](https://confcomm.ieee-ies.org/app/general/conferences/ETFA25/initial-submission).

When submitting papers in the submission system, please select the correct track:

*   TT01 ... TT11 – technical tracks (regular papers)
*   SS01 … SS12 – special sessions (regular papers)
*   WS01, WS02, WS03 – workshops based on solicited papers (regular papers)
*   WIP TT01 … WIP TT11 – technical tracks (work-in-progress papers)
*   WIP SS01 … WIP SS12 – special sessions (work-in-progress papers)

Papers are solicited for regular Technical Tracks and Special Session tracks both as Regular papers and Work in progress (WiP) papers. Workshops based on solicited papers are instead accepting only regular papers (no WiP submissions will be accepted).

Eurocrypt 2025 is organized by the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR).","# Eurocrypt 2025: Call for Papers

Eurocrypt 2025, the 44th Annual International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques, will take place in **Madrid, Spain on May 4-8, 2025.**  Eurocrypt 2025 is organized by the **International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR)**. The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series.

## General Information

Original research papers are welcomed on any cryptographic topic, including but not limited to:

*   Foundational theory and mathematics
*   The design, proposal, and analysis of cryptographic primitives and protocols
*   Secure implementation and optimization in hardware or software
*   Applied aspects of cryptography

Authors of accepted papers are asked to present their work in person at the conference.

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions must be at most 27 pages using the Springer LNCS format, including title page and figures, but excluding references. Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following after the main body of the paper. However, reviewers are not required to read or review beyond the main body, and submissions are expected to be intelligible, and show sufficient scientific quality and depth, without the supplementary material.

The above in particular means that submissions are expected to present the core technical part of the result(s) in the main body. Thus, the main body should allow the reader to understand and verify what is at the heart of the contribution, conceptually and technically; the supplementary material should be used mainly for tying up the loose ends, spelling out the less innovative parts, providing extensions/generalizations, etc.

The final published version of an accepted paper will be limited to 30 pages including references and is expected to closely match the submission. For further details, consult the paper submission page.

## Review Process

Eurocrypt 2025 will operate a two-round review system with a rebuttal phase.

## Early Withdrawal

Until final decisions have been made, authors can only withdraw their paper with the express approval of the program chairs.

## PC Member Submissions

PC members and area chairs are restricted to submit either 1 single-author paper, up to 2 papers if at least one of them is with a co-author, or up to 3 papers if all are with co-authors and at least two are with student co-authors. The PC co-chairs are not allowed to submit any papers.

## Awards

The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall Best Paper Award. In a continuing effort to promote independent work by researchers at early stages of their careers, the Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper(s) authored exclusively by early-career researchers. As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.

## Stipends

Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. Furthermore, a limited number of stipends are available to students that are unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Application instructions will be posted together with other registration information.

## Artifacts

To encourage open and reproducible research, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts associated with their papers, such as software or datasets, for review. The artifact review will be a collaborative process between authors and the artifact review committee. The goal of the process is not just to evaluate artifacts, but also to improve them for reproduction and reusability by the scientific community. Artifacts that pass successfully through the artifact review process will be archived on the IACR's artifact archive at artifacts.iacr.org. Please see the detailed call for artifacts.

The 10th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P 2025) will be held in **Venice, Italy, from June 30 to July 4, 2025.**

EuroS&P is a premier forum for computer security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners.

## Call for Papers

We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security or privacy, as well as Systematization of Knowledge papers that systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning widely-held beliefs. Papers without a clear connection to security or privacy will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.

## Conference Expectations

EuroS&P aims for a rigorous and thorough review process, resulting in the acceptance of every paper with scientific merit and sufficient value to the community.  A four-week revision opportunity is incorporated, in which the PC assists authors to try to get as many papers as possible to the level needed.

## New in 2025: Per-Reviewer Responses

EuroS&P 2025 will feature per-reviewer responses. Reviewers will be asked to provide a limited set of explicit questions that the response should focus on. Authors are then expected to solely focus on the questions as well as factual errors.  We hope to improve on the communication between individual reviewers and authors.

## Returning from 2024: Meta Reviews

EuroS&P 2025 will feature a publicly available meta-review (accessible through the EuroS&P website) for each accepted paper. This meta-review will outline the PC’s main reasons for accepting the paper and may also contain limitations the PC identified.

## Systematization of Knowledge Papers

We solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix ""SoK:"" in the title on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions, the emphasis will be on their value to the community.

## Paper Awards

Outstanding papers will be selected by the program committee for paper awards. The award finalists and winners will be announced at the symposium.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE = UTC-12h).

*   **Focus Group Proposal submission deadline:** May 16, 2025

## Paper Submission Process

The submission runs through three quality gates before the final proceedings are published.  After the first draft is accepted, your paper will be assigned to a shepherd. This is an experienced pattern author, who will provide feedback and suggestions on how to improve your paper. Following several iterations of shepherding, your improved second draft will be reviewed again and accepted or rejected for the conference. On acceptance, your paper will be discussed in the writers’ workshop during the conference. Based on the feedback received during the workshops, you must submit a final revised version that will be published. 

*   The submission system is available at: [https://www.europlop.net/submission/](https://www.europlop.net/submission/)

## Paper Submission Format

The final submission for publication must be formatted using the Springer template, but you can use any format for drafts and intermediate versions. We recommend 10 pages as a guideline and especially welcome shorter papers. Longer papers are also possible but bear in mind that the writers’ workshop might decide to focus only on a part of your paper.

All submissions within the scope of EWSN are equally welcome, and all submissions will be evaluated based on the same criteria.

The conference will accept two types of papers – **Full Papers (max 12 pages)** and **Short Papers (max 6 pages)**. Short papers are intended to present preliminary research results or advocate for new research directions; their titles should be prepended with “Vision paper: / Position paper: / WiP paper” when they are submitted for review as well as in the final proceedings. Authors should carefully consider the distinction between Full Papers and Short Papers; papers submitted in one category will not be considered in the other category.

EWSN 2025 will use a double-anonymous review policy during the paper review process. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper.

## Submission Process

Submissions are via HotCRP: [https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/](https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/)

Decisions will be: accept, reject, or one-shot revision; papers receiving a “one-shot revision” for the winter deadline will be invited to submit a revised paper by the summer deadline. Authors of papers rejected in the winter cycle may submit a revised paper in the summer cycle along with a cover letter explaining how/why the new revision addresses all the concerns raised by the reviewers.

## Paper Format

Pages must use 8.5″ x 11″ (letter) two-column format, using 10-point type on 11-point leading, with a maximum text block of 7″ wide x 9″ deep with an inter-column spacing of .25″. Submissions with a page size of 11.7 x 8.3 ” (297 x 210 mm / A4) will not be accepted. The page limits include figures, tables, and references. Authors may use the EWSN 2025 template adapted from the ACM templates for convenience (on Overleaf here).

## Publication

All accepted papers will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library, SCOPUS, and other prominent digital libraries."
