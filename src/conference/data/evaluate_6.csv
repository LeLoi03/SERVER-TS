The 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025) will take place between **July 22-26, 2025 in Palermo, Italy**.

## Theme

“AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future”

The AIED 2025 conference centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education. By harnessing AI’s capacity to personalize learning experiences, educators can address the diverse needs of students and mitigate educational disparities, particularly among underserved and marginalized communities. This year’s theme also underscores the critical importance of ethical AI integration, ensuring that these advanced technologies are deployed responsibly to uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and privacy.

## Tracks

For its main paper submissions, AIED 2025 solicits empirical and theoretical papers relating to both AI and education in the following lines of research and application, which represent our research tracks:

*   Track 1 – AIED architectures and tools
*   Track 2 – Machine learning and Generative AI
*   Track 3 – Learning, teaching and pedagogy
*   Track 4 – Human-centered design and design-based research
*   Track 5 – Teaching AI
*   Track 6 – Ethics, Equity, and AIED in Society
*   Track 7 – Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modelling for Education

## Submission Instructions

We invite the following main submissions to the conference, to be submitted directly to one of the above research tracks:

*   **Full paper submission:** Full papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Full papers will be presented as long oral talks. Papers submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper.
*   **Short paper submission:** Short papers are expected to describe novel and interesting results to the overall community at large. The goal is to give novel but not necessarily mature work a chance to be seen by other researchers and practitioners and to be discussed at the conference. Short papers will be presented as short oral talks.

Submissions must follow Springer policies on publication (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process): [https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v](https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v).

## Review Process

All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the program committee, followed by a metareview conducted by a senior member of the program committee (all double-masked) to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation.

## Anonymity

The review process will be double-masked, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous. To this end, authors should:

*   Eliminate all information that could lead to their identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, projects and/or systems)
*   Cite own prior work (if needed) in the third person
*   Eliminate acknowledgments and references to funding sources

## Important Dates (full and short papers, main submission)

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper. Submissions must be formatted in accordance with the LIPIcs proceedings guidelines and may not exceed 500 lines of text. Authors must use the LaTeX class file `socg-lipics-v2021.cls`; for a quick start, duplicate this Overleaf project.

Proofs omitted due to the line constraint must be placed in an appendix. This appendix will be read by the program committee members at their discretion. In particular, appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.

These guidelines are strict: submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk being rejected without consideration of their merits.

## Submission Guidelines for Full Papers and Review Process

Since the proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series, authors must submit manuscripts using the LNCS style. The page limit for submitted papers (as well as for final, camera-ready papers) is 16 pages (excluding references). ER 2025 follows a double-blind review process. Authors are therefore asked to remove all identifying information from the manuscript and use repository anonymization services to anonymize potential source code repositories and online supplementary material.

Manuscripts not submitted in the LNCS style or exceeding the page limit will be desk rejected. Likewise, submissions that do not primarily focus on aspects of conceptual modeling shall be rejected without undergoing formal reviewing. Papers submitted must not be under evaluation for or have already been published in, or accepted for publication, in a journal or another conference.

## Submission Link

To submit your paper, please use the following link: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=er2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=er2025)

## Post-Conference Special Journal Issue

The authors of selected papers will be invited to prepare a substantially revised and extended version of a Special Issue in Elsevier's Data & Knowledge Engineering (JCR 2023 Impact Factor 2.7).

The 2025 ACM Symposium on Eye Tracking Research & Applications (ETRA) will be held in **Tokyo, Japan from May 26 to May 29, 2025**.

## Call for Long Papers

The symposium presents advances and innovations in oculomotor research, gaze tracking systems, eye tracking applications, gaze-based interaction, and eye movement data analysis. We invite high-quality papers in all areas of eye tracking research and applications and welcome submissions from all domains, including visuomotor neuroscience, perception, and cognition.

Papers must be original and not accepted previously for publication or under review elsewhere. At least one author must register and present accepted work at the conference. Accepted full papers will be published as journal articles in special issues of either PACM CGIT or PACM HCI with the authors’ choice.

**Required this year:** With burgeoning technological and social applications of eye-tracking research, we now require authors to discuss the potential societal risks that might result from its publication. Authors are required to include a privacy and ethics statement of two to three sentences related to their study findings or new advancements made possible by their developed methods. The privacy and ethics statement should clearly address the broader impacts of their work as it relates to the authors' interpretation of privacy, fairness, safety, human rights, data sovereignty, or future misuse and any benefit/risk trade-off resulting from this research.

## Call for Short Papers

Authors are also invited to submit original work in a shorter format. A short paper should provide a focused and concise, yet significant, contribution to the current state of the art while not delving into broad discussion.

All short paper submissions will undergo a double-blind review process assessing the originality and technical quality of the work, as well as the relevance for eye-tracking research and applications. Accepted papers will be archived in the conference proceedings and will be available in the ACM Digital Library as ""ETRA '25 Short Papers"".

## Submission

We invite authors to submit extended abstracts of their original research. Submissions must be formatted in LaTeX using a supplied class file (`euroCG25.cls` and `eurocg25-submission.cls`), and not be longer than 175 lines of text. Submissions will be handled through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=eurocg2025).

A zip file containing an example of how to use the class file can be found [here](eurocg25-ex.zip).

## Acceptance Policy

EuroCG is a non-competitive forum. We will accept all submissions which are original, correct, well-presented, non-trivial, and in scope. The program committee judges submissions on these five criteria, each of which can lead to rejection. If a submission satisfies all criteria, then it will be accepted: there is no competition against other submissions.

## Proceedings

EuroCG does not have formally reviewed proceedings. A booklet of abstracts, without ISBN, will be accessible online on the website for the benefit of the community and must be regarded as a collection of preprints rather than a formally reviewed selection of papers. Results presented at EuroCG are expected to appear in other conferences with formal proceedings and/or in journals.

Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions to a special issue of the *Computing in Geometry and Topology (CGT)* journal.

There will also be a voting for the Best Student Presentation.

## Attendance and Presentation of Papers

EuroCG is fundamentally an in-person event and all presentations are expected to be given in person. Hence at least one author of an accepted contribution must become a member of the society and attend EuroCG. If no author of an accepted contribution is attending EuroCG, then the contribution may be removed from the program, the booklet of abstracts, and the conference website."

The 10th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P 2025) will be held in **Venice, Italy, from June 30 to July 4, 2025**.

EuroS&P is a premier forum for computer security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners.

## Submission Guidelines

We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security or privacy, as well as Systematization of Knowledge papers that systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning widely-held beliefs. Papers without a clear connection to security or privacy will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.

### Anonymous Submission

Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing their identity in the text. When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else. Any source code or other material (e.g., data sets) which requires hosting must use anonymous services. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.

### Page Limit and Formatting

Papers shall not exceed 13 pages of body text, with unlimited additional pages for references and appendices.  Papers must be typeset in LaTeX in A4 format (not ""US Letter"") using the IEEE conference proceeding template. Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf).

### Systematization of Knowledge Papers

We solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix ""SoK:"" in the title on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions, the emphasis will be on their value to the community.

### Proactive Prevention of Harm

We expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out their research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to adequately discuss such potential harms within the body of the submission may result in rejection of a submission, regardless of its quality and scientific value.

### Open Science Expectations

Our expectation for Euro S&P is that researchers will maximize the scientific and community value of their work by making it as open as possible. All submissions must therefore include a clear statement on Data Availability (as a separate appendix which does not count towards the page limit) that explains how the artifacts needed to reproduce their work will be shared, or an explanation of why they will not be shared.

### Plagiarism and Duplicate Submission

All submissions must be original work. Plagiarism (whether of others or self) will be grounds for rejection. Simultaneous submission of the same or substantially similar paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection.

### Revision Option

EuroS&P features the option to revise papers for which the program committee sees a path for revision that is likely to lead to acceptance. If authors who are invited to do so wish to submit a revised paper, they must do so within four weeks of the notification. Revised papers will be re-reviewed by the same reviewers who reviewed the original submission.

### New in 2025: Per-Reviewer Responses

EuroS&P 2025 will feature per-reviewer responses. Reviewers will be asked to provide a limited set of explicit questions that the response should focus on. Authors are then expected to solely focus on the questions as well as factual errors.

### Returning from 2024: Meta Reviews

EuroS&P 2025 will feature a publicly available meta-review for each accepted paper. This meta-review will outline the PC’s main reasons for accepting the paper and may also contain limitations the PC identified.

## Paper Awards

Outstanding papers will be selected by the program committee for paper awards.

The conference will accept two types of papers – Full Papers (max 12 pages) and Short Papers (max 6 pages). Short papers are intended to present preliminary research results or advocate for new research directions; their titles should be prepended with “Vision paper: / Position paper: / WiP paper” when they are submitted for review as well as in the final proceedings. Authors should carefully consider the distinction between Full Papers and Short Papers; papers submitted in one category will not be considered in the other category.

EWSN 2025 will use a double-anonymous review policy. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed.

## Submission System

Submissions are via HotCRP: [https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/](https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/)

Decisions will be: accept, reject, or one-shot revision; papers receiving a “one-shot revision” for the winter deadline will be invited to submit a revised paper by the summer deadline.  Authors of papers rejected in the winter cycle may submit a revised paper in the spring cycle along with a cover letter explaining how/why the new revision addresses all the concerns raised by the reviewers."
