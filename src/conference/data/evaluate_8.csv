The 20th Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems (HotOS XX) will be held from **May 14–16, 2025, in Banff, Alberta, Canada**.

## Call for Papers and Discussions

HotOS XX hopes to bring together researchers and practitioners in computer systems to engage in a lively discussion on the principles and practices of building systems software. Participants will present new ideas and debate future research agendas in systems research.

We solicit position papers that propose new directions of systems research, advocate innovative approaches to long-standing problems, or report on deep insights gained from experience with real-world systems. We seek early-stage work where the authors can benefit from community feedback. An ideal submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry that results in multiple conference papers by different authors in related venues, rather than a single follow-on conference paper. The program committee will explicitly favor papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion.

HotOS takes a broad view of systems research. This includes operating systems, storage, distributed systems, mobile and embedded systems, virtualization, programming languages, networking, security, dependability, and manageability, as well as new systems contributions influenced by other fields such as hardware design, training and serving machine learning, verification, economics, social organization, and biological or other nontraditional computing systems.

## Submission Guidelines

The workshop will be held in person at UC Irvine, with a live Zoom Webinar broadcast for remote attendance.","# HotNets 2024: Call for Papers

The 23rd ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets 2024) will bring together researchers to engage in a lively debate on the theory and practice of computer networking and networked systems. HotNets provides a venue to discuss innovative ideas and debate future research agendas for the field.

## Submission Guidelines

We invite researchers and practitioners to submit short position papers. We encourage submissions that:

*   Identify fundamental open questions
*   Advocate for new approaches
*   Offer constructive critiques of the state of networking research
*   Re-frame or debunk existing work
*   Report unexpected early results from a deployment
*   Report promising but unproven ideas
*   Propose new evaluation methods

Authors need not support their ideas with full evaluations; we consider well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations sufficient support for the possibility of the paper’s claims in HotNets.

We seek early-stage work, where the authors can benefit from community feedback. An ideal submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry for the community that results in multiple conference papers in related venues (SIGCOMM, NSDI, CoNEXT, SOSP, OSDI, MobiCom, MobiSys, etc.), rather than a single follow-on conference paper. We strongly discourage “conference papers in the miniature,” and the program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion over something that is ready for publication at a conference. Finished work that fits in a short paper is likely a better fit with the short-paper tracks at CoNEXT or IMC.

HotNets takes a broad view of networking research. The scope includes new ideas that relate to (but not limited to) mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks and that use a variety of link technologies (e.g., wired, wireless, optical, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks and network architecture. HotNets encompasses all aspects of networks, which include (but is not limited to) packet-processing and transmission hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, provisioning and resource management, performance, energy consumption, sustainability, topology, robustness and security, measurement, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics and evolution, theory, usability, machine learning, and interactions with applications.

## Important Dates

*   **Paper submission deadline:** June 27, 2024 (23:59 AoE)
*   **Author notification:** September 13, 2024
*   **Camera-ready deadline:** October 22, 2024

## Submission and Formatting

Papers should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format. Each paper should have no more than 6 pages, excluding references, in 10-point font. There is no limit on the page count for references; however, appendices are not allowed. Papers must contain novel ideas and must differ significantly in content from previously published papers.

All submissions must be blind: they must not indicate the names or affiliations of the authors in the paper. Only electronic submissions in PDF will be accepted. Submissions must be written in English, render without error using standard tools (e.g., Acrobat Reader), and print on US Letter paper. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (i.e., do not use ""et al.""). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]. Please make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale. Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected.

[This archive](hotnets/2024/docs/hotnets24-template.zip) contains a LaTeX class file that follows the prescribed submission format. The `hotnets24-template.tex` included in the archive has the correct defaults for HotNets 2024 submissions. Specifically, the first two lines should be:

```
\documentclass[sigconf, 10pt, anonymous, nonacm]{acmart}
\settopmatter{printfolios=true, printccs=false, printacmref=false}
```

The default citation style is numeric. Please do not modify the `acmart.cls` file or settings to try to sneak in additional space.

## Guidelines for Submissions

The purpose of having a paper registration deadline a week ahead of the actual paper submission is to overlap review assignments with giving you extra time to improve the quality of your submission. While we could have opted to freeze the title, authors, and abstract fields by the paper registration deadline, we have decided against this, in order to provide you some flexibility in making modifications until the actual submission deadline. However, we do not want authors to misuse this flexibility. To adhere to the spirit of this intention, we need you to:

*   Please make the paper title as close to the final version as possible.
*   The author list should not change (order of authors can) after registration. If there is a change, you should send an email indicating the change at least 48 hours before the paper submission deadline to the PC chair.
*   Consequently, the Conflict List should also be finalized by the abstract registration. Please ensure it is accurate at the time of registration.
*   Please make the abstract as close to the final version as possible.

Flagrant violation of the above could result in an outright rejection of the submission.

## Paper Format

Papers must be submitted in printable PDF format and should contain a maximum of 11 pages of single-spaced two-column text, not including references. You may include any number of pages for references, but see below for more instructions. If you are using LaTeX to typeset your paper, then we suggest that you use [our template](https://hpca-conf.org/2025/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hpca2025-latex-template.zip).  If you use a different software package to typeset your paper, then please adhere to the guidelines given in the table below. Please ensure that you include page numbers with your submission. This makes it easier for the reviewers to refer to different parts of your paper when they provide comments. Please ensure that your submission has a banner at the top of the title page, which contains the submission number and the notice of confidentiality.

## Paper Submission Instructions

*   Guidelines for Determining Authorship
*   Declaring Authors
*   Areas and Topics
*   Declaring Conflicts of Interest
*   ArXiv Submissions
*   Concurrent Submissions and Workshops

## Paper Evaluation Objectives

The committee will make every effort to judge each submitted paper on its own merits. There will be no target acceptance rate. We expect to accept a wide range of papers with appropriate expectations for evaluation – while papers that build on significant past work with strong evaluations are valuable, papers that open new areas with less rigorous evaluation are equally welcome and especially encouraged. We also acknowledge the wide range of evaluation methodologies in HPCA including modeling, simulation, prototyping, experimental implementation, real product evaluation, etc.

## Industry Track

HPCA 2025 features a separate Industry Track with a separate call for papers. The goal of the HPCA Industry Track is to publish papers that are written by industry authors and their content relates to industrial products/processes.

The 52nd EATCS International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP 2025) will take place in **Aarhus, Denmark, from July 8-11, 2025**.  Workshops will take place on July 7, 2025.

ICALP is the main conference and annual meeting of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS).

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions to ICALP 2025 use the HotCRP system:

*   Submission server Track A: [icalp25-a.hotcrp.com](https://icalp25-a.hotcrp.com)
*   Submission server Track B: [icalp25-b.hotcrp.com](https://icalp25-b.hotcrp.com)

**Guidelines:**

1.  Papers must present original research on the theory of computer science. No prior publication and no simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed. Authors are encouraged to also make full versions of their submissions freely accessible in an online repository such as ArXiv, HAL, ECCC.
2.  Submissions take the form of an extended abstract of no more than 15 pages, excluding references and a clearly labelled appendix. The appendix may consist either of omitted proofs or of a full version of the submission, and it will be read at the discretion of program committee members. The use of the LIPIcs document class is an option, but not required. The extended abstract has to present the merits of the paper and its main contributions clearly, and describe the key concepts and technical ideas used to obtain the results. Submissions must provide the proofs which can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be verified.
3.  Submissions are anonymous. The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).
4.  Submissions authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed.
5.  The submissions are done via HotCRP to the appropriate track of the conference. The use of pdflatex or similar pdf generating tools is mandatory and the page limit is strict (see point 2.). Papers that deviate significantly from these requirements risk rejection without consideration of merit.
6.  During the rebuttal phase, authors will have from March 21-24, 2025, the opportunity to view and respond to initial reviews. Further instructions will be sent to authors of submitted papers before that time.
7.  At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register for the conference, and all talks are in-person. In exceptional cases, there may be support for remotely presenting a talk.
8.  Papers authored only by students should be marked as such upon submission in order to be eligible for the best student paper awards of the track.

## Important Dates

*   **Submissions:** February 8, 2025 (anywhere on Earth)
*   **Rebuttal:** March 21-24, 2025
*   **Author notification:** April 14, 2025

*   The format of ICAPS 2025 will be in-person. We expect at least one author of each accepted paper to register for the conference and present their work in person, unless exceptional circumstances prevent this.

## Use of Generative AI

ICAPS 2025 continues the policy adopted in 2024 regarding using large-scale language models (LLMs) and other so-called “Generative AI” tools. Papers that include text generated from an LLM are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis.

## Ethical / Societal Impact

Authors are encouraged to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences.

## Best Paper Awards and Journal Fast Track

Following the ICAPS tradition, we will award the best non-student and student papers. These papers may also receive an invitation to submit an extended version to a top AI journal, such as the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) or the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ).

The 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025) will take place between **July 22-26, 2025 in Palermo, Italy**.

## Theme

“AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future”

The AIED 2025 conference centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education. By harnessing AI’s capacity to personalize learning experiences, educators can address the diverse needs of students and mitigate educational disparities, particularly among underserved and marginalized communities. This year’s theme also underscores the critical importance of ethical AI integration, ensuring that these advanced technologies are deployed responsibly to uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and privacy.

## Tracks

For its main paper submissions, AIED 2025 solicits empirical and theoretical papers relating to both AI and education in the following lines of research and application, which represent our research tracks:

*   Track 1 – AIED architectures and tools
*   Track 2 – Machine learning and Generative AI
*   Track 3 – Learning, teaching and pedagogy
*   Track 4 – Human-centered design and design-based research
*   Track 5 – Teaching AI
*   Track 6 – Ethics, Equity, and AIED in Society
*   Track 7 – Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modelling for Education

## Submission Instructions

We invite the following main submissions to the conference, to be submitted directly to one of the above research tracks:

*   **Full paper submission:** Full papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Full papers will be presented as long oral talks. Papers submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper.
*   **Short paper submission:** Short papers are expected to describe novel and interesting results to the overall community at large. The goal is to give novel but not necessarily mature work a chance to be seen by other researchers and practitioners and to be discussed at the conference. Short papers will be presented as short oral talks.

Submissions must follow Springer policies on publication (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process): [https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v](https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v).

## Review Process

All submissions will be reviewed by three members of the program committee, followed by a metareview conducted by a senior member of the program committee (all double-masked) to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation.

## Anonymity

The review process will be double-masked, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous. To this end, authors should:

*   Eliminate all information that could lead to their identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, projects and/or systems)
*   Cite own prior work (if needed) in the third person
*   Eliminate acknowledgments and references to funding sources
