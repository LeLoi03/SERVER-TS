The conference scope includes machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, multiagent systems, knowledge representation, human-in-the-loop AI, search, planning, reasoning, robotics and perception, and ethics.

## Special Track on AI for Social Impact (AISI)

Submissions to this track will be reviewed according to a rubric that emphasizes the fit between the techniques used and a problem of social importance, rather than simply rewarding technical novelty.

## Special Track on AI Alignment

This year we are introducing a special track on AI alignment. This track is motivated by the fact that as we begin to build more and more capable AI systems, it becomes crucial to ensure that the goals and actions of such systems are aligned with human values.

## Review Criteria

AAAI is a highly selective conference. Prospective authors are therefore strongly encouraged to submit only their very best work to AAAI.

All submissions will be rigorously evaluated by expert reviewers to assess whether the contributions of the paper are substantive enough to warrant publication in AAAI.

## Plagiarism & Use of ChatGPT or similar LLMs Policy

Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. Note that this policy does not prohibit authors from using LLMs for editing or polishing author-written text.

*   IJCAI 2025 will enforce a strict submission limit. Each author is limited to no more than 8 submissions to IJCAI 2025.

## Review Process

The reviewing process will proceed in two phases:

*   **Phase 1:** Every paper will receive two reviews by PC members. If a paper receives two good-quality reviews that are not sufficiently positive in Phase 1, it will be rejected without any opportunity to submit an author response.
*   **Phase 2:** Papers passing the summary reject step will receive additional reviews by a group of PC members (PCs) and SPC members (SPCs).  Area Chairs (ACs) will coordinate the review process and write a meta-review with a recommendation cross-checked by a Senior Area Chair (SAC). The full paper review process will allow authors to respond to the reviews.  Author responses should be concise and are not intended to create a dialogue between reviewers and authors.

## Participation in the Conference

At least one author of each accepted paper must participate in the conference at Montreal and present the work. Authors who possess evidence indicating their inability to obtain visas for Canada may submit a request to [pcchair@2025.ijcai.org](mailto:pcchair@2025.ijcai.org) to participate in the satellite event in Guangzhou.

Papers not presented in person, whether at the main conference in Montreal or the satellite event in Guangzhou, will be excluded from the proceedings unless one of the authors provides notification of exceptional circumstances to IJCAI via [pcchair@2025.ijcai.org](mailto:pcchair@2025.ijcai.org). Any such exceptional circumstances must receive prior approval from IJCAI.
