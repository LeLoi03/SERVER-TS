  "Call for Papers": "# IEEE VIS 2025: Call for Participation\n\nIEEE VIS 2025 will be held in **Vienna, Austria, from November 2-7, 2025**.  It is the premier forum for advances in theory, methods, and applications of visualization and visual analytics.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nIEEE VIS 2025 solicits novel research contributions and innovative applications in all areas of visualization.\n\n### Areas\n\n*   **Area 1: Theoretical & Empirical:** Theoretical and empirical research topics that aim to define the foundation of VIS as a scientific subject. ([Theoretical & Empirical](/year/2025/info/call-participation/area-model#area-1-theoretical--empirical))\n*   **Area 2: Applications:** All forms of application-focused research. ([Applications](/year/2025/info/call-participation/area-model#area-2-applications))\n*   **Area 3: Systems & Rendering:** Building systems, algorithms for rendering, and alternate input and output modalities. ([Systems & Rendering](/year/2025/info/call-participation/area-model#area-3-systems--rendering))\n*   **Area 4: Representations & Interaction:** The design of visual representations and interaction techniques for different types of data, users, and visualization tasks. ([Representations & Interaction](/year/2025/info/call-participation/area-model#area-4-representations--interaction))\n*   **Area 5: Data Transformations:** Algorithms and techniques that transform data from one form to another to enable effective and efficient visual mapping as required by the intended visual representations. ([Data Transformations](/year/2025/info/call-participation/area-model#area-5-data-transformations))\n*   **Area 6: Analytics & Decisions:** Design and optimization of integrated workflows for visual data analysis, knowledge discovery, decision support, machine learning, and other data intelligence tasks. ([Analytics & Decisions](/year/2025/info/call-participation/area-model#area-6-analytics--decisions))\n\n## Publication Venue\n\nFull papers accepted to IEEE VIS will appear in a special issue of the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG) and will be indexed in IEEE Xplore.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 pm (23:59) AoE (Anywhere on Earth).\n\n*   **Abstract submission (MANDATORY):** March 21, 2025\n*   **Paper submission:** March 31, 2025\n*   **Notification of results of first review cycle:** June 6, 2025\n*   **Paper submission for second review cycle:** July 1, 2025\n*   **Final notification:** July 15, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready copy:** August 8, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines and Reviewing Criteria\n\nSubmissions will be judged on their scientific quality and novelty, potential impact, degree to which the evidence supports the findings, appropriateness of methodology, and the research process followed. After the initial notification of review results, selected papers are only conditionally accepted and will undergo a full revision and review cycle: only papers that improve according to the required changes will be accepted after the second round review.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nWe highly recommend screen reader accessible final submissions. Please see the [VIS Accessibility Guide](/year/2025/info/call-participation/make-pdf-accessible) to learn how you can make your contribution accessible.\n\n## Open Access Policy\n\nVisualization research is best communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, all paper authors are encouraged to share their accepted paper in an open-access repository in accordance with IEEE copyright regulations. We also recommend that authors include sufficient supplemental materials with their submission so that their work can be easily scrutinized and used or extended by future researchers and practitioners. For instructions on how to post an accepted paper to an open-access repository and recommendations on sharing supplemental materials, please see the [VIS Open Practices Guidelines](https://ieeevis.org/year/2025/info/open-practices/open-practices).\n\n## Submission Process\n\n[Paper Submission Guidelines](/year/2025/info/call-participation/paper-submission-guidelines)\n\n[Submission Keywords](/year/2025/info/call-participation/paper-keywords)\n\n[Review Instructions](/year/2025/info/call-participation/review-instructions)\n\n[Student Reviewer Guidelines](/year/2025/info/call-participation/student-reviewer-guide)\n\n[Open Practices](/year/2025/info/open-practices/open-practices)"
