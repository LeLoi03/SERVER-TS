  "Call for Papers": "# VMCAI 2025: Call for Papers\n\nVMCAI 2025 is the 26th International Conference on Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation. The conference will be held from **January 20-21, 2025**, in **Denver, Colorado, United States**.\n\nVMCAI provides a forum for researchers from the communities of Verification, Model Checking, and Abstract Interpretation, facilitating interaction, cross-fertilization, and advancement of hybrid methods that combine these and related areas.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe program will consist of refereed research papers as well as invited lectures and tutorials. Research contributions can report new results as well as experimental evaluations and comparisons of existing techniques.\n\n## Topics\n\nTopics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Program Verification\n*   Model Checking\n*   Abstract Interpretation\n*   Abstract Domains\n*   Program Synthesis\n*   Static Analysis\n*   Type Systems\n*   Deductive Methods\n*   Program Logics\n*   First-Order Theories\n*   Decision Procedures\n*   Interpolation\n*   Horn Clause Solving\n*   Program Certification\n*   Separation Logic\n*   Probabilistic Programming and Analysis\n*   Error Diagnosis\n*   Detection of Bugs and Security Vulnerabilities\n*   Program Transformations\n*   Hybrid and Cyber-physical Systems\n*   Concurrent and distributed Systems\n*   Analysis of numerical properties\n*   Analysis of smart contracts\n*   Analysis of neural networks\n*   Case Studies on all of the above topics\n\nSubmissions can address any programming paradigm, including concurrent, constraint, functional, imperative, logic, and object-oriented programming.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions are required to follow Springer’s LNCS format. The page limit depends on the paper’s category (see below). In each category, additional material beyond the page limit may be placed in a clearly marked appendix, to be read at the discretion of the reviewers and to be omitted in the final version. Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting can be found at the Springer website. Submission is via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=vmcai2025](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=vmcai2025). Note: submissions will open on August 26th.\n\nAll accepted papers will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The corresponding author of each paper will need to complete and sign a License-to-Publish form to be submitted together with the camera-ready version.\n\nSubmissions will undergo a single-blind review process. Submissions should not be anonymized for the purposes of review. There will be three categories of papers: regular papers, tool papers, and case studies. Papers in each category have a different page limit and will be evaluated differently.\n\n*   **Regular papers:** clearly identify and justify an advance to the field of verification, abstract interpretation, or model checking. Where applicable, they are supported by experimental validation. Regular papers are restricted to 20 pages in LNCS format, not counting references.\n*   **Tool papers:** present a new tool, a new tool component, or novel extensions to an existing tool. Tool papers are restricted to 12 pages in LNCS format, not counting references.\n*   **Case studies:** are expected to describe the use of verification, model checking, and abstract interpretation techniques in new application domains or industrial settings. Case study papers are restricted to 20 pages in LNCS format, not counting references. (Shorter case study papers are also welcome.)\n\n## Call for Artifacts\n\nVMCAI 2025 makes available the option to submit an artifact along with a paper. Artifact submission is optional. However, we highly encourage all authors to also submit an artifact. A successfully evaluated artifact can increase your chance of being accepted since the evaluation result of your artifact is taken into account during paper reviewing.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE, UTC-12h)\n\n*   **Paper Submission Deadline (extended):** October 1, 2024\n*   **Artifact Evaluation Abstract Registration Deadline:** October 1, 2024\n*   **Artifact Evaluation : Artifacts Deadline:** October 3, 2024\n*   **Author Notification Deadline:** November 11, 2024\n*   **Artifact Evaluation Notification:** November 11, 2024\n*   **Camera Ready:** November 25, 2024\n*   **Artifact test phase notification:** October 10, 2024\n*   **Artifact notification:** November 8, 2024\n*   **Early Registration Closes:** December 20, 2024\n\n## Registration\n\nRegistration for VMCAI 2025 will be handled through easyconferences: [https://www.easyconferences.org/vmcai2025/register](https://www.easyconferences.org/vmcai2025/register).\n\nAll papers accepted for VMCAI 2025 must have at least one registered author."
