  "Call for Papers": "# SOSP 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 31st ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP) will be held from **October 13-16, 2025 at the Lotte Hotel World in Seoul, Republic of Korea**.\n\nSOSP seeks to present innovative and exciting research related to the design, implementation, analysis, evaluation, and deployment of computer systems software.\n\n## Topics\n\nSOSP takes a broad view of systems and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including:\n\n*   Operating systems\n*   File and storage systems\n*   Distributed systems\n*   Cloud computing\n*   Mobile and edge systems\n*   Secure and reliable systems\n*   Systems aspects of big data and machine learning\n*   Embedded and real-time systems\n*   Virtualization\n*   Networking as it relates to operating systems\n*   Management and troubleshooting of complex systems\n\nWe also welcome work that explores the interaction of computer systems with related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, verification, and databases.\n\n## Submission Criteria\n\nSubmissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. A good paper will:\n\n*   Motivate a significant problem\n*   Propose and implement an interesting, compelling solution\n*   Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution\n*   Draw appropriate conclusions\n*   Clearly describe the paper's contributions\n*   Articulate the advances beyond previous work\n*   Be accessible to the broader systems community\n\nWe encourage submission of groundbreaking work in significant new directions, with the understanding that the evaluation criteria for papers addressing new problems may be different from those continuing a line of work in a more established area.\n\n## Originality\n\nSubmissions should contain original, unpublished material. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism is not allowed.\n\n## Resubmissions\n\nSubmitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted, although authors are expected to have improved the paper to address substantive issues raised in previous reviews.  Authors should provide information regarding the previous submission(s) and a summary of the subsequent revisions to the paper. This description, which will be supplied to reviewers after theyâ€™ve completed their reviews, helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit the description of changes to one page.\n\n## Anonymity\n\nSOSP will use double-blind reviewing. Please make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\nAuthors may optionally include supplementary material as a separate document.  PC members are not required to read this optional supplementary material, so the submission must stand alone without it.\n\n## Formatting\n\nPapers will be submitted electronically in PDF format.\n\nSubmissions may have at most 12 pages of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit.\n\nSubmissions violating these rules will not be considered for publication, and there will be no extensions for fixing violations.\n\n## Confidentiality\n\nReviewing will be done mostly by members of the program committee, with limited use of outside reviewers. Submissions will be treated as confidential; however, papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered for publication.\n\n## Conflicts\n\nTo avoid conflicts of interest in the review process, when you register and submit your paper, we ask that you provide information about conflicts between any of the authors of your submission and PC members.\n\n## Author Response Period\n\nSOSP will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting.\n\n## Accepted Papers\n\nPapers selected by the program committee will receive conditional acceptance, with the final acceptance subject to revisions and approval by a program committee member acting as a shepherd.\n\n## Submission Information\n\nPapers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the [web submission form](https://sosp25.hotcrp.com/).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Deadline to register abstracts:** April 10, 2025; 23:59 PT\n*   **Submission deadline (no extensions):** April 17, 2025; 23:59 PT\n*   **Reviews available for author response:** July 1, 2025\n*   **Author response due:** July 3, 2025\n*   **Author notification:** July 15, 2025\n*   **Camera ready due:** TBD\n*   **Workshop:** October 13, 2025\n*   **Conference:** October 14 - 16, 2025\n\n## Contact\n\nAny questions about paper submissions can be emailed to [sosp2025@gmail.com](mailto:sosp2025@gmail.com).\n\nAny organizational questions about the conference can be emailed to [sosp25gc@kaist.ac.kr](mailto:sosp25gc@kaist.ac.kr)"
