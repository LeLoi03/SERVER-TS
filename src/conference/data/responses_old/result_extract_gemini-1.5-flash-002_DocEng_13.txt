  "Call for Papers": "# DocEng 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 25th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng'25) will be held at the **University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK, from September 2-5, 2025**.\n\nDocEng emphasizes innovative approaches to document engineering technology, use of documents and document collections in real-world applications, and novel principles, tools, and processes that improve our ability to create, manage, maintain, share, and productively use documents.\n\n## Theme\n\n**Document Trust and Security**\n\n## Submission Types\n\n*   **Full papers:** describing complete works of research (up to 10 pages)\n*   **Short papers:** describing smaller complete works of research, novel challenges or visions (up to 4 pages)\n*   **Demonstrations:** of interesting use-cases of systems or tools (up to 2-page abstract)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Full Papers & Short Papers & Demonstrations:**\n    *   **Abstracts due:** April 22, 2025 (Full Papers); June 10, 2025 (Short Papers & Demonstrations)\n    *   **Manuscripts due:** April 29, 2025 (Full Papers); June 17, 2025 (Short Papers & Demonstrations)\n    *   **Acceptance notice:** June 3, 2025 (Full Papers); July 15, 2025 (Short Papers & Demonstrations)\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions should be prepared using the ACM format. Guidelines are available at [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Please note that Word users should use the interim template; DocEng does not use TAPS.\n\nPapers can be submitted online at: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=doceng25](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=doceng25)\n\n## Publication\n\nAccepted articles will be published in the DocEng 2025 proceedings in the ACM Digital Library.\n\n## Relevant Topics\n\nWe seek original contributions that are mainly focused on, but not necessarily limited to, the following topics:\n\n*   **Document Trust and Security:** Documents and privacy; Document authentication; Document encryption; Secure document workflows, policy, and access; security for mobile and printing devices; Security printing, including document identification, tagging and meta-data\n*   **Machine Learning for Digital Documents:** Applications of Large Language Models in Document Processing and Creation; AI in document processing and management; AI in document content analysis; Generative Systems\n*   **Digital Accessibility:** Models for representing Accessibility in Documents; Interfaces for accessing document structures; Alternative User Experiences for document consumption; Document Repurposing for accessibility\n*   **Collections, Systems, and Management:** Storage, indexing, retrieval, deduplication, cleansing; Enterprise content management: models and standards, scale and performance; Digital libraries: and archives preservation systems; Massive collections of documents; Systems and algorithms for safe and efficient document processing; Scalable distributed document processing\n*   **Modelling and Representation:** Document models and structures; Document representation and standards; Document type representation, metadata; Linked data and semantics enrichment; Collaborative documents and sharing economy; Document internationalisation\n*   **Document Content Analysis:** Structure and visual representation analysis; Linguistic and semantic (content) analysis; Automated tagging\n*   **Systems for Visual Document Analysis:** Historical document processing; Handwritten character recognition; Recognition of images, equations, drawings, music scores; Recovery and assessing document quality\n*   **Generation, Manipulation, and Presentation:** Document authoring tools and systems; Document presentation; Automatically generated documents; Mobile platforms and documents; Document transformation\n*   **Applications:** Digital humanities; Digital preservation/archiving; Open Science; Education; eBooks and digital publishing; Web applications and systems; Mobile applications; Cyber-physical document workflows\n*   **User Experience:** Navigation, search; Usability, accessibility, readability, and aesthetics; Collaborative authoring and editing; Workflows\n*   **Fair Access and Student Support:** SIGWEB is committed to providing fair access and student support to its sponsored conferences by means of travel grants."
