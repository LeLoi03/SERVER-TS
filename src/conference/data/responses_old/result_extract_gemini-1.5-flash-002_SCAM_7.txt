  "Call for Papers": "# SCAM 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 25th IEEE International Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2025) will be held from **September 7-12, 2025, in Auckland, New Zealand**, co-located with ICSME 2025.\n\nSCAM aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on theory, techniques, and applications that concern analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of software systems.\n\n## Tracks\n\nSCAM 2025 will feature two tracks:\n\n*   Research Track\n*   Engineering Track\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe welcome submission of papers that describe original and significant work in the field of source code analysis and manipulation. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Abstract interpretation\n*   Bad smell detection\n*   Bug location and prediction\n*   Clone detection\n*   Concern, concept, and feature localization and mining\n*   Decompilation\n*   Energy efficient source code\n*   Natural language analysis of source code artifacts\n*   Program comprehension\n*   Program slicing\n*   Program transformation and refactoring\n*   Repository, revision, and change analysis\n*   Security vulnerability analysis\n*   Source level metrics\n*   Source level optimization\n*   Source-level testing and verification\n*   Static and dynamic analysis\n\nSCAM explicitly solicits results from any theoretical or technological domain that can be applied to these and similar topics.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Submitted papers should describe original, unpublished, and significant work and must not have been previously accepted for publication nor be concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop.\n*   Papers must not exceed 12 pages (the last 2 pages can be used for references only) and must conform to the IEEE proceedings paper format guidelines. Templates in LaTeX and Word are available on IEEE’s website.\n*   All submissions must be in English and should be submitted electronically in PDF format.\n*   Submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee, judging the paper on its novelty, quality, importance, evaluation, and scientific rigor.\n*   If the paper is accepted, at least one author must register for the conference and present the paper.\n*   All authors, reviewers, and organizers are expected to uphold the IEEE Code of Conduct. Failure to do so may lead to a (desk) rejection of the paper.\n\n### Double-blind Review\n\nWe follow a double-blind reviewing process. Submitted papers must adhere to the following rules:\n\n*   Author names and affiliations must be omitted.\n*   References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person.\n\n### Artifact Evaluation\n\nICSME, VISSOFT, and SCAM have joined forces and present a single Artifact Evaluation Track for the three venues. We invite authors of any paper accepted to SCAM 2025 to submit artifacts associated with their papers for evaluation. Papers with artifacts that meet the review criteria will be awarded badges, noting their contributions to open science in software engineering.\n\nMore information on the Call for Papers of the Joint Artifact Evaluation Track will be available at the ICSME 2025 web page ([https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsme-2025](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsme-2025)).\n\n## Proceedings\n\nAll accepted papers will appear in the proceedings which will be available through the IEEE Digital Library.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract submission:** June 5, 2025\n*   **Paper submission (Research Track):** June 9, 2025\n*   **Paper submission (Engineering Track):** June 11, 2025\n*   **Author notification (Engineering Track):** July 30, 2025\n*   **Author notification (Research Track):** July 30, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready (Engineering Track):** August 15, 2025\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=scam2025](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=scam2025)"
