  "Call for Papers": "# CHIRA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe International Conference on Computer-Human Interaction Research and Applications (CHIRA 2025) will be held from **October 20-21, 2025**. CHIRA is held in conjunction with ICINCO 2025, WEBIST 2025, icSPORTS 2025, and CoopIS 2025. Registration to CHIRA allows free access to these conferences (as a non-speaker).\n\n## Scope\n\nCHIRA aims to bring together professionals, academics, and students interested in advancing research and practical applications of interaction design & human-computer interaction. Four parallel tracks will be held, covering different aspects of Computer-Human Interaction, including Human Factors and Information Systems, Interactive Devices, Interaction Design, and Adaptive and Intelligent Systems.\n\nPapers describing original work on advanced methods, prototypes, systems, tools, and techniques, as well as general survey papers indicating future directions, are encouraged. Accepted papers will be presented at the conference by one of the authors and published in the Proceedings of CHIRA, which will be placed on at least one Digital Library and sent for indexation by the major international indexes.\n\n## Conference Areas\n\n1.  **HUMAN FACTORS FOR INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS, RESEARCH, AND APPLICATIONS:** User Preferences and Customization, Security and Privacy, User Behaviour Analysis, Modelling Human Factors, User Experience Evaluation, Decision Support Systems, Human-Centered AI, Collaborative Systems, Healthcare Applications, User Experience, Entertainment, Social Computing, Human-in-the-loop\n2.  **INTERACTIVE DEVICES:** Metaverse, Conversational Speech Interfaces, 3D Interaction, Virtual, Augmented, Mixed, and Extended Reality, Wearable Sensors, Mobile Devices and Services, Human-Robot Interaction, Brain-Computer Interfaces, Gesture-Based Interaction, EEG Signal Processing\n3.  **INTERACTION DESIGN:** User Experience Design, Accessible and Adaptive Interaction, Design and Evaluation, Interaction Design Modelling, Collaboration and Interaction Design, Mobile Computer-Human Interaction, User-Centered Interaction Design Patterns, Cognitive Interaction, Affective Computing, Multimedia and Multimodal Interaction\n4.  **ADAPTIVE AND INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS:** Visualization Tools, Information Retrieval, Computational Interaction, Context-Aware Systems, Intelligent User Interfaces, Cognition, Communication and Interaction, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), Artificial Intelligence\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nAuthors can submit their work in the form of a complete paper or an abstract. Complete papers can be submitted as a Regular Paper or a Position Paper.\n\n*   **Regular Paper:** Completed and validated research\n*   **Position Paper:** Short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion\n\nAuthors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics. To facilitate the double-blind paper evaluation method, authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors.\n\nAll papers must be submitted through the online submission platform PRIMORIS and should follow the instructions and templates that can be found under Guidelines and Templates.\n\n## Publications\n\nAll accepted complete papers will be published by Springer in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference. The proceedings will be abstracted/indexed in DBLP, Google Scholar, EI-Compendex, INSPEC, Japanese Science and Technology Agency (JST), Norwegian Register for Scientific Journals and Series, Mathematical Reviews, SCImago, Scopus, and zbMATH. CCIS volumes are also submitted for the inclusion in ISI Proceedings.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Conference Date:** October 20 - 21, 2025\n*   **Regular Papers Paper Submission:** May 19, 2025\n*   **Regular Papers Authors Notification:** July 17, 2025\n*   **Regular Papers Camera Ready and Registration:** July 31, 2025\n*   **Position Papers /Regular Papers Paper Submission:** June 26, 2025\n*   **Position Papers /Regular Papers Authors Notification:** July 31, 2025\n*   **Position Papers /Regular Papers Camera Ready and Registration:** September 5, 2025\n*   **Workshops Workshop Proposal:** May 27, 2025\n*   **Special Sessions Special Session Proposal:** May 27, 2025\n*   **Tutorials Tutorial Proposal:** September 11, 2025\n*   **Demos Demo Proposal:** September 11, 2025\n*   **Panels Panel Proposal:** September 11, 2025\n*   **Abstracts Track Abstract Submission:** July 31, 2025\n*   **Abstracts Track Authors Notification:** September 8, 2025\n*   **Abstracts Track Camera Ready and Registration:** September 17, 2025\n\n**Note:** All dates refer to AOE time, i.e., \"Anywhere on Earth\"\n\n## Conference Chair\n\nPietro Cipresso, Department of Psychology, University of Turin, Italy\n\n## Program Chair\n\nHugo Plácido da Silva, IT- Instituto de Telecomunicações, Portugal\n\n## Secretariat\n\nCHIRA Secretariat\n\n*   Address: Avenida de S.
