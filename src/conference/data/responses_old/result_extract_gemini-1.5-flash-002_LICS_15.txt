  "Call for Papers": "# LICS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 40th Annual ACM/IEEE Symposium on Logic in Computer Science (LICS 2025) will be held in **Singapore from 23–26 June 2025**, with workshops on **27 and 28 June**.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nSuggested, but not exclusive, topics of interest include:\n\n*   automata theory\n*   automated deduction\n*   categorical models and logics\n*   concurrency and distributed computation\n*   constraint programming\n*   constructive mathematics\n*   database theory\n*   decision procedures\n*   description logics\n*   domain theory\n*   finite model theory\n*   formal aspects of program analysis\n*   formal methods\n*   foundations of computability\n*   foundations of probabilistic, real-time and hybrid systems\n*   games and logic\n*   higher-order logic\n*   knowledge representation and reasoning\n*   lambda and combinatory calculi\n*   linear logic\n*   logic programming\n*   logical aspects of AI\n*   logical aspects of bioinformatics\n*   logical aspects of computational complexity\n*   logical aspects of quantum computation\n*   logical frameworks\n*   logics of programs\n*   modal and temporal logics\n*   model checking\n*   process calculi\n*   programming language semantics\n*   proof theory\n*   reasoning about security and privacy\n*   rewriting\n*   type systems\n*   type theory\n*   verification\n\n## Instructions to Authors\n\nAuthors are required to submit a paper title and a short abstract of about 100 words in advance of submitting the full paper. The exact deadline time on these dates is given by anywhere on earth (AoE).\n\n*   **Titles and Short Abstracts Due:** January 16, 2025\n*   **Full Papers Due:** January 23, 2025\n*   **Author Response Period:** March 17–20, 2025\n*   **Author Notification:** April 8, 2025\n\nSubmission deadlines are firm; late submissions will not be considered. All submissions will be electronic via [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lics25](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lics25).\n\n### Formatting Instructions\n\nEvery full paper must be submitted in the IEEE Proceedings 2-column 10pt format and may be at most 12 pages, excluding references. Please use IEEEtran.cls version V1.8b, updated 2024. LaTeX style files are available at ieee.org.\n\nThe paper must be in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper. It should begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their significance and relevance to the conference and to computer science, all phrased for the non-specialist. Technical development directed to the specialist should follow. References and comparisons with related work must be included. (If necessary, detailed proofs of technical results may be included in a clearly-labeled appendix, to be consulted at the discretion of program committee members.) Submissions not conforming to the above requirements will be rejected without further consideration.\n\n### Publication\n\n*   The official publication date may differ from the first day of the conference.\n*   The official publication date may affect the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.\n\n## Program Committee Chairs\n\n*   Lars Birkedal, Aarhus University\n*   Barbara König, University of Duisberg-Essen\n\n## Invited Speakers\n\n*   Anuj Dawar\n*   Hongseok Yang\n*   Rustan Leino (tutorial)\n*   Christine Tasson (tutorial)"
