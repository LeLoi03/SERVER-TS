  "Call for Papers": "# ESA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA 2025) is one of the premier conferences on algorithms. It is organized in collaboration with the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS) and is a part of ALGO 2025, to be held in Warsaw, Poland.\n\n## Tracks\n\nPapers with a strong emphasis on the theoretical analysis of algorithms should be submitted to **Track A**, while papers reporting the results of extensive experimental evaluations and/or providing original contributions to the engineering of algorithms for practical applications should be submitted to **Track B**. Submissions that prove or explain results, possibly already known, in a particularly clear, simple, or elegant way should be submitted to **Track S**.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** April 21, 2025, 23:59 AoE ([EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esa2025))\n*   **Notification:** June 23, 2025\n*   **Camera ready:** July 7, 2025\n*   **Conference:** September 15-17, 2025, in Warsaw, Poland\n\n## Awards\n\nThere will be a Best Student Paper Award as well as a Best Paper Award, both sponsored by EATCS. In order for a paper to be considered for the Best Student Paper Award, all of its authors are required to be students at the time of submission.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAuthors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper. Submissions must be formatted in accordance with the LIPIcs proceedings guidelines and may not exceed 500 lines of text. Authors must use the LaTeX class file `socg-lipics-v2021.cls`.  For a quick start, duplicate this [Overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/project/63f274925f9a1a60b575f59b).\n\nProofs omitted due to the line constraint must be placed in an appendix. This appendix will be read by the program committee members at their discretion.  Appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paperâ€™s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.\n\nThese guidelines are strict: submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk being rejected without consideration of their merits.\n\n## Double-Blind Reviewing\n\nThe conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors.  Any references to the authors' own related work should be in the third person.\n\n## Conflict of Interest\n\nWhen submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members. A CoI is limited to the following categories:\n\n*   Family member or close friend.\n*   Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years.\n*   Person with the same affiliation.\n*   Involved in an alleged incident of harassment.\n*   Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter).\n*   Frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.\n\n## Paper Submission and Proceedings\n\nPapers should be submitted electronically via the [EasyChair submission system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esa2025). The ESA 2025 proceedings will be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series."
