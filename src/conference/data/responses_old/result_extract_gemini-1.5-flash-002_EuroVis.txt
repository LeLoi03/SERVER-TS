  "Call for Papers": "# EuroVis 2025: Call for Full Papers\n\nEuroVis 2025 will be held in **Luxembourg City, Luxembourg, on June 2-6, 2025.**\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nThis call invites original submissions of high-quality papers that will set the standard and stimulate future trends in the field of visualization and visual analytics. Accepted full papers will be published in a special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, the International Journal of the Eurographics Association, after a two-stage peer-reviewing process. All accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference.\n\nWe encourage submissions from all areas of visualization and visual analytics. Suggested paper types and topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   **Techniques:** Novel algorithms, visual encoding methods, and/or interaction techniques for data analysis, exploration, or communication.  All sub-areas of visualization and visual analytics are welcomed, including high-dimensional, time-series, spatial, geographic, text, hierarchical, and network data. Techniques may be specialized for specific devices or form-factors (e.g., mobile or wall-scale visualization).\n*   **Systems:** New software frameworks, languages, or tools for visualization; systems for large-scale visualization; integrated graphical systems for visual analysis or interactive machine learning; collaborative and web-scale visualization systems.\n*   **Applications & Design Studies:** Novel use of visualization to address problems in an application domain, including accounts of innovative system design, deployment, and impact. We welcome diverse application areas, including the physical sciences, life sciences, social sciences, engineering, arts, sports, and humanities.\n*   **Evaluation & Empirical Research:** Comparative evaluation of competing visualization approaches; controlled experiments to inform visualization best practices; longitudinal and qualitative studies to understand user needs, visualization adoption, and use.\n*   **Theory:** Models of visual encoding, interaction, and/or analysis tasks; implications from theories of perception, cognition, design, and/or aesthetics; methods for automated design or visualization recommendation.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are AoE (Anywhere on Earth).\n\n*   **Abstract deadline:** November 27, 2024 (Wednesday)\n*   **Full paper deadline:** December 4, 2024 (Wednesday)\n*   **First Round Notification:** February 12, 2025 (Wednesday)\n*   **Revised Submission:** March 5, 2025 (Wednesday)\n*   **Final Notification:** March 19, 2025 (Wednesday)\n*   **Camera Ready Version:** April 16, 2025 (Wednesday)\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n*   The maximum length for submitted papers is 10 pages (in Computer Graphics Forum (CGF) style, including all images and acknowledgements, but excluding references).\n*   References should not exceed 2 pages. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content.\n*   Submissions must be made using the Computer Graphics Forum style, using the conference LaTeX template ([https://www.eurovis2025.lu/fileadmin/files/egPublStyle-EuroVis_full-short-stars-posters-edu_2025.zip](https://www.eurovis2025.lu/fileadmin/files/egPublStyle-EuroVis_full-short-stars-posters-edu_2025.zip)).\n*   Authors have the option to submit their papers anonymously. Double-blind reviewing is optional.\n*   Authors have the option of submitting additional material with their submissions.\n*   All full papers accepted to EuroVis appear in a special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, containing the conference proceedings, and will appear at the same time in the Eurographics digital library.\n\n## Submission Platform\n\nAbstracts and full papers are submitted using the Precision Conference System (PCS): [https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions)\n\n## Contact\n\nFor any questions concerning full paper submissions, please contact the full papers chairs: [fullpapers@eurovis.org](mailto:fullpapers@eurovis.org)\n\n*   Wolfgang Aigner, St. PÃ¶lten University of Applied Sciences, Austria\n*   Natalia Andrienko, Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Germany\n*   Bei Wang, University of Utah, USA"
