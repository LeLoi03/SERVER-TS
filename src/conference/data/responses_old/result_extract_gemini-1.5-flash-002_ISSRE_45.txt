  "Call for Papers": "# ISSRE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE 2025) will be held in **São Paulo, Brazil, from October 21-24, 2025**.\n\nISSRE is the leading conference on software reliability and focuses on approaches, techniques, and tools for assessing, predicting, and improving the reliability, safety, and security of software systems.\n\n## Research Track\n\nThe research track at ISSRE 2025 invites high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results. ISSRE solicits submissions in three categories:\n\n1.  **REG papers:** (Regular research papers) Describe a novel contribution to the reliability of software systems. Novelty should be argued via concrete evidence and appropriate positioning within the state of the art. REG papers are also expected to clearly explain the validation process and its limitations.\n2.  **PER papers:** (Practical experience reports) Provide an in-depth exposition of practical experiences, ideally performed by a collaboration of researchers and industry practitioners. The key contribution should be lessons learned from the application of known research tools and methods related to ISSRE topics, or new knowledge acquired through empirical studies.\n3.  **TAR papers:** (Tools and artifacts) Describe a new tool or artifact. Tool-focused TAR papers must present either a new tool or novel and substantial extensions to an existing tool. They should include a description of (i) the theoretical foundations, (ii) the design and implementation aspects, and (iii) experiments with realistic case studies. Making the tool publicly available is strongly encouraged. Artifact-focused TAR papers should cover (i) a working copy of the software and (ii) experimental data sets.\n\n## Important Dates (AoE)\n\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** April 28, 2025\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** May 5, 2025\n*   **Early decisions:** June 30, 2025\n*   **Author rebuttal period:** June 30 - July 5, 2025\n*   **Notification to authors:** July 18, 2025\n*   **Camera ready papers:** August 19, 2025\n\n### Workshops\n\n*   **Workshop proposal deadline:** May 15, 2025\n*   **Workshop proposal notification:** May 22, 2025\n*   **Workshop paper submission deadline:** July 21, 2025\n*   **Workshop paper notification to authors:** August 11, 2025\n*   **Camera ready papers:** August 18, 2025\n\n## Paper Categories\n\n*   REG papers: 12 pages (including references)\n*   PER papers: 12 pages (including references)\n*   TAR papers: 6-10 pages (including references)\n\nPapers that exceed the page limit for their submission category will be rejected without review.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include development, analysis methods, and models throughout the software development lifecycle, and are not limited to:\n\n*   Dependability attributes (i.e., security, safety, maintainability, survivability, resilience, robustness) impacting software reliability\n*   Reliability threats (i.e., faults, errors, failures)\n*   Reliability means (fault prevention, fault removal, fault tolerance, fault forecasting)\n*   Software testing and formal methods\n*   Software fault localization, debugging, root-cause analysis\n*   Metrics, measurements, and threat estimation for reliability prediction and the interplay with safety/security\n*   Reliability of autonomous systems and (self-)adaptive systems\n*   Reliability of AI-based systems, AI for Reliability Engineering\n*   Reliability of Large Language/Foundational Model (LLM) and LLM for software reliability\n*   Reliability of software services and Software as a Service (SaaS)\n*   Reliability of model-based and auto-generated software\n*   Reliability of open-source software\n*   Reliability of software dealing with Big Data\n*   Reliability of model-based and auto-generated software\n*   Reliability of green and sustainable systems\n*   Reliability of mobile systems\n*   Reliability of software within specific technological spaces\n*   Normative/regulatory/ethical spaces about software reliability\n*   Societal aspects of software reliability\n\n## Anonymizing Rules\n\nAuthors shall anonymize their papers.  Submissions that do not conform to the submission deadline, anonymization, and formatting guidelines will be disregarded.\n\n## Formatting Rules\n\nSubmissions must adhere to the IEEE Computer Society Format Guidelines.  Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file. All fonts must be embedded.\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nPapers are submitted via Easychair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=issre2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=issre2025)\n\n## Review Process and Author Response\n\nAfter the papers have been reviewed, but before the Program Committee/Board meeting, the reviews will be made available to the authors to respond to any factual errors in the reviews. Rebuttals do not include additional information about the research or a submission of an updated or revised paper.  ISSRE 2025 is introducing early decisions to reduce the authors and reviewers’ burden of unnecessary writing/reading of authors’ responses.\n\n## Best Research Paper Award\n\nISSRE is pleased to announce the Best Research Paper Award, attributed every year to the best paper in the Research Track.\n\n## Conference Proceedings\n\nThe conference proceedings will be published by IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services (CPS). Papers presented at the conference will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore and to all of the A&I (abstracting and indexing) partners (such as the EI Compendex)."
