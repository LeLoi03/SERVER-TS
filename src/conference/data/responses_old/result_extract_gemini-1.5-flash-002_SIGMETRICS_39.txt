  "Summary": "The ACM SIGMETRICS 2025 conference will be held at Stony Brook University, New York, USA, on June 9-13, 2025. SIGMETRICS is the flagship conference of the ACM special interest group for the computer systems performance evaluation community. The conference solicits papers on the design, modeling, measurement, and performance analysis of computer systems.",
  "Call for Papers": "# ACM SIGMETRICS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 2025 ACM SIGMETRICS conference will be held at **Stony Brook University, New York, USA, on June 9-13, 2025**.\n\nWe solicit papers on the design, modeling, measurement, and performance analysis of computer systems. A good submission typically focuses on a well-motivated problem in computer systems, proposes a principled solution using modeling, measurement, and performance analysis, and empirically validates the solution through simulations and/or implementation.\n\n## Tracks\n\nSIGMETRICS 2025 uses \"soft\" tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers. All submissions, regardless of the selected track, will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed below when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element.\n\n*   **Learning:** Papers in this track make progress on either (i) the design and analysis of machine learning and AI algorithms, broadly defined, or (ii) the application of tools from machine learning and AI, broadly defined, to the design, control, and optimization of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems.\n*   **Measurement & Applied Modeling:** Papers in this track make an empirical or applied contribution. They often either (i) draw significant insights from real or synthetic data through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources; and/or (ii) propose and apply a new model or simulation tool to capture real-world phenomena.\n*   **Systems:** Papers in this track make a contribution to the design, implementation, and/or practical evaluation of computing, networked, social, or cyber-physical systems. A good submission to this track will make a contribution to the modeling and performance analysis of the system prior to empirical validation.\n*   **Theory:** Papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new analysis techniques.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nThere are three submission opportunities over the course of the year. Deadlines are hard and at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth).\n\n### Summer Submission\n\n*   Website: [sigmetrics25summer.hotcrp.com](https://sigmetrics25summer.hotcrp.com)\n*   Registration of abstract: July 31, 2024\n*   Paper submission: August 7, 2024\n*   Author notification: September 24, 2024\n\n### Fall Submission\n\n*   Website: [sigmetrics25fall.hotcrp.com](https://sigmetrics25fall.hotcrp.com)\n*   Registration of abstract: October 2, 2024\n*   Paper submission: October 9, 2024\n*   Author notification: December 10, 2024\n\n### Winter Submission\n\n*   Website: [sigmetrics25winter.hotcrp.com](https://sigmetrics25winter.hotcrp.com)\n*   Registration of abstract: January 15, 2025\n*   Paper submission: January 22, 2025\n*   Author notification: March 18, 2025\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nPapers must be submitted electronically in printable PDF form via the submission site posted on this page. All submissions should satisfy the following requirements:\n\n*   The submission may have up to 20 pages, in single-column `acmsmall` template format, for technical content (including all tables and figures), plus unlimited pages for references.\n*   Reviewing is double anonymous (also known as double blind); please do NOT include your name or affiliation on the submission.\n*   Authors must truthfully declare all conflicts with program committee members on the submission page.\n*   Authors are encouraged to conform to the inclusivity guidelines provided in the Diversity and Inclusiveness section below.\n\n## Reviewing Process\n\nPapers invited to present at the SIGMETRICS conference are journal papers accepted to the Proceedings of the ACM on Measurement and Analysis of Computing Systems (POMACS). The reviewing process for submissions is a hybrid of the traditional conference and journal models in computer science. There are three possible outcomes from the first round of submission:\n\n*   **Accept with Shepherding:** Every accepted paper will be shepherded.\n*   **Reject:** If the paper is rejected it may not be resubmitted to any SIGMETRICS deadline within 12 months following the initial submission of the paper.\n*   **Resubmit:** For papers that are close to the acceptance threshold, but require a major revision prior to acceptance, the 12-month resubmission ban is waived and a resubmit option is offered.\n\n## Policies\n\n*   Anonymity guidelines\n*   Publication of a pre-submission version\n*   Substantive title and abstract\n*   Original research\n*   Simultaneous submissions\n*   Shepherding process\n*   Opting out of POMACS publication\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\nPapers describing experiments with users or user data should follow the basic principles of ethical research.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusiveness\n\nWe provide inclusivity and accessibility guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation."
