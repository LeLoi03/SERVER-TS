  "Call for Papers": "# DNA31: Call for Papers\n\nThe 31st International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming (DNA31) will be held from **August 25-28, 2025**, at the **Amphithéâtre Charles Mérieux, École Normale Supérieure de Lyon, in Lyon, France**.\n\n## Submission\n\nAll papers and abstracts should be submitted electronically via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dna31](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dna31)\n\nPapers must be submitted in PDF format.\n\n## Tracks\n\nAuthors submitting a paper and/or proposal for a presentation may choose between three submission tracks:\n\n### Track A – Full Paper\n\nFor authors who want their full papers to be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings of Informatics (LIPIcs) conference proceedings. Submissions to this track may not be previously published or simultaneously submitted to another conference or journal for publication. The paper is formatted in LaTeX using the LIPIcs-v2021 style.\n\n*   The main text of the paper is limited to 15 pages (excluding the title page or bibliography).\n*   An optional technical appendix is permitted (up to 5 pages).\n\n### Track B – One-page abstract with accompanying material\n\nPrimarily for authors submitting experimental results who plan to submit to a journal rather than publish in the conference proceedings. For a Track B submission to be considered, it must contain at least 67% (i.e., 2/3) new content, beyond that which has been presented at previous years of the DNA conference, though substantially expanded work previously presented as a poster may be considered. Abstracts for work recently submitted to, or published in, a journal will also be considered.  A one-page abstract and supporting documentation are required.\n\n### Track C – Poster Submissions\n\nFor authors interested in presenting their work only in the poster session. The one-page abstract should describe the primary results and their importance. At the discretion of the PC, a small number of high-quality posters may be selected for short (10-minute) presentations at the conference.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Full paper (track A) and extended abstract (track B) submission:** April 22, 2025 (11:59 PM AoE)\n*   **Notification of paper acceptance:** June 9, 2025\n*   **Revised manuscripts due:** June 23, 2025\n*   **Poster (track C) submission:** June 15, 2025 (11:59 PM AoE)\n*   **Notification of poster acceptance:** June 30, 2025\n*   **Early registration deadline:** July 10, 2025\n*   **Registration ends:** August 14, 2025\n*   **Conference:** August 25-28, 2025\n*   **Conference workshop:** August 29, 2025\n\n**NOTE:** ALL DEADLINES ARE FIRM, THERE WILL BE NO EXTENSIONS!"
