  "Summary": "The 51st International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science (WG 2025) will be held at Europäische Akademie Otzenhausen from June 11 to 13, 2025. WG conferences aim to connect theory and applications by demonstrating how graph-theoretic concepts can be applied in various areas of computer science.",
  "Call for Papers": "# WG 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 51st International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science (WG 2025) will take place from **June 11 to 13, 2025**, with a reception on the evening of June 10, at the **Europäische Akademie Otzenhausen, Germany**.\n\n## Aims and Scope\n\nWG is mainly concerned with efficient algorithms of various types (e.g., sequential, parallel, distributed, randomized, parameterized) for problems on graphs and networks. The goal is to present recent results and to identify and explore directions for future research. Submitted papers should describe original results in any aspects of graph theory related to computer science, including but not restricted to:\n\n*   design and analysis of sequential, parallel, randomized, parameterized algorithms\n*   distributed graph and network algorithms\n*   structural graph theory with algorithmic or complexity applications\n*   computational complexity of graph and network problems\n*   graph grammars, graph rewriting systems, and graph modeling\n*   graph drawing and layouts\n*   computational geometry\n*   computational biology\n*   graph mining\n*   random graphs and models of the web and scale-free networks\n*   support of the above concepts by suitable implementations and applications\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll times are Anywhere on Earth (AoE).\n\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** February 14, 2025\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** February 20, 2025\n*   **Notification of paper acceptance:** April 17, 2025\n*   **Symposium:** June 11-13, 2025\n*   **Final versions due:** July 4, 2025\n\n## Submissions and Proceedings\n\nContributors are invited to submit an extended abstract of at most 12 pages Springer LNCS format ([www.springer.com/lncs](www.springer.com/lncs)) including title and abstract, but excluding references. Proofs omitted due to space restrictions must be placed in an appendix, to be read by program committee members at their discretion. All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. At least one author of each accepted paper will be expected to register and present the paper in person at the conference. Accepted contributions will be published in the conference post-proceedings in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series of Springer-Verlag.\n\nThe submission server is: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wg2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wg2025)\n\n## Awards\n\nWG 2025 will offer awards for the best paper and the best student paper. The awards will be decided by the program committee. The committee can decide to split the awards over multiple papers, or not to offer an award. Papers eligible for the best student paper can have non-student co-authors, but the main work in a paper that is a candidate for the best student paper award must be done by co-authors that were students at the time of submission, and the award can be received only by such co-authors. It must be indicated at the time of submission whether a paper is a candidate for this award."
