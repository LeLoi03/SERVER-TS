  "Call for Papers": "# ISMB/ECCB 2025: Call for Abstracts\n\nThe joint ISMB/ECCB 2025 meeting will be held in **Liverpool, United Kingdom, from July 20-24, 2025**.\n\n## Abstracts â€“ Talks and Posters\n\nWe invite abstracts for research that is topical to bioinformatics and computational biology, which is in progress (unpublished) or previously published within the last 18 months for consideration for oral and/or poster presentation.\n\nYour abstract should be submitted to the Communities of Special Interest (COSI) or Open Session Track that most accurately reflects the area of the work. (You will have the option to identify two other tracks that may also be suited to your research area during your submission). You can learn more about COSIs [here](https://www.iscb.org/communities-of-special-interest).\n\n*   Talks and posters are organized according to scientific topics covered by the COSIs and open sessions listed below.\n*   Abstracts are not limited to COSI and open session topics. If the topic falls outside the listed COSIs you can choose the \"General Computational Biology\" area.\n*   Your abstract should convey a scientific result and should not be an advertisement for any commercial software package.\n*   Multiple presentations of the same talk as an oral presentation are not permitted. Research may be presented as both a talk and a poster if and only if submitted as two individual submissions with two different presenters. Having the same person deliver two (or more) different talks is NOT PERMITTED on the same topic. A presenting author may present NO MORE THAN ONE talk or poster on the same topic.\n*   ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue.  Remote presentation options will be granted for reasons such as maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 15, 2025. If unable to participate in person you will need to request a waiver by writing to [presentationwaiver@iscb.org](mailto:presentationwaiver@iscb.org).\n*   Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference.\n*   ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models ([https://www.iscb.org/iscb-policy-statements/iscb-policy-for-acceptable-use-of-large-language-models](https://www.iscb.org/iscb-policy-statements/iscb-policy-for-acceptable-use-of-large-language-models))\n\n## Abstracts: Deadlines\n\nDifferent submission types have different deadlines and notification dates. Be sure to check the below table or the [key dates page](/ismbeccb2025/key-dates) to find the dates relevant to your submission. Poster-only submissions DO NOT require any materials to be uploaded during submission. Submissions are evaluated on the 250-word text abstract provided during submission.\n\n## Tracks: Communities of Special Interest (COSIs) and Open Sessions\n\n*   3DSIG\n*   Bio-Ontologies\n*   BioInfo-Core\n*   Bioinformatics in UK\n*   BioVis\n*   BOSC: Bioinformatics Open Source Conference\n*   CAMDA\n*   CompMS\n*   Computational and Systems Immunology\n*   Digital Agriculture\n*   Education\n*   Equity and Diversity in Computational Biology Research\n*   EvolCompGen: Evolution and Comparative Genomics\n*   Function\n*   General Computational Biology\n*   HitSeq\n*   iRNA\n*   MLCSB\n*   MICROBIOME\n*   NetBio\n*   RegSys\n*   SysMod\n*   Text Mining\n*   TransMed\n*   VarI\n\n## Abstracts: Submission Guidelines\n\nAll submissions MUST select a presenting author. The presenting author MUST be marked as a corresponding author. Presenters of accepted abstracts are required to make the presentation themselves, and must register and pay to attend the conference. Submitters may choose to have their submission reviewed for: talk or poster or poster only. If you select talk or poster and are unsuccessful for a talk your abstract will automatically be considered for a poster presentation. Submission deadlines are posted in the deadlines section or [key dates page](/ismbeccb2025/key-dates).\n\nDuring the submission process, you will submit to the COSI or open session track that most reflects your research area. You will have the option to identify two other tracks that may also be suited to your research area during your submission.\n\nAll abstracts must be submitted using the conference submission site by the abstract deadlines. (You have until 11:59 p.m. Any Time Zone).\n\nAccepted abstracts (maximum 250 words) will be posted on the conference website. For authors requesting a talk, you should upload a long abstract of up to two (2) pages in PDF format during the submission process.  *Do not submit more than two pages*. It is best to check individual COSI websites for specific information regarding program goals and guidelines. PLEASE note: CAMDA submitters should include a 3-5 page long abstract PDF.\n\n## Abstracts: Review Criteria\n\nAll submissions will be evaluated by a program committee. Submitters may choose to have their submission reviewed for talk or poster or poster only. If you select talk or poster and are unsuccessful for a talk, your abstract will automatically be considered for a poster. Posters advertising commercial software will be rejected from this poster session and/or removed from the conference without notice. There is a separate space for such posters in the exhibition area. If you have an industry poster, contact [events@iscb.org](mailto:events@iscb.org).\n\n## Poster Details for ISMB/ECCB 2025\n\n*   Scientific Research Exchange - Posters Presentation Hours: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM & 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM July 21-24, 2025\n*   Recommended poster size is A0 size (84.1cm wide and 118.9cm tall).\n*   No onsite poster printing is available.\n\n## Late-breaking Posters\n\nAfter the initial submission deadline, late-breaking posters can be submitted. The submission window is notably smaller, be sure not to miss deadlines posted in the deadlines section or [key dates page](/ismbeccb2025/key-dates), as extensions cannot be granted.\n\n## Submission\n\n[Click Here to Submit](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ismbeccb2025)"
