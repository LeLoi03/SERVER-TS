"Call for Papers": "# ICSME 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 41st IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME 2025) will be held in **Auckland, New Zealand from September 7-12, 2025**.\n\n## Goal and Scope\n\nICSME 2025 is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, experiences, and challenges in software maintenance and evolution. We invite high-quality submissions describing significant and unpublished results related to software maintenance and evolution topics, including:\n\n*   Change and defect management\n*   Code cloning and provenance\n*   Concept and feature location\n*   Continuous integration/deployment\n*   Empirical studies of software maintenance and evolution\n*   Evolution of non-code artifacts\n*   Evolution and maintenance of AI-based applications\n*   Human factors and social aspects of software maintenance and evolution\n*   Large Language Models for software evolution and maintenance tasks\n*   Maintenance and evolution of model-based methods\n*   Maintenance and evolution of mobile apps\n*   Maintenance and evolution of service-oriented and cloud computing systems\n*   Maintenance and evolution processes\n*   Maintenance versus release process\n*   Mining software repositories\n*   Productivity of software engineers during maintenance and evolution\n*   Release engineering\n*   Reverse engineering and re-engineering\n*   Run-time evolution and dynamic configuration\n*   Software and system comprehension\n*   Software migration and renovation\n*   Software quality assessment\n*   Software refactoring and restructuring\n*   Software testing theory and practice\n*   Source code analysis and manipulation\n*   Technical Debt\n\n## Evaluation\n\nSubmissions that are not in compliance with the required submission format or that are out of the scope of the conference will be desk-rejected without being reviewed. All submissions that meet the submission criteria and fit the scope of the conference will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nPlease use the following link to submit to the research track: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsme2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsme2025)\n\nSubmitted papers must comply with IEEE plagiarism policy and procedures. Papers submitted to ICSME 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration for ICSME 2025. Submitting the same paper to different tracks of ICSME 2025 is also not allowed. ICSME 2025 will use a double anonymous reviewing process.\n\n## Paper Format\n\nPapers must strictly adhere to the two-column IEEE conference proceedings format. Papers must not exceed 10 pages (including figures and appendices) plus up to 2 pages that contain ONLY references. All submissions must be in PDF and must be submitted online by the deadline via the ICSME 2025 EasyChair link.\n\n## Special Issue\n\nAuthors of select papers from the research track will be invited to submit extended versions of their work to a special issue of the Springer International Journal of Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE).\n\n## Author Response Period\n\nICSME 2025 will offer an author response period. During this period, the authors will have the opportunity to inspect the reviews and answer specific questions raised by the program committee.\n\n## Early Decisions\n\nICSME 2025 will make early decisions: If reviewers already decide that a paper can be accepted in its current state without requiring any further input from the authors, the authors will receive an “Accept” decision at the beginning of the author response period and will not be required to submit a response. Conversely, if the paper is perceived to be in a highly deficient state by the reviewers, leading them to conclude that the authors’ response is unlikely to alter their evaluation significantly, the authors will receive a “Reject” decision at the beginning of the author response period and will not be asked to submit a response. All other papers will receive a “Response Recommended” notification at the beginning of the author response period. However, as customary, it is still up to the authors to decide if they want to submit an author response.\n\n## Publication and Presentation\n\nAccepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. All authors of all accepted papers will be asked to complete an electronic IEEE Copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing their camera-ready versions. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper at the conference.\n\n## Open Science Policy\n\nICSME encourages open science. Sharing of data sets, replication packages, or preprints is expected to be the default, and non-sharing needs to be justified.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll submission dates are at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth)\n\n*   **Abstract submission:** March 6, 2025 (passed; updates of existing submissions allowed until the full paper deadline, but no new submissions)\n*   **Paper submission:** March 13, 2025\n*   **Early Decisions notification:** May 7, 2025\n*   **Final notification:** June 5, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready submission:** TBC"
