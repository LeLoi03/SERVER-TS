  "Call for Papers": "# ITP 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 16th International Conference on Interactive Theorem Proving (ITP 2025) will be held in **Reykjavik, Iceland, from September 27 to October 3, 2025**.\n\n## Topics\n\nITP welcomes submissions describing original research on all aspects of interactive theorem proving and its applications. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n*   Formalizations of computational models\n*   Improvements in interactive theorem prover technology\n*   Formalizations of mathematics\n*   Integration with automated provers and other symbolic tools\n*   Verification of security algorithms\n*   Industrial applications of interactive theorem provers\n*   Formal specification and verification of hardware and software\n*   User interfaces for interactive theorem provers\n*   Use of theorem provers in education\n*   Concise and elegant worked examples of formalizations (proof pearls)\n\n## Paper Categories and Submission\n\nWe welcome regular papers and short papers. Submission for both is lightweight double-blind. This means that:\n\n1.  Author names and institutions must be omitted using the `anonymous` option of the document class.\n2.  References to authors’ own related work should be in the third person.\n3.  The identity of authors will be revealed to reviewers once they have submitted a first draft of their review.\n\n### Regular Papers\n\n*   Must be no more than 16 pages in length excluding bibliographic references.\n*   Must not include an appendix.\n*   Must be in LIPIcs format.\n\n### Short Papers\n\nShort papers can be used to describe interesting work that is still ongoing and not fully mature. Accepted short papers will be published in the main proceedings and will be presented as short talks. Short papers must:\n\n*   Be no more than 6 pages in length excluding bibliographic references and may consist of an extended abstract.\n*   Have the phrase \"Short paper\" as a subtitle.\n*   Not include an appendix.\n*   Be in LIPIcs format.\n\nBoth categories of papers must be prepared in LaTeX using the [LIPIcs-v2021 style (v2021.1.3)](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author) and must be submitted electronically as pdf files through [HotCRP](https://itp25.hotcrp.com).\n\nAll submissions are expected to be accompanied by supplementary material containing verifiable evidence of a suitable implementation, such as the source files of a formalization for the proof assistant used.\n\n## Publication\n\nThe conference proceedings will be published in Dagstuhl Publishing’s Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series in Gold Open Access under the CC-BY-4.0 license.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** March 12, 2025\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** March 19, 2025\n*   **Author notification:** May 23, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready copy due:** June 27, 2025\n\n## Programme Committee Co-chairs\n\n*   Yannick Forster, Inria Paris\n*   Chantal Keller, LMF, Université Paris-Saclay\n\n## Programme Committee\n\n*   Mohammad Abdulaziz, King's College London\n*   Reynald Affeldt, AIST\n*   Jeremy Avigad, Carnegie Mellon University\n*   Anne Baanen, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Lean FRO LLC\n*   Małgorzata Biernacka, University of Wroclaw\n*   Mario Carneiro, Chalmers University of Technology\n*   Évelyne Contejean, CNRS\n*   María Inés de Frutos Fernández, University of Bonn\n*   Tom de Jong, University of Nottingham\n*   Thaynara Arielly de Lima, Universidade Federal de Goiás\n*   Manuel Eberl, University of Innsbruck\n*   Chelsea Edmonds, University of Sheffield\n*   Andres Erbsen, Google\n*   Thiago Felicissimo, Inria Rennes\n*   Amy Felty, University of Ottawa\n*   Asta Halkjær From, University of Copenhagen\n*   Aymeric Fromherz, Inria Paris\n*   Ruben Gamboa, University of Wyoming\n*   Hrutvik Kanabar, Arm\n*   Dominik Kirst, Inria\n*   Angeliki Koutsoukou-Argyraki, University of Cambridge\n*   Vincent Laporte, Inria Nancy\n*   Meven Lennon-Bertrand, University of Cambridge\n*   Robert Lewis, Brown University\n*   Heather Macbeth, Fordham University, NYC\n*   Paolo Masci, NASA\n*   Cody Roux, AWS\n*   Yong Kiam Tan, Institute for Infocomm Research, A*STAR, Singapore\n*   Andrew Tolmach, Portland State University\n*   Sophie Tourret, Inria Nancy\n*   Dmitriy Traytel, University of Copenhagen\n*   Niccolò Veltri, Tallinn University of Technology\n*   Bohua Zhan, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd."
