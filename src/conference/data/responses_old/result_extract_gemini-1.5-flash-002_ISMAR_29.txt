  "Call for Papers": "# ISMAR 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 24th IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality (ISMAR 2025) will be held at the **Daejeon Convention Center (DCC), South Korea, from October 8 to October 12, 2025**.\n\n## Overview\n\nISMAR 2025 will host a single track for papers and include a revise and resubmit phase strengthening the rebuttal opportunity. ISMAR 2025 will cover industry and research activities related to the full range of immersive technologies (AR, MR, and VR).\n\n## Paper Submissions\n\nThis year, there is one submission deadline for a unified review process for both the IEEE TVCG journal and the conference-only papers. The possible outcomes of this unified process are:\n\n*   Accept as IEEE TVCG paper, with presentation at ISMAR 2025\n*   Accept as IEEE ISMAR 2025 conference paper, with presentation at ISMAR 2025\n*   Recommended as IEEE ISMAR 2025 poster\n*   Reject\n\nSubmissions accepted as journal papers will be directly published in a special issue of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). Submissions accepted as conference papers will be published in the conference proceedings of ISMAR 2025. All accepted papers will be archived in the IEEE Xplore digital library.\n\nSubmissions may be 4-9 pages with an additional 2 pages of references. A paper abstract must be uploaded prior to the actual paper submission deadline. All paper submissions must be in English and left blind for review.\n\n## Important Deadlines\n\n*   **Abstract deadline:** April 4th, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Friday)\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** April 11th, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Friday)\n*   **Initial Notification:** June 3rd, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Tuesday)\n*   **Revise and Resubmit deadline:** June 18th, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Wednesday)\n*   **Final Notification:** July 22nd, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Tuesday)\n*   **Camera-ready version:** July 31st, 2025 (23:59 AoE, Thursday)\n\n## Review Process\n\nThe review process will have two cycles under the single submission deadline.\n\n### Review Cycle I (Submission to Initial Notification)\n\nSubmissions will be assigned to two members of the ISMAR 2025 International Program Committee (IPC): a primary coordinator (1AC) and a secondary coordinator (2AC). Submissions that violate the [submission guidelines](/2025/contribute/guidelines/submissions) will be desk rejected.\n\n### Review Cycle II (Revision with Rebuttal to Final Decision)\n\nAuthors will be given time to revise their submissions and write a rebuttal to the initial notifications. The revised submission and rebuttal will be submitted, and the reviewers will review the revised submission.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nAll topics relevant to and advancing AR, MR, and VR are of interest.  A strong and explicit connection to AR, MR, and/or VR is essential for submissions. VR papers are welcome regardless of their relevance to AR/MR. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Artificial intelligence / Machine learning\n*   Assistive technologies and applications\n*   Camera and projector-camera calibration\n*   Collaborative interfaces\n*   Computer vision\n*   Content creation/authoring and content management\n*   Conversational and speech interfaces\n*   Display technologies\n*   Diversity and inclusivity issues\n*   Ethical issues\n*   Ergonomics and human factors\n*   Free viewpoint image generation\n*   Haptic and tactile interfaces\n*   Human augmentations\n*   Human-computer interaction\n*   Immersive visual analytics\n*   Localization, spatial registration, and tracking\n*   Locomotion and navigation techniques\n*   Mediated and diminished reality\n*   Multimodal input and output\n*   Omnidirectional, 360, immersive videos\n*   Optics\n*   Perception\n*   Presence, body ownership, and agency\n*   Psychology\n*   Real-time performance issues\n*   Rendering techniques\n*   Sensor fusion\n*   Spatial audio, auditory perception, and psychoacoustics\n*   Spatial AR, projection mapping, projector-camera systems\n*   System architectures, distributed, and online systems\n*   Touch, tangible, and gesture interfaces\n*   Technology acceptance and social implications\n*   Teleoperation, telepresence, and telexistence\n*   User experience, usability studies, and human-subjects experiments\n*   VR simulations of AR/MR\n*   Virtual production\n*   Virtual humans and avatars\n*   Visualization techniques\n\n### AR/MR/VR applications from domains include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Architecture\n*   Art, cultural heritage, education and training\n*   Automotive and aerospace\n*   Entertainment, sports broadcast\n*   Health, wellbeing, and medical applications\n*   Industrial, military, emergency response\n*   Therapy and rehabilitation"
