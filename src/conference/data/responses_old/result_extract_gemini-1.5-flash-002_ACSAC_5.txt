  "Summary": "The Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) brings together leading researchers and practitioners, along with a diverse group of security professionals drawn from academia, industry, and government, gathered to present and discuss the latest cybersecurity results and topics. ACSAC's first edition was held in 1985 and is now one of the oldest computer security conferences. ACSAC 2025 will be held near the infamous Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii, from December 8-12, 2025.",
  "Call for Papers": "# ACSAC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) will be held in **Honolulu, Hawaii from December 8-12, 2025**.\n\nACSAC brings together leading researchers and practitioners, along with a diverse group of security professionals drawn from academia, industry, and government, gathered to present and discuss the latest cybersecurity results and topics.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe main topics of interest to ACSAC include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Access Control, Assurance, Audit\n*   Anonymity, Privacy\n*   Application Security\n*   Big Data for Security\n*   Cloud and Virtualization Security\n*   Cyber-Physical Systems, Embedded Systems, and IoT Security\n*   Data Integrity and Protection\n*   Denial of Service Attacks and Defenses\n*   Deployable Trustworthy Systems\n*   Digital Forensics\n*   Distributed Systems Security\n*   Enterprise Security Management and Incident Response\n*   Hardware and Supply Chain Security\n*   Identity Management\n*   Intrusion Detection, Prevention\n*   Machine Learning Security\n*   Malware\n*   Mobile Security, Wireless Security\n*   Network Security\n*   OS Security, Systems Security\n*   Resilience\n*   Security Applications of Generative AI (Hard Topic)\n*   Software Security\n*   Software-defined Programmable Security\n*   Usability, Human-centered Security\n*   Web Security\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   Paper Submissions: May 28 (23:59 Anywhere on Earth) — firm deadline\n*   Early Rejection Notification: July 8, 2025\n*   Authors Response Period: August 2-7, 2025 (tentative)\n*   Acceptance Notification: August 19, 2025\n*   Paper Artifacts Submission:  Please refer to the Call for Paper Artifacts\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted to another conference or journal for consideration of publication.\n*   Submissions must be fully anonymous with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references.\n*   Submissions must be written in English and have at most 10 double-column pages, excluding well-marked references and appendices limited to a maximum of 5 pages. The full PDF document must not exceed a total of 15 pages.\n*   Papers must be appropriately anonymized to the dual anonymous review process.\n\n## New this year: Reproduction and Replication (R+R) Papers\n\nSecurity research is often criticized for the poor reproducibility of its results, a situation we aim to address through artifact evaluation. At the same time, reproduction and replication studies are often undervalued in academic publishing. Thus, in addition to regular papers and artifact evaluations, this year we are also soliciting studies that confirm, question, or clarify the results of previous research. These papers must contain the prefix “R+R:” in their title and check the corresponding option in the submission form.\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\nPapers that might raise ethical concerns (e.g., papers that use human subjects, leverage potentially sensitive data, or describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems) must include an Ethical Considerations section that properly describes what procedures have been followed to minimize potential harm.\n\n## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nACSAC is committed to supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the cybersecurity community. Authors are encouraged to consider DEI issues as they prepare their submissions (e.g., keep in mind that Words Matter ).\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n*   Martina Lindorfer, TU Wien\n*   Gianluca Stringhini, Boston University\n\n## Artifacts Evaluation Co-Chairs\n\n*   Adwait Nadkarni, William & Mary\n*   Tobias Fiebig, MPI-INF"
