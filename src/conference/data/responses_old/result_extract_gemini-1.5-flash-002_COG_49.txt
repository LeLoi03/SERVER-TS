  "Call for Papers": "# IEEE CoG 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe annual IEEE Conference on Games (IEEE CoG) is a leading scientific research venue for game researchers and practitioners. IEEE CoG 2025 will take place at the **University of Lisbon in Lisbon, Portugal**.\n\n## Call for Full Papers\n\nWe invite the submission of full technical and vision papers with an 8-page limit (including references and appendices).\n\n*   **Full technical papers:** should provide a technical or empirical contribution to scientific, technical, or engineering aspects of games.\n*   **Full vision papers:** should describe a vision for the future of the Games field or some part of it, be based on extensive research, and include a comprehensive bibliography. Literature reviews and opinion papers with speculations not grounded in research are immediately rejected.\n\n## Call for Auxiliary Papers\n\nWe invite the submission of short, demo, and competition papers. We continue to invite vision papers. Auxiliary papers will be included in the conference proceedings.\n\n*   **Short papers (2-4 pages):** describe work in progress, smaller projects that are not yet ready to be published as a full paper, or new progress on projects that have been reported elsewhere.\n*   **Demo papers (2 pages):** describe works to be presented during a demo session.\n*   **Competition papers (8 pages):** describe research related to one of the competitions in the Games community, including the design of new competitions and in particular submissions to existing competitions.\n*   **Vision papers:** should describe a vision for the future of the Games field or some part of it, be based on extensive research, and include a comprehensive bibliography. Literature reviews and opinion papers with speculations not grounded in research are immediately rejected.\n\nAll page limits include references and appendices.\n\n## Tracks\n\nWe invite authors to select the track that best matches the expertise needed to assess your research and that you believe will most fully appreciate the contribution of your paper to the field of games research.\n\n*   **AI and Game-playing:** This track is suitable for computational and artificial intelligence applications in digital and non-digital games, except for procedural content generation (see below). Topics include but are not limited to general game-playing AI, mixed-initiative authoring tools, believable agents, and AI-assisted game design and testing. \n    *   Track chairs: Diego-Perez Liebana ([diego.perez@qmul.ac.uk](mailto:diego.perez@qmul.ac.uk)) and Kyung-Joong Kim ([kjkim@gist.ac.kr](mailto:kjkim@gist.ac.kr))\n*   **Procedural Content Generation (PCG):** This track focuses on advancing research on developing and evaluating algorithms that automatically create game design and content such as levels, maps, characters, stories, textures, and music. We welcome theoretical papers on the subject.\n    *   Track chairs: Antonios Liapis ([an.liapis@gmail.com](mailto:an.liapis@gmail.com)) and Ahmed Khalifa ([ahmed.khalifa@um.edu.mt](mailto:ahmed.khalifa@um.edu.mt))\n*   **Designing Games, Serious Games and Playful Experience:** This track welcomes papers that make a designerly contribution to games, playful interaction, and other playable media.\n    *   Track chairs: Casper Harteveld ([c.harteveld@northeastern.edu](mailto:c.harteveld@northeastern.edu))\n*   **Game Technology:** This track invites papers that improve the technical aspects of game design and development besides AI and robotics.\n    *   Track chairs: Christopher Salge ([C.Salge@herts.ac.uk](mailto:C.Salge@herts.ac.uk)) and Johannes Pfau ([j.pfau@uu.nl](mailto:j.pfau@uu.nl))\n*   **Game HCI, Player Experience, Game Analytics, e-sports:** This track is suitable for submissions that seek to understand people in the context of play.\n    *   Track chairs: Alessandro Canossa ([acan@kglakademi.dk](mailto:acan@kglakademi.dk)) and Erica Kleinman ([e.kleinman@northeastern.edu](mailto:e.kleinman@northeastern.edu))\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nCoG will use a double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from their submissions and avoid obvious identifying statements.
