  "Call for Papers": "# RSS 2025: Call for Papers and Demos\n\nThe 21st edition of the Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) conference will be held at the **University of Southern California in Los Angeles, California, USA, from June 21-25, 2025.**\n\nRSS is a single-track conference that connects researchers working on all aspects of robotics, including scientific foundations, mechanisms, algorithms, applications, and analysis of robotic systems.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract/Title Submission Deadline:** January 17, 2025, 11:59 pm AoE\n*   **Initial Paper and Demo Submission Deadline:** January 24, 2025, 11:59 pm AoE\n*   **Final PDF Submission Deadline:** January 31, 2025, 11:59 pm AoE\n*   **Supplementary Material Submission Deadline:** January 31, 2025, 11:59 pm AoE\n*   **Reviews Released and Rebuttal Invitations:** March 17, 2025, 11:59 pm AoE\n*   **Rebuttal Submission Deadline:** March 24, 2025, 11:59 pm AoE\n*   **Paper and Demo Acceptance Notification:** April 10, 2025, 11:59 pm AoE\n*   **Final Camera Ready Paper Submission:** April 25, 2025, 11:59 pm AoE\n*   **RSS Pioneers Workshop:** June 20, 2025\n*   **RSS 2025 Conference:** June 21–25, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nRSS 2025 has no page length requirements on submissions. Detailed submission instructions are available [here](/information/authorinfo/).\n\n## Demo Submissions\n\nDemo submissions will be possible for RSS 2025 contributors.  Open-source and open-access systems or interactive systems that are accessible by the community are especially encouraged.\n\n## Review Process\n\nThe review process will continue RSS’ strong tradition in emphasizing quality, fairness, and rigor. Reviews for RSS papers of all types, i.e., “science”, “systems”, and “demo” papers, will remain blind. The conference includes a rebuttal stage.\n\n## Limitations Section\n\nRSS 2025 will require papers to include a “Limitations” section, describing shortcomings and open problems related to the proposed contribution.\n\n## Title/Abstract Submission\n\nRSS 2025 requires authors to submit the title/abstract of their paper(s) by January 17, one week before the full paper submission. \n\n## Subject Areas\n\nRSS seeks high-quality research papers and demos that introduce new ideas and stimulate future trends in robotics. We invite paper and demo submissions in all areas of robotics, including:\n\n*   Assembly, Logistics and Manufacturing\n*   Assistive, Entertainment and Service Robots\n*   Autonomous Vehicle Navigation & Mobile Robots\n*   Bioinspired Robots\n*   Control & Dynamics\n*   Cognitive Modeling & Knowledge Representation for Robots\n*   Field Robotics (e.g., Aerial, Agricultural, Construction, Space, Underwater Robotics)\n*   Formal Methods for Robotics\n*   Grasping & Manipulation\n*   Human-Robot Interaction\n*   Humanoid & Walking Robots\n*   Mechanisms & Design\n*   Medical Robotics\n*   Multi-Robot & Networked Systems\n*   Robot Learning: Foundation Models\n*   Robot Learning: Reinforcement Learning\n*   Robot Learning: Imitation Learning\n*   Robot Learning: Model Learning\n*   Robot Learning: Datasets and Benchmarks\n*   Robot Modeling & Simulation\n*   Perceptual Learning\n*   Robot Perception, Sensing & Vision\n*   Robot Planning\n*   Robot State Estimation, Localization & Mapping\n*   Soft Robots"
