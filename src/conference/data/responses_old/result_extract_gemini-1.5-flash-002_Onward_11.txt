  "Call for Papers": "# Onward! Papers: Call for Papers\n\nOnward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.\n\nOnward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are AoE (UTC-12h)\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** April 24, 2025\n*   **First-round notification:** June 6, 2025\n*   **Revised submission deadline:** July 17, 2025\n*   **Final notification:** August 11, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready deadline:** August 25, 2025\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/](https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nFor fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.\n\nAuthors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.\n\n## Concurrent Submissions\n\nPapers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.\n\n## Policy on Double-Blind Review\n\nOnward! 2025 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review.\n\n## Policy on Authorship Changes\n\nAny addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.\n\n## Format\n\nSubmissions should use [ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/) and 10-point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.\n\n## Page Limit\n\nTo ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self-contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages.\n\n## Publication\n\nThe official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor additional information, clarification, or answers to questions, please contact the Program Chair via [onward@splashcon.org](mailto:onward@splashcon.org)."
