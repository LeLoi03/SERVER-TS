  "Call for Papers": "# SCA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 24th annual Symposium on Computer Animation (SCA) will take place in **Vancouver, Canada, from August 8 to August 10, 2025**.\n\nSCA is the premier forum for presenting innovations on the theory, software, and technology of computer animation.  Its single-track program features paper sessions, poster presentations, panel discussions, and keynote talks.  Its emphasis on community interaction makes SCA the best venue to exchange research results, get inspired, and initiate collaborations.\n\n## Topics\n\nWe invite submissions of original, high-quality papers on computer animation, broadly defined as computation dealing with time-varying phenomena.  Topics include:\n\n*   2D, 3D, and N-D animation systems\n*   Autonomous agents\n*   Clothing animation and simulation\n*   Computational design of animated systems\n*   Expressive motion / communication\n*   Generative and morphable models\n*   3D and 4D motion modeling\n*   Learned character control\n*   Facial animation\n*   Feature learning of motions, faces, body shapes and hand gestures\n*   Foundation models for animation\n*   Group and crowd behavior\n*   Interactive computer graphics\n*   Intuitive interfaces for creating and editing animations\n*   Mathematical foundations of animation\n*   Methods of control and artistic direction of simulations\n*   Machine learning techniques for animation\n*   Multimodal techniques for animation\n*   Modeling and simulation of natural phenomena\n*   Nature in motion (natural phenomena, plants, clouds, etc.)\n*   New time-based art forms on the computer\n*   Novel time-varying phenomena\n*   Perceptual metrics of animation\n*   Physical realism / measuring the real world for animation\n*   Physical simulation\n*   Fluid animation and simulation\n*   Planning / learning / optimization for animation\n*   Real-time and interactive methods\n*   Camera control methods for computer animation\n*   Sound and speech for animation\n*   ... as well as related problems in robotics, game development, human-computer interaction, simulation visualization, computer vision, and others.\n\nSCA welcomes all kinds of contributions that advance the field of computer animation. This includes new and improved algorithms, but also:\n\n*   New datasets\n*   Advanced practices in data collection and curation\n*   Benchmarks and benchmarking tools\n*   Perceptual studies\n*   Experimental studies\n*   Material measurements\n*   Systems\n*   Hardware\n*   Theoretical foundations\n*   New promising approaches that do not yet achieve state-of-the-art performance\n\n## Technical Papers - Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Papers can be submitted via the [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sca2025) website.\n*   Papers should be written and presented in English.\n*   There is no strict maximum length for submitted papers. However, we recommend that research papers be up to 16 pages (excluding references), and longer papers should make a very significant contribution.\n*   Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content.\n*   A paper submission should describe an original work of the authors.\n*   Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources.\n*   Supplementary material such as videos may also be submitted electronically and will be made available to reviewers (size up to 500MB). Videos are required for techniques involving motion or animation.\n*   The author(s) of accepted papers must also attend the conference and present their work in-person. At least one (1) author from each accepted paper must register for the conference.\n*   Submitted articles will receive two rounds of reviewing by at least three expert reviewers. There is no rebuttal process.\n\n### Paper Format\n\nResearch papers should be in [ACM article format](https://www.siggraph.org/preparing-your-content/author-instructions/) using the ACM small trim journal size (`acmsmall`).\n\n### Anonymous Submissions\n\nPaper submissions must be anonymous and include the unique paper ID that will be assigned upon creating a submission using the online system.  The review process is double-anonymous.\n\n## Awards\n\nBest Paper Awards will be given to exceptional submissions on the cutting edge of computer animation.\n\n## Poster Abstracts\n\nThe poster session will be part of the SCA program.  Poster abstracts will not be included in the conference proceedings.\n\n*   Poster abstract submissions should consist of a PDF paper according to the ACM article format. Submissions are permitted to be up to two pages in length, written and presented in English.\n*   Supplementary material such as videos may also be submitted electronically and will be made available to reviewers. All supplementary materials must be submitted as a single zip file (size up to 500MB).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission deadline (papers):** April 7, 2025 (23:59 Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Submission deadline (posters):** June 15, 2025 (23:59 AoE)\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** May 12, 2025\n*   **Revised version deadline:** June 12, 2025 (23:59 AoE)\n*   **Journal notification:** June 30, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready deadline:** July 10, 2025 (23:59 AoE)"
