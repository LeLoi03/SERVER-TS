  "Call for Papers": "# FSE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE 2025) will be held in **Trondheim, Norway from June 23-27, 2025.**\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nFSE 2025 invites high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental software engineering research. Contributions should describe innovative and significant original research. Papers describing groundbreaking approaches to emerging problems are also welcome, as well as replication papers. Submissions that facilitate reproducibility by using available datasets or making the described tools and datasets publicly available are especially encouraged.\n\n**Note:** Submissions must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023, which contains policy regarding the use of Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT.\n\n## Tracks\n\nThis CFP refers to the Research Track of FSE 2025. For the remaining tracks, please check the specific calls on the website: [https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025](https://conf.researchr.org/home/fse-2025)\n\n## How to Submit\n\n*   The following only applies to the main track of FSE. For the other tracks, please see the general formatting instructions: [https://conf.researchr.org/track/fse-2025/fse-2025-how-to-submit](https://conf.researchr.org/track/fse-2025/fse-2025-how-to-submit)\n*   At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the LaTeX or Word (Mac) or Word (Windows) templates.\n*   Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2025 submission site: [https://fse2025.hotcrp.com](https://fse2025.hotcrp.com)\n\n## Double-Anonymous Review Process\n\nIn order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process.\n\n## Submission Policies\n\nThe authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023, and its accompanying FAQ, including the following points:\n\n*   Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work.\n*   If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.\n\n## Open Science Policy\n\nThe research track of FSE has introduced an open science policy. Openness in science is key to fostering scientific progress via transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The steering principle is that all research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and that empirical studies should be reproducible.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Artificial intelligence and machine learning for software engineering\n*   Autonomic computing\n*   Debugging and fault localization\n*   Dependability, safety, and reliability\n*   Distributed and collaborative software engineering\n*   Embedded software, safety-critical systems, and cyber-physical systems\n*   Empirical software engineering\n*   Human and social aspects of software engineering\n*   Human-computer interaction\n*   Mining software repositories\n*   Mobile development\n*   Model checking\n*   Model-driven engineering\n*   Parallel, distributed, and concurrent systems\n*   Performance engineering\n*   Program analysis\n*   Program comprehension\n*   Program repair\n*   Program synthesis\n*   Programming languages\n*   Recommendation systems\n*   Requirements engineering\n*   Search-based software engineering\n*   Services, components, and cloud\n*   Software architectures\n*   Software engineering education\n*   Software engineering for machine learning and artificial intelligence\n*   Software evolution\n*   Software processes\n*   Software security\n*   Software testing\n*   Software traceability\n*   Symbolic execution\n*   Tools and environments\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll dates are 23:59:59 AoE (UTC-12h)\n\n*   Paper registration: September 5, 2024\n*   Full paper submission: September 12, 2024\n*   Author response: November 22-26, 2024\n*   Initial notification: January 14, 2025\n*   Revised manuscript submissions (major revisions only): February 25, 2025\n*   Final notification for major revisions: April 1, 2025\n*   Camera ready: April 24, 2025"
