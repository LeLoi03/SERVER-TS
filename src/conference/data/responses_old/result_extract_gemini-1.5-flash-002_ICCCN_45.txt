ICCCN serves to foster communication among researchers and practitioners with a common interest in improving communications and networking through scientific and technological innovation.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe primary focus of the ICCCN 2025 conference is on new and original research results in the areas of design, implementation, and applications of computer communications and networks. ICCCN 2025 covers the following technical tracks:\n\n*   **Track 1:** Infrastructure Networking Technologies\n*   **Track 2:** Network Architecture, Algorithm, Protocol, and Evaluation\n*   **Track 3:** IoT and Cyber-Physical Systems\n*   **Track 4:** Edge and Cloud Computing\n*   **Track 5:** Pervasive Communications, Networking and Sensing\n*   **Track 6:** Social Networks, Extended Reality, and Metaverse\n*   **Track 7:** AI-Enabled Communications and Networks\n*   **Track 8:** Security, Privacy, and Trust\n*   **Track 9:** Emerging Topics in Networking\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmitted manuscripts must be formatted in standard IEEE camera-ready format (double-column, 10-pt font) and must be submitted via EasyChair ([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icccn2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icccn2025)) as PDF files (formatted for 8.5×11-inch paper). The manuscripts should be no longer than 9 pages including all figures/tables and references. Submitted papers should not be previously published in or be under consideration for publication in another conference or journal.\n\n## Review and Publication of Manuscripts\n\nSubmitted papers will be reviewed by the TPC and judged on originality, technical correctness, relevance, and quality of presentation (the review process is single-blind). An accepted paper must be presented at the conference venue by a registered author at the full registration rate. Each full registration covers up to two conference papers authored by the registered author.\n\nAccepted and presented (onsite) papers will be published in the conference proceedings and IEEE Xplore.\n\n## Workshops\n\nICCCN 2025 workshops are exciting forums to present, discuss, and formulate specialized topics and emerging hot research topics. Workshop papers should be no longer than 6 pages including all figures/tables and references. The detailed info can be found in each workshop’s Call for Papers from [http://www.icccn.org/icccn25/workshop/list-of-workshops/](http://www.icccn.org/icccn25/workshop/list-of-workshops/).\n\n## Poster Papers\n\nICCCN 2025 provides an opportunity to present in-progress work in the fields of computer communications and networks. Posters must be formatted in standard IEEE camera-ready format (double-column, 10-pt font).
