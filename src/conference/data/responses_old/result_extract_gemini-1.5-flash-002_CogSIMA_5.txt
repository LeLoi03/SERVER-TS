  "Call for Papers": "# CogSIMA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 2025 IEEE Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation Management (CogSIMA) will be held at the **University of Duisburg-Essen, Campus Duisburg, from June 2-5, 2025**.\n\nCogSIMA 2025 is sponsored by the **IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society (SMCS)** and supported by the IEEE SMCS Technical Committees on **Cognitive Situation Management** and **Interactive and Wearable Computing and Devices**.\n\n## Theme\n\n\"Improved Situation Awareness in Theory and Application\"\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nCogSIMA 2025 continues to push forward the boundaries of cognitive situation management research. The conference series has become a premier scientific forum for presenting novel results on interdisciplinary studies of complex heterogeneous dynamical systems that include humans, physical systems, and computer agents whose behaviors depend on situations.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nWe invite two types of submissions, regular papers and poster presentations, which will undergo a competitive review process. All papers must present original and unpublished work that is not currently under review elsewhere. Each paper will be reviewed by at least three independent referees. Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the conference.\n\n*   **Regular Papers (5-8 pages):** describe new results that advance the state-of-the-art. Each accepted paper will be allocated approximately 25 minutes for the oral presentation during the conference.\n*   **Poster Presentations (3-5 pages):** describe work in progress. Each accepted poster will be presented in a 5-minute talk in the poster session and will be included in the final conference proceedings submitted to the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.\n\nAuthors should prepare a Portable Document Format (PDF) version of their paper using the stylesheet templates provided by IEEE. For more information, contact [admin@cogsima.org](mailto:admin@cogsima.org). All paper submissions will be handled electronically.\n\n## Publication\n\nAccepted papers and poster presentations will be submitted for publication in the **IEEE Xplore® Digital Library**, which will be indexed by all major indexing and web discovery services.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Regular & Poster Papers due:** December 20, 2024 (firm!)\n*   **Notification of Acceptance:** February 25, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready due:** March 25, 2025\n\n## Contact\n\nFor questions concerning CogSIMA 2025, contact [admin@cogsima.org](mailto:admin@cogsima.org)."
