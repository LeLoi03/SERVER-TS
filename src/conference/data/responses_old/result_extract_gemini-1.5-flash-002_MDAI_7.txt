  "Call for Papers": "# MDAI 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 22nd International Conference on Modeling Decisions for Artificial Intelligence (MDAI 2025) will be held in **València, Spain, from September 15-18, 2025**.\n\n## Aims and Goals\n\nIn MDAI, we are particularly interested in the different facets of decision processes in a broad sense. This includes model building and all kinds of mathematical tools for data aggregation, information fusion, and decision making; tools to help decision in data science problems (including e.g., statistical and machine learning algorithms as well as data visualization tools); and algorithms for data privacy and transparency-aware methods so that data processing processes and decisions made from them are fair, transparent, explainable, and avoid unnecessary disclosure of sensitive information.\n\nThe MDAI conference includes the following tracks:\n\n*   Human decision making\n*   Aggregation functions\n*   Data science and machine learning\n*   Data privacy\n*   Graphs and (social) networks\n*   Information security\n\n## Submission and Publication\n\nOriginal technical contributions are sought. Contributions will be selected on the basis of their quality. Papers should not exceed 12 pages in total (using LNCS/LNAI style).\n\nProceedings with accepted papers will be published in the LNAI/LNCS series (Springer-Verlag) and distributed at the conference. Besides, papers that, according to the evaluation of the referees, are not suitable for the LNAI but that have some merits will be published in some additional proceedings (with ISBN) and scheduled in the MDAI program. Direct submission to these other proceedings is also possible.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **LNAI Submission deadline:** April 12, 2025\n*   **LNAI Acceptance notification:** May 15, 2025\n*   **USB-only Submission deadline:** May 20, 2025\n*   **Final version of LNAI accepted papers:** June 5, 2025\n*   **USB Acceptance notification:** June 15, 2025\n*   **Early registration:** June 20, 2025\n*   **Conference:** September 15-18, 2025\n\n## Contacts\n\n*   [mdai@mdai.cat](mailto:mdai@mdai.cat)\n\n## General Chairs\n\n*   Josep Domingo-Ferrer (Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Catalonia)\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n*   Vicenç Torra (Umeå University, Sweden)\n*   Yasuo Narukawa (Tamagawa University, Japan)\n*   Josep Domingo-Ferrer (Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Catalonia)\n\n## Advisory Board & Program Chairs\n\n[http://www.mdai.cat/](http://www.mdai.cat/)"
