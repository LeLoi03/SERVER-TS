  "Call for Papers": "# EWSN 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 22nd International Conference on Embedded Wireless Systems and Networks (EWSN 2025) will be held in **Leuven, Belgium from September 22–25, 2025**, hosted by KU Leuven.\n\nEWSN targets new platforms and software systems that enable sensing, communication, computation, and other embedded applications. This year’s edition will also highlight a feature topic in Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT).\n\n## Specific Topics\n\nSpecific topics for the conference include (but are not exclusively limited to):\n\n*   AI-operated wireless sensing, actuation, and control systems\n*   Applications and opportunities for networked embedded systems in developing countries\n*   Applications of wireless embedded networks in various domains: health, automation, manufacturing, transportation, etc.\n*   Architectures and infrastructures for edge-cloud solutions that integrate networked embedded systems\n*   Communication and networking for wireless and embedded systems\n*   Computing architectures for networked embedded systems\n*   Dependability in wireless systems, including reliability, availability, safety, and real-time guarantees\n*   Edge/embedded intelligence paradigms, models, and techniques for networked embedded systems\n*   Foundation models and generative AI for networked embedded systems\n*   TinyML and on-device AI for networked embedded systems\n*   Empirical studies, measurement, validation, deployment, and experience reports\n*   Human-centric interaction with wireless and embedded systems\n*   Localization and context-awareness for embedded wireless systems and networks\n*   Modeling, simulation, and measurement tools for wireless systems and applications\n*   Neuromorphic computing\n*   Next-generation wireless networks, including 6G\n*   New communication techniques for embedded systems (Wi-Fi HaLow, NearLink, etc.)\n*   Operating systems, middleware, and services for networked embedded systems\n*   Privacy and security in networked embedded systems and applications\n*   Processing, storage, and management of data in embedded wireless networks\n*   Sustainable applications of networked embedded systems (low-power operation, energy harvesting, etc.)\n*   Embedded systems for joint sensing and communication with mmwave, Terahertz, Wi-Fi, visible light, etc.\n\n## Submission Details\n\nAny paper submitted to EWSN 2025 must be original (i.e., not previously published) and should not have been published, accepted for publication, or be under review by any other venue (including other conferences, workshops, or journals). All submissions within the scope of EWSN are equally welcome, and all submissions will be evaluated based on the same criteria.\n\nThe conference will accept two types of papers – **Full Papers (max 12 pages)** and **Short Papers (max 6 pages)**. Short papers are intended to present preliminary research results or advocate for new research directions; their titles should be prepended with “Vision paper: / Position paper: / WiP paper” when they are submitted for review as well as in the final proceedings. Authors should carefully consider the distinction between Full Papers and Short Papers; papers submitted in one category will not be considered in the other category.\n\nEWSN 2025 will use a double-anonymous review policy during the paper review process. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper.\n\n## Submission Process\n\nSubmissions are via HotCRP: [https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/](https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/)\n\nDecisions will be: accept, reject, or one-shot revision; papers receiving a “one-shot revision” for the winter deadline will be invited to submit a revised paper by the summer deadline. Authors of papers rejected in the winter cycle may submit a revised paper in the summer cycle along with a cover letter explaining how/why the new revision addresses all the concerns raised by the reviewers.\n\n## Paper Format\n\nPages must use 8.5″ x 11″ (letter) two-column format, using 10-point type on 11-point leading, with a maximum text block of 7″ wide x 9″ deep with an inter-column spacing of .25″. Submissions with a page size of 11.7 x 8.3 ” (297 x 210 mm / A4) will not be accepted. The page limits include figures, tables, and references. Authors may use the EWSN 2025 template adapted from the ACM templates for convenience (on Overleaf here).\n\n## Publication\n\nAll accepted papers will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library, SCOPUS, and other prominent digital libraries."
