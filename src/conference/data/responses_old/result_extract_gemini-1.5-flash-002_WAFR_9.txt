  "Call for Papers": "# WAFR 2024: Call for Papers\n\nThe Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR) is a biannual multi-disciplinary single-track meeting of international researchers presenting the latest advances on algorithmic problems in robotics.  WAFR 2024 was held in **Chicago, USA from October 7-9, 2024**.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe focus of WAFR is on the design and analysis of robot algorithms from both theoretical and practical angles.  Topics of interest are very broad since the focus of WAFR is on algorithm development and analysis rather than specific problems or applications.  Topics include:\n\n*   Algorithmic approaches to human-robot interaction\n*   Computational geometry and topology\n*   Control theory and optimization\n*   Distributed and parallel methods\n*   Decision theory and game theory\n*   Geometrical and physical modeling\n*   Machine learning\n*   Planning and reasoning under uncertainty\n*   Probabilistic and sampling-based algorithms\n*   Sensing and perception\n*   Task and motion planning\n*   Theoretical computer science\n\nIn addition to these topics, we also encourage papers on applications of robot algorithms to important or new domains, including those beyond the traditional scope of robotics, such as:\n\n*   Assistive and service robotics\n*   Brain-controlled robots\n*   Computational biology\n*   Computer animation, graphics and animation, VR/AR\n*   Legged locomotion\n*   Manufacturing and automation\n*   Multi-agent systems\n*   Sensor networks and IoT devices\n*   Surgical robots, intelligent prosthetics, rehabilitation robots\n*   Transportation networks and systems\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** June 13, 2024\n*   **Acceptance notification:** August 17, 2024\n*   **Final manuscript for website:** September 18, 2024\n*   **WAFR 2024:** October 7-9, 2024\n*   **Camera-ready manuscript for SPAR book:** December 9, 2024\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nPapers must be submitted in Portable Document Format (PDF) at our [Submission Site in OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=algorithmic-robotics.org/WAFR/2024/Conference) according to the deadlines listed above. Manuscripts should be prepared using the [Springer Proceedings in Advanced Robotics (SPAR)](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors) format.  Submissions should not exceed 16 pages + references (references do not count towards this page limit).\n\nAs usual for WAFR, submissions are single-blind (authors are listed on the manuscript) and there will be no rebuttal phase.\n\n## Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools\n\n### For Authors\n\nGenerative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of a paper submitted to WAFR. The use of content generated by AI in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The AI system used must be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content should be specified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the manner in which the AI system was used to generate the content.\n\n### For Reviewers\n\nInformation or content contained in or about a manuscript under review shall not be processed through an AI system. Doing so is considered a breach of confidentiality and as such is not permitted.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\nIn the submissions before the conference, you can submit supplementary material together with the main manuscript in a separate PDF or ZIP file (50MB max file size). Please note that the program committee members are not required to check the supplementary material when preparing their reviews and we encourage you to make sure your paper is self-contained. No supplementary material will be included in the book.\n\n## Keywords\n\nWhen submitting your manuscript, please use at least one of the following suggested keywords:\n\n*   Algorithmic Completeness and Complexity\n*   Algorithms for Novel Robot Mechanisms and Sensors\n*   Automation, Manufacturing & Logistics\n*   Collision Avoidance\n*   Computational Biology\n*   Computational Geometry\n*   Computer Animation & Simulation\n*   Control Theory and Optimization\n*   Dynamics\n*   Field Robotics\n*   Human-Robot Interaction\n*   Humanoids and Legged Systems\n*   Kinematics\n*   Localization and Mapping\n*   Formal Methods\n*   Machine Learning in Robotics\n*   Manipulation & Grasping\n*   Medical & Surgical Robots\n*   Micro/Nano Robots\n*   Mobile Robots\n*   Motion and Path Planning\n*   Multi-Agent Systems and Distributed Robotics\n*   Perception\n*   Service Robots\n*   Task Planning\n*   Vision and Sensor-based Control\n\n## Contact\n\n[wafr2024@gmail.com](mailto:wafr2024@gmail.com)"
