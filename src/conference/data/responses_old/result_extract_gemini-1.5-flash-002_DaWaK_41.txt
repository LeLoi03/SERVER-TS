  "Call for Papers": "# DAWAK 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 27th International Conference on Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Discovery (DAWAK 2025) will be held in **Bangkok, Thailand from August 25-27, 2025**.\n\n## Scope\n\nDaWaK conference is a high-quality forum for researchers, practitioners, and developers in the field of Big Data Analytics, in a broad sense. The objective is to explore, disseminate and exchange knowledge in this field through scientific and industry talks.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe conference will bring together active researchers from the database systems, cloud computing, programming languages, and data science communities worldwide. Main topics include:\n\n*   Theoretical models for extended data warehouses and big data\n*   Conceptual model foundations for big data\n*   Modelling diverse big data sources\n*   Parallel processing\n*   Parallel DBMS technology\n*   Distributed system architectures\n*   Scalability and parallelization using Map-Reduce, Spark, and related systems\n*   Query languages\n*   Query processing and optimization\n*   Semantics for big data intelligence\n*   Data warehouse and data lake architectures\n*   Pre-processing and data cleaning\n*   Integration of data warehousing, OLAP cubes, and data mining\n*   Polystore and multistore architectures\n*   NoSQL storage systems\n*   Cloud infrastructures for big data\n*   Metadata for big data frameworks\n*   Big data storage and indexing\n*   Big data analytics: algorithms, techniques, and systems\n*   Big data quality and provenance\n*   Big data search and discovery\n*   Big data management for mobile applications\n*   AI/ML for Big data analytics (text, time series, spatio-temporal, graph)\n*   Analytic workflows\n*   Graph analytics\n*   Analytics for unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data\n*   Analytics for temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal, and mobile data\n*   Analytics for data streams and sensor data\n*   Real-time/right-time and event-based analytics\n*   Privacy and security in analytics\n*   Data visualisation\n*   Big data application deployment\n*   Data science products\n*   Novel applications of text mining for big data\n*   Machine Learning: auto AI, deep learning applications\n*   AI/ML for data engineering, management, and analytics\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nDAWAK 2025 follows a single-blind review policy. Authors are invited to submit original research contributions or experience reports in English. DaWak will accept submissions of both short and full papers.\n\n*   **Short papers:** Up to 6 pages on preliminary work, vision papers, or industrial applications\n*   **Full papers:** Up to 15 pages (including references and appendixes). Full papers are expected to be more mature, contain more theory, or present a survey (tutorial style) of some hot or not yet explored topics.\n\nPapers exceeding the page limit or deviating from the formatting requirement are desk rejected. Submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. Duplicate submissions are not allowed and will be rejected immediately without further reviewing.\n\n## Submission Procedure\n\nPapers submission will be managed using HotCRP: [https://dawak2025.iiwas.org/](https://dawak2025.iiwas.org/). Authors should consult [Springer’s authors’ instructions](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and use the proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Please refer to the [Paper Submission](papers-submission.html) procedure page.\n\n## Publication\n\nAll accepted conference papers will be published by Springer in their Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). The best DAWAK papers will be invited to contribute to the Special Issue of Data & Knowledge Engineering (DKE).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission:** April 10, 2025 (Sharp & Final)\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** May 14, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready copies due:** June 14, 2025\n*   **Authors Registration deadline:** June 14, 2025\n*   **Conference days:** August 25-27, 2025\n\n## Program Committee Chairs\n\n*   Carson K. Leung, University of Manitoba, Canada\n*   Anton Dignös, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, Italy\n\n## Publicity Chair\n\n*   Kanda Saikaew, Khon Kaen University, Thailand"
