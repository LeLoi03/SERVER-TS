  "Summary": "The BTW conference is the most important database conference in the German-speaking area. Every two years since 1985, it has served as a central forum for the exchange of information between scientists, practitioners, and users on topics of database and information system technology. BTW 2025 will be held in Bamberg, Germany, from March 3-7, 2025.",
  "Call for Papers": "# BTW 2025: Call for Research Papers\n\nThe 21st Conference on Database Systems for Business, Technology, and Web (BTW 2025) will be held in **Bamberg, Germany, from March 3–7, 2025**.\n\nThe BTW conference is the most important database conference in the German-speaking area. It serves as a central forum for the exchange of information between scientists, practitioners, and users on topics of database and information system technology.\n\n## Tracks and Topics\n\nAt the BTW conference, both classic and emerging questions from the database area and their possible solutions will be discussed. Contributions will be organized in five tracks. Authors will be able to assign their paper to more than one track.\n\n*   **Database Technologies and Systems:** Query processing and optimization, storage and physical database design, indexing, access methods, data management on modern hardware, transaction processing and concurrency control, data warehousing and analytics, implementation and architecture of database systems, parallel, distributed, and cloud-based data processing, NoSQL systems\n*   **Text, Semi-structured Data, and IR:** User aspects of retrieval applications, system and foundational aspects, retrieval models, query processing and ranking, efficiency and scalability, machine learning, deep learning and neural models, text mining and text analysis, natural language processing, applications such as web and social media search, professional and domain-specific search, evaluation research of retrieval systems, users, and/or applications\n*   **Data Engineering, Data Science & Machine Learning:** Green-IT, sustainability, data ethics, and FAIR data management, data analytics, mining, intelligent systems and machine learning, data transformation, integration, linkage and interoperability, data preparation, cleaning, profiling, and visualization, data provenance, versioning, and reasoning, data streaming and dataflow engines, batch- and ETL-processing systems, schema engineering, evolution, and optimization, metadata management and recording, data processing on modern hardware, distributed systems, and cloud, semantic data and knowledge bases, benchmarks for data engineering algorithms and workflows\n*   **Database Languages & Theory:** All topics of the other tracks are in principle suitable for Databases Languages and Theory, but this track is primarily interested in work focusing on foundational aspects concerning the principles and theory of data management.\n*   **Innovations and Use Cases:** Implementation and architectural advancements of database systems, particularly for distributed and big data solutions, integration and performance optimization of database technologies in the cloud and in “as-a-service” models, application of Data Engineering, AI, machine learning methods, and language models within database systems, exploration of data protection, security measures, and ethical considerations within industrial data systems\n\n## Procedures\n\n*   The review process will include a feedback phase, which allows authors to submit a revision letter.\n*   The scientific program and the industrial program will be merged at the conference.\n*   The organization team encourages the authors of papers to ensure the repeatability and reproducibility of their experiments and analyses.\n*   Both long papers and short papers can be submitted. Practical contributions are also qualified for both long and short papers.\n*   Submissions should be written in English. English is also recommended as the lecture language during the conference.\n*   The page limit (not including references) is 20 pages for long papers and 10 pages for short papers.\n\n## Submissions\n\nSubmissions are handled via [https://www.conftool.com/btw2025/](https://www.conftool.com/btw2025/) from July 2024 onwards. All research track papers are subject to single-anonymity requirements.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission deadline for abstracts:** September 13, 2024\n*   **Papers are due:** October 2, 2024 (11:59 pm, GMT+1)"
