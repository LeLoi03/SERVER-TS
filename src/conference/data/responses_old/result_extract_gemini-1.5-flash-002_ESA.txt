  "Call for Papers": "# ESA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA 2025) is one of the premier conferences on algorithms. It is organized in collaboration with the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS) and is a part of ALGO 2025, to be held in **Warsaw, Poland from September 15-17, 2025**.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nThe symposium seeks original algorithmic contributions for problems with relevant theoretical and/or practical applications. Papers with a strong emphasis on the theoretical analysis of algorithms should be submitted to **Track A**, while papers reporting the results of extensive experimental evaluations and/or providing original contributions to the engineering of algorithms for practical applications should be submitted to **Track B**. Submissions that prove or explain results, possibly already known, in a particularly clear, simple, or elegant way should be submitted to **Track S**.\n\nThere will be a **Best Student Paper Award** as well as a **Best Paper Award**, both sponsored by EATCS. In order for a paper to be considered for the Best Student Paper Award, all of its authors are required to be students at the time of submission.\n\n## Paper Submission and Proceedings\n\nPapers should be submitted electronically via the EasyChair submission system: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esa2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esa2025). The ESA 2025 proceedings will be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAuthors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper. Submissions must be formatted in accordance with the LIPIcs proceedings guidelines and may not exceed 500 lines of text. Authors must use the LaTeX class file `socg-lipics-v2021.cls`; for a quick start, duplicate this Overleaf project.\n\nProofs omitted due to the line constraint must be placed in an appendix. This appendix will be read by the program committee members at their discretion. In particular, appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paperâ€™s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.\n\nThese guidelines are strict: submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk being rejected without consideration of their merits.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** April 21, 2025, 23:59 AoE ([EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esa2025))\n*   **Notification:** June 23, 2025\n*   **Camera ready:** July 7, 2025\n*   **Conference:** September 15-17, 2025, in Warsaw, Poland\n\n## Double-Blind Reviewing\n\nThe conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process.\n\n## Topics\n\nPapers presenting original research in all areas of algorithmic research are sought, including but not limited to:\n\n*   Algorithm engineering\n*   Algorithmic aspects of networks\n*   Algorithmic game theory\n*   Algorithmic Data Science\n*   Approximation algorithms\n*   Computational biology\n*   Computational finance\n*   Computational geometry\n*   Combinatorial optimization\n*   Data compression\n*   Data structures\n*   Databases and information retrieval\n*   Distributed and parallel computing\n*   Graph algorithms\n*   Hierarchical memories\n*   Heuristics and meta-heuristics\n*   Mathematical programming\n*   Mobile computing\n*   Online algorithms\n*   Parameterized algorithms\n*   Pattern matching\n*   Quantum computing\n*   Randomized algorithms\n*   Scheduling and resource allocation problems\n*   Streaming algorithms"
