  "Call for Papers": "# ITiCSE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 30th annual ACM conference on Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education (ITiCSE 2025) will take place at **Radboud University in Nijmegen, Netherlands, from June 30 to July 2, 2025**.\n\n## Paper Tracks\n\nPapers presented at ITiCSE address aspects of computing education, that is, the education of students who are studying computing.  Note that an abstract submission is mandatory for all papers and is due a week before the deadline for full papers. When making a submission, you will be asked to place it in one of three tracks:\n\n*   **Computing education research:** Papers that define research questions, describe the data gathering and the methods used to address the questions, present the results, and discuss the contribution to knowledge about the teaching and learning of computing;\n*   **Experience reports and tools:** Papers that describe computing education experiences, including tools that have been developed for use in computing education, in sufficient detail for others to see whether their use was beneficial and to be able to adopt them if required; these papers will generally be motivated by the literature, will highlight the novelty of the work, and will be accompanied by a rich description of what worked and what didn’t;\n*   **Position papers and proposals:** Papers articulating original and well-argued positions on aspects of computing education, or proposals for work that is in its early stages; while these papers should be well situated in the literature, they need not report on work that has been completed; however, they must offer something of value to the community – the intention to carry out some work is not necessarily a worthwhile contribution in its own right.\n\n## Submitting the Abstract\n\nYour abstract can be up to 250 words and must be submitted by the paper abstract deadline (see the sidebar for these dates). The abstract will be plain text — not, for example, a PDF.\n\n## Anonymous Version for Review\n\nThe paper submitted for review must be a fully anonymous version so as to allow the authors an unbiased review. The anonymous version should have ALL identifying references to the authors removed:\n\n*   Authors’ names\n*   Authors’ affiliations\n*   Any information in the body or the headers of the paper that might identify the authors or their institutions\n*   Acknowledgements\n\n## Ethical Status of Data Collection\n\nAny submission that makes use of data from human participants must clearly indicate whether approval has been granted for the use of that data, by what authority, and what the approval covers. If the work includes any data from human participants that has not been granted approval, that should be clearly explained.\n\n## Formatting the Paper\n\n*   The paper is limited to a maximum of six pages plus one page for references.\n*   If the paper includes figures and tables, the text in them must be readable at 100% magnification and in greyscale. Figures and tables must be readable if the paper is printed.\n*   Please ensure that the file to be submitted is no more than 10MB in size.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Conference:** June 30 - July 2, 2025\n*   **Working Groups:** June 27 - 29, 2025\n*   **Doctoral Consortium:** June 28 - 29, 2025\n*   **Papers:**\n    *   Mandatory abstract submission: January 12, 2025\n    *   Full paper submission: January 19, 2025\n    *   Author notification: March 3, 2025\n*   **Panels:**\n    *   Submission: March 9, 2025\n    *   Notification: April 8, 2025\n*   **Posters:**\n    *   Submission: March 9, 2025\n    *   Notification: April 8, 2025\n*   **Tips, Techniques, & Courseware:**\n    *   Submission: March 9, 2025\n    *   Notification: April 8, 2025\n*   **Doctoral Consortium:**\n    *   Submission: March 9, 2025\n    *   Notification: April 8, 2025\n*   **Working Groups:**\n    *   Submission: January 19, 2025\n    *   Notification of working groups to proceed: February 3, 2025\n*   **Membership applications open:** February 10, 2025\n*   **Membership applications close #1:** March 2, 2025\n*   **Membership applications close #2:** March 16, 2025\n*   **Draft report submission to WG chairs:** June 29, 2025, 8 pm CET\n*   **Initial feedback from WG chairs:** July 14, 2025\n*   **WG submit draft for external review:** September 14, 2025\n*   **Preliminary accept / reject notification:** October 26, 2025\n*   **Camera ready deadline:** November 16, 2025\n*   **Final accept / reject notification:** November 24, 2025\n\nAll submission deadlines are 23:59 AoE – Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12)\n\n## Contact Addresses\n\n*   Conference Chairs: [conferencechairs@iticse.acm.org](mailto:conferencechairs@iticse.acm.org)\n*   Organisation / Registrar: [registrars@iticse.acm.org](mailto:registrars@iticse.acm.org)\n*   Program Chairs (Papers): [iticse2025papers@easychair.org](mailto:iticse2025papers@easychair.org)\n*   Working Group Chairs: [iticse2025wg@easychair.org](mailto:iticse2025wg@easychair.org)\n*   Panels Chairs: [iticse2025panels@easychair.org](mailto:iticse2025panels@easychair.org)\n*   TTC Chairs: [iticse2025ttc@easychair.org](mailto:iticse2025ttc@easychair.org)\n*   Posters Chairs: [iticse2025posters@easychair.org](mailto:iticse2025posters@easychair.org)\n*   Doctoral Consortium Chairs: [iticse2025dc@easychair.org](mailto:iticse2025dc@easychair.org)"
