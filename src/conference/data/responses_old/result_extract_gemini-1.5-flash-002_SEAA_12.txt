  "Call for Papers": "# SEAA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 51st Euromicro Conference Series on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA 2025) will be held at the **Grand Hotel Salerno, Salerno, Italy, from September 10th to 12th, 2025**.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe Euromicro Conference Series on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA) is a long-standing international forum for researchers, practitioners, and students to present and discuss the latest innovations, trends, experiences, and concerns in the field of Software Engineering and Advanced Applications in information technology for software-intensive systems.\n\n## Program Tracks\n\n*   CPS: Cyber-Physical Systems\n*   DAIDE: Data and AI Driven Engineering\n*   ECT: Emerging Computing Technologies\n*   MDEML: Model-Driven Engineering and Modeling Languages\n*   SM: Software Management: Measurement, Peopleware, and Innovation\n*   SMSE: Systematic Literature Reviews and Mapping Studies in Software Engineering\n*   SPPI: Software Process and Product Improvement\n*   STREAM: Software Analytics: Mining Software Open Datasets and Repositories\n*   KKIO: Practical Aspects of Software Engineering\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSEAA 2025 encourages the submission of full research papers, short papers, tool demo papers (maximum 4 pages), and posters (maximum 2 pages). A maximum of 8 pages is allowed for each full research paper. Papers follow a single-blinded reviewing process and must contain original unpublished work, describe significant novel contributions, and provide evidence about the validation of the results. Reports on industrial applications are also welcome.\n\nPapers submitted to SEAA 2025 must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for SEAA 2025. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases.\n\nConference Publishing Services (CPS) will publish accepted papers in the conference proceedings, and the proceedings will be submitted to the IEEE Xplore digital library and indexing services. We reserve the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., by not placing it in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library) if it is not presented at the conference.\n\nBest papers of SEAA 2025 will be invited to submit extended versions for a theme issue at Elsevier Journal of Systems and Software. Selected papers will be expected to comply with the standard guidelines of the journal when publishing an extended version of a paper, including adding about 30% new material.\n\nPapers must strictly adhere to the two-column IEEE conference proceedings format. Please use the available templates. LaTeX users should use the following configuration: `\\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}`. Microsoft Word users should use the US Letter format template. All submissions of all the tracks and special sessions at SEAA 2025 must be in PDF and submitted online by the deadline via the EasyChair conference management system: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=seaa2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=seaa2025)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submissions will be open from:** February 16, 2025\n*   **Deadline for paper submission:** April 15th, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** May 15th, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready papers:** June 1st, 2025\n\n## Registration\n\n*   **Registration will be open from:** May 22, 2025\n*   **Registration will close on:** September 12, 2025 (including possible on-site registration)\n*   **Early bird registration fee:** 750 EUR\n*   **Late registration fee:** 800 EUR\n\n## Organizers\n\n*   **General Chairs:** Gemma Catolino (University of Salerno, Italy), Carmine Gravino (University of Salerno, Italy)\n*   **Program Chairs:** Davide Taibi (University of Oulu, Finland), Darja Šmite (Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden)\n*   **Proceedings Chair:** Julian Frattini (Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden), Ashley van Can (Utrecht University, Netherlands)\n*   **Finance Chair:** Francesco Leporati (University of Pavia, Italy)\n*   **Publicity Chair:** Matteo Esposito (University of Oulu, Finland)\n*   **Steering Committee:** Stefan Biffl (Technische Universität Wien, Austria), Michel Chaudron (Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands), Onur Demirors (IzTech, Turkey), Carmine Gravino (University of Salerno, Italy), Helena Holmström Olsson (Malmö University, Sweden), Andreas Wortmann (Stuttgart University, Germany)\n\n## Contact\n\nFor further information, please contact Davide or Darja via [seaa2025@easychair.org](mailto:seaa2025@easychair.org)."
