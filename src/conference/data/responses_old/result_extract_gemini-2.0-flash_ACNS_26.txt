  "Call for Papers": "# ACNS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 23rd International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security (ACNS 2025) will be held in **Munich, Germany, on 23–26 June 2025**.\n\nACNS is an annual conference focusing on current developments that advance the areas of applied cryptography, cyber security (including network and computer security), and privacy.\n\n## Areas of Interest\n\nAreas of interest for ACNS 2025 (in alphabetical order) include but are not limited to:\n\n*   Applied cryptography\n*   Artificial intelligence for security\n*   Automated security analysis\n*   Authentication and biometric security and privacy\n*   Blockchain security and privacy\n*   Cloud security and privacy\n*   Critical infrastructure security and privacy\n*   Cryptanalysis\n*   Cryptographic primitives and protocols\n*   Data protection\n*   Distributed security and consensus protocols\n*   Email, app and web security and privacy\n*   Future Internet security and privacy\n*   Lightweight cryptography\n*   Identity management\n*   Internet fraud and cybercrime\n*   Internet-of-Things security and privacy\n*   Malicious code and unsolicited software\n*   Mobile and wireless security\n*   Network security protocols\n*   Post-quantum cryptography\n*   Privacy and anonymity, privacy-enhancing technologies\n*   Secure electronic voting\n*   Security and privacy metrics\n*   Security and privacy of systems based on ML and AI\n*   Side-channel analysis and physical attacks\n*   Systems security and privacy\n*   Trust management and trustworthy computing in networks or systems\n*   Usable security and privacy\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are on the given day, 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth).\n\n**First submission deadline:**\n\n*   Submission: September 9, 2024\n*   Notification: November 11, 2024\n*   Camera-ready: December 2, 2024\n\n**Second submission deadline:**\n\n*   Submission: January 13, 2025\n*   Notification: March 17, 2025\n*   Camera-ready: April 7, 2025 (firm deadline)\n\n## Instructions for Authors\n\nSubmissions must be done via the HotCRP website. The link will be announced shortly before the paper deadline.\n\n*   ACNS 2025 will be an in-person conference. Authors submitting a paper must ensure that one of the authors can present the paper at the conference in person.\n*   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published (other than preprint) or accepted for publication or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings.\n*   ACNS encourages promising students to submit and present their results at the conference.\n\n### Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references.\n*   Each submission must begin with a title, short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader.\n*   All submissions must be submitted in PDF format, following the unmodified LNCS format and typeset using the corresponding LaTeX class file.\n*   They must fit within a page limit of 20 pages, including title and abstract, figures, etc., but excluding references.\n*   Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following the main body of the paper; however, reviewers are not required to read or review any supplementary material, and submissions are expected to be intelligible without it.\n\n## Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)\n\nACNS 2025 solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. We encourage the authors to distinguish SoK submissions by adding the “SoK:” prefix to the title.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and program committee members to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest.\n\n## Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure\n\nWhere research identifies a vulnerability, we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days to 90 days ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.\n\n## Diversity and Inclusion\n\nACNS is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our community. If you have suggestions, concerns, or complaints related to biases or sexual harassment, we encourage you to reach out to the Conference Co-Chairs.\n\nWe encourage authors to be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing.\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n*   Marc Fischlin, TU Darmstadt\n*   Veelasha Moonsamy, Ruhr-University Bochum\n\n## Workshop Chair\n\n*   Mark Manulis, University of the Bundeswehr Munich"
