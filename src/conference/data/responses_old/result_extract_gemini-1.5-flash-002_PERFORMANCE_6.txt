  "Call for Papers": "# IFIP PERFORMANCE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe IFIP Performance 2025 conference will be held at **CWI in Amsterdam from November 11-14, 2025.**  The conference aims to bring together researchers interested in understanding and improving the performance of computing and communication systems using state-of-the-art quantitative models and solution techniques.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe invite submissions of research papers focusing on algorithm design, mathematical analysis and modeling, simulation, and measurement techniques for computer systems and communication networks. We particularly welcome contributions that introduce novel performance evaluation methods or creatively apply existing techniques to predict or gain insights into key design trade-offs across a wide range of computing, networked, and cyber-physical systems.  These include mobile devices, Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, and large-scale cloud computing environments. Submissions of reproducible experiments are also encouraged.\n\n## Submission Categories\n\nWe accept submissions in two categories:\n\n*   **Regular papers:** 20 pages\n*   **Short papers:** 10 pages\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   Submission site opens: May 1, 2025\n*   Abstract submission: May 25, 2025\n*   Full paper submission: June 1, 2025\n*   Notification to authors: July 30, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions should be made on the online platform: [https://performance2025.hotcrp.com/](https://performance2025.hotcrp.com/)\n\nPapers must be submitted through hotCRP platform in printable PDF form. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review.\n\nAll submissions will be reviewed using a double-blind review process.  The identity of authors and referees will not be revealed to each other.\n\n## Tracks\n\nIFIP Performance uses “soft” tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions.  Regardless of the selected track, all submissions will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines.  Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element.\n\n*   Learning\n*   Measurement & Applied Modelling\n*   Systems\n*   Theory\n\n## Special Issues\n\nBy default, accepted regular papers will be published in a special Performance Evaluation (PEVA) issue. Additionally, an extended abstract will be published in a special ACM Performance Evaluation Review (PER) issue.  However, authors may opt-out of publication in PEVA in favor of an expedited review process in journals related to Performance Evaluation and Operations Research.\n\nThe following journals will provide an expedited review process of accepted papers:\n\n*   [ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems (ToMPECS)](https://tompecs.acm.org/)\n*   Queueing Systems: Theory and Application (QUESTA)\n*   Stochastic Models\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\nPapers describing experiments with users or user data should follow the basic principles of ethical research. Authors may want to consult the [Menlo Report](https://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2012/menlo_report_actual_formatted/) for further information on ethical principles or the [Allman/Paxson IMC ’07 paper](http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2007/papers/imc76.pdf) for guidance on ethical data sharing.\n\n## Diversity & Inclusiveness\n\nAs part of our efforts to foster diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or conference presentation."
