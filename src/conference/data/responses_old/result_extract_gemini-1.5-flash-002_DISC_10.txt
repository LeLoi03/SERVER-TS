  "Call for Papers": "# DISC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 39th International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC 2025) will be held in **Berlin, Germany, from October 27th – October 31st, 2025**, at the **Harnack House**.\n\n## Conference Overview\n\nThe International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC) is an international forum on the theory, design, analysis, implementation, and application of distributed systems and networks. It is organized in cooperation with the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS).\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are at 23:59 AoE.\n\n*   **Paper registration:** May 20, 2025\n*   **Submission deadline:** May 23, 2025\n*   **Rebuttal phase:** July 7–14, 2025\n*   **Notification:** August 7, 2025\n*   **Workshop/Tutorial proposal deadline:** May 31, 2025\n*   **Main Conference:** October 28–30, 2025\n*   **Workshops + Conference:** October 27–31, 2025\n\n## Scope\n\nSubmissions are sought in all areas of distributed algorithms and distributed systems, including theory, design, implementation, modeling, analysis, and application of distributed systems and networks. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Biological and nature-inspired distributed algorithms\n*   Blockchain protocols\n*   Coding and reliable communication\n*   Communication networks: algorithms, protocols, and applications\n*   Complexity, lower bounds, and impossibility results\n*   Design and analysis of distributed algorithms\n*   Distributed and concurrent data structures\n*   Distributed algorithms for clouds and IoT\n*   Distributed graph algorithms\n*   Distributed machine learning and data science\n*   Distributed operating systems, middleware, database systems\n*   Distributed resource management\n*   Fault tolerance, reliability, self-organization, self-stabilization\n*   Formal methods for distributed computing: verification, synthesis, and testing\n*   Game-theoretic and knowledge-based approaches to distributed computing\n*   Internet and web applications, social networks, and recommendation systems\n*   Massively-parallel, high-performance, cloud, and grid computing\n*   Mobile agents, autonomous distributed systems, swarm robotics\n*   Multiprocessor and multi-core architectures and algorithms\n*   Overlay networks and peer-to-peer networks\n*   Population protocols and chemical reaction networks\n*   Quantum distributed algorithms\n*   Replication, consensus, and consistency\n*   Security in distributed computing, cryptographic protocols\n*   Synchronization, persistence, and transactional memory\n*   Wireless, mobile, sensor, and ad-hoc networks\n\n## Submissions\n\nThere are two types of submissions: regular papers and brief announcements.\n\n*   **Regular papers:** must report on original research that has not previously been published (and may not be concurrently submitted to other journals or conferences with proceedings).\n*   **Brief announcements:** may describe work in progress or work presented elsewhere.\n\nA paper that is not accepted as a regular paper may be invited as a brief announcement.\n\n## Submission Format\n\nSubmissions must be in English in PDF format and they must be prepared using the LaTeX style template for LIPIcs ([https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author)) with `\\documentclass[a4paper,anonymous,USenglish]{lipics-v2021}`.\n\nSubmissions must be anonymous, without any author names, affiliations, or email addresses. The contact information of the authors will be entered separately in the submission metadata.\n\nFor regular papers, there is no page limit, and authors are encouraged to use the “full version” of their paper as the submission. The initial 15 pages, excluding the title page and a table of contents, should contain a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. (Illustrative figures are encouraged.) The submission must contain all necessary details, including full proofs of all claims in the paper.\n\nAlthough there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the first 15 pages, excluding the title page and a table of contents, will be read at the committee’s discretion. Papers submitted as brief announcements should comply with the above rules, replacing 15 pages with 5 pages.\n\nSubmissions not conforming to the submission guidelines and papers outside of the scope of the conference will be rejected without consideration.\n\n## Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)\n\nThe use of LLMs for submission preparation is permitted, although it is highly recommended that they only be used for cosmetic changes, e.g., proofreading of the text. The use of LLMs in technical parts should be treated in the same way as any other software or system, and thus carefully described and documented in the submission.\n\n## Anonymous Submissions\n\nWe will use a relaxed implementation of double-blind peer review. Submissions must not reveal the identity of the authors in any way.\n\n## Conflict of Interest\n\nThe submission form provides an opportunity to specify conflicts of interest with any of the PC members and other members of the research community.\n\n## Participation at DISC\n\nIt is expected that accepted papers and brief announcements be presented in-person at the conference.\n\n## Publication\n\nThe proceedings will be published by LIPIcs. Regular papers will have 15 pages in the final proceedings (excluding references), and brief announcements will have 5 pages in the proceedings (including everything). If more space is needed, the authors are encouraged to post the full version e.g., on arXiv and refer to it in their paper.\n\n## Awards\n\nAwards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper."
