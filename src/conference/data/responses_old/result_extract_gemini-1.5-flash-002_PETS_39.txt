  "Call for Papers": "# PETS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 25th Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2025) will be a **hybrid event** held in **Washington, DC, USA and online from July 14–19, 2025**.\n\n## Submission Information\n\nPapers undergo a journal-style reviewing process, and accepted papers are published in the journal *Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies* (PoPETs). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to attend and present at the physical event, where their presentations can be recorded for the virtual event and where they can participate directly in in-person research, technical, and social activities. However, in-person attendance is not required for publication in the proceedings.\n\nPoPETs is a scholarly, open-access journal for research papers on privacy; it provides high-quality reviewing and publication while also supporting the successful PETS community event. PoPETs is self-published and does not have article processing charges or article submission charges.\n\nAuthors can submit papers to PoPETs four times a year, every three months, and are notified of decisions about two months after submission.  Authors will receive a decision of accept, revise, or reject; those receiving revise will be invited to revise their article with the guidance of a revision editor.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nThe submission guidelines contain important submission information for authors. Please note especially the instructions for anonymizing submissions, for ensuring ethical research, and for using AI in writing or editing the manuscript.
