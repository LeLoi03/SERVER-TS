  "Call for Papers": "# SSDBM 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe International Conference on Scalable Scientific Data Management 2025 (SSDBM 2025) will be held from **June 23-25, 2025 in Columbus, Ohio**.\n\nSSDBM 2025 will broaden its scope to encompass all areas of scalable and scientific data management. The conference will serve as a forum for original research contributions, as well as practical system design, implementation, and evaluation of the latest advances in scalable and scientific data management.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of particular interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n**Scientific Applications, Workflows and Reproducibility:**\n\n*   Design, implementation, optimization, and reproducibility of scientific workflows\n*   Platforms and tools for reproducible data science and scientific collaboration\n*   Application case studies (e.g., astrophysics, climate, energy, sustainability, biomedicine)\n*   Open data standards and cross-platform compatibility for scientific data\n*   Cloud computing issues in large-scale data management\n*   System architectures for scientific data\n*   HPC applications and scalability challenges in data-intensive scientific fields\n*   Data ethics, bias in scientific data handling, and privacy in large-scale studies\n*   Handling data errors, inconsistencies, and outliers in scientific datasets\n\n**Data Modeling, Management, and Integration:**\n\n*   FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)\n*   Data lifecycle and retention management, provenance data management\n*   Data integration\n*   Data storage and management architectures (e.g., distributed file systems, data lakes, high-performance storage)\n*   Protocols and frameworks for cross-domain data sharing and exchange\n*   Modeling of scientific data\n*   Schema evolution\n*   Information retrieval and text mining\n*   Indexing and querying scientific data, including spatial, temporal, and streaming data\n\n**Big Data Processing and Performance Aspects:**\n\n*   Big data processing frameworks for scientific data\n*   Scalable architectures and distributed systems for managing large-scale datasets\n*   Optimization techniques for high-efficiency data storage and retrieval\n*   Innovations in data compression and encoding for enhanced performance\n*   Efficient computational techniques for statistical data analysis and modeling\n*   Methods for ensuring data quality, integrity, and consistency in big data environments\n*   Smart city applications and services leveraging high-performance data solutions\n\n**Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Visualization:**\n\n*   Database support of machine learning and AI\n*   Data management for AI applications\n*   Machine learning and AI for scientific data management\n*   Visualization and exploration of large datasets\n*   Security and privacy in scientific data management\n*   Data storage and compression techniques for machine learning\n\n**Streaming and Real-Time Data Processing:**\n\n*   Stream data representation and management\n*   Stream data analysis (e.g., summarization, statistical analysis, pattern matching, pattern discovery, learning, and prediction)\n*   Dataflow and parallel processing for complex data workflows\n*   Distributed systems and devices\n*   Internet of Things (IoT) data analytics\n*   Location-aware recommender systems\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAuthors are invited to submit original, unpublished manuscripts.  Regular Research Papers are up to 12 pages (including references and appendices). Papers should be descriptions of complete technical work. All submissions should be formatted using the ACM format ([https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)) by selecting the generic “sigconf” sample. For submissions prepared in LaTeX, authors are recommended to use `\\documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}` configuration.  SSDBM 2025 is single-blind reviewed; authors must include their names and affiliations on the first page. All authors should respect ACM Policy on Authorship and use of generative AI tools and technologies ([https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship)).\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ssdbm2025)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract submission:** February 23, 2025, 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Submission deadline:** March 2, 2025 at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Notification:** April 4th, 2025\n\n**Note:**  The program committee may decide to accept some papers as short papers or posters.  Regular papers (up to 12 pages including references) and Short papers (up to 6 pages including references) will be included as part of the conference proceedings. Posters with a single-page abstract and electronic poster presentation will be published on the conference website, without proceedings. If your paper is selected, at least one author must register for the Technical Program in order to attend the conference and present the paper. Each author registration can be applied to only one accepted submission. For an accepted paper to be included in the proceedings, the author has to present the paper at the conference in person. Otherwise, the paper will be removed from the proceedings."
