  "Summary": "SenSys'25, the 23rd ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems, will be held in Irvine, USA, from May 6-9, 2025.  This year's SenSys will retain the current name and will be collocated with CPS-IoT Week 2025.  The conference is in transition to becoming SenSys: Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems, merging with IPSN and IoTDI.",
  "Call for Papers": "# SenSys 2025: Call for Papers\n\nACM SenSys 2025 will mark the inaugural combined event, merging SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI, forming the single premier conference in the area of Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems. Due to the time required for institutional approvals, this year’s SenSys will retain the current name (Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems) and will be collocated with CPS-IoT Week 2025. All accepted papers this year will be published in the ACM SenSys proceedings.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nSenSys 2025 invites groundbreaking research contributions on networked sensor systems, embedded systems, mobile computing, the Internet of Things (IoT), wireless communications, signal processing, machine learning, cyber-physical systems, and AI-driven applications.

Submissions must be at most 12 (full papers) or 6 (short papers) single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages with 10-pt font size (override default font of 9-pt) in two-column format, including figures and tables.  As for references, submissions may include as many pages as needed.\n\nAll submissions must use the LaTeX (preferred) or Word styles found here. LaTeX submissions should use the acmart.cls template (sigconf option), with the 10-pt font (override default font of 9-pt). Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions.  Although submission is double-blind, the existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the conference submission system.\n\nPapers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze nonpublic data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), should briefly describe how the research protocol addresses ethical considerations and whether their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Registration:** November 7, 2024, 23:59 AoE / November 14, 2024, 23:59 AoE\n*   **Paper Submission Deadline:** November 14, 2024, 23:59 AoE\n*   **Acceptance Notification:** January 21, 2025\n*   **Conference:** May 6-9, 2025\n\n## Submission System\n\n[SenSys 2025 Conference Submission System](https://sensys25.hotcrp.com/)"
