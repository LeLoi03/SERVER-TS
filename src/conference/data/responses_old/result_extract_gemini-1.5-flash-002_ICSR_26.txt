The submission deadline is firm, no extensions.\n\n## Keynote Talk\n\n**Keynote by Tommi Mikkonen (University of Jyväskylä, Finland)**\n\n**Title:** AI-assisted Development — Next-Generation Software Reuse?\n\n**Summary:** Software development is undergoing a profound transformation, driven by the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and the increasing reliance on generative software reuse. These emerging technologies are reshaping every stage of the software development lifecycle, from specification and design to testing and deployment. Traditionally, software reuse involved developers leveraging existing libraries, frameworks, and components, carefully integrating them into new systems while maintaining a deep understanding of their functionality. However, this paradigm is shifting as AI-driven approaches gain traction. While this transformation offers significant advantages—such as faster development cycles, reduced effort, and automated optimization—it also introduces new challenges. One of the most pressing concerns is that software engineers may increasingly rely on AI-generated code without fully comprehending its underlying logic, structure, or potential vulnerabilities. In this keynote, we explore the impact of AI-driven software reuse and highlight some key questions that need to be addressed.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor questions, use the [ICSR contact form](https://conf.researchr.org/contact2/icsr-2025/icsr-2025-papers)."
