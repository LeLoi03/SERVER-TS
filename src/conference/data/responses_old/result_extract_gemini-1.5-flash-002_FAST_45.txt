  "Call for Papers": "# FAST '26: Call for Papers\n\nThe 24th USENIX Conference on File and Storage Technologies (FAST '26) will take place on **February 24–26, 2026**, at the **Hyatt Regency Santa Clara in Santa Clara, CA, USA**.\n\nFAST brings together storage-system researchers and practitioners to explore new directions in the design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment of systems related to storage.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nNew for FAST '26, there will be two submission deadlines (Spring and Fall), and one-shot revisions will be introduced.\n\n**Spring Deadline:**\n\n*   **Paper submissions due:** March 18, 2025, 23:59 AoE\n*   **Author response period begins:** May 20, 2025\n*   **Author response period ends:** May 22, 2025, 23:59 AoE\n*   **Notification to authors:** June 5, 2025\n*   **Final paper files due:** July 29, 2025, 23:59 AoE\n\n**Fall Deadline:**\n\n*   **Paper submissions due:** September 16, 2025, 23:59 AoE\n*   **Author response period begins:** November 18, 2025\n*   **Author response period ends:** November 20, 2025, 23:59 AoE\n*   **Notification to authors:** December 8, 2025\n*   **Final paper files due:** January 27, 2026, 23:59 AoE\n\n## Overview\n\nThe program committee interprets storage-related systems broadly: submissions on low-level storage devices, distributed storage systems, information and data management, as well as other systems interconnected with storage are all of interest.\n\n## Topics\n\nThe topics of interest to FAST are various aspects of systems related to storage. These include and overlap with, but are not limited to, the following topics:\n\n*   Archival systems\n*   AI for storage and storage for AI\n*   Auditing and provenance\n*   Big data, analytics, and data sciences\n*   Caching, replication, and consistency\n*   Cloud, multi- and hybrid-cloud environments\n*   Data deduplication and compression\n*   Database storage\n*   Distributed and networked storage (wide-area, grid, peer-to-peer)\n*   Emerging memory hierarchy design\n*   Empirical evaluation\n*   Experience with deployed-systems\n*   File system design\n*   Hardware design and prototypes\n*   HPC systems, including parallel I/O\n*   Key-value and NoSQL storage\n*   Memory-only storage systems\n*   Mobile, personal, embedded, and home storage\n*   Networking\n*   Novel and emerging storage technologies (e.g., DNA and glass storage)\n*   Performance and QoS\n*   Power-aware storage architectures\n*   RAID and erasure coding\n*   Reliability, availability, and disaster tolerance\n*   Search and data retrieval\n*   Security\n*   Storage Management\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nPlease submit your short and long papers by one of the submission deadlines listed above, in PDF format via the [submission form](https://fast26spring.usenix.hotcrp.com/).\n\n*   **Long Papers:** No longer than 12 pages, excluding references.\n*   **Short Papers:** No longer than 6 pages, excluding references.\n*   Supplemental material is optional and may be added as a single separate PDF file without page limits.\n\n## Double-blind Policy\n\nAuthors must not be identified in the submissions, either explicitly or by implication. To refer to your previous work, consider it as written by a third party.\n\n## Prior Workshop Paper Policy\n\nIf a submission extends a prior workshop paper, please include an anonymized copy of the workshop paper as supplemental material.\n\n## Simultaneous Submission\n\nSimultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. USENIX prohibits these practices.\n\n## Author Response Period\n\nFAST '26 will allow authors to respond to reviews prior to the final decision, according to the schedule above. Authors must limit their response to correcting factual errors in the reviews, to addressing questions posed by reviewers, and to clarifying the ideas in the paper. Responses may include new experiments and data in response to a reviewer's request. Responses are optional and limited to 1000 words.\n\n## Conflict Identification\n\nUpon submitting your paper, authors must indicate conflicts with PC members. A conflict exists in one of the following cases:\n\n*   Institution\n*   Advisor/Advisee\n*   Collaboration\n*   Close friends and family\n\n## One-Shot Revision\n\nA one-shot revision decision includes a summary of the paper's merits and a list of necessary changes that are required for the paper to be accepted at FAST.\n\n## Policy on FAST Resubmissions\n\nPapers rejected at the spring deadline cannot be resubmitted at the FAST '26 fall deadline. However, both papers rejected at the spring and fall deadlines may be resubmitted at either deadline for FAST '27.\n\n## Program Co-Chairs\n\n*   André Brinkmann, Johannes Gutenberg-Universität Mainz\n*   Philip Shilane, Dell Technologies"
