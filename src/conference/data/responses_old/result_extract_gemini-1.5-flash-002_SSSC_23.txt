  "Call for Papers": "# SSSC 2025, TDS 2025, COSY 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 9th IFAC Symposium on System Structure and Control (SSSC 2025), 19th IFAC Workshop on Time Delay Systems (TDS 2025), and 2nd IFAC Workshop on Control of Complex Systems (COSY 2025) will be held jointly in **Gif-sur-Yvette, France, from June 30th to July 2nd, 2025** at **CentraleSupélec** in the **Paris-Saclay University campus**.\n\nThe aim of this joint event is to gather academics and professionals with a particular interest in system structure, control, linear and nonlinear system theory, and to offer them a forum where to discuss current research developments and open problems, as well as to establish scientific networks with a focus on the mathematical structure of systems as well as on the limits it imposes on control systems design and performance.\n\n## Submission Policy\n\n*   All papers must be submitted through the conference submission website ([ifac.papercept.net](ifac.papercept.net)) formatted in the standard 2-column Proceedings format.\n*   Contributions can be submitted as either an extended abstract (2 pages) or a full paper (minimum 4 and maximum 8 pages initial submission, 6 pages final submission), in A4 size and PDF format. Accepted papers will be published in IFAC Papers on-line. Abstract submissions will NOT be published in IFAC Papers on-line but will be included in the conference preprints.\n*   A regular registration by an Author will allow the Author to upload up to 2 accepted papers the Author has (co)authored. A reduced registration will allow the Student/Retiree Author to upload up to one of the accepted papers the Student/Retiree Author has (co)authored.\n\n## Copyright Conditions\n\nAll publication material submitted for presentation at an IFAC-sponsored meeting must be original and hence cannot be already published, nor can it be under review elsewhere. The authors take responsibility for the material that has been submitted. IFAC-sponsored conferences will abide by the highest standard of ethical behavior in the review process, and the authors will abide by the IFAC publication ethics guidelines ([https://www.ifac-control.org/events/organizers-guide/PublicationEthicsGuidelines.pdf/view](https://www.ifac-control.org/events/organizers-guide/PublicationEthicsGuidelines.pdf/view)).\n\nAccepted papers that have been presented at an IFAC meeting will be published in the proceedings of the event using the open-access IFAC-PapersOnLine series hosted on ScienceDirect ([https://sciencedirect.com/](https://sciencedirect.com/)).\n\n## Call for Contributed Papers\n\nPapers are invited as regular manuscripts or extended abstracts. Papers must conform to the submission policy; all manuscripts shall be in 2-column format and meet strict page limits.\n\n## Call for Invited Sessions\n\nInvited sessions consist of 5-6 papers, which should present a unifying theme from diverse viewpoints. Proposals must describe the motivation and relevance of the session.\n\n## Call for Tutorial/Panel Sessions\n\nTutorial sessions and panel discussions addressing state-of-the-art control theory and advanced industrial applications are solicited.\n\n## Call for Workshops\n\nWorkshops to be held prior to the conference are solicited on all related topics. Proposals for workshops addressing novel control methodologies and control applications are strongly encouraged.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Deadline for invited session:** January 15, 2025\n*   **Deadline for submissions (papers and extended abstracts):** February 10, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notification:** March 27, 2025\n*   **Early registration deadline:** April 14, 2025\n*   **Final submission deadline:** April 30, 2025\n*   **Regular registration deadline:** April 30, 2025\n*   **Late registration deadline:** June 15, 2025\n\n## Contact\n\n[ifac2025conf@centralesupelec.fr](mailto:ifac2025conf@centralesupelec.fr)"
