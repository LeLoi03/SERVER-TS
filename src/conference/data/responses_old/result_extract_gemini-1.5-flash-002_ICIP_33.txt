  "Call for Papers": "# IEEE ICIP 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 2025 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) will take place in **Anchorage, Alaska, USA, from September 14-17, 2025.**\n\n## Theme\n\n\"Imaging in the Age of GenAI\"\n\n## Submission Options\n\nIEEE ICIP 2025 offers several ways for authors to present their latest research:\n\n1.  **Submit a conference paper:** Up to five pages for technical content and a sixth page containing only references. Top papers will be highlighted in Spotlight Oral Sessions, with an invitation to submit an extended version for expedited review in select SPS journals.\n2.  **Submit a journal paper to the IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing (OJ-SP):** Submit up to eight pages of technical content and one page for references; for publication in the IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing (OJ-SP), the completely open-access journal of the SPS, instead of in the conference proceedings. Papers submitted to OJ-SP prior to the advertised submission deadline that are designated as being intended for presentation at the conference will receive expedited review to ensure that a decision is available in time for inclusion in the conference program. The article processing charge (APC) for open-access publication is paid after acceptance.\n3.  **Present an accepted or published SPS journal paper:** Authors who have published or accepted a paper(s) in an eligible journal within the last year may submit an SPS Journal Paper Presentation Request to present the paper(s) at the conference. For eligibility requirements, visit the [IEEE Signal Processing Society](https://signalprocessingsociety.org/publications-resources/information-authors) website under the “Journal Paper Presentation at SPS Conferences and Workshops” section to view the criteria for eligibility.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Sensing, Representation, Modeling, & Registration\n*   Synthesis, Rendering, & Visualization\n*   Texture Image Representation & Classification\n*   Computational Imaging\n*   Restoration & Enhancement\n*   Filtering & Multi-resolution Processing\n*   Compression, Coding, & Transmission\n*   Color, Multi-spectral, & Hyper-spectral Imaging\n*   Image & Video Interpretation & Understanding\n*   Document Analysis & Processing\n*   Stereoscopic, Multi-view, and 3D Processing\n*   Image & Video Quality Models\n*   Motion Estimation, Registration, & Fusion\n*   Deep Learning for Images & Videos\n*   Learning with Limited Labels\n*   Image & Video Analysis\n*   Detection, Recognition, Retrieval, & Classification\n*   Biometrics, Forensics, & Security\n*   Image Processing for Public Health & Safety\n*   Biomedical & Biological Image Processing\n*   Trustworthy AI\n*   Explainable AI\n*   AI-Powered Image & Video Processing\n*   Emerging Applications & Systems\n*   Datasets and Benchmarks\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Special Session Proposal Deadline:** December 18, 2024\n*   **Special Session Acceptance Notification:** January 6, 2025\n*   **Tutorial Proposal Deadline:** January 8, 2025\n*   **Regular & Special Session Paper Submission Deadline (6 pages Inclusive):** January 22, 2025\n*   **Open Journal of Signal Processing Paper Submission Deadline (9 Pages):** January 22, 2025\n*   **Satellite Workshop Proposals Deadline:** February 5, 2025\n*   **Satellite Workshop Acceptance Notification:** February 12, 2025\n*   **Tutorial Acceptance Notification:** February 26, 2025\n*   **Grand Challenge Session Proposal Deadline:** March 19, 2025\n*   **Reviews Made Available to Authors:** April 23, 2025\n*   **Grand Challenge Session Acceptance Notification:** May 20, 2025\n*   **Author Rebuttal Deadline:** April 30, 2025\n*   **Regular Paper Acceptance Notification (6 pages):** May 20, 2025\n*   **Journal Track Paper Acceptance Notification (9 pages):** May 20, 2025\n*   **Satellite Workshop Paper Submission Deadline:** May 28, 2025\n*   **Journal Paper Presentation Request Deadline:** May 28, 2025\n*   **Final Regular Paper Submission Deadline:** May 28, 2025\n*   **Grand Challenge Paper Submission:** May 28, 2025\n*   **Industry Demo First Round Abstract Submission Deadline:** May 28, 2025\n*   **Journal Paper Presentation Request Notification:** June 4, 2025\n*   **Industry Demo First Round Abstract Notification of Acceptance/Rejection:** June 11, 2025\n*   **Satellite Workshop Paper Acceptance Notification:** June 25, 2025\n*   **Grand Challenge Paper Acceptance Notification:** June 25, 2025\n*   **Industry Demo Second Round Video Submission Deadline:** June 25, 2025\n*   **Satellite Workshop Final Paper Submission Deadline:** July 2, 2025\n*   **Grand Challenge Final Paper Submission Deadline:** July 2, 2025\n*   **Final Industry Demo Notification of Acceptance/Rejection:** July 3, 2025\n*   **All Author Registration Deadline:** July 16, 2025\n\n*OJSP submissions received after the original OJSP deadline of January 22, 2025 are not guaranteed inclusion in the ICIP program.\n\n## Datasets and Benchmarks Track\n\nThe ICIP 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track aims to advance image processing research by providing a platform for high-quality, publicly available image and video datasets.
