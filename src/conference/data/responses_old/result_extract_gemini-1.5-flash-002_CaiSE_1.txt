  "Call for Papers": "# CAiSE 2025: Call for Full Papers\n\nThe 37th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE 2025) will be held in **Vienna, Austria, from June 16-20, 2025.**\n\n## Theme: Bridging Silos\n\nEngineering real-world information systems requires a coherent design encompassing human, organizational, economic, societal, and technological aspects.  The theme for this year’s CAiSE conference is \"Bridging Silos.\" We encourage submissions that consider information systems engineering as a cohesive design involving multiple aspects. Submissions focused on specific specializations should explicitly position their results within the broader context to engage researchers across different areas and avoid silo formation.\n\n## Types of Scientific Papers\n\nWe invite three types of scientific papers: technical papers, empirical papers, and exploratory papers.  The type of submission must be indicated in the submission system. Each contribution should explicitly identify the information systems engineering problem addressed, its expected real-world impact, and the research method used. Submissions concerned with specific specializations within the information systems engineering field are welcome but must explicitly position their results within the broader context.\n\n### Technical Papers\n\nTechnical papers describe original insights pertaining to the field of information systems engineering. We welcome three kinds of technical papers:\n\n*   Technology-oriented papers\n*   Method-oriented papers\n*   Conceptual and theoretical papers\n\n### Empirical Papers\n\nEmpirical papers evaluate existing problem situations or validate proposed solutions with scientific means (empirical studies, experiments, case studies, experience reports, simulations, etc.).\n\n### Exploratory Papers\n\nExploratory papers describe completely new research positions or approaches to address generic situations arising because of new ICT, new kinds of activities, or new IS challenges.\n\n## Topics of Contribution\n\nTopics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Novel Approaches to IS Engineering\n*   Artificial Intelligence (including generative AI and Machine Learning)\n*   Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\n*   Big Data, Data Science, and Analytics\n*   Blockchain applications in IS\n*   Simulation and Digital Twins\n*   IS for collaboration and social computing\n*   Virtual Reality / Augmented Reality\n*   Context-aware, autonomous and adaptive IS\n*   Models, Methods and Techniques in IS Engineering\n*   Ontologies and Ontology Engineering\n*   Conceptual modeling, languages and design\n*   Requirements engineering\n*   Business process modeling, analysis and improvement\n*   Process automation, mining and monitoring\n*   Models and methods for evolution and reuse\n*   Low-code/no-code technology\n*   Domain and method engineering\n*   Product lines, variability and configuration management\n*   Compliance and alignment handling\n*   Active and interactive models\n*   Quality of IS models for analysis and design\n*   Visualization techniques in IS\n*   Decision models and business intelligence\n*   Knowledge graphs\n*   Human-centered techniques\n*   Architectures and Platforms for IS Engineering\n*   Distributed, mobile and open architecture\n*   Big Data architectures\n*   Cloud- and edge-based IS engineering\n*   Service oriented and multi-agent IS engineering\n*   Multi-platform IS engineering\n*   Cyber-physical systems and Internet of Things (IoT)\n*   Workflow and Process Aware Information Systems (PAIS)\n*   Handling of real-time data streams\n*   Content management and semantic Web\n*   Crowdsourcing platforms\n*   Conversational agents (chatbots)\n*   Microservices design and deployment\n*   Domain-specific and Multi-aspect IS Engineering\n*   IT governance\n*   eGovernment\n*   Autonomous and smart systems (smart city management, smart vehicles, etc.)\n*   IS for healthcare\n*   Educational Systems and Learning Analytics\n*   Value and supply chain management\n*   Industry 4.0/Industry 5.0\n*   Sustainability and social responsibility management\n*   Privacy, security, trust, and safety management\n\n## Submission Details\n\n*   Submit your paper using EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=caise2025](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=caise2025) (EasyChair opens on November 1st)\n*   Papers should be submitted as PDF, following Springer’s LNCS format, and should not exceed 14 pages, excluding the references, but including all text, figures, and appendices.\n*   The results described must be unpublished and not under review elsewhere.\n*   Three to five keywords should be listed at the end of the abstract.\n*   Each paper will be reviewed by at least two program committee members and, if positively evaluated, a third review will be conducted by one additional program board member.\n*   Accepted papers will be presented at CAiSE’25 and published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) conference proceedings.\n\n## Awards\n\n*   **Best Paper Award:** prize EUR 1000 (sponsored by Springer)\n*   A small selection of best papers will be invited to submit enhanced versions for consideration in a special issue of Elsevier Information Systems journal dedicated to this conference.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Submission:** November 29, 2024, AoE (mandatory)\n*   **Paper Submission:** December 6, 2024, AoE\n*   **Notification of Acceptance:** February 28, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready Papers:** April 14, 2025\n*   **Author Registration Deadline:** April 14, 2025"
