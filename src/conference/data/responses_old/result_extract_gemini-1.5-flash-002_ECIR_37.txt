  "Call for Papers": "# ECIR 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 47th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR 2025) will be held as a physical (in-person) conference from **April 6th to 10th, 2025, in Lucca, Italy**.\n\nECIR is the prime European forum for the presentation of original research in the field of Information Retrieval.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nECIR 2025 invites the submission of high-quality and original papers in the broad field of Information Retrieval – this primarily includes textual or textual with multimodal information. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Search and ranking (including retrieval models and ranking, query and content analysis, web search, and theoretical aspects of Information Retrieval)\n*   User aspects in IR (including information interaction, contextualisation, personalisation, simulation, characterisation, and behaviours)\n*   System aspects (including retrieval and recommendation architectures, efficiency and scalability)\n*   Conversational search and recommender systems (focusing on natural language understanding and generation, dialogue management, multimodal interaction, and user engagement in search processes)\n*   Explainability methods (addressing the transparency, interpretability, and accountability of AI-driven systems, particularly for information retrieval, recommendation, and personalisation)\n*   Machine Learning and Large Language Models for information retrieval and recommendation\n*   Applications (such as web search, recommender systems, web and social media apps, professional and domain-specific search, novel interfaces to search tools, intelligent search, and conversational agents)\n*   Evaluation research (including new metrics and novel methods for the measurement and evaluation of retrieval and/or recommendation systems, users, and/or applications)\n*   New social and technical challenges in IR (such as bias, ethics, fake news, and hate speech, IR-focused trustworthy & explainable AI methodologies and techniques)\n\n### Full Paper Track\n\nThe Full Paper Track provides the opportunity for researchers to present their state-of-the-art research in Information Retrieval, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.\n\n*   Full papers are up to 12 pages in length plus additional pages for references. Appendices count toward the page limit. Please put appendices before the references for paper submission.\n*   Full papers will be refereed through double-blind peer review, with an initial first-stage review followed by a second stage of discussion led by a meta-reviewer.\n\n### Submission Guidelines\n\nAuthors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word ([https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)), for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers ([https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid](https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/orcid)).\n\nAll submissions must be written in English. All papers should be submitted electronically through the EasyChair submission system ([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecir2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecir2025)).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Conference:** April 6-10, 2025\n*   **Full Paper Track**\n    *   Abstract Submission: October 9, 2024\n    *   Full Paper Submission: October 16, 2024\n    *   Acceptance/Rejection Notifications: December 16, 2024\n*   **Short Paper Track**\n    *   Abstract Submission: October 23, 2024\n    *   Short Paper Submission: November 3, 2024\n    *   Acceptance/Rejection Notifications: December 16, 2024\n*   **Workshop Track**\n    *   Proposals Submission: September 20, 2024\n    *   Acceptance/Rejection Notifications: October 18, 2024\n*   **Demo Track**\n    *   Demo Submission: October 30, 2024\n    *   Acceptance/Rejection Notifications: December 16, 2024\n*   **Reproducibility Track**\n    *   Abstract Submission: October 23, 2024\n    *   Reproducibility Paper Submission: October 30, 2024\n    *   Acceptance/Rejection Notifications: December 16, 2024\n*   **“IR for Good” Track**\n    *   Abstract Submission: November 3, 2024\n    *   “IR for Good” Paper Submission: November 10, 2024\n    *   Acceptance/Rejection Notifications: December 16, 2024\n*   **Tutorial Track**\n    *   Tutorial Submission: November 8, 2024\n    *   Acceptance/Rejection Notifications: December 16, 2024\n*   **Doctoral Consortium Track**\n    *   Abstract Submission: November 10, 2024\n    *   Doctoral Consortium Paper Submission: November 17, 2024\n    *   Acceptance/Rejection Notifications: December 16, 2024\n*   **Industry Day Track**\n    *   Proposals Submission: November 13, 2024\n    *   Acceptance/Rejection Notifications: December 16, 2024"
