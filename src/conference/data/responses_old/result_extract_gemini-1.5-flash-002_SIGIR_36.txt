  "Call for Papers": "# SIGIR 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 48th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2025) will be held in **Padua, Italy, from July 13-17, 2025**, followed by ICTIR 2025 on July 18, 2025.\n\nSIGIR is the premier international forum for the presentation of new research results and for the demonstration of new systems and techniques in information retrieval.\n\n## Call for Full Papers\n\nThe annual SIGIR conference is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results, and the demonstration of new systems and techniques, in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). SIGIR 2025 welcomes high-impact original papers with contributions related to any aspect of information retrieval and access, including theories, foundations, algorithms, evaluation, analysis, and applications.\n\n## Important Dates for Full Papers\n\nTime zone: Anywhere on Earth (AoE)\n\n*   **Full paper abstracts due:** January 16, 2025\n*   **Full papers due:** January 23, 2025\n*   **Full paper notifications:** April 4, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nFull research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including the other tracks of SIGIR 2025).\n\n*   Submissions must be in English, in PDF format, and at most 9 pages in length (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgements, and any content except references), with unrestricted space for references, in the current ACM two-column conference format.\n*   ACM’s CCS concepts and keywords are required for review.\n*   Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir2025) by selecting the “SIGIR 2025 Full Papers” track.\n*   At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for SIGIR 2025, and the author(s) or their delegate(s) must present the work at the conference in person.\n\n## Anonymity and Pre-Print/arXiv Policy\n\nThe full paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. Breaking anonymity or pre-print/ArXiv policy puts the submission at risk of being desk rejected.\n\n## In-Person Attendance Policy\n\nSIGIR 2025 is an in-person conference. All accepted papers (including all tracks) to the main conference and workshops are expected to be presented in-person. No pre-recorded videos will be accepted.\n\n## Child Care Service\n\nSIGIR 2025 promotes inclusion and attendance by organizing a child care service, offering congress attendees the opportunity to attend events with their children.\n\n## Authorship Policy\n\nAuthors should carefully go through ACM’s authorship policy ([https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship)) before submitting a paper.\n\n## Use of AI\n\nAll submissions must comply with the ACM policy on the use of Artificial Intelligence.\n\n## Desk Rejection Policy\n\nSubmissions that violate the anonymity, pre-print policy, length, or formatting requirements, or are determined to violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty are subject to desk rejection by the chairs.\n\n## Relevant Areas\n\nRelevant areas are (but not limited to):\n\n*   Search and Ranking\n*   System, Efficiency and Scalability\n*   Recommender Systems\n*   Machine Learning for IR\n*   Natural Language Processing for IR\n*   Conversational IR and Intelligent Agents\n*   Humans and Interfaces\n*   Datasets, Benchmarks, and Evaluation\n*   Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics, and Explainability (FATE) in IR\n*   Multi Modal IR\n*   Domain-specific Applications\n*   Other IR Topics\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n*   Omar Alonso, Amazon, USA\n*   Andrew Trotman, University of Otago, New Zealand\n*   Suzan Verberne, Leiden University, The Netherlands"
