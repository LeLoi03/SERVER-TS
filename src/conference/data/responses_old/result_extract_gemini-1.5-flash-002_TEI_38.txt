  "Call for Papers": "# TEI 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 19th International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction (TEI 2025) will take place from **March 4-7, 2025, in Bordeaux, France**.\n\n## Theme\n\n**Sustainable TEI**\n\nThis theme addresses climate change, exhaustion of resources, and the long-term sustainability of our scientific and design practices. We also want TEI'25 to be a supportive environment where attendees can discuss the deeper meaning of their research and long-term career perspectives.\n\n## Contribution Types\n\nAuthors are invited to submit high-quality papers that contribute to advancing this rapidly developing field. We highlight the following non-exclusive set of contribution types:\n\n*   **Artifact:** Research artifacts that advance the state of the art in Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction.\n*   **Method:** Tools, approaches, and techniques that enable researchers, technologists, designers, and practitioners to study, research, and work in Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction.\n*   **Theory:** Explorations, extensions, refutations, instantiations, and other developments of and to the theories pertaining to Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction.\n*   **Empirical:** Studies and data that add to our understanding of Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   TEI 2025 uses the new ACM workflow TAPS for submission templates and published papers.\n*   Papers do not have a page limit.\n*   Your submission must be original and cannot have been published in another peer-reviewed venue or be under concurrent review at another peer-reviewed venue.\n*   All papers must be anonymized for review. Author and affiliation sections and credits must be left blank.\n*   All abstracts and full papers must be submitted electronically via the Precision Conference (PCS) website before their respective deadlines.\n*   At the time of submission, authors must select their preferred presentation format (talk, demo, and/or poster).\n\n## Review Process\n\nAfter a paper-bidding process by the ACS, the program chairs will assign each paper to a primary AC (1AC) and a secondary AC (2AC). The 1AC will find two external reviewers. Each external reviewer and the 2AC will write a detailed review of their assigned submissions and assess the contribution of the research to the field. Thus, each paper will receive 3 detailed reviews. The 1AC is responsible for the quality of the reviews and will write a meta-review of the paper, summarizing the reviews from the two external reviewers and the 2AC.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract deadline:** July 25, 2024, AoE\n*   **Full submission deadline:** August 1, 2024, AoE\n*   **Notification of conditional acceptance:** October 9, 2024\n*   **Camera-ready deadline:** November 22, 2024\n*   **TEI 2025 conference:** March 4-7, 2025\n\n## Paper Chairs\n\n*   Leah Buechley, University of New Mexico\n*   HyunJoo Oh, Georgia Tech\n*   Paul Strohmeier, Saarland University\n\n## Contact\n\nFor further questions, please contact the Paper chairs at [program_chairs@tei.acm.org](mailto:program_chairs@tei.acm.org)"
