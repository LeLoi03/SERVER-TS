  "Call for Papers": "# KDD 2025: Call for Papers\n\nKDD is the premier Data Science conference, hosting both a Research and an Applied Data Science Track. The conference will take place in **Toronto, Canada, from Sunday, August 3, 2025, to Thursday, August 7, 2025.**\n\nKDD has multiple submission cycles per year. KDD 2025 has two cycles: one already complete with submissions due on August 1, 2024, and a second cycle underway.\n\n## Research Track: Call for Papers\n\n### Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Deadline:** February 3, 2025\n*   **Paper Deadline:** February 10, 2025\n*   **Author Rebuttal Period:** April 4-18, 2025\n*   **Notification:** May 16, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready:** TBD\n\n### Submission Site\n\nWe will use OpenReview to manage the submissions and reviewing. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.\n\n### Scope\n\nFor the research track, we invite submissions describing innovative research on all aspects of knowledge discovery and data science, ranging from theoretical foundations to novel models and algorithms for data science problems in science, business, medicine, and engineering. Visionary papers on new and emerging topics are also welcome, as are application-oriented papers that make innovative technical contributions to research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   **Data Science:** Methods for analyzing social networks, time series, sequences, streams, text, web, graphs, rules, patterns, logs, IoT data, spatio-temporal data, biological data, scientific and business data; recommender systems, computational advertising, multimedia, finance, bioinformatics.\n*   **Big Data:** Large-scale systems for data analysis, machine learning, optimization, sampling, summarization; parallel and distributed data science (cloud, map-reduce, federated learning); novel algorithmic and statistical techniques for big data; algorithmically efficient data transformation and integration.\n*   **Foundations:** Models and algorithms, asymptotic analysis; model selection, dimensionality reduction, relational/structured learning, matrix and tensor methods, probabilistic and statistical methods; deep learning, transfer learning, representation learning, meta learning, reinforcement learning; classification, clustering, regression, semi-supervised learning, self-supervised learning, few shot learning, and unsupervised learning; personalization, security and privacy, visualization; fairness, interpretability, ethics, and robustness.\n\n### Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Deadlines: The submission deadlines are strict and no extensions will be allowed.\n*   Authorship: Every person named as the author of a paper must have contributed substantially to the work.\n*   Maximum authorship: In the research track, the number of submissions allowed per author is limited to 7 (seven) maximum.\n*   Authorship changes: The full list of author names, including the ordering, must be finalized by the submission deadline.\n*   Anonymity: The review process will be double-blind. The submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information.\n*   Formatting Requirements: Submissions must be in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the ACM template and format (also available in Overleaf); Word users may use the Word Interim Template.\n*   Originality and Concurrent Submissions: Submissions must present original workâ€”papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference/journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted.\n*   Resubmission Guidelines: A paper that receives a Resubmit decision during the Aug 2024 submission cycle may submit a revised version to the Feb 2025 deadline. A paper that was either rejected or withdrawn after receiving its reviews during the Aug 2024 deadline cannot submit a revision and cannot be re-submitted as a fresh submission to the Feb 2025 deadline.\n*   Serving as Reviewer: Every submission must nominate at least one author who is a qualified reviewer (i.e., authors with at least three papers in KDD or other related conferences).\n*   Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent: Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when appropriate.\n\n### Submission Site\n\nAbstracts and papers can be submitted through OpenReview: [https://openreview.net/group?id=KDD.org/2025/Research_Track_February](https://openreview.net/group?id=KDD.org/2025/Research_Track_February)\n\n## Applied Data Science (ADS) Track: Call for Papers\n\n### Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Deadline:** February 3, 2025\n*   **Paper Deadline:** February 10, 2025\n*   **Author Rebuttal Period:** April 4-18, 2025\n*   **Notification:** May 16, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready:** TBD\n\n## Datasets and Benchmarks Track: Call for Papers\n\n### Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper Abstract Deadline:** February 17, 2025\n*   **Paper Deadline:** February 24, 2025\n*   **Notification to Authors:** May 16, 2024\n\n## Calls for Proposals\n\n*   Call for Lecture-Style Tutorials\n*   Call for Hands-On Tutorials\n*   Call for Workshop Proposals\n*   Call for KDD Cup Proposals\n*   Call for Reviewers\n*   Call for Student Volunteers\n\n## Program Committee Co-Chairs\n\n*   Yizhou Sun (University of California, Los Angeles)\n*   Flavio Chierichetti (Sapienza University of Rome)\n*   Hady W.
