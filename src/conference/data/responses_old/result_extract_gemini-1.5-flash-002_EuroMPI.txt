It will be hosted by the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre in Perth, Australia from September 25-27, 2024 and will be co-located with the International Workshop on OpenMP – IWOMP 2024.",
  "Call for Papers": "# EuroMPI/Australia 2024: Call for Papers\n\nEuroMPI is an annual conference with a focus on advancing the ubiquitous Message Passing Interface (MPI) model and specification of parallel programming.  EuroMPI/Australia 2024 (25–27 September 2024) will be hosted by the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre in Perth, Australia, and will be co-located with the International Workshop on OpenMP – IWOMP 2024 (23–25 September 2024).\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe solicit quality submissions of unpublished work that detail innovative, original research and development related to MPI. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Implementation issues and algorithms\n*   Architectures and systems\n*   Programming models and paradigms for large-scale, parallel, distributed memory systems\n*   Extensions to and shortcomings of MPI, alternative interfaces and solutions\n*   New, parallel (MPI-)I/O mechanisms optimizations\n*   Hybrid and heterogeneous programming with MPI and other interfaces\n*   Message passing interface support for data-intensive parallel applications\n*   Fault tolerance in message-passing implementations and systems\n*   MPI parallel programming in clouds and non-dedicated systems\n*   Applications and performance\n*   Automatic performance tuning of applications and implementations\n*   Verification of message-passing applications and protocols\n*   Applications using message passing, in particular in computational science and scientific computing\n*   Parallel algorithms in the message-passing paradigm\n*   Interactions between the message-passing library and runtime systems\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission Deadline (extended):** Friday, 14 June 2024 (AoE)\n*   **Acceptance Notifications:** Friday, 12 July 2024 (AoE)\n*   **Camera Ready Copy Deadline:** Friday, 26 July 2024 (AoE)\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmitted papers should follow LNCS Guidelines and obey the [Authors' Code of Conduct](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct).\n\n*   Submitted full papers should be 12–15 pages, and short papers should be 6–11 pages (not all short papers will appear in the proceedings).\n*   Note that at least one of the authors of each full paper, short paper, or poster accepted for presentation must be registered for EuroMPI/Australia 2024.\n\n## Submission\n\nMake a submission using the EasyChair Conference Management System: [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=eurompiaustralia2024](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=eurompiaustralia2024)\n\n## Proceedings\n\nEuroMPI/Australia 2024 will publish formal proceedings of the accepted papers in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series."
