  "Call for Papers": "# PKC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nPKC 2025, the International Conference on Practice and Theory in Public Key Cryptography, will take place in **Røros, Norway on May 12-15, 2025.**  The conference is organized by the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR).\n\n## General Information\n\nThe proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series.\n\nOriginal research papers on all aspects of public-key cryptography, covering theory, implementations and applications, and related fields, are solicited for submission to PKC 2025.\n\n## Areas of Interest\n\nAreas of interest include research on:\n\n*   Public key schemes, such as their design and analysis (including side channel attacks), from its math to actual systems\n*   The design, proposal, and analysis of cryptographic primitives and protocols\n*   Public-key techniques in MPC or other protocols\n\nPure information-theoretic and symmetric-key subjects (e.g., block cipher design and attacks) are not in scope. This year, submissions on the theme of \"Real-world public-key cryptography\" are particularly welcome.\n\n## Program Committee Members\n\nProgram committee members are permitted to submit either 3 co-authored papers, or at most 4 co-authored papers all with students.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 11:59 pm AoE (Anywhere on Earth).\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** October 16, 2024\n*   **First round notification:** December 11, 2024\n*   **Rebuttal deadline:** December 18, 2024\n*   **Final notification:** February 5, 2025\n*   **Final versions due:** February 26, 2025\n*   **Conference begins:** May 12, 2025\n\n## Awards\n\nThe Program Committee may choose a paper to receive an overall best paper award. The Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper authored exclusively by early-career researchers. To be eligible, all co-authors must be studying full/part-time or have received their degree in 2019 or later. Awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.\n\n## Stipends\n\nStudents whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration waived. A limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students whose papers are accepted and who will present the paper themselves are encouraged to apply if such assistance is needed.  Requests for stipends should be sent to the general chair.\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   **Program Co-chairs:**\n    *   Tibor Jager, University of Wuppertal, Germany\n    *   Jiaxin Pan, University of Kassel, Germany\n    *   [pkc2025programchairs@iacr.org](mailto:pkc2025programchairs@iacr.org)\n*   **Area Chairs:**\n    *   Stefano Tessaro, Advanced PKE\n    *   Alexander May, Mathematics of Public-Key Crypto\n    *   Claudio Orlandi, MPC and Friends\n    *   Mihir Bellare, (Real-World) Primitives and Protocols\n    *   Miyako Ohkubo, Advanced Signatures and Proof Systems\n*   **General Co-chairs:**\n    *   Bor de Kock, TNO, The Netherlands\n    *   Tjerand Silde, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway\n    *   [pkc2025@iacr.org](mailto:pkc2025@iacr.org)"
