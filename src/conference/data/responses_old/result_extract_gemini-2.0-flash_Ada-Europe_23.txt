The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Formal and model-based engineering of critical systems\n*   High-Integrity Systems and Reliability\n*   AI for High-Integrity Systems Engineering\n*   Real-Time Systems\n*   Domain applications\n*   Experience Reports in Reliable System Development\n*   Ada Language\n\n## Call for Contributions\n\nThe conference schedule comprises a journal track, an industrial track, a work-in-progress track, a vendor exhibition, parallel tutorials, and satellite workshops.\n\n### Journal Track Submissions\n\nThis edition of the conference again includes a \"Journal Track\" which seeks original and high-quality papers that describe mature research work on the conference topics. Accepted journal track papers will be published in the **Reliable Software Technologies (AEiC2025) Special Issue of JSA** -- the Journal of Systems Architecture (Q1 ranked, CiteScore 8.7, impact factor 3.8). The conference is listed as “Journal Published” in the latest update of the CORE Conference Ranking released in August 2023.\n\n*   Submissions should be made online at [https://www.editorialmanager.com/jsa/](https://www.editorialmanager.com/jsa/).

Subsequent papers will follow JSA regular publishing track.\n\n### Industrial Track Submissions\n\nThe conference seeks industrial practitioner presentations that deliver insight on the challenges of developing reliable software.\n\n*   Contributions (one‐to‐two pages abstract) must be submitted by 7 March 2025 (extended).\n*   Interested authors shall submit a short (1‐to‐2 pages) abstract, via [Easy Chair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aeic2025), strictly in PDF following the [Ada User Journal](https://ada-europe.org/auj/home) style.\n*   The abstract of the accepted contributions will be included in the conference booklet. The corresponding authors will get a presentation slot in the prime‐time technical program of the conference, and will also be invited to expand their contributions into full‐fledged articles for publication in the Ada User Journal.\n*   The Industrial Track welcomes contributions that fit the general scope of the conference, and actively address the perspective of practitioners on the topic of interest.\n\n### Work‐in‐Progress Track Submissions\n\nThe Work‐in‐Progress track seeks two kinds of submissions: (a) ongoing research and (b) early‐stage ideas.\n\n*   Ongoing research submissions are 4‐page papers describing research results that are not mature enough to be submitted to the journal track.\n*   Early‐stage ideas are 1‐page papers that pitch new research directions that fall within the scope of the conference.\n*   Both kinds of submissions must be original and shall undergo anonymous peer review. Submissions by recent MSc graduates and PhD students are especially sought.\n*   Contributions must be submitted by 7 March 2025 (extended). Interested authors shall submit their work via [Easy Chair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aeic2025), strictly in PDF following the [Ada User Journal](https://ada-europe.org/auj/home) style.\n*   The abstract of the accepted contributions will be included in the conference booklet.
