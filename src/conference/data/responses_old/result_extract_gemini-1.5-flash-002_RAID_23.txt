  "Call for Papers": "# RAID 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 28th International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions, and Defenses (RAID 2025) will be held in **Gold Coast, Australia, from October 19-22, 2025**.\n\nRAID is a venue where leading researchers and practitioners from academia, industry, and the government present novel research in cybersecurity.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe are soliciting research papers on topics covering all well-motivated computer security problems. We care about techniques that identify new real-world threats, techniques to prevent them, to detect them, to mitigate them, or to assess their prevalence and consequences. Measurement papers are encouraged, as well as papers offering public access to new tools or datasets, or experience papers that clearly articulate important lessons learned. Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Cloud security\n*   Cybercrime and underground economies\n*   Cyber-physical systems security and threats against critical infrastructures\n*   Denial-of-Service attacks and defenses\n*   Digital forensics\n*   Hardware security\n*   Intrusion detection and prevention\n*   IoT security\n*   Machine learning for security\n*   Malware and unwanted software\n*   Mobile security and privacy\n*   Network security\n*   Program analysis and reverse engineering\n*   Security education and training\n*   Security measurement studies\n*   Security of machine learning systems\n*   Software security\n*   Systems security\n*   Statistical and adversarial learning for computer security\n*   Usable security and privacy\n*   Vulnerability analysis and exploitation techniques\n*   Web security and privacy\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission Deadline:** April 17, 2025, 11:59:59 pm Anywhere on earth (UTC-12)\n*   **Notification to Authors:** July 9, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready Deadline:** August 14, 2025\n*   **Conference Dates:** October 19 - 22, 2025\n\n## Submission Process and Format\n\nThe submission site is available here: [https://raid2025.hotcrp.com/](https://raid2025.hotcrp.com/).\n\nSubmissions must be a PDF file and should follow the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template ([https://template-selector.ieee.org/](https://template-selector.ieee.org/)). The submission must be no more than 12 pages long, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Note that reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material. Authors should not change the font or the margins of the IEEE format. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.\n\n## Review Process\n\nReviewing will be double-blind, meaning the authors’ identities will be hidden from the reviewers. All papers will be reviewed by at least three reviewers and will receive notification according to the timeline above. No major/minor revision options are allowed. All papers must be appropriately anonymized.\n\n## Human Subjects and Ethical Considerations\n\nSubmissions that describe experiments on human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:\n\n*   Disclose whether the research received approval or a waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (e.g., an IRB).\n*   Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect.\n*   If the submission deals with vulnerabilities, the authors need to discuss in detail the steps they have already taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities (e.g., by disclosing vulnerabilities to the vendors).\n*   If a paper raises significant ethical and legal concerns, it might be rejected based on these concerns.\n\n## Proceedings\n\nPapers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented at RAID 2025 and published in conference proceedings by Conference Publishing Services, CPS, and will be submitted to IEEE Xplore Digital Library. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. Note that for papers that share authors, a separate author registration is required for each paper.\n\n## Program Committee\n\nWe are looking for volunteers, and we are accepting nominations (self-nominations are welcome as well). If interested, please fill this form: [https://forms.gle/yVia9CV9wtRxQY388](https://forms.gle/yVia9CV9wtRxQY388)."
