  "Call for Papers": "# COCOON 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 31st International Computing and Combinatorics Conference (COCOON 2025) will be held in **Chengdu, China, from August 15-17, 2025**.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nOriginal research papers in the areas of algorithms, theory of computation, computational complexity, and combinatorics related to computing are solicited. In addition to theoretical results, submissions that report on experimental and applied research of general algorithmic interest are welcome. Special consideration will be given to research that is motivated by real-world problems. Experimental and applied papers are expected to show convincingly the usefulness and efficiency of the algorithms discussed in a practical setting.\n\nThe topics of interest include (but are not limited to) the following:\n\n*   Algorithms and Data Structures\n*   Algorithmic Game Theory and Mechanism Design\n*   Approximation Algorithms and Online Algorithms\n*   Automata, Languages, Logic, and Computability\n*   Combinatorics Related to Algorithms and Complexity\n*   Complexity Theory\n*   Computational Learning Theory and Knowledge Discovery\n*   Cryptography, Reliability and Security, and Database Theory\n*   Computational Biology and Bioinformatics\n*   Computational Algebra, Geometry, and Number Theory\n*   Exact and Parameterized Algorithms\n*   Graph Drawing and Information Visualization\n*   Graph Theory, Communication Networks, and Optimization\n*   Parallel and Distributed Computing\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nThe submission should contain a scholarly exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including the motivation and a clear comparison with related work. The length of the submission should not exceed 12 pages in LNCS style (including references, but excluding the optional appendix). Appendices should be placed at the end of the main body (after references, in the same file). For code and data, authors can provide anonymous download links or refer to an anonymized GitHub repository. The Program Committee (PC) will review the content in the appendices and links at their discretion. The submitted papers will be reviewed in a double-blind peer review manner. Please delete the author information on your manuscript.\n\nAll submissions must be submitted electronically through EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cocoon2025](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cocoon2025)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission:** March 5, 2025, 23:59 AoE\n*   **Notification:** May 5, 2025 AoE\n*   **Camera-ready:** May 20, 2024 AoE\n*   **Conference:** August 15 â€“ August 17, 2025\n\nAoE: Anywhere on Earth time, UTC -12 hours\n\n## Publication\n\nThe proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series, and will be available for distribution at the conference. Selected high-quality papers will be invited for submission to some journals.\n\n## Awards\n\nAwards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper. To be eligible for the best student paper award, all authors must be full-time students at the time of submission. Please indicate in the final line of the abstract that the paper is being considered for the best student paper award. The program committee reserves the right to withhold these awards or to split them between multiple recipients.\n\n## Contact\n\nEmail: [cocoon2025.chengdu@gmail.com](mailto:cocoon2025.chengdu@gmail.com)"
