  "Summary": "The International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA) is the premier forum for new ideas and research results in computer architecture.  In 2025, the 31st edition of HPCA will be held from March 1st to March 5th at the Westin Las Vegas, United States. HPCA-31 is one of the conferences of the Annual Meeting in Parallel programming, computer ARchitecture and Compilers (PARC), in conjunction with PPoPP, CGO, and CC.",
  "Call for Papers": "# HPCA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 31st IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA) will be held in **Las Vegas, NV, from March 1-5, 2025**.\n\nHPCA is a high-impact premier venue for presenting research results on a wide range of computer architecture topics.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nSome topics of interest are listed below, but we encourage authors to contact the program chair ([hpca2025@psu.edu](mailto:hpca2025@psu.edu)) if they have a question regarding the topic fit:\n\n*   Processor, memory, and storage systems architecture\n*   Instruction-, thread-, and data-level parallelism\n*   Interconnection networks and network interface architecture\n*   Domain-specific architectures and Accelerators\n*   FPGA, CGRA, and Reconfigurable systems\n*   Near/In-Memory computing\n*   Cloud, Datacenters, cluster/distributed systems\n*   Approximate computing\n*   Compilers/Languages/Runtimes for novel architectures\n*   IoT, Mobile, Edge, and Embedded architectures\n*   Effects of circuits or technology on architecture (3D/chiplets/interposer/wafer-scale)\n*   Architecture modeling and simulation methodologies\n*   Neuromorphic computing\n*   Quantum, Superconducting and Emerging technologies impacting computer architectures\n*   Reliability/Fault Tolerance, Energy Efficiency and Sustainability of Computer Systems\n*   Security/Privacy\n*   Evaluation and measurement of real computing systems\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper Registration and Abstract Submission:** July 26, 2024\n*   **Paper Submission:** August 2, 2024\n*   **Revision/Rebuttal Period:** October 4-16, 2024\n*   **Notification:** November 5, 2024\n*   **Final Papers Due:** January 17, 2025\n*   **Conference Date:** March 1-5, 2025\n\n## Guidelines for Submissions\n\nThe purpose of having a paper registration deadline a week ahead of the actual paper submission is to overlap review assignments with giving you extra time to improve the quality of your submission. While we could have opted to freeze the title, authors, and abstract fields by the paper registration deadline, we have decided against this, in order to provide you some flexibility in making modifications until the actual submission deadline. However, we do not want authors to misuse this flexibility. To adhere to the spirit of this intention, we need you to:\n\n*   Please make the paper title as close to the final version as possible.\n*   The author list should not change (order of authors can) after registration. If there is a change, you should send an email indicating the change at least 48 hours before the paper submission deadline to the PC chair.\n*   Consequently, the Conflict List should also be finalized by the abstract registration. Please ensure it is accurate at the time of registration.\n*   Please make the abstract as close to the final version as possible.\n\nFlagrant violation of the above could result in an outright rejection of the submission.\n\n## Paper Format\n\nPapers must be submitted in printable PDF format and should contain a maximum of 11 pages of single-spaced two-column text, not including references. You may include any number of pages for references, but see below for more instructions. If you are using LaTeX to typeset your paper, then we suggest that you use [our template](https://hpca-conf.org/2025/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/hpca2025-latex-template.zip).  If you use a different software package to typeset your paper, then please adhere to the guidelines given in the table below. Please ensure that you include page numbers with your submission. This makes it easier for the reviewers to refer to different parts of your paper when they provide comments. Please ensure that your submission has a banner at the top of the title page, which contains the submission number and the notice of confidentiality.\n\n## Paper Submission Instructions\n\n*   Guidelines for Determining Authorship\n*   Declaring Authors\n*   Areas and Topics\n*   Declaring Conflicts of Interest\n*   ArXiv Submissions\n*   Concurrent Submissions and Workshops\n\n## Paper Evaluation Objectives\n\nThe committee will make every effort to judge each submitted paper on its own merits. There will be no target acceptance rate. We expect to accept a wide range of papers with appropriate expectations for evaluation â€“ while papers that build on significant past work with strong evaluations are valuable, papers that open new areas with less rigorous evaluation are equally welcome and especially encouraged. We also acknowledge the wide range of evaluation methodologies in HPCA including modeling, simulation, prototyping, experimental implementation, real product evaluation, etc.\n\n## Industry Track\n\nHPCA 2025 features a separate Industry Track with a separate call for papers. The goal of the HPCA Industry Track is to publish papers that are written by industry authors and their content relates to industrial products/processes.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor any questions, please contact the Program Chair at [hpca2025@psu.edu](mailto:hpca2025@psu.edu)."
