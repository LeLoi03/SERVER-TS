  "Call for Papers": "# EuroMPI/USA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nEuroMPI/USA 2025 will be hosted by the University of North Carolina, Charlotte and will be co-located with [IWOMP 2025](https://www.iwomp.org/) (October 1 - October 3, 2025), with joint tutorials, and opportunities for interaction between the two communities.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe invite high-quality, full and short paper submissions on all topics related to message-passing parallel programming with MPI and related or competing models. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   **Implementation Issues and Algorithms:** Efficient and scalable implementations of message-passing constructs.\n*   **Architectures and systems:** Towards exascale computing, efficient use of accelerators and other features of modern, large-scale systems, hardware-software interaction.\n*   **Message Passing for accelerator-based compute architectures:** including multi-GPU, TPU, and AI-accelerator systems.\n*   **Programming models and paradigms:** related to MPI targeting large-scale, parallel, distributed memory systems, hierarchical and hybrid models, partitioned global address space (PGAS) models.\n*   **Extensions to and shortcomings of MPI:** alternative interfaces and solutions.\n*   **New, parallel (MPI-)I/O mechanisms optimizations**.\n*   **Hybrid and heterogeneous programming:** with MPI and other interfaces.\n*   **Message passing interface support for data-intensive parallel applications**.\n*   **Fault tolerance:** in message-passing implementations and systems.\n*   **MPI parallel programming in clouds and non-dedicated systems**.\n*   **Performance evaluation:** for MPI and MPI-based applications.\n*   **Automatic performance tuning:** of applications and implementations.\n*   **Verification:** of message-passing applications and protocols.\n*   **Applications:** using advanced message passing, in particular in computational science and scientific computing.\n*   **Parallel algorithms:** in the message-passing paradigm.\n*   **Interactions:** between the message-passing library and runtime systems.\n*   **Use of MPI in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLM)** and its challenges\n*   **Integration and comparisons with competing industry standards** (e.g., NCCL, RCCL)\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n### Papers\n\nTo be considered, papers must use the **Springer LNCS proceedings template**. An **Overleaf template** is available as well. Full papers should be at least 12 and at most 16 pages, including figures and tables but excluding references. Short papers may be between 6 and 9 pages. Margins, spacing, and font sizes should not be modified from the template.\n\nAuthors should submit their work through the [EuroMPI/USA 2025 submission site at EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=eurompiusa2025). Note that at least one of the authors of each paper accepted for presentation in EuroMPI/USA 2025 must be registered.\n\n### Posters\n\nWe welcome the submission of abstracts for posters to be presented during a dedicated poster session. These abstracts should not exceed 2 pages (excluding references) and should use the Springer LNCS proceedings template, submitted through the [EasyChair submission site](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=eurompiusa2025) and marked as a poster submission. The deadline for submitting poster abstracts is July 16, 2025.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract deadline:** May 16, 2025 AoE\n*   **Submission deadline:** May 23, 2025 AoE\n*   **Paper notification:** June 20, 2025 AoE\n*   **Poster submission deadline:** July 11, 2025 AoE\n*   **Poster notification:** July 25, 2025 AoE\n\n## Contact\n\nFor queries relating to the conference or research papers (submission, deadlines, publishing, etc.) please contact [eurompiconference@gmail.com](mailto:eurompiconference@gmail.com)"
