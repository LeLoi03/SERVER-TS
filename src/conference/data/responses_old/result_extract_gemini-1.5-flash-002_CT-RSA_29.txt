  "Call for Papers": "# CT-RSA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Cryptographers' Track at RSA Conference (CT-RSA 2025) will be held in **San Francisco, California, USA from April 28–May 1, 2025.**\n\nCT-RSA is RSAC's venue for scientific papers on cryptography. It presents a unique opportunity for researchers to share their work with a broader audience than at a typical academic conference.\n\n## Topics\n\nOriginal papers on all technical aspects of cryptology are solicited for submission. Papers of interest to the wider audience of security professionals at RSA Conference are especially encouraged. Topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Blockchains and distributed ledger security\n*   Code based cryptography\n*   Cryptanalysis\n*   Cryptographic standards\n*   Design and security analysis of cryptographic primitives and protocols\n*   Differential privacy\n*   Formal verification of cryptographic security properties\n*   Hardware & software implementations\n*   Indistinguishable obfuscation\n*   Information-theoretic cryptography\n*   Multi-party computation and zero-knowledge\n*   Novel applications of cryptography\n*   Physically unclonable functions\n*   Post-quantum cryptography\n*   Privacy\n*   Public-key cryptography algorithms and protocols\n*   Public-key encryption and advanced encryption schemes\n*   Side-channel attacks and defenses\n*   Symmetric-key cryptography\n*   Theory of leakage resistance\n*   Time-released cryptography and PoW\n*   White-box cryptography\n\n### Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers\n\nCT-RSA also welcomes systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers. These papers will not be judged on novel research contributions, but on their value to the research community. SoK papers should provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area; support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence; or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate for acceptance.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nFor submissions including practical evaluations, it is encouraged (but not required) to make implementations available to facilitate replicability and reproducibility.\n\nAccepted papers (including SoK papers) will appear in the CT-RSA proceedings, published by Springer in its LNCS series.\n\nCT-RSA is scheduled to be an in-person event. It is strongly preferred that authors of accepted papers present their work in person. Exceptions will be made only in the case of serious extenuating circumstances, such as COVID restrictions, visa delays, and other emergencies. The presenter of each paper will be given a free Full Pass to RSA Conference.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission:** October 30, 2024\n*   **Notification of decision:** January 10, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready versions due:** January 20, 2025\n*   **Author presentations due:** April 3, 2025\n*   **Conference:** April 28–May 1, 2025\n\n## Contact\n\nFor questions specific to the CT-RSA track, contact the CT-RSA program chair Arpita Patra ([ctrsa2025chair.csa@iisc.ac.in](mailto:ctrsa2025chair.csa@iisc.ac.in)).
