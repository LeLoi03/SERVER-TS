  "Call for Papers": "# STOC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 57th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2025) will be held in **Prague, Czech Republic, from Monday, June 23 to Friday, June 27, 2025** at the **OREA Hotel Pyramida**.\n\nPapers presenting new and original research on the theory of computation are sought. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include:\n\n*   Algorithms and data structures\n*   Computational complexity\n*   Randomness in computing\n*   Algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics\n*   Analysis of Boolean functions\n*   Approximation algorithms\n*   Cryptography\n*   Computational learning theory\n*   Continuous and discrete optimization\n*   Economics and computation\n*   Parallel and distributed algorithms\n*   Quantum computing\n*   Algorithmic coding theory\n*   Computational geometry and topology\n*   Computational applications of logic\n*   Algebraic computation\n*   Computational and foundational aspects of areas such as machine learning, fairness, privacy, networks, data management, databases and computational biology\n\nPapers that extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged. The program committee will make every effort to consider a broad range of areas.\n\n## Submission Format\n\nSubmissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information, and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the \"full version\" of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea. Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.\n\nAlthough there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.\n\n## Double-Blind Reviewing\n\nSTOC 2025 will use double-blind reviewing, and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nAuthors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing). The [submission server](https://stoc25.hotcrp.com/) is scheduled to open on October 1, 2024.\n\nIt is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** Monday, November 4, 2024, 7:59 pm EST. There is no separate abstract submission deadline.\n*   **Notification date:** By email on or before February 1, 2025.\n*   **Camera-ready versions of accepted papers:** A camera-ready copy of each accepted paper is required by March 31, 2025. The format of your paper must strictly adhere to the ACM Format, and specifically the sigconf option. (LaTeX users, please use: `\\documentclass[sigconf,screen]{acmart}`).\n*   **STOC talks:** Monday morning June 23 to Friday afternoon June 27, 2025.\n*   **Publication date:** The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference.\n\n## Awards\n\n*   **Best Paper Award:** The program committee may designate up to three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best Papers. All submissions are automatically eligible.\n*   **Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award:** A prize of $500 will be given to the author(s) of the best student-authored paper (or split between more than one paper if there is a tie). A paper is eligible if all of its authors are full-time students at the time of submission.\n\n## Organizers\n\n*   **Local Arrangements:** Michal Koucký (Charles University, Chair), Jan Kratochvil (Charles University), Jiří Sgall (Charles University), Tung Anh Vu (Charles University), CONFORG, s.r.o.\n*   **Program Committee Chair:** Nikhil Bansal (University of Michigan)\n*   **Theory Fest Chair:** Raghu Meka (UCLA)"
