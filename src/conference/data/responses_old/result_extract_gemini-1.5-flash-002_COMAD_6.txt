  "Call for Papers": "# CODS 2025: Call for Research Track Papers\n\nCODS 2025, the premier data-centric conference in India, will be held at the **Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, from December 17-20, 2025.**\n\n## Call for Papers: Research Track\n\nWe invite submissions of papers describing innovative and original research contributions in data science, data management, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, as well as papers describing the design, implementation, and results of applying these advances to real-world problems.  Papers can range from theoretical contributions to systems and algorithms to experimental research and benchmarking.\n\nWe invite two types of submissions:\n\n*   **Archival papers:** 8 pages + 2 pages for references\n*   **Non-archival papers:** 2 pages + 1 page references\n\nPapers submitted to the Archival track will undergo a rigorous review process that will judge submissions for the novelty of the described approaches. The goal of the non-archival track is to provide authors with a fast-track route to get feedback for any preliminary ideas that show promising results but do not yet have the maturity to be submitted to the archival track.\n\nPapers accepted in the archival track will appear in the conference proceedings and be published. The publication venue will be announced soon. Papers accepted in the non-archival track will be presented at the conference but not published. Unlike previous years, we will have a single-stage review process this time, i.e., there will not be a rebuttal stage and no option to submit revised papers. Authors of all accepted papers (archival and non-archival) must present their work at the conference.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\n*   **AI, ML, and Data Mining:** Classification and regression; Knowledge discovery; knowledge representation and knowledge-based systems; data preprocessing and wrangling; feature engineering; reinforcement learning; deep learning; Bayesian methods; time series analysis; optimization; graphical models; statistical relational learning; matrix and tensor methods; parallel and distributed learning; semi- and unsupervised learning; graph mining; network analytics; text analytics and NLP; information retrieval; learning-based computer vision; multimodal learning and analytics; human-in-the-loop learning; planning and reasoning; ML for mobiles and other resource-constrained environments; federated learning; AutoML; causality; weak supervision and data augmentation; new benchmark tasks and datasets for AI/ML/data mining.\n*   **Data Management:** Data management systems (subtopics including but not limited to benchmarking, monitoring, testing, and tuning database systems, cloud, distributed, decentralized and parallel data management, database systems on emerging hardware, embedded databases, IoT and Sensor networks, Storage, indexing, and physical database design, Query processing and optimization, Transaction processing, Data warehousing, OLAP, Analytics); Models and Languages (subtopics including but not limited to Data models and semantics, Declarative programming languages and optimization, Spatial and temporal data management, Graphs, social networks, web data, and semantic web, Multimedia and information retrieval, Uncertain, probabilistic, and approximate databases, Streams and complex event processing); Human-Centric Data Management (subtopics including but not limited to Data exploration, visualization, query languages, and user interfaces, Crowdsourced and collaborative data management, User-centric and human-in-the-loop data management, Natural language processing for databases); Data Governance (subtopics including but not limited to Data provenance and workflows, Data integration, information extraction, and schema matching, Data quality, data cleaning, Data security, privacy, and access control, Responsible data management and data fairness, Metadata Management).\n*   **Intersection of AI & Data Management:** Structured queries over unstructured data: images, video, natural language, natural language queries; machine learning methods for database engine internals; machine learning methods for database tuning; data management and metadata for machine learning pipelines; knowledge base management.\n*   **Data Science Ethics:** Subtopics including, but not limited to quantifying and mitigating fairness and bias issues; improving model trust, transparency and explainability; data privacy; model alignment; environmental costs; governance and regulation.\n\n## Sharing and Reproducibility\n\nAuthors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly accessible during the review process, unless there is an inevitable reason that prohibits sharing (e.g., it requires data from a specific company or it is medical data where there is no public alternative).\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE, UTC-1200)\n\n*   **Submission of papers:** August 1, 2025\n*   **Final decision notifications (Accept / Reject):** September 22, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready Due:** November 18, 2025\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n*   Jana Doppa, Washington State University\n*   Sriparna Saha, IIT Patna\n\n## Contact\n\n[cods@acmindia.org](mailto:cods@acmindia.org)"
