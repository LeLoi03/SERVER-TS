  "callForPapers": "# PODS 2025: Call for Research Papers\n\nThe Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management. The 2025 conference will be held in **Berlin, Germany**.\n\n## Mission\n\nThe PODS community aims to provide a solid scientific basis for data management, developing solutions that ensure high levels of efficiency, scalability, usability, expressiveness, robustness, security, clarity, and privacy.\n\n## Scope\n\nPODS seeks scientific articles that present contributions to modeling, application and system building in the context of data management. At a time when computer science is increasingly data-centric, PODS pays special attention to those papers that help in the urgent process of integrating data management techniques within broader computer science.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Database processing: Query evaluation, query optimization, schema management, distributed data processing, approximate data processing\n*   Database design: Data models, query languages, schemas, constraints\n*   Database access: Data structures, access methods, concurrency, transactions\n*   Data quality: Data consistency, data cleaning, data discovery, data exploration\n*   Data analysis: Data mining, machine learning, information extraction, data streams\n*   Uncertainty: Incomplete data, inconsistent data, probabilistic data\n*   Interoperability: Mappings and views, data integration, data exchange, ontology-based data access\n*   Responsible data management: Access control, privacy, security, verification, ethical aspects of data management\n*   Human-database interaction: data summarization, data visualization, explanation for database queries\n*   Connections between database principles and other disciplines\n\n## Submission\n\n*   Submission Site: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025)\n*   Format: ACM \"acmsmall\" proceedings stylesheet\n    *   `\\documentclass[acmsmall,review,anonymous]{acmart}`\n    *   A submission can be up to **15 pages**, not including references, plus unlimited space for references.\n    *   Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, of unlimited length, that should be incorporated at submission time; online appendices are not allowed.\n    *   Papers that are longer than 15 pages or do not cohere with the required format style risk rejection without consideration of their merits.\n*   Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms and accepted papers will be published in a PODS 2025 issue of the PACMMOD (https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod) journal.\n*   PODS will apply a double-blind reviewing process.\n\n## Double-anonymous reviewing\n\nSubmissions must adhere to the following:\n\n*   Author names and institutions must be omitted.\n*   References to the authorsâ€™ own related work should be in the third person.\n*   Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed.\n\n## Merit-based acceptance\n\n*   The paper selection will be merit-based.\n*   The program committee will judge the work based on originality, quality, clarity of presentation, relevance to the field, and technical depth.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n### FIRST SUBMISSION PHASE\n\n*   **Abstract:** May 31, 2024\n*   **Submission:** June 7, 2024\n*   **Rebuttal:** July 29 - August 1, 2024\n*   **Initial notification:** August 12, 2024\n*   **Revision submission:** August 26, 2024\n*   **Final notification:** September 2, 2024\n\n### SECOND SUBMISSION PHASE\n\n*   **Abstract:** December 2, 2024\n*   **Submission:** December 9, 2024\n*   **Rebuttal:** February 3-7, 2025\n*   **Initial notification:** February 14, 2025\n*   **Revision submission:** February 28, 2025\n*   **Final notification:** March 7, 2025\n\n*All deadlines end at 5 PM Pacific Time.*\n",
