  "Call for Papers": "# ECMS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 39th ECMS International Conference on Modelling and Simulation will be held in **Catania, Sicily, Italy, from June 24th to 27th, 2025**, at the **Monastery of San Nicolò l’Arena**. The event is co-located with the 21st European Performance Engineering Workshop (EPEW).\n\n## Theme\n\nThe human capacity to abstract complex systems and phenomena into simplified models has played a critical role in the rapid evolution of our modern industrial processes, and scientific research that recently have heavily affected AI applications and techniques. As a science and an art, Modelling and Simulation have been one of the core enablers of this remarkable human trace and have become a topic of great importance for researchers and practitioners. The increasing availability of massive computational resources and interconnectivity has helped fuel tremendous advances in the field, collapsing previous barriers and redefining new horizons for its capabilities and applications.\n\n## Call for Contributions\n\nThe ECMS International Conference on Modelling and Simulation is dedicated to helping define the state of the art in different fields involved in creating, defining, and building innovative simulation systems, simulation and modelling tools and techniques, and novel applications for modelling and simulation. Prospective authors are invited to submit high-quality papers representing original results in all related areas of modelling and simulation. Published papers will be sent for indexation to DBLP, SCOPUS, ISI, INSPEC, and DOI. High-quality selected papers will be considered for publication in a focused issue with some international journals. An author of each accepted paper must register and present the paper at the conference.\n\n## Tracks\n\nThe conference will include the following tracks:\n\n*   Business Process Modelling and Simulation for Industrial Operations (BPMI)\n*   Digital Twins for Smart Industrial Systems (DTSIS)\n*   Finite Discrete Elements Simulation (FDEM)\n*   Finance, Economics and Social Sciences (FES)\n*   Modelling and Simulation of Human-Robot Interaction and Collaboration (HRIC)\n*   Logistics, Transportation and Manufacturing Applications (LTMA)\n*   Mathematical Modelling and Computer Simulations (MathMO)\n*   Open and Collaborative Models and Simulation Methods (OCMS)\n*   Resilient and Sustainable Supply Chain Modelling and Simulation (RSSC)\n*   Cybersecurity Modelling and Simulation (SecMoS)\n*   Simulation and Optimization (SIMO)\n*   Special Students’ Track on Modelling, Simulation and Visualization (SSTMSV)\n*   Modelling and Simulation for Performance Evaluation of Computer-based Systems with Data Intensive Systems (MaSPECS-DIS)\n*   Simulation and Modelling based on AI, ML and Intelligent Agents techniques (SIMAI)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission of Full-Length Papers (7-10 pages):** February 20, 2025\n*   **Notification of Paper Acceptance:** around March 15, 2025\n*   **Submission of camera-ready Paper and payment:** April 9, 2025 (no extension possible)\n*   **Conference dates in Catania, Sicily:** June 24–27, 2025\n\n## Registration Fees\n\n*   **ALL FEES need to be paid by April 9, 2025**\n\n|                | STUDENT (with proof sent) | NEW Author or Participant | RETURNING Author or Participant |\n| :------------- | :----------------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------- |\n| Author or Participant | 375€                     | 500€                       | 450€                           |\n| for a second or subsequent accepted paper of an already registered Author (no additional person attending) | 275€ for each additional accepted paper |  |  |\n| For a subsequent attending Author of an accepted paper with one already registered Author | 375€ for each additional Author of an accepted paper |  |  |\n| Paper size exceeding 7 pages | 40€ for each additional page over 7 |  |  |\n| Exhibition      | 500€                     |  |  |\n\nPrinted Proceedings with CD-version attached can be ordered on payment/registration page: 60€/each\n\n## Best Paper Awards\n\nAll submitted papers will be evaluated for the Best Conference Paper Award and Best Student Paper Award.\n\n## Publication\n\nCommunications of the ECMS is the yearly series published by the Council and collects all revised versions of the papers accepted for the Council conferences.
