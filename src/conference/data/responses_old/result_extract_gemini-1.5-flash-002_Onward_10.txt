Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven.  Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software.",
  "Call for Papers": "# Onward! 2025: Call for Papers\n\nOnward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities, and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.\n\n## The Character of Onward! Papers\n\nOnward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.\n\n## Selection Process\n\nOnward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double-blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.\n\nOnward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission.\n\n## Instructions for Authors\n\nFor fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.\n\nAuthors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/](https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Concurrent Submissions\n\nPapers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.\n\n## Policy on Double-Blind Review\n\nOnward! 2025 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:\n\n*   Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc.) from the author block of the first page of the paper.\n*   To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person.\n*   To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements.\n\nAfter submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.\n\n## Policy on Authorship Changes\n\nAny addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.\n\n## Format\n\nSubmissions should use [ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/) and 10-point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.\n\n## Page Limit\n\nTo ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self-contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)\n\n## Publication\n\n**AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:** The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAoE (UTC-12h)\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** April 24, 2025\n*   **First-round notification:** June 6, 2025\n*   **Revised submission deadline:** July 17, 2025\n*   **Final notification:** August 11, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready deadline:** August 25, 2025\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Shigeru Chiba, University of Tokyo, Japan\n*   Clemens Nylandsted Klokmose, Aarhus University, Denmark\n*   Antranig Basman, Raising the Floor - International, United Kingdom\n*   Jacques Carette, McMaster University, Canada\n*   Luke Church, University of Cambridge | Candela Inc, United Kingdom\n*   Siobhán Clarke, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland\n*   Stéphane Ducasse, Inria; University of Lille; CNRS; Centrale Lille; CRIStAL, France\n*   Elisa Gonzalez Boix, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium\n*   Philipp Haller, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden\n*   Reid Holmes, University of British Columbia, Canada\n*   Joel Jakubovic, Charles University in Prague, Czechia\n*   Jun Kato, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan\n*   Raffi Khatchadourian, CUNY Hunter College, United States\n*   Patrick Lam, University of Waterloo\n*   Daan Leijen, Microsoft Research, United States\n*   Sorin Lerner, University of California at San Diego, United States\n*   Magnus Madsen, Aarhus University, Denmark\n*   Ole Lehrmann Madsen, Aarhus University, Denmark\n*   Hidehiko Masuhara, Institute of Science Tokyo, Japan\n*   Steve Oney, University of Michigan\n*   Roly Perera, University of Cambridge/University of Bristol, United Kingdom\n*   Guillermo Polito, Univ.
