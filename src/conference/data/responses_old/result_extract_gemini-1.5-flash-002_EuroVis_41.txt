  "Call for Papers": "# EuroVis 2025: Call for Full Papers\n\nEuroVis 2025 will be held in **Luxembourg City, Luxembourg on June 2-6, 2025.**\n\nThis call invites original submissions of high-quality papers that will set the standard and stimulate future trends in the field of visualization and visual analytics. Accepted full papers will be published in a special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, the International Journal of the Eurographics Association, after a two-stage peer-reviewing process. All accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference.\n\n## Suggested Paper Types and Topics\n\n*   **Techniques:** Novel algorithms, visual encoding methods, and/or interaction techniques for data analysis, exploration, or communication.\n*   **Systems:** New software frameworks, languages, or tools for visualization; systems for large-scale visualization; integrated graphical systems for visual analysis or interactive machine learning; collaborative and web-scale visualization systems.\n*   **Applications & Design Studies:** Novel use of visualization to address problems in an application domain, including accounts of innovative system design, deployment, and impact.\n*   **Evaluation & Empirical Research:** Comparative evaluation of competing visualization approaches; controlled experiments to inform visualization best practices; longitudinal and qualitative studies to understand user needs, visualization adoption, and use.\n*   **Theory:** Models of visual encoding, interaction, and/or analysis tasks; implications from theories of perception, cognition, design, and/or aesthetics; methods for automated design or visualization recommendation.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract deadline:** November 27, 2024 (Wednesday)\n*   **Full paper deadline:** December 4, 2024 (Wednesday)\n*   **First Round Notification:** February 12, 2025 (Wednesday)\n*   **Revised Submission:** March 5, 2025 (Wednesday)\n*   **Final Notification:** March 19, 2025 (Wednesday)\n*   **Camera Ready Version:** April 16, 2025 (Wednesday)\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n*   The maximum length for submitted papers is **10 pages** (in Computer Graphics Forum (CGF) style, including all images and acknowledgements, but excluding references).\n*   References should not exceed 2 pages. Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content. Papers exceeding the maximum allowed number of pages will be automatically rejected.\n*   Submissions must be made using the Computer Graphics Forum style, using the conference LaTeX template for full papers ([https://www.eurovis2025.lu/fileadmin/files/egPublStyle-EuroVis_full-short-stars-posters-edu_2025.zip](https://www.eurovis2025.lu/fileadmin/files/egPublStyle-EuroVis_full-short-stars-posters-edu_2025.zip)).\n*   Authors have the option to submit their papers anonymously. Double-blind reviewing is optional.\n*   Authors have the option of submitting additional material with their submissions. Supplementary materials, such as videos and supporting data, are encouraged.\n*   All full papers accepted to EuroVis appear in a special issue of Computer Graphics Forum, containing the conference proceedings, and will appear at the same time in the Eurographics digital library.\n\n## Submission Platform\n\nAbstracts and full papers are submitted using the Precision Conference System (PCS): [https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions)\n\nPlease select Society: Eurographics, Conference/Journal: EuroVis 2025, Track: EuroVis 2025 Papers.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor any questions concerning full paper submissions, please contact the full papers chairs at [fullpapers@eurovis.org](mailto:fullpapers@eurovis.org).\n\n*   Wolfgang Aigner, St. PÃ¶lten University of Applied Sciences, Austria\n*   Natalia Andrienko, Fraunhofer Institute IAIS, Germany\n*   Bei Wang, University of Utah, USA"
