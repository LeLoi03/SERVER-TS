  "Call for Papers": "# CCC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Computational Complexity Conference (CCC) is an annual conference on the inherent difficulty of computational problems in terms of the resources they require.  CCC 2025 will be held from **August 5 to 8, 2025 in Toronto, Canada.**\n\n## Scope\n\nThe conference seeks original research papers in all areas of computational complexity theory, studying the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints. We welcome contributions from all topics with connections to or motivated by questions in complexity theory, broadly construed. We especially encourage submissions that address complexity-theoretic issues in complexity-adjacent areas such as coding theory, cryptography, game theory, learning, logic and privacy. Possible topics include but are not limited to:\n\n*   Complexity classes\n*   Reducibility and completeness\n*   Circuit complexity\n*   Communication complexity\n*   Algebraic complexity\n*   Proof complexity\n*   Complexity in other concrete computational models\n*   Interactive and probabilistic proof systems\n*   Logic and descriptive complexity\n*   Pseudorandomness and derandomization\n*   Average case complexity\n*   Quantum computation\n*   Parametrized complexity\n*   Fine-grained complexity\n*   Complexity-theoretic aspects of:\n    *   coding theory\n    *   cryptography\n    *   optimization (including inapproximability continuous optimization)\n    *   property testing\n    *   streaming and sublinear computation\n    *   distributed computation\n    *   game theory\n    *   machine learning\n    *   privacy\n\n## Submission\n\n**Deadlines:** Papers must be submitted electronically via submission server [here](https://ccc2025.hotcrp.com/), and received by **Friday, February 7, 2025, 23:59 AoE**. Notification of acceptance will be sent by **Friday, May 2, 2025**, and final camera-ready copies of accepted papers will be due by the **end of May, 2025**.\n\n**Format:** Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper and an abstract of 1-2 paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. A submission must contain within its first 10 pages a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including discussion of its importance, prior work, and an outline of key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims (similar to the content of a brief oral presentation). There is no bound on the total length of a submission, but material other than the abstract, references, and the first 10 pages is considered as supplementary and will be read at the committee's discretion. Submissions should include proofs of all central claims. The submission should be in single-column format, use at least 11-point font, at least 1-inch margins, and at least single-spacing between lines. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Instructions for formatting camera-ready versions will be communicated to the authors of accepted papers.\n\nThe conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. (Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.)\n\n## Additional Remarks\n\nIn addition to the submission, authors may optionally send a short email to the program committee (PC) chair at [ccc2025chair@gmail.com](mailto:ccc2025chair@gmail.com) containing any additional remarks for the PC, such as the relationship with independent/concurrent work, differences from prior versions, conflict of interest statements, or clarifications concerning prior reviews of the work. Submissions involving PC members are not allowed.\n\n## Publication\n\n*   **Online posting:** Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity ([http://eccc.hpi-web.de/eccc](http://eccc.hpi-web.de/eccc)) or the arXiv.\n*   **Proceedings:** The conference proceedings will be published under a Creative Commons BY license in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series.\n*   **Presentation:** Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the conference. The program committee will determine time allocations for presentations (between 15 and 45 minutes).\n\n## Awards\n\n*   **EATCS Luca Trevisan award for the CCC best student paper:** This award will be given to the best paper written solely by one or more students as judged by the program committee.\n*   **Best paper award:** This award will be given to the best paper submitted to the conference as judged by the program committee.\n*   **Special journal issue:** The program committee will invite full versions of a select number of conference submissions to a special issue of the journal Computational Complexity.\n\n## Conference Information\n\n*   **Dates and location:** The conference will be held from **Tuesday, August 5 to Friday, August 8, 2025 in Toronto, Canada.**\n*   **Travel allowances:** Travel allowances will be offered to students and post-doctoral fellows.\n*   **Visas:** A visa for Canada may be needed for attending the conference.\n*   **Code of conduct:** CCC 2025 is a participant in the SafeTOC initiative.\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Paul Beame, University of Washington\n*   Anna Gál, University of Texas at Austin\n*   Sumegha Garg, Rutgers University\n*   Joshua Grochow, University of Colorado Boulder\n*   Shuichi Hirahara, National Institute of Informatics\n*   Holger Dell, Goethe-Universität Frankfurt and IT University of Copenhagen\n*   Igor Carboni Oliveira, University of Warwick\n*   Amir Shpilka, Tel Aviv University\n*   Makrand Sinha, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign\n*   Srikanth Srinivasan (Chair), University of Copenhagen and IIT Bombay\n*   Avishay Tal, University of California Berkeley\n*   Madhur Tulsiani, Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago\n\n## Local Arrangements Committee\n\n*   Swastik Kopparty (Chair), University of Toronto\n*   Benjamin Rossman, Duke University\n\n## Contact\n\nPlease contact [Srikanth Srinivasan](mailto:ccc2025chair@gmail.com)."
