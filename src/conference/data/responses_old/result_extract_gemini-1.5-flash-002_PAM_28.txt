  "Call for Papers": "# PAM 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Passive and Active Measurement (PAM) conference brings together researchers and operators to discuss novel and emerging work in the area of network measurement and analysis. PAM 2025 will be held **virtually**.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nOriginal contributions that advance the state-of-the-art in the following areas are invited:\n\n*   Applications (e.g., web, streaming, games)\n*   Data centers and cloud computing\n*   Energy\n*   IoT (e.g., smart home, SCADA, ICS, embedded systems)\n*   Measurement tools and software\n*   Network security\n*   User privacy\n*   Overlays (e.g., P2P, CDNs)\n*   Physical Layer\n*   Routing\n*   Social networks\n*   Topology\n*   Transport/congestion control\n*   User behavior and experience, QoE\n*   Virtualization (e.g., SDN, NFV)\n*   Visualization\n*   Wireless, cellular, and mobile\n\n### Replicability and Reproducibility Track\n\nPAM 2025 will trial a new Replicability and Reproducibility Track for submissions that aim to reproduce or replicate results that have been previously published at PAM, TMA, IMC or the measurements track at SIGCOMM, CoNEXT, SIGMETRICS or other networking conferences. For the definitions of replicability and reproducibility, please see ACM’s site.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAuthors should only submit original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. PAM welcomes both short and long submissions. This includes early-stage contributions of work that is less mature but shows exciting promise, articulates a high-level vision, and describes challenging future directions for the community or validates, verifies important results, or presents new ideas that challenge existing assumptions.\n\nSubmissions should describe original research, with succinctness appropriate to the topics and themes they discuss. We will consider paper submissions that extend previously published short, or preliminary papers (including PAM short papers), following the model of the ACM SIGCOMM policy.\n\n## Submission Requirements\n\nAll submissions must satisfy the following requirements:\n\n*   Follow Springer LNCS format\n*   Short papers: Up to 11 pages for technical content (up to 5 pages for appendices and references)\n*   Long papers: Up to 24 pages for technical content (up to 5 pages for appendices and references)\n*   Anonymization: Reviewing will be double-blind\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\nEthics will be considered during the review process. Each paper must include a statement detailing the ethical considerations of the work. If the authors believe the submission does not raise ethical concerns, authors must indicate so in a short statement that is clearly marked in the paper.\n\n## Awards\n\nThere will be two awards for papers of exceptional merit:\n\n*   The Best Paper Award\n*   The Community Contribution Award\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper registration:** October 1, 2024 AoE (October 2nd 11:59:59 AM UTC)\n*   **Paper submission:** October 8, 2024 AoE (October 9th 11:59:59 AM UTC)\n*   **Notification:** November 14, 2024\n*   **Camera-ready due:** December 10, 2024\n*   **Conference:** March 10-12, 2025\n\n## Submission Portal\n\n[Submit via HotCRP](https://hotcrp.dacs.utwente.nl/pam2025/)"
