  "Call for Papers": "# FSCD 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 10th International Conference on Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction (FSCD 2025) will be held in **Birmingham, UK, from Tuesday 15 - Friday 18 July, 2025**, with workshops on **Monday 14 and Saturday 19 - Sunday 20**. The conference is held in co-operation with ACM SIGLOG.\n\n## Overview\n\nFSCD covers all aspects of formal structures for computation and deduction, from theoretical foundations to applications. Building on two communities, RTA (Rewriting Techniques and Applications) and TLCA (Typed Lambda Calculi and Applications), FSCD embraces their core topics and broadens their scope to closely related areas in logic, models of computation, semantics and verification in new challenging areas.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe suggested, but not exclusive, list of topics for submission is:\n\n### Calculi\n\n*   Rewriting systems (string, term, higher-order, nominal, graph, conditional, modulo, infinitary, etc.)\n*   Lambda calculus\n*   Logics (first-order, higher-order, equational, modal, linear, classical, constructive, etc.)\n*   Proof theory (natural deduction, sequent calculus, proof nets, etc.)\n*   Type theory and logical frameworks\n*   Homotopy type theory\n*   Process algebras (synchronous, asynchronous, static and dynamic semantics with and without time, etc.)\n*   Quantum calculi\n\n### Methods in Computation and Deduction\n\n*   Type systems (polymorphism, dependent, recursive, intersection, session, etc.)\n*   Induction, coinduction\n*   Matching, unification, completion, orderings\n*   Strategies (normalisation, completeness, etc.)\n*   Tree automata\n*   Model building and model checking\n*   Proof search and theorem proving\n*   Constraint solving and decision procedures\n\n### Semantics\n\n*   Operational semantics and abstract machines\n*   Game Semantics and applications\n*   Domain theory and categorical models\n*   Quantitative models (timing, probabilities, etc.)\n*   Quantum computation and emerging models of computation\n\n### Algorithmic Analysis and Transformations of Formal Systems\n\n*   Type inference and type checking\n*   Abstract Interpretation\n*   Complexity analysis and implicit computational complexity\n*   Checking termination, confluence, derivational complexity and related properties\n*   Symbolic computation\n\n### Tools and Applications\n\n*   Programming and proof environments\n*   Verification tools\n*   Proof assistants and interactive theorem provers\n*   Applications in industry\n*   Applications of formal systems in other sciences\n*   Applications of formal systems in education\n\n### Formal Systems for Modelling and Verification in new challenging areas\n\n*   Certification\n*   Security\n*   Blockchain\n*   Databases\n*   Deep learning and machine learning algorithms\n*   Planning\n\n## Publication\n\nThe proceedings will be published as an electronic volume in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) of Schloss Dagstuhl. All LIPIcs proceedings are open access.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Submissions must be formatted using the [LIPIcs style files](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author) and submitted via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fscd2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fscd2025).\n*   Submissions can be made in two categories: Regular research papers (limited to 15 pages, excluding references and appendices) and System descriptions (limited to 15 pages, excluding references).\n*   One author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the work in person at the conference. Online presentation will be arranged if in-person attendance is impossible, but in-person registration will still be required.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are midnight anywhere-on-earth (AoE); late submissions will not be considered.\n\n*   **Abstract:** February 17, 2025 (extended)\n*   **Submission:** February 22, 2025 (extended)\n*   **Rebuttal:** April 7-11, 2025\n*   **Notification:** April 30, 2025\n*   **Final version:** May 14, 2025\n\n## Invited Speakers\n\n*   Liron Cohen (Ben-Gurion University)\n*   Mariangiola Dezani (University of Torino)\n*   Ekaterina Komendantskaya (University of Southampton)\n*   Jose Meseguer (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign)\n\n## Programme Committee Chair\n\nMaribel Fernandez, King's College London, UK\n\n## Workshops\n\nSee the [Workshops](cfw.htm) page for details on the scheduled workshops."
