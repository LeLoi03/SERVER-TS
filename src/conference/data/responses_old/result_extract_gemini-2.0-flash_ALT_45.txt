  "Call for Papers": "# ALT 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Algorithmic Learning Theory (ALT) 2025 conference will be held in **Milan, Italy on February 24-27, 2025**.\n\nThe conference is dedicated to all theoretical and algorithmic aspects of machine learning.\n\n## Topics\n\nWe invite submissions with contributions to new or existing learning problems including, but not limited to:\n\n*   Design and analysis of learning algorithms.\n*   Statistical and computational learning theory.\n*   Online learning algorithms and theory.\n*   Optimization methods for learning.\n*   Unsupervised, semi-supervised, and active learning.\n*   Interactive learning, planning and control, and reinforcement learning.\n*   Privacy-preserving data analysis.\n*   Learning with additional societal and strategic considerations: e.g., fairness, economics.\n*   Robustness of learning algorithms to adversarial agents.\n*   Artificial neural networks, including deep learning.\n*   High-dimensional and non-parametric statistics.\n*   Adaptive data analysis and selective inference.\n*   Learning with algebraic or combinatorial structure.\n*   Bayesian methods in learning.\n*   Learning in distributed and streaming settings.\n*   Game theory and learning.\n*   Learning from complex data: e.g., networks, time series.\n\nWhile the primary focus of the conference is theoretical, authors are welcome to support their analysis by including relevant experimental results.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** October 1, 2024, 6 PM ET\n*   **Author feedback:** November 18-24, 2024\n*   **Author notification:** December 20, 2024\n\n## Conference Format\n\nThe conference will be in-person and will not be hybrid. At least one author of each accepted paper will be required to present their paper in-person at the conference. When travel is not possible, we encourage authors to find alternative presenters in the community attending the conference.\n\n## Dual Submission Policy\n\n*   Conferences: Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings may not be submitted to ALT.\n*   Journals: Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that are already published in a journal at the time of submission may not be submitted to ALT.\n\n## Rebuttal Phase\n\nThis year there will be a rebuttal phase during the review process. Authors will have an opportunity to provide a short response to the initial reviews.\n\n## Awards\n\nAwards may be given to outstanding papers. Primary authors who are full-time students are eligible for student paper awards, and they should indicate if they wish their paper to be considered for such an award.\n\n## Contact\n\nAll questions about submissions should be emailed to the PC chairs at [alt2025pc@gmail.com](mailto:alt2025pc@gmail.com)."
