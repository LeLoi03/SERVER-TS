  "Call for Papers": "# NeurIPS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) will be held at the **San Diego Convention Center from Tuesday, December 2nd through Sunday, December 7th, 2025**.\n\nNeurIPS is an interdisciplinary conference that brings together researchers in machine learning, neuroscience, statistics, optimization, computer vision, natural language processing, life sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, and other adjacent fields.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe invite submissions presenting new and original research on topics including, but not limited to, the following:\n\n*   Applications (e.g., vision, language, speech and audio, Creative AI)\n*   Deep learning (e.g., architectures, generative models, optimization for deep networks, foundation models, LLMs)\n*   Evaluation (e.g., methodology, meta studies, replicability and validity, human-in-the-loop)\n*   General machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, online, active, etc.)\n*   Infrastructure (e.g., libraries, improved implementation and scalability, distributed solutions)\n*   Machine learning for sciences (e.g., climate, health, life sciences, physics, social sciences)\n*   Neuroscience and cognitive science (e.g., neural coding, brain-computer interfaces)\n*   Optimization (e.g., convex and non-convex, stochastic, robust)\n*   Probabilistic methods (e.g., variational inference, causal inference, Gaussian processes)\n*   Reinforcement learning (e.g., decision and control, planning, hierarchical RL, robotics)\n*   Social and economic aspects of machine learning (e.g., fairness, interpretability, human-AI interaction, privacy, safety, strategic behavior)\n*   Theory (e.g., control theory, learning theory, algorithmic game theory)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper Submissions Open:** April 3, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Paper Abstract Submission Deadline:** May 11, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Full Paper Submission Deadline:** May 15, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Paper Supplemental Material Submission Deadline:** May 22, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Paper Author Notifications:** September 18, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Paper Camera Ready Deadline:** October 23, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Registration Open:** February 27, 2025\n*   **Early Registration Deadline:** October 11, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   All submissions must be in PDF format and must be anonymized to meet the double-blind reviewing policy requirements.\n*   The main text of a submitted paper is limited to nine content pages, including all figures and tables. Additional pages containing references, checklist, and the optional technical appendices do not count as content pages. If your submission is accepted, you will be allowed an additional content page for the camera-ready version.\n*   You must format your submission using the NeurIPS 2025 LaTeX style file, which includes a \"preprint\" option for non-anonymous preprints posted online.\n*   All submissions must include a completed paper checklist.\n*   Technical appendices and supplementary material may be submitted separately.\n*   Authors are responsible for following the NeurIPS policy for the use of Large Language Models (LLMs).\n*   The OpenReview profiles must be up to date, with all publications by the authors, and their current affiliations.\n*   Submissions without the authors' updated OpenReview profiles will be desk rejected.\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference)\n\n## Datasets & Benchmarks\n\nPlease refer to the [Datasets and Benchmarks CFP](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks) for details on track-specific requirements.\n\n## Position Papers\n\nPlease refer to the [Position Papers CFP](/Conferences/2025/CallForPositionPapers) for more details."
