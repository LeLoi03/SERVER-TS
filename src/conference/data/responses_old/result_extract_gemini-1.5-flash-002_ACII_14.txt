  "Summary": "The 13th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII 2025) will be held in Canberra, Australia, from October 8-11, 2025. Organized by the Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC), ACII is a premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on systems that can recognize, interpret, and simulate human emotions and affective phenomena. The theme for ACII 2025 is Socially Responsible Affective Computing.",
  "Call for Papers": "# ACII 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 13th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII 2025) will be held in **Canberra, Australia, 8-11 October 2025**.\n\nACII 2025 will be an **in-person event** held at the **Hotel Realm** conference venue in Canberra, Australia.\n\nThe ACII conference series is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognise, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena.\n\nThe theme for ACII 2025 is **Socially Responsible Affective Computing**.\n\nACII 2025 will be held just before the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction ([ICMI 2025](https://icmi.acm.org/2025/), 13-17 Oct 2025) at the same venue.\n\n## Publication\n\nAll accepted papers will be included in **IEEE Xplore** (subject to approval by the IEEE Computer Society) and indexed by **EI**. A selection of the best articles at ACII 2025 will be invited to submit extended versions to the **IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing**.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Recognition and Synthesis of Human Affect from ALL Modalities\n*   Multimodal Modeling of Cognitive and Affective States\n*   Contextualized Modeling of Cognitive and Affective States\n*   Facial and Body Gesture Recognition, Modeling and Animation\n*   Affective Speech Analysis, Recognition and Synthesis\n*   Recognition and Synthesis of Auditory Affect Bursts (Laughter, Cries, etc.)\n*   Motion Capture for Affect Recognition\n*   Affect Recognition from Alternative Modalities (Physiology, Brain Waves, etc.)\n*   Affective Text Processing and Sentiment Analysis\n*   Multimodal Data Fusion for Affect Recognition\n*   Synthesis of Multimodal Affective Behaviour\n*   Summarisation of Affective Behaviour\n*   Affective Science using Affective Computing Tools\n*   Studies of affective behavior perception using computational tools\n*   Studies of affective behavior production using computational tools\n*   Studies of affect in medical/clinical settings using computational tools\n*   Studies of affect in context using computational tools\n*   Psychology & Cognition of Affect in Designing Computational Systems\n*   Computational Models of Affective Processes\n*   Issues in Psychology & Cognition of Affect in Affective Computing Systems\n*   Cultural Differences in Affective Design and Interaction\n*   Affective Interfaces\n*   Interfaces for Monitoring and Improving Mental and Physical Well-Being\n*   Design of Affective Loop and Affective Dialogue Systems\n*   Human-Centred Human-Behaviour-Adaptive Interfaces\n*   Interfaces for Attentive & Intelligent Environments\n*   Mobile, Tangible and Virtual/Augmented Multimodal Proactive Interfaces\n*   Distributed/Collaborative Multimodal Proactive Interfaces\n*   Tools and System Design Issues for Building Affective and Proactive Interfaces\n*   Evaluation of Affective, Behavioural, and Proactive Interfaces\n*   Affective, Social and Inclusive Robotics and Virtual Agents\n*   Artificial Agents for Supporting Mental and Physical Well-Being\n*   Emotion in Robot and Virtual Agent Cognition and Action\n*   Embodied Emotion\n*   Biologically-Inspired Architectures for Affective and Social Robotics\n*   Developmental and Evolutionary Models for Affective and Social Robotics\n*   Models of Emotion for Embodied Conversational Agents\n*   Personality in Embodied Conversational Agents\n*   Memory, Reasoning, and Learning in Affective Conversational Agents\n*   Affect and Group Emotions\n*   Analyzing and modeling groups taking into account emergent states and/or emotions\n*   Integration of artificial agents (robots, virtual characters) in the group life by leveraging its affective loop: interaction paradigms, strategies, modalities, adaptation\n*   Collaborative affective interfaces (e.g., for inclusion, for education, for games and entertainment)\n*   Open Resources for Affective Computing\n*   Shared Datasets for Affective Computing\n*   Benchmarks for Affective Computing\n*   Open-source Software/Tools for Affective Computing\n*   Fairness, Accountability, Privacy, Transparency and Ethics in Affective Computing\n*   Bias, imbalance and inequalities in data and modeling approaches in the context of Affective Computing\n*   Bias mitigation in the context of Affective Computing\n*   Explainability and Transparency in the context of Affective Computing\n*   Privacy-preserving affect sensing and modeling\n*   Ethical aspects in the context of Affective Computing\n*   Applications\n*   Health and well-being\n*   Education\n*   Entertainment\n*   Consumer Products\n*   User Experience\n\n## Important Dates\n\nThe time zone for the deadlines below is Anywhere on Earth (AOE).\n\n### Main Track\n\n*   **Main track full paper submission deadline:** April 9, 2025 (Extended)\n*   **Rebuttal period:** May 31 – June 4, 2025\n*   **Paper notification for the main track:** June 19, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready paper submission deadline:** July 19, 2025\n*   **Main conference:** October 8 – 10, 2025\n\n### Tutorials\n\n*   **Tutorial proposal submission deadline:** April 16, 2025\n*   **Tutorial acceptance notification:** June 11, 2025\n\n### Workshops and Challenges\n\n*   **Submission deadline for workshop proposals:** February 28, 2025\n*   **Notification for workshop proposals:** March 14, 2025\n*   **Paper submission deadline for workshops:** June 30, 2025\n*   **Workshop papers decision notification:** July 28, 2025\n*   **Workshop camera-ready deadline:** August 20, 2025\n\n### Tutorials, Workshops, and Doctoral Consortium\n\n*   **Tutorials, Workshops, and Doctoral Consortium:** October 11, 2025"
