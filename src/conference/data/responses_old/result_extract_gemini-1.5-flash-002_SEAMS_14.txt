  "Call for Papers": "# SEAMS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 20th International Conference on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS 2025) will be held in **Ottawa, Ontario, Canada from April 28-29, 2025**.\n\nSEAMS is a CORE-A ranked conference that applies software engineering methods, techniques, processes, and tools to support the construction of safe, performant, and cost-effective self-adaptive and autonomous systems that provide self-* properties like self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization, and self-protection.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe welcome research contributions to all topics related to engineering self-adaptive and self-managing systems, including:\n\n*   Foundational concepts\n*   Self-* properties\n*   Uncertainty\n*   Runtime models and variability\n*   Mixed-initiative and human-in-the-loop/human-on-the-loop\n*   Ethical challenges\n*   Adaptation vs evolution\n*   Engineering strategies\n*   AI and machine learning\n*   Automatic synthesis techniques\n*   Control theory\n*   Search-based techniques\n*   Model checking\n*   Simulation and digital twins\n*   Human-centered software development\n*   Engineering activities\n*   Domain/environment analysis\n*   Requirements elicitation\n*   Security and privacy\n*   Architecture and design\n*   Testing and assurances\n*   Automated maintenance\n*   Systematic reuse\n*   Processes and methodologies\n*   Self-adaptation for software engineering\n*   Languages\n*   Formal notations for self-* properties\n*   Domain-specific languages\n*   Programming language support\n\nApplication areas and domains include, but are not limited to, the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, cloud/fog/edge/mobile computing, bioengineering, robotics, smart environments, smart user interfaces, web/service-based applications, and automotive.\n\n## Types of Papers\n\nWe solicit two types of papers:\n\n*   **Research papers:** 10 pages of content + 2 pages of references: papers offering novel and mature research contributions and experiences gained from applying or evaluating research results in practice.\n*   **Short papers:** 6 pages of content + 1 page of references: papers presenting ongoing research or new research ideas without a complete evaluation.\n\n## Community Debate Proposals\n\nWe plan to complement the SEAMS 2025 program of research and short paper presentations with a community debate. We now call for proposals for the debate.\n\n*   **Community debate proposals:** 1-page proposal, possibly with a supporting video: proposals suggesting a topic of the debate, and the chair(s) who will be in charge of organizing and moderating the debate at SEAMS 2025 if the proposal is accepted.\n\n## Submission and Important Dates\n\nSEAMS 2025 will use two submission rounds for the Research Track, with firm deadlines in October 2024 and December 2024, and with the possibility of submitting a revised version from the first round to the second as detailed below.\n\n### First Submission Round\n\n*   **Abstract deadline:** October 1, 2024\n*   **Paper submission due:** October 8, 2024\n*   **Notification of decision:** November 11, 2024\n\n### Second Submission Round\n\n*   **Abstract deadline for new submissions:** December 6, 2024\n*   **Paper, new and revised 1st papers submission due:** December 13, 2024\n*   **Notification of decision:** January 14, 2025\n\n### All Rounds\n\n*   **Camera Ready:** January 28, 2025\n\n## Author Responses\n\nAuthors of papers that receive “Revision” decisions in the first round will have the opportunity to submit a revised version of their papers to the second round. The authors are required to provide a response letter that (1) explains how the comments have been tackled, (2) provides answers to the questions posed by reviewers.\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nSubmissions to SEAMS 2025 must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template. Submissions must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above. Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review.\n\nThe SEAMS 2025 Research Track will use a lightweight double-anonymous review process. No submission may reveal its authors’ identities.\n\n## Notification and Publication\n\nAccepted papers will appear in the SEAMS 2025 proceedings that will be published in the IEEE and ACM digital libraries. Authors of selected Research papers will be invited to submit revised and extended versions of their work to a dedicated Special Issue of ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems (TAAS).\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://seams25.hotcrp.com/](https://seams25.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   **Program Co-Chair:** Shiva Nejati, University of Ottawa, Canada\n*   **Program Co-Chair:** Thomas Vogel, Humboldt-Universtität zu Berlin, Germany"
