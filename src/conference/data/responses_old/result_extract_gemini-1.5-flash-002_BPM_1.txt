  "Summary": "The 23rd International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM 2025) will be held in Seville, Spain from August 31 to September 5, 2025. BPM 2025 continues the tradition of providing the premier forum for researchers and practitioners in Business Process Management.",
  "Call for Papers": "# BPM 2025: Call for Research Papers\n\nThe International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM) is the premium forum for researchers and practitioners in the field of BPM. The conference embraces the interdisciplinary nature of BPM to its fullest extent. The objective is to enhance or refine the existing portfolio of theories, methods, and tools for managing and improving business processes.\n\n## Tracks\n\nTo accommodate the diversity of contributions, the BPM conference is structured into three tracks: Foundations, Engineering, and Management. Each track covers different phenomena of interest and research methods. Accordingly, each track has specific evaluation criteria, a separate track chair, and a dedicated program committee. The track chairs work together with the consolidation chair to align the tracks with each other.\n\n### Track I: Foundations\n\nTrack I invites papers that have a foundational nature, that is, a formal, mathematical, algorithmic, or conceptual nature. It focuses on (i) papers investigating the underlying principles of BPM, computational theories, formal methods, and algorithms for modeling, automating, analyzing, and optimizing business processes; (ii) papers identifying novel problems, novel modeling languages, architectures, and other concepts underlying process-aware information systems, as well as conceptual papers on frameworks, taxonomies, patterns, and that investigate problems in the design of BPM systems.\n\n### Track II: Engineering\n\nTrack II invites papers that deal with engineering aspects of BPM research. The focus is on the development and investigation of artifacts and systems that aim to solve concrete problems in business environments. This track covers tools and techniques for process modeling, the enactment of process models, as well as process monitoring and analytics (including process mining techniques). It includes the usage of such artifacts and systems in particular domains, such as digital health, smart mobility, logistics, or smart government. It also addresses aspects related to the interaction between processes and software infrastructure and services.\n\n### Track III: Management\n\nTrack III invites papers that focus on the empirical, socio-technical, cognitive, psychological, managerial, and societal aspects of BPM. This includes all techniques, tools, and methods that are employed in and across organizations to better govern business processes. Research papers that are submitted to this track aim to advance our understanding of how process management (and mining) concepts, along with the underlying information systems, can deliver business value.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper Abstract submission:** March 4, 2025\n*   **Paper submission:** March 18, 2025\n*   **Notification to authors:** May 8, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready submission:** June 13, 2025\n\n**Deadlines correspond to Anywhere on Earth (AoE or UTC-12).**\n\n## Submission\n\nEach paper must be submitted to exactly one track. Papers must be formatted according to Springerâ€™s LNCS formatting guidelines. Submissions must be in English and cannot exceed 16 pages including references and appendices. The title page must contain a short abstract clarifying the relation of the paper with the topics above. The paper must state the problem being addressed, the goal of the work, the results achieved, and the relation to other work.\n\nSubmissions must be original contributions that have neither been published previously nor submitted to other conferences or journals while being submitted to BPM 2025.\n\nPapers should be submitted electronically in PDF format via the BPM 2025 EasyChair submission site: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2025)\n\n## Awards\n\nThe BPM conference will recognize the best papers submitted to the conference with an award in two different categories:\n\n*   Best paper award\n*   Best student paper award\n\n## BPM Forum\n\nPapers that do not fully meet the quality criteria for the main conference, but make a significant contribution to the community, will be invited for presentation at the BPM Forum. These papers will be published in full length in a separate post-proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP) series. They will be presented during the main conference.\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n*   Hajo Reijers, Utrecht University, The Netherlands (Consolidation Chair)\n*   Arik Senderovich, York University, Canada (Track Chair, Foundations Track)\n*   Cristina Cabanillas, Universidad de Sevilla, Spain (Track Chair, Engineering Track)\n*   Irene Vanderfeesten, KU Leuven, Belgium (Track Chair, Management Track)"
