Authors are requested to submit PDF documents in a special format, which should have a visual in the upper half of a page and the explanatory text in the lower half and must not exceed twenty (20) annotated visuals, including title and references. Innovation papers will be included in conference proceedings but will NOT be submitted to any A&I databases. The copyright of accepted papers will belong to the author(s). The author(s) may transfer the copyright to a journal publisher if the same content or its extended version is submitted separately to a journal.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** May 26, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** July 14, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready paper submission:** August 4, 2025\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nAll submissions should go through EDAS: [https://apnoms2025.edas.info/](https://apnoms2025.edas.info/)\n\n## Contact Information\n\n[apnoms2025@gmail.com](mailto:apnoms2025@gmail.com)\n\n## TPC Co-Chairs\n\n*   Meng-Shiuan Pan (National Taipei University of Technology, Taiwan) [mspan@ntut.edu.tw](mailto:mspan@ntut.edu.tw)\n*   Cheng Zhang (Ibaraki University, Japan) [cheng.zhang.abbott@vc.ibaraki.ac.jp](mailto:cheng.zhang.abbott@vc.ibaraki.ac.jp)\n*   Seung-Joon Seok (Kyungnam University, Korea) [sjseok@kyungnam.ac.kr](mailto:sjseok@kyungnam.ac.kr)"
