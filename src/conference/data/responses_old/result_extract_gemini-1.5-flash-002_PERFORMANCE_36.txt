  "Call for Papers": "# IFIP PERFORMANCE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe IFIP Performance 2025 conference will be held at **CWI in Amsterdam on November 11-14, 2025.**  The conference aims to bring together researchers interested in understanding and improving the performance of computing and communication systems using state-of-the-art quantitative models and solution techniques.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe invite submissions of research papers focusing on algorithm design, mathematical analysis and modeling, simulation, and measurement techniques for computer systems and communication networks. We particularly welcome contributions that introduce novel performance evaluation methods or creatively apply existing techniques to predict or gain insights into key design trade-offs across a wide range of computing, networked, and cyber-physical systems. These include mobile devices, Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, and large-scale cloud computing environments. Submissions of reproducible experiments are also encouraged.\n\n## Submission Categories\n\nWe accept the submission of original and unpublished work in two categories:\n\n*   **Regular papers:** 20 pages\n*   **Short papers:** 10 pages\n\n## Submission Platform\n\nSubmissions should be made on the online platform: [https://performance2025.hotcrp.com/](https://performance2025.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   Submission site opens: May 1, 2025\n*   Abstract submission: May 25, 2025\n*   Full paper submission: June 1, 2025\n*   Notification to authors: July 30, 2025\n\n## Paper Submission\n\n### Format of regular paper submissions\n\nRegular papers should not exceed 20 pages for technical content, including all tables and figures (references are excluded from the page limit). Authors are recommended to use the Elsevier article class `elsarticle.cls` (with the `3p` document class option) to prepare their manuscript and BibTeX to generate their bibliography. See also the guide for authors: [https://www.elsevier.com/journals/performance-evaluation/0166-5316/guide-for-authors](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/performance-evaluation/0166-5316/guide-for-authors).\n\nAuthors may include an appendix (of unrestricted length) but only to justify the technical correctness of the claims stated in the main paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. However, the appendix should serve as supplementary material only, as reviewers will evaluate the novelty and significance of the submission based on the main content of the paper and are not obligated to review the appendix.\n\n### Format of short paper submissions\n\nShort papers are limited to 10 pages for technical content, including all tables and figures (references are excluded from the page limit). Authors may include an appendix (of unrestricted length) but only to justify the technical correctness of the claims stated in the main paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. However, the appendix should serve as supplementary material only, as reviewers will evaluate the novelty and significance of the submission based on the main content of the paper and are not obligated to review the appendix.\n\nAccepted short papers will be published in a special ACM Performance Evaluation Review (PER) issue. Please find the style files [here](https://performance2025.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/1).\n\n### Instructions for all submissions\n\nPapers must be submitted through the [hotCRP platform](https://performance2025.hotcrp.com/) in printable PDF form. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review.\n\nAll submissions will be reviewed using a double-blind review process. The identity of authors and referees will not be revealed to each other.\n\n## Tracks\n\nIFIP Performance uses “soft” tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions.  Regardless of the selected track, all submissions will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element.\n\n*   Learning\n*   Measurement & Applied Modelling\n*   Systems\n*   Theory\n\n## Special Issues\n\nBy default, accepted regular papers will be published in a special Performance Evaluation (PEVA) issue. Additionally, an extended abstract will be published in a special ACM Performance Evaluation Review (PER) issue. However, authors may opt-out of publication in PEVA in favor of an expedited review process in journals related to Performance Evaluation and Operations Research.\n\nThe following journals will provide an expedited review process of accepted papers:\n\n*   [ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems (ToMPECS)](https://tompecs.acm.org/)\n*   Queueing Systems: Theory and Application (QUESTA)\n*   Stochastic Models\n\n## Policies\n\n### Anonymity Guidelines\n\nIFIP Performance is double-blind, meaning that authors should make a good-faith effort to anonymize papers.  Specifically, please take the following steps when preparing your submission:\n\n*   Remove authors’ names and affiliations from the title page.\n*   Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources.\n*   Use care in naming your files.\n*   Use care when referring to related work, particularly your own.\n*   If you need to reference another submission at IFIP Performance on a related topic, reference it as follows: “A related paper describes the design and implementation of our compiler [Anonymous 2023].” with the corresponding citation: “[Anonymous 2023] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing.”\n*   If you cite anonymous work, you should also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chairs in a separate email.\n\n### Further Considerations\n\n*   The list of authors is expected to remain the same for accepted papers between the submission stage and the final camera-ready stage. However, the PC Chairs must be notified if such a change is desired.\n*   The paper must have a substantive title and abstract. Placeholders are not allowed after the registration deadline. Any submission that does not have a substantive title and abstract by the registration deadline will be rejected without further notice.\n*   Submissions must present original research. However, previous publication of preliminary work as an extended abstract at a workshop is acceptable as long as the submission includes substantial new material.\n*   Simultaneous submissions are not allowed.\n*   Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential before publication.\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\nPapers describing experiments with users or user data should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence, minimal risk, voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues.\n\n## Diversity & Inclusiveness\n\nAs part of our efforts to foster diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or conference presentation."
