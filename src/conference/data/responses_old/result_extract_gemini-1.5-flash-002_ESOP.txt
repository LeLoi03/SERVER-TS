  "Call for Papers": "# ESOP 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 34th European Symposium on Programming (ESOP 2025) will take place from **March 29 to April 2, 2025, in Coimbra, Portugal.**\n\nESOP is an annual conference devoted to fundamental issues in the specification, design, analysis, and implementation of programming languages and systems.\n\n## Scope\n\nESOP seeks contributions on all aspects of programming language research, including, but not limited to:\n\n*   Programming paradigms and styles\n*   Methods and tools to specify and reason about programs and languages\n*   Programming language foundations\n*   Methods and tools for implementation, concurrency, and distribution\n*   Applications and emerging topics\n\nContributions bridging the gap between theory and practice are particularly welcome.\n\n## Submission Categories\n\nESOP 2025 solicits three forms of contributions:\n\n*   **Research Papers:** Articles that advance the state-of-the-art on the theory and practice of programming languages and systems. Submitted research papers may be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, ACM’s PACMPL, or ACM’s TOPLAS format. Camera-ready papers may not exceed 25 pages (excluding bibliography) and must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS.\n*   **Experience Reports:** Articles reporting on systems and techniques developed in practice, such as artifacts, tools, mechanized proofs, and educational systems, both in academic and industrial settings. These articles must include a critical evaluation of the experience reported. Submitted and camera-ready experience report papers must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, not exceeding 15 pages (excluding bibliography).\n*   **Fresh Perspectives:** Articles that promote new insights on programming languages and systems in a particularly elegant way.  Submitted and camera-ready fresh perspective papers must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, not exceeding 15 pages (excluding bibliography).\n\nThe paper review process will be double-blind. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions.\n\n## Submission Rounds\n\nESOP 2025 features a two-round submission scheme:\n\n### Round 1\n\n*   Submission deadline: May 30, 2024\n*   Rebuttal: July 23-25, 2024\n*   Notification: August 8, 2024\n\n### Round 2\n\n*   Submission deadline: October 10, 2024 (submitted papers can be polished until October 14 23:59, AoE)\n*   Rebuttal: December 3-5, 2024\n*   Notification: December 19, 2024\n\n## Journal-First Submissions\n\nESOP research papers submitted by the round 1 deadline are eligible to the Journal First channel, if marked so at submission time. The requirements of TOPLAS apply to these submissions. Accepted Journal First papers will appear in the ESOP proceedings as a 3-page extended abstract (excluding bibliography), will be presented at the conference, and published at TOPLAS.\n\n## Journal-After Submissions\n\nRevised and expanded versions of accepted ESOP research papers are eligible for the ESOP Journal-After TOPLAS channel. A call will open in January at a predefined date after the ESOP notification, and to which all accepted papers may apply.\n\n## Artifact Evaluation\n\nESOP 2025 will have a post-paper-acceptance voluntary artifact evaluation. Authors will be encouraged to submit artifacts for evaluation after paper notification. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision. Note: artifacts may be submitted with an accompanying short 5-page experience report (including 1-page bibliography), that will appear in the conference proceedings.\n\n## Submission\n\nThe papers can be submitted [here](https://esop25.mpi-sws.org)."
