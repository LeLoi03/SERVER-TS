  "Call for Papers": "# MUM 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 24th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia (MUM 2025) will be held in **Enna, Italy, from December 1-4, 2025**.\n\nMUM is an interdisciplinary forum for advances in research of mobile and ubiquitous multimedia systems, applications, and services. At MUM, academics and practitioners discuss challenges and achievements in this field from diverse perspectives, such as interaction techniques, user research, system development, software solutions, and devices. This edition of MUM aims to continue the tradition of innovation and excellence in research established by previous MUM conferences.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe welcome submissions of high-quality papers that offer original and unpublished contributions relevant to mobile and ubiquitous multimedia. Paper topics include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n*   Prototypes and systems tackling relevant technical challenges\n*   Novel applications for mobile and ubiquitous gaming, learning, entertainment, social networking, and advertising\n*   Augmented, mixed, and virtual reality systems and applications\n*   Case studies, field trials, or user experience evaluations of new applications and services\n*   Context-aware and location-based mobile and ubiquitous services\n*   Metrics and measures for evaluating and testing mobile and ubiquitous systems\n*   Privacy and security-related challenges to multimedia systems\n*   Social implications of mobile and ubiquitous multimedia systems\n*   Interaction and collaboration with human-centered AI systems\n*   Tools and development environments for building mobile, wearable, and ubiquitous multimedia systems\n*   User interfaces, interaction design, and interaction techniques for mobile and ubiquitous systems\n*   Interaction design for automotive and other modes of transportation\n*   Fabrication and device prototyping\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n### Novelty\n\nThe submission must be original work. It cannot have been published elsewhere nor be under concurrent review for publication by another conference or journal. Papers should be grounded in existing literature and knowledge and written for an interdisciplinary audience.\n\n### Length and Contribution\n\nSubmissions can be of variable length. The paper length must match the contribution. Using the single-column format, the maximum length for a full paper is 16 pages (excluding references) and the maximum length for a short paper is 7 pages (excluding references).\n\nSuccessful full-paper submissions typically represent significant empirical, theoretical, or methodological advances in the field. Successful short-paper submissions offer more focused contributions with a smaller scope; they are not intended to be work-in-progress reports. Instead, they should offer complete, rigorously developed work with a solid contribution to the field.\n\n### Formatting\n\nSubmissions must be in PDF format. Papers must be in English. All references must be complete, accurate, accessible, and conform to the ACM Publication Format. Authors are required to use the single-column ACM Manuscript template.\n\nFor LaTeX, use the correct templates (Overleaf or LaTeX templates) found on ACM's \"[Preparing your article for LaTeX](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-latex)\" page, using `\\documentclass[manuscript, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart}` style for the document.\n\nFor Word, use the correct submission template found on ACM's \"[Preparing your article for Word](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word)\" page, i.e., \"submission template\".\n\nThe TAPS workflow used is described on ACM's \"[ACM's TAPS workflow page](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow)\".\n\n### Anonymity\n\nAll submissions need to be fully anonymized. This includes any appendices or supplemental material, as well as a potential acknowledgements section. Citations to the authors’ own previous work are NOT allowed to be anonymized.  However, authors should refer to their own prior work in the third person. Papers that violate the anonymization policy will be desk rejected.\n\n### Supplementary Material\n\nAll videos and supplementary material must be anonymized. Authors should submit any non-video supplementary material as a single .zip file, including a README file with a description of the materials.\n\nAuthors are encouraged to submit an optional video of a maximum of 6 minutes to support their submission. Authors are encouraged to follow the Accessible Presentation Guide. To ensure reviewers can view the supplementary video, authors should use the H.264 encoding and the MP4 file format. The bit rate of videos can be lowered to accommodate the upload limits of EasyChair (max. 50 MB per file).\n\n### Accessibility\n\nAuthors are required to follow SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission ([https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/](https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/)). Papers flagged as inaccessible by a reviewer will be reassigned.\n\n### Use of Generative AI\n\nAuthors must adhere to the ACM Policy on Authorship ([https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship)) regarding the use of generative AI in submissions. Authors are responsible for all content produced by these tools and must disclose their use.\n\n### Submitting\n\nSubmissions are facilitated via the EasyChair platform. Authors may submit and edit their materials until the submission deadline. Should authors encounter any difficulties, technical problems, or questions about this process, please contact the Paper chairs via [papers2025@mum-conf.org](mailto:papers2025@mum-conf.org).\n\n### Metadata Integrity\n\nChanges in author names are not allowed after the submission deadline; there are no exceptions. Changes to the order of authors are allowed only before the camera-ready deadline.\n\n### Selection Process\n\nSubmitted papers will undergo a rigorous double-blind review process. Each submitted paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers. There will be a single round of reviews with three potential outcomes: desk rejects, rejection, and conditional acceptance. No rebuttal phase is planned.\n\n### Upon Acceptance\n\n#### Publication\n\nAccepted papers will appear in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library.\n\n#### Presentation Format\n\nAccepted papers must be presented at the conference. Authors with accepted publications will be informed closer to the conference about the duration of their assigned slot and the timing of their presentation.\n\n#### Conference Registration\n\nFor each accepted paper, full registration for the MUM 2025 conference is required by the early bird registration deadline.\n\n## Timeline\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** August 21st, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Decision Notification:** October 6th, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Camera-ready deadline:** October 20th, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Conference dates:** December 1st - December 4th, 2025\n\n## Contact Us\n\nContact: [papers2025@mum-conf.org](mailto:papers2025@mum-conf.org)\n\n*   Mohamed Khamis, University of Glasgow, UK\n*   Passant Elagroudy, DFKI, Germany"
