  "Call for Papers": "# CDVE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Conference on Cooperative Design, Visualization, and Engineering (CDVE 2025) will be held in **Bangkok, Thailand from October 19-22, 2025.**\n\nThe conference invites submissions of original papers from a broad range of areas in cooperative design, cooperative visualization, and cooperative engineering. It includes those which encompass multiple users, locations, or sensors. Multimodal cooperation and integration in engineering are within the conference attention as well.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe major areas are the following but not limited to the following:\n\n*   **Cooperative Design (CD)**\n*   **Cooperative visualization (CV)**\n*   **Cooperative Engineering (CE)**\n*   **Cooperative Applications (CA)**\n*   **Basic Theories, methods and technologies that support CDVE (BT)**\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nManuscripts must be prepared in 10-point font using the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column conference format. All papers must not exceed 8 pages and should be exported in PDF format and anonymous since IEEE AICCSA manages a double-blind review process. The official language for the conference is English.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Full Papers (10 pages):**\n    *   Submission deadline: April 15, 2025\n    *   Notification of acceptance: May 20, 2025\n    *   Final camera ready paper due and registration for all accepted paper authors: June 25, 2025\n*   **Short papers (6 pages):**\n    *   Submission deadline: April 15, 2025\n    *   Notification of acceptance: May 20, 2025\n    *   Final camera ready paper due and registration for all accepted paper authors: June 25, 2025\n*   **Poster Paper:**\n    *   Submission deadline: June 25, 2025\n    *   Notification of acceptance: July 10, 2025\n*   **Registration Dates:**\n    *   Early registration for accepted paper authors: June 25, 2025\n    *   Early registration for all participants: July 31, 2025\n    *   Normal registration dates: Until the last day of the conference\n\n## Publication\n\n*   CDVE 2025 will publish two SCI journal special issues for the conference extended accepted papers in addition to the proceedings book.\n*   The proceedings book will be published by the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)."
