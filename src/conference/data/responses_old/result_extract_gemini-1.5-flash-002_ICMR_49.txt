"Summary": "The 15th ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval (ICMR 2025) will be held in Chicago, USA, from June 30 to July 3, 2025. The conference is calling for high-quality original papers addressing innovative research in multimedia retrieval and its related broad fields.",
"Call for Papers": "# ICMR 2025: Call for Regular Papers\n\nACM ICMR 2025 is calling for high-quality original papers addressing innovative research in multimedia retrieval and its related broad fields. The main scope of the conference is not only search and retrieval of multimedia data but also analysis and understanding of multimedia contents, including community-contributed social data, lifelogging data, and automatically generated sensor data, integration of diverse multimodal data, deep learning-based methodology, and practical multimedia applications.\n\n## Paper Types\n\n*   Long research papers should present complete work with evaluations on topics related to the Conference. They will have both oral and poster presentations at the conference.\n*   Short research papers should present preliminary results or more focused contributions. They will be presented as posters at the conference.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\n*   Multimedia content-based search and retrieval\n*   Multimedia-content-based (or hybrid) recommender systems\n*   Large-scale and Web-scale multimedia retrieval\n*   Multimedia content extraction, analysis, and indexing\n*   Multimedia analytics and knowledge discovery\n*   Multimedia machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks\n*   Relevance feedback, active learning, and transfer learning\n*   Fine-grained retrieval for multimedia\n*   Event-based indexing and multimedia understanding\n*   Semantic descriptors and novel high- or mid-level features\n*   Crowdsourcing, community contributions, and social multimedia\n*   Multimedia retrieval leveraging quality, production cues, style, framing, and affect\n*   Synthetic media generation and detection\n*   Narrative generation and narrative analysis\n*   User intent and human perception in multimedia retrieval\n*   Query processing and relevance feedback\n*   Multimedia browsing, summarization, and visualization\n*   Multimedia beyond video, including 3D data and sensor data\n*   Mobile multimedia browsing and search\n*   Multimedia analysis/search acceleration, e.g., GPU, FPGA\n*   Benchmarks and evaluation methodologies for multimedia analysis/search\n*   Privacy-aware multimedia retrieval methods and systems\n*   Fairness and explainability in multimedia analysis/search\n*   Legal, ethical and societal impact of multimedia retrieval research\n*   Applications of multimedia retrieval, e.g., news/journalism, media, medicine, sports, commerce, lifelogs, travel, security, and environment\n\n## Maximum Length of a Paper\n\n*   Long research paper: 8 pages (excluding references)\n*   Short research paper: 4 pages (excluding references)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** February 23, 2025\n\nFor more dates, please check [here](/important-dates).\n\n## Review Style\n\nACM ICMR follows a double-blind review process for full paper selection.\n\n## Abstract and Keywords\n\nThe abstract and the keywords form the primary source for assigning papers to reviewers. So make sure that they form a concise and complete summary of your paper with sufficient information to let someone who has not read the full paper know what it is about.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nSee the [Paper Submission](/authors/paper-submissions) section.\n\n## Presentation Format\n\nACM ICMR 2025 will be an in-person event. All oral talks and demonstrations must be on-site at the conference venue, otherwise they will be removed from the proceedings and no refund given. This includes full papers, BNI papers, and doctoral symposium papers. Posters should be presented at the conference, but we will also facilitate online posters using our online conference platform. This platform requires the upload of a poster and a short accompanying video."
