  "Call for Papers": "# PETS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 25th Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium (PETS 2025) will be a **hybrid event** held in **Washington, DC, USA and online from July 14–19, 2025.**\n\n## Publication\n\nPapers undergo a journal-style reviewing process, and accepted papers are published in the journal **Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PoPETs)**.  PoPETs is a scholarly, open-access journal for research papers on privacy; it provides high-quality reviewing and publication while also supporting the successful PETS community event. PoPETs is self-published and does not have article processing charges or article submission charges.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nPapers submitted to PETS/PoPETs should present novel practical and/or theoretical research into the requirements, design, analysis, experimentation, or fielding of privacy-enhancing technologies and the social, cultural, legal, or situational contexts in which they are used. PETS is also open to interdisciplinary research examining people’s and communities’ privacy needs, preferences, and expectations as long as it is clear how these findings can impact the design, development, or deployment of technology with privacy implications.\n\nThe submission guidelines contain important submission information for authors. Please note especially the instructions for anonymizing submissions, for ensuring ethical research, and for using AI in writing or editing the manuscript.  Papers must be submitted via the PETS 2025 submission server: [https://submit.petsymposium.org](https://submit.petsymposium.org).\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 23:59:59 Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12):\n\n### Issue 1\n\n*   Paper submission deadline: May 31, 2024 (firm)\n*   Rebuttal period: July 16–19, 2024\n*   Author notification: August 1, 2024\n*   Revision deadline: September 1, 2024\n*   Camera-ready deadline for accepted papers and accepted revisions: September 15, 2024\n\n### Issue 2\n\n*   Paper submission deadline: August 31, 2024 (firm)\n*   Rebuttal period: October 15–18, 2024\n*   Author notification: November 1, 2024\n*   Revision deadline: December 1, 2024\n*   Camera-ready deadline for accepted papers and accepted revisions: December 15, 2024\n\n### Issue 3\n\n*   Paper submission deadline: November 30, 2024 (firm)\n*   Rebuttal period: January 14–17, 2025\n*   Author notification: February 1, 2025\n*   Revision deadline: March 1, 2025\n*   Camera-ready deadline for accepted papers and accepted revisions: March 15, 2025\n\n### Issue 4\n\n*   Paper submission deadline: February 28, 2025 (firm)\n*   Rebuttal period: April 15–18, 2025\n*   Author notification: May 1, 2025\n*   Revision deadline: June 1, 2025\n*   Camera-ready deadline for accepted papers and accepted revisions: June 15, 2025\n\n## Review Process\n\nAuthors invited to revise their submissions will be provided with a set of revision criteria that must be satisfactorily completed before their paper can be accepted. Authors of such papers will not resubmit to the next issue, but will instead be assigned a revision editor who will guide the revision process by interactively reviewing new versions of the paper and providing feedback and guidance on the changes necessary for acceptance.\n\n## Resubmission of Rejected Papers\n\nAuthors of rejected papers may consider resubmitting to a future issue of PoPETs, but must skip one full issue before resubmission.\n\n## Scope\n\nPapers submitted to PETS/PoPETs should present novel practical and/or theoretical research into the requirements, design, analysis, experimentation, or fielding of privacy-enhancing technologies and the social, cultural, legal, or situational contexts in which they are used.\n\n## Suggested Topics\n\nSuggested topics include but are not restricted to:\n\n*   Anonymous communication and censorship resistance\n*   Blockchain privacy\n*   Building and deploying privacy-enhancing systems\n*   Cloud computing and privacy\n*   Compliance with privacy laws and regulations\n*   Cryptographic tools for privacy\n*   Data protection technologies\n*   Defining and quantifying privacy\n*   Differential privacy and private data analysis\n*   Economics and game-theoretical approaches to privacy\n*   Forensics and privacy\n*   Genomic and medical privacy\n*   Human factors, usability, and user-centered design of privacy technologies\n*   Information leakage, data correlation, and abstract attacks on privacy\n*   Interdisciplinary research connecting privacy to economics, law, psychology, etc.\n*   Internet of Things privacy\n*   Location privacy\n*   Machine learning and privacy\n*   Measurement of privacy in real-world systems\n*   Mobile devices and privacy\n*   Policy languages and tools for privacy\n*   Profiling and data mining\n*   Social network privacy\n*   Surveillance\n*   Traffic analysis\n*   Transparency, fairness, robustness, and abuse in privacy systems\n*   Web privacy\n\n### Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers\n\nPETS also solicits Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers on any of these topics.\n\n## Awards\n\n*   Caspar Bowden Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies\n*   Andreas Pfitzmann Best Student Paper Award\n*   Artifact Award\n\n## HotPETs and FOCI\n\nPart of the symposium will be devoted to HotPETs and FOCI. Further information will be published on the PETS website in early 2025.\n\n## Contact Information\n\n*   General Chair: [gc25@petsymposium.org](mailto:gc25@petsymposium.org)\n*   Program Chairs/Co-Editors-in-Chief: [pets25-chairs@petsymposium.org](mailto:pets25-chairs@petsymposium.org)"
