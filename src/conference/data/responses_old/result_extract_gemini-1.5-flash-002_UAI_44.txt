Authors are strongly encouraged to make code and data available.\n\nAll accepted papers will be presented in poster sessions and spotlight presentations (physically or remotely). Selected papers will have longer presentations. All accepted papers will be published in a volume of [Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)](http://proceedings.mlr.press/).\n\n## Important Dates for Authors\n\n*   Paper submission starts: January 5th, 2025 (23:59 AoE)\n*   Suggested OpenReview account creation deadline: January 27, 2025\n*   Paper submission deadline: February 10th, 2025 (23:59 AoE)\n*   Reviews released to Authors: April 3rd, 2025 (23:59 AoE)\n*   Author response/discussion period: April 3rd - April 12th, 2025 (23:59 AoE)\n*   Author notification: May 6th, 2025 (23:59 AoE)\n*   Camera-ready deadline: June 6th, 2025 (23:59 AoE)\n\n## Submission\n\nPapers should be submitted on the UAI 2025 OpenReview submission site: [https://openreview.net/group?id=auai.org/UAI/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=auai.org/UAI/2025/Conference).
