  "Call for Papers": "# EDM 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Educational Data Mining Conference 2025 (EDM 2025) will be held in **Palermo, Italy, from July 20-23, 2025**.\n\n## Theme\n\nNew Goals, New Measurements, New Incentives to Learn: In a world where AI can excel and outperform humans in many cognitive tasks, educational systems need to reconsider their goals from the ground up. As AI is expected to reshape the labor market, the social mechanisms that have shaped students’ incentives to learn may diminish or, at the very least, change. This presents an opportunity, and perhaps even a necessity, for communities like EDM to help learners of all ages find their own voices and take greater responsibility for their learning journey. Reshaping goals and priorities would also require developing new ways to measure learning gains and processes to include more complex constructs, like critical thinking, creativity, and the ability to evaluate and incorporate new information.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Developing new techniques for mining educational data\n*   Bridging EDM research and learning sciences\n*   Actionable advice rooted in educational data mining research, experiments, and outcomes\n*   Evaluating the efficacy of curriculum and interventions\n*   Domain Knowledge Modeling\n*   Educational Recommenders, Instructional Sequencing, and Personalized Learning\n*   Equity, Privacy, Transparency, and Fairness\n*   Human Factors, Transparency, and Explainability\n*   Learner Cognitive and Behavior Modeling and its association with performance\n*   Learner Knowledge and Performance Modeling\n*   Comparing Human and Artificial Intelligence\n*   Learning Analytics\n*   Social and Collaborative Learning\n*   Reproducibility\n\n## Submission Types\n\nFor all tracks, the acknowledgements and references sections at the end of the paper do not count towards the listed page limits.\n\n*   **Full Papers:** 10 pages. Should describe original, substantive, mature, and unpublished work.\n*   **Short Papers:** 6 pages. Should describe original, unpublished work. This includes early-stage, less developed works in progress.\n*   **JEDM Journal Track Papers:** Papers submitted to the Journal of Educational Data Mining track will be published in JEDM and presented during the JEDM track of the conference.\n*   **Industry Papers:** 6 pages. Should describe innovative uses of EDM techniques in a commercial setting.\n*   **Doctoral Consortium:** 2-4 pages. Should describe the graduate/postgraduate student’s research topic, proposed contributions, and results so far.\n*   **Posters/Demos:** 2-4 pages. Posters should describe original unpublished work in progress or last-minute results. Demos should describe EDM tools and systems, or educational systems that use EDM techniques.\n*   **Workshop proposals:** 2-4 pages. Should describe the organizers’ plan both to conduct the workshop and to stimulate growth in the workshop’s area of focus.\n*   **Tutorial proposals:** 2-4 pages. Should motivate and describe succinctly the field or tool that will be presented, as well as a plan for attendees to learn it in a hands-on way.\n\n## Submission\n\nAll paper submissions must be submitted for double-blind reviewing. All papers must not have been submitted for publication at other venues. Links to existing source code are encouraged; however, to keep the double-blind reviewing, we suggest using a service such as Anonymous GitHub ([https://anonymous.4open.science](https://anonymous.4open.science)).\n\nAll papers – except the papers submitted to the JEDM Journal Track – should be formatted according to the EDM template:\n\n*   **Word:** [https://educationaldatamining.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/edm_word_template2024.docx](https://educationaldatamining.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/edm_word_template2024.docx)\n*   **LaTeX:** [https://educationaldatamining.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/EDM-template2024.zip](https://educationaldatamining.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/EDM-template2024.zip)\n\nPapers not adhering to the provided templates, not respecting the page limits associated to the respective track, making unauthorized changes, or failing to comply with accessibility guidelines may be rejected without review.\n\nPapers can be submitted through the EasyChair platform: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=edm2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=edm2025)\n\n## JEDM Journal Track Papers\n\nJEDM track papers should be formatted according to the JEDM guidelines and should be submitted to the journal directly at: [https://jedm.educationaldatamining.org/index.php/JEDM/about/submissions](https://jedm.educationaldatamining.org/index.php/JEDM/about/submissions)\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll dates refer to 23:59 (11:59 pm) anywhere on Earth. All deadlines are firm. No extension will be granted.\n\n*   **JEDM track papers:**\n    *   Cut-off deadline 1: October 13, 2024\n    *   Cut-off deadline 2: December 2, 2024\n    *   Cut-off deadline 3: January 26, 2025\n*   **Abstracts for full and short papers:** February 13, 2025\n*   **Full papers and short papers:** February 20, 2025\n*   **Industry papers:** February 20, 2025\n*   **Workshop and Tutorial proposals:** March 1, 2025\n*   **Doctoral consortium papers:** March 11, 2025\n*   **Posters and demos:** March 18, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notifications for workshop and tutorial submissions:** March 22, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notifications for full, short, and industry papers:** April 10, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notifications for posters, demos, and doctoral consortium papers:** April 25, 2025\n*   **Application deadline for student volunteers:** April 20, 2025\n*   **Revisions due for submissions with conditional accept decisions:** April 30, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready copy due:** May 10, 2025\n*   **Conference Workshop Day:** July 20, 2025\n*   **EDM:** July 21-23, 2025"
