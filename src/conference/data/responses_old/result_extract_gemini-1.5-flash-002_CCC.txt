  "Call for Papers": "# CCC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Computational Complexity Conference (CCC 2025) will be held from **August 5 to 8, 2025, in Toronto, Canada.**\n\n## Scope\n\nThe conference seeks original research papers in all areas of computational complexity theory, studying the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints. We welcome contributions from all topics with connections to or motivated by questions in complexity theory, broadly construed. We especially encourage submissions that address complexity-theoretic issues in complexity-adjacent areas such as coding theory, cryptography, game theory, learning, logic and privacy.\n\nPossible topics include but are not limited to:\n\n*   Complexity classes\n*   Reducibility and completeness\n*   Circuit complexity\n*   Communication complexity\n*   Algebraic complexity\n*   Proof complexity\n*   Complexity in other concrete computational models\n*   Interactive and probabilistic proof systems\n*   Logic and descriptive complexity\n*   Pseudorandomness and derandomization\n*   Average case complexity\n*   Quantum computation\n*   Parametrized complexity\n*   Fine-grained complexity\n*   Complexity-theoretic aspects of:\n    *   Coding theory\n    *   Cryptography\n    *   Optimization (including inapproximability continuous optimization)\n    *   Property testing\n    *   Streaming and sublinear computation\n    *   Distributed computation\n    *   Game theory\n    *   Machine learning\n    *   Privacy\n\n## Submission\n\n### Deadlines\n\n*   **Papers must be submitted electronically:** by February 7, 2025, 23:59 AoE\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** May 2, 2025\n*   **Final camera-ready copies:** End of May, 2025\n\n### Format\n\nSubmissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper and an abstract of 1-2 paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. A submission must contain within its first 10 pages a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including discussion of its importance, prior work, and an outline of key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims (similar to the content of a brief oral presentation). There is no bound on the total length of a submission, but material other than the abstract, references, and the first 10 pages is considered as supplementary and will be read at the committee's discretion.\n\nSubmissions should include proofs of all central claims. The submission should be in single-column format, use at least 11-point font, at least 1-inch margins, and at least single-spacing between lines. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Instructions for formatting camera-ready versions will be communicated to the authors of accepted papers.\n\n### Double-Blind Reviewing\n\nThe conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authorsâ€™ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. (Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.)\n\n### Additional Remarks\n\nIn addition to the submission, authors may optionally send a short email to the program committee (PC) chair at ccc2025chair@gmail.com containing any additional remarks for the PC.\n\n### Conflict of Interest\n\nWe expect PC members and reviewers to recuse themselves from the evaluation of any submission if they would not be able to give an objective opinion due to some conflict of interest (COI).\n\n### Simultaneous Submission Policy\n\nMaterial which has been previously published in a journal or another conference proceedings, or which is scheduled for publication prior to September 2025, will not be considered for acceptance. Simultaneous submission of the same or essentially the same material to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed.\n\n## Publication\n\n### Online Posting\n\nAuthors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity or the arXiv.\n\n### Proceedings\n\nThe conference proceedings will be published under a Creative Commons BY license in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series. Publication in the conference proceedings does not preclude subsequent journal publication.\n\n### Presentation\n\nAuthors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the conference. The program committee will determine time allocations for presentations (between 15 and 45 minutes).\n\n## Awards\n\n*   EATCS Luca Trevisan award for the CCC best student paper\n*   Best paper award\n*   Special journal issue\n\n## Conference Information\n\n*   **Dates and location:** Tuesday, August 5 to Friday, August 8, 2025, in Toronto, Canada.\n*   **Travel allowances:** Will be offered to students and post-doctoral fellows.\n*   **Visas:** A visa for Canada may be needed for attending the conference.\n*   **Code of conduct:** CCC 2025 is a participant in the SafeTOC initiative."
