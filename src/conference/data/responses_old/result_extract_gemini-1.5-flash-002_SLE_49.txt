  "Call for Papers": "# SLE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE 2025) will be held in **Koblenz, Germany, from June 12-13, 2025**, co-located with STAF 2025.\n\nSLE is devoted to the principles of software languages: their design, their implementation, and their evolution.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nSLE covers software language engineering in general, rather than engineering a specific software language. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   **Software Language Design and Implementation:** Approaches to and methods for language design, static semantics, techniques for specifying behavioral/executable semantics, generative approaches, meta-languages, meta-tools, language workbenches, AI-assisted language design and optimisation\n*   **Software Language Validation:** Verification and formal methods for languages, testing techniques for languages, simulation techniques for languages, model-based testing, AI-assisted validation\n*   **Software Language Integration and Composition:** Coordination of heterogeneous languages and tools, mappings between languages, traceability between languages, deployment of languages to different platforms, AI-assisted refactoring\n*   **Software Language Maintenance:** Software language reuse, language evolution, language families and variability, language and software product lines, domain-specific approaches\n*   **Empirical evaluation and experience reports of language engineering tools:** User studies evaluating usability, performance benchmarks, industrial applications\n*   **Synergies between Language Engineering and emerging/promising research areas:** Generative AI in language engineering, AI and ML language engineering, quantum language engineering, language engineering for physical systems, socio-technical systems and language engineering\n\n## Types of Submissions\n\nSLE accepts the following types of papers:\n\n*   **Research papers:** (6-12 pages + optional 2 pages for bibliography/appendices)\n*   **New ideas/vision papers:** (up to 5 pages + optional 1 page for bibliography/appendices)\n*   **SLE Body of Knowledge:** (up to 20 pages, including bibliography/appendices)\n*   **Tool papers:** (up to 5 pages + optional 1 page for bibliography/appendices)\n\n## Submission\n\nSLE 2025 has a single submission round for papers, including a mandatory abstract registration and a rebuttal phase. Authors of accepted research papers will be invited to submit artifacts.\n\n## Format\n\nSubmissions have to use the [ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”](https://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format); please make sure that you always use the latest ACM SIGPLAN acmart LaTeX template, and that the document class definition is `\\documentclass[sigplan,anonymous,review]{acmart}`. Do not make any changes to this format!\n\n## Concurrent Submissions\n\nPapers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere.\n\n## Policy on Human Participant and Subject Research\n\nAuthors conducting research involving human participants and subjects must ensure that their research complies with their local governing laws and regulations and the ACM’s general principles.\n\n## Reviewing Process\n\nAll submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. For research papers, authors will get a chance to respond to the reviews before a final decision is made.\n\n## Artifact Evaluation\n\nSLE will use an evaluation process to assess the quality of artifacts on which papers are based to foster the culture of experimental reproducibility. Authors of accepted research papers are invited to submit artifacts.\n\n## Awards\n\n*   Distinguished paper\n*   Distinguished artifact\n*   Distinguished reviewer\n*   Most Influential Paper\n\n## Publication\n\nAll accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.\n\n## Important Dates (Authors)\n\n*   **Initial Optional Abstract Submission:** February 7, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Abstract and Paper Submission:** March 4, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Author Response:** April 11, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Paper Notification:** April 15, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Artifact submission Deadline:** April 23, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Start Kick-the-tires author response period:** April 28, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **End Kick-the-tires author response period:** May 2, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Author artifact Notification:** June 1, 2025 (AoE)\n\n## Submission Website\n\n[https://sle25.hotcrp.com/](https://sle25.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Contact\n\nFor additional information, clarification, or answers to any questions, please get in touch with the program co-chairs ([regina.hebig@uni-rostock.de](mailto:regina.hebig@uni-rostock.de) and [vadim@grammarware.net](mailto:vadim@grammarware.net))."
