"Call for Papers": "# ICST 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 18th IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST 2025) will be held in **Naples, Italy, from March 31 to April 4, 2025**.\n\nICST serves as a premier platform uniting researchers, scientists, engineers, and practitioners worldwide to showcase their cutting-edge research findings, innovative ideas, and practical applications in the domain of Software Testing, Verification, and Validation.\n\n## Call for Papers: Research Papers Track\n\nThe Research Papers track of ICST 2025 invites high-quality submissions in all areas of software testing, verification, and validation. Papers for the research track should present novel and original work that advances the state-of-the-art. Case studies and empirical research papers are also welcome.\n\n## Submission Format\n\nFull Research papers must conform to the two-column IEEE conference publication format, and not exceed 10 pages, including all text, figures, tables, and appendices; two additional pages containing only references are permitted. It must conform to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (use the letter format template and conference option).\n\n## Double-Blind Reviewing\n\nEach submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the ICST 2025 Program Committee.

If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to register for ICST 2025 and present the paper. We expect that the conference will be in-person.\n\n## Replication Material\n\nSubmissions must supply all information needed to replicate the results and therefore are expected to include or point to an anonymized replication package with the necessary software, data, and instructions.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Submission Deadline:** September 25, 2024\n*   **Full Paper Submission Deadline:** October 2, 2024\n*   **Author Notification Deadline:** December 18, 2024\n*   **Camera Ready:** January 22, 2025\n*   **Special Issue Submission Deadline:** September 1, 2025"
