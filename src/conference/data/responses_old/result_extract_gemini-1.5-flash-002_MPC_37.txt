  "Call for Papers": "# MPC 2019: Call for Papers\n\nThe International Conference on Mathematics of Program Construction (MPC) aims to promote the development of mathematical principles and techniques that are demonstrably practical and effective in the process of constructing computer programs.\n\nMPC 2019 was held in **Porto, Portugal from 7-9 October 2019**, co-located with the International Symposium on Formal Methods, FM 2019.\n\n## Scope\n\nMPC seeks original papers on mathematical methods and tools put to use in program construction. Topics of interest range from algorithmics to support for program construction in programming languages and systems. Typical areas include type systems, program analysis and transformation, programming language semantics, security, and program logics. The notion of a 'program' is interpreted broadly, ranging from algorithms to hardware.\n\nTheoretical contributions are welcome, provided that their relevance to program construction is clear. Reports on applications are welcome, provided that their mathematical basis is evident. We also encourage the submission of 'programming pearls' that present elegant and instructive examples of the mathematics of program construction.\n\n## Submission\n\nSubmission was in two stages:\n\n*   Abstracts (plain text, maximum 250 words) were submitted by May 7, 2019.\n*   Full papers (pdf, formatted using the llncs.sty style file for LaTeX) were submitted by May 10, 2019. There was no prescribed page limit, but authors should strive for brevity.\n\nBoth abstracts and papers were submitted using [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mpc20190).\n\nPapers had to present previously unpublished work and not be submitted concurrently to any other publication venue. Submissions were evaluated by the program committee according to their relevance, correctness, significance, originality, and clarity. Each submission should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work. Accepted papers had to be presented in person at the conference by one of the authors.\n\nThe proceedings of MPC 2019 were published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Authors of accepted papers were expected to transfer copyright to Springer for this purpose. After the conference, authors of the best papers from MPC 2019 and MPC 2015 were invited to submit revised versions to a special issue of Science of Computer Programming (SCP).\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Patrick Bahr | IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark\n*   Richard Bird | University of Oxford, UK\n*   Corina Cîrstea | University of Southampton, UK\n*   Brijesh Dongol | University of Surrey, UK\n*   João F.
