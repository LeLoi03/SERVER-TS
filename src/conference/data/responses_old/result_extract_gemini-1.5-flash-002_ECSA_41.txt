  "Summary": "The 19th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA 2025) will be held from September 15 to 19, 2025, in Limassol, Cyprus. ECSA is the premier European software architecture conference, providing researchers, practitioners, and educators with a platform to present and discuss the most recent, innovative, and significant findings and experiences in the field of software architecture research and practice. The theme for ECSA 2025 is “impactful software architecture”.",
  "Call for Papers": "# ECSA 2025: Call for Research Papers\n\nThe 19th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA 2025) will be held from **September 15 to 19, 2025, in Limassol, Cyprus**.\n\n## Theme\n\nThe theme for ECSA 2025 is **impactful software architecture**.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe Program Committee seeks submissions of original and unpublished high-quality papers describing fundamental and applied research; new methods, approaches, and processes; novel applications; education and training in software architecture; and experience reports on all topics related to software architecture. We particularly encourage papers that demonstrate that diversity in gender, culture, religion, country, etc. are key factors for success and innovation in software architecture.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Foundational principles of software architecture\n*   Relationship of requirements engineering and software architecture\n*   Quality attributes and software architectures\n*   Architecture practices for secure, explainable, and trustworthy software\n*   Architecture design and analysis\n*   Architecture description languages and meta-models\n*   Architecture verification and validation\n*   Management of architectural knowledge, decisions, and rationale\n*   Architecture patterns, styles, and tactics; reference architectures\n*   Architecture viewpoints and views\n*   Architecture conformance\n*   Software architecture virtualization and visualization\n*   Architecture-centric process models and frameworks\n*   Software architecture and agile, incremental, iterative, and continuous development\n*   Component-based models and deployment; middleware\n*   Software architecture and system architecture\n*   Software tools and environments for architecture-centric software engineering\n*   Ethics, cultural, economic, business, social, human, and managerial aspects of software architecture\n*   Architecture and technical debt\n*   Architecting for sustainable and environment friendly systems\n*   Applying AI and LLMs in software architecture and architecting for AI and LLM intensive systems\n*   Software architecture education\n*   Cross-disciplinary approaches to software architecture\n*   Architectures for reconfigurable and self-adaptive systems\n*   Architectural concerns of autonomic systems\n*   Software architecture applied to new and emerging areas, such as the cloud/edge, big data, blockchain, cyber-physical systems, IoT, autonomous systems, systems-of-systems, energy-aware software, quantum computing, AI-enabled systems\n*   Empirical studies, systematic literature reviews, and mapping studies in software architecture\n*   Diversity, equity, and inclusion in activities related to software architecture\n\n## Paper Submissions\n\nECSA 2025 seeks four types of papers for the research track:\n\n*   **Research papers** (max. 16 pages in LNCS style)\n*   **Education and training papers** (max. 16 pages in LNCS style)\n*   **Experience reports** (max. 16 pages in LNCS style)\n*   **Short papers** (max. 8 pages in LNCS style)\n\nAll submitted papers will undergo a rigorous double-blind peer review process. Papers will be selected based on originality, quality, soundness, and relevance.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll dates are 23:59h AoE (Anywhere on Earth).\n\n*   **Abstract submission:** March 14, 2025\n*   **Paper submission:** March 21, 2025\n*   **Notification:** May 9, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready paper:** June 23, 2025\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecsa2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecsa2025)"
