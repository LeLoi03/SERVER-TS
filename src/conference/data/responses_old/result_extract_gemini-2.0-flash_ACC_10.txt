  "Call for Papers": "# Applied Computing 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Applied Computing 2025 conference aims to address the main issues of concern within the applied computing area and related fields. This conference covers essentially technical aspects. The applied computing field is divided into more detailed areas (see below). However, innovative contributions that don’t fit into these areas will also be considered since they might be of benefit to conference attendees.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nAll areas related to Applied Computing are of interest, including, but not being limited to, the following areas:\n\n**Application Fields**\n\n*   eCommerce and ePayment\n*   eLearning\n*   eHealth and eSports\n*   IT services\n*   Mobile computing\n*   Knowledge management and distribution\n\n**Fundamental Concepts and Engineering**\n\n*   Algorithms\n*   Data bases and data mining\n*   Information Systems\n*   Information sourcing and aggregation\n*   Programming languages and concepts\n*   Security and Privacy\n*   Usability\n\n**Performance**\n\n*   Distributed and parallel systems\n*   Cloud Computing\n*   Evaluation and Assessment\n*   Intelligent systems\n*   Large-scale applications\n*   Local and distributed storage\n\n**Communication**\n\n*   IoT\n*   Industry 4.0\n*   Mobile Systems and Networks\n*   Protocols, Standards and Mark-up Languages\n*   Sensor Networks\n*   WWW Applications and Technologies\n\n**Hardware scope**\n\n*   Embedded Computing\n*   Environment-friendly Constructions\n*   Mobile Aspects\n*   Realization of IoT nodes\n*   Security concepts and devices\n*   Wideband Information streaming\n\n## Types of Contributions\n\nThe Conference will be composed of several types of contributions:\n\n*   **Full Papers:** These include mainly accomplished research results and have 8 pages at the maximum (5,000 words).\n*   **Short Papers:** These are mostly composed of work in progress reports or fresh developments and have 4 pages at maximum (2,500 words).\n*   **Reflection Papers:** These might review recent research literature pertaining to a particular problem or approach, indicate what the findings suggest, and/or provide a suggestion – with rationale and justification – for a different approach or perspective on that problem. Reflection papers might also analyze general trends or discuss important issues in topics related to Applied Computing. These have two pages at maximum (1500 words).\n*   **Posters / Demonstrations:** These have one page at the maximum (625 words) besides the poster itself (or demonstration) that will be exposed at the conference.\n*   **Tutorials:** Tutorials can be proposed by scholars or company representatives. A proposal of maximum 250 words is expected.\n*   **Panels:** Discussions on selected topics will be held. A proposal of maximum 250 words is expected.\n*   **Invited Talks:** These will be made of contributions from well-known scholars and company representatives. An abstract will be included in the conference proceedings.\n*   **Doctoral Consortium:** The Doctoral Consortium will discuss on going work of PhD students in an informal and formative atmosphere. Contributions to the consortium should take the form of either:\n    *   a critical literature review of the research topic providing the rationale for the relevance and interest of the research topic; or\n    *   a short paper discussing the research question(s), research objectives, research methodology and work done so far.\n\nDoctoral Consortium Contributions should have a maximum 2,500 words (4 pages).\n\n*   **Corporate Showcases & Exhibitions:** The former enables Companies to present recent developments and applications, inform a large and qualified audience of your future directions and showcase company’s noteworthy products and services. There will be a time slot for companies to make their presentation in a room. The latter enables companies the opportunity to display its latest offerings of hardware, software, tools, services and books, through an exhibit booth.
