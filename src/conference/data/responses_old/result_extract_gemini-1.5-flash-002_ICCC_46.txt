  "Call for Papers": "# ICCC’25: Call for Papers\n\nThe 16th International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC’25) will be held in **Campinas, Brazil, from June 23 to 27, 2025**.\n\n## Computational Creativity\n\nComputational creativity is the art, science, philosophy, and engineering of computational systems which, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviours that unbiased observers would deem to be creative.\n\n## Paper Types\n\nICCC’25 welcomes the submission of five different types of full papers. During your submission, please indicate the category in which your paper best fits:\n\n*   **Technical papers:** Papers posing and addressing hypotheses about aspects of creative behaviour in computational systems. Strong evaluation of approaches is essential.\n*   **System or Resource description papers:** Papers describing the building and deployment of a creative system or resource to produce artefacts of potential cultural value. Some evaluation is expected.\n*   **Study papers:** Papers drawing on allied fields such as psychology, philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, humanities, the arts, etc.; or which appeal to broader areas of AI and Computer Science; or which appeal to studies of the field of CC as a whole.\n*   **Cultural application papers:** Papers presenting the use of creative software in a cultural setting.\n*   **Position papers:** Papers presenting an opinion on some aspect of the culture of CC research.\n\n## Themes and Topics\n\nOriginal research contributions are solicited in all areas related to Computational Creativity research and practice, including, but not limited to:\n\n*   Applications of Computational Creativity\n*   Human-Machine Co-Creativity\n*   Computational Creativity Evaluation\n*   Social Models\n*   Computational Paradigms\n*   Interdisciplinary Perspectives\n*   Data and Creativity\n*   Societal Impact\n*   Psychological Factors\n*   Provocations\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nThis year the submission process has two stages: initial submission of a title and abstract, and subsequent submission of the full paper a week later.\n\n*   Recommended length for the abstract is 100–200 words.\n*   The full paper page limit is 8 pages + up to 2 pages of references.\n*   Papers will be reviewed in a double-blind fashion.\n*   To be considered, papers must be submitted as a PDF document formatted according to ICCC style (similar to AAAI and IJCAI formats). You can download the updated ICCC’25 LaTeX template [here](https://computationalcreativity.net/ICCC-author-kit-2022.zip) and Word template [here](https://computationalcreativity.net/ICCC-author-kit-Word.zip).\n*   Abstracts are to be submitted one week before the full paper deadline. Submit your abstract via the EasyChair system [here](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccc202501).\n*   Submit your full paper by updating the EasyChair Abstract with your manuscript file.\n*   Papers must be submitted through the EasyChair platform: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccc202501](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccc202501)\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines given are 23:59 anywhere on Earth time.\n\n*   **Abstracts due:** February 21, 2025\n*   **Submissions due:** February 28, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notification:** April 11, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready copies due:** May 2, 2025\n*   **Conference:** June 23–27, 2025\n\n## Contact\n\n[iccc25@computationalcreativity.net](mailto:iccc25@computationalcreativity.net)"
