All manuscripts will be peer-reviewed and will be evaluated on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, quality of presentation, and relevance to the conference topics. Submissions need to be double-blinded. Authors should not reveal their identity in their submissions. References to past work need to be in a third-person form.\n\nSubmitted manuscripts should not exceed 10 letter size pages (8.5 x 11, IEEE format for conference proceedings), including figures, tables and references. Original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other conference or journal is expected. Papers determined to be under active review elsewhere will be rejected without review. Submissions received after the due date, exceeding the length limit will not be considered.  The proceedings will be published through the IEEE Press and will be made available online through the IEEE Digital Library. When submitting the final accepted manuscript, authors may purchase up to two additional pages beyond the original 10 pages (excluding references) to address comments received from the reviewers.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE, UTC-12 timezone).\n\n*   Workshop proposal open: August 1, 2024\n*   Workshop proposal due: September 2, 2024\n*   Workshop proposal acceptance: October 1, 2024\n*   Deadline paper abstract: December 9, 2024\n*   Deadline paper: December 23, 2024\n*   Author notification: February 17, 2025\n*   Camera ready: March 14, 2025\n*   Conference date: May 19 to 22, 2025\n\n## Contact\n\n[ccgrid2025@uit.no](mailto:ccgrid2025@uit.no)"
