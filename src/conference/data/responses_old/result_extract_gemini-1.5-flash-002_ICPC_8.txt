"Call for Papers": "# ICPC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 33rd IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2025) is the premier venue for work in the area of program comprehension. It encompasses both human activities for comprehending the software and technologies for supporting such comprehension. ICPC 2025 is co-located with ICSE 2025 and will be held in **Ottawa, Ontario, Canada from April 27-28, 2025**.\n\n## Tracks\n\nICPC 2025 solicits four main categories of research contributions:\n\n*   Research papers\n*   Early research achievement (ERA) papers\n*   Replications and negative results papers\n*   Tool demos\n\nOn top of this, journal-first papers from selected journals will be accepted for presentation.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Submission:** November 6, 2024\n*   **Paper Submission:** November 9, 2024\n*   **Author Notification:** December 17, 2024\n*   **Author Response Deadline:** December 21, 2024\n*   **Final Author Notification:** January 12, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready:** February 5, 2025\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest for all tracks include but are not limited to:\n\n*   Empirical evaluations of program comprehension tools, techniques, and approaches\n*   Human aspects in program comprehension\n*   Cognitive theories for program comprehension\n*   Topics at the intersection between program comprehension and programming education\n*   Individual, collaborative, distributed, and global program comprehension\n*   Novel visualization or summarization techniques and interfaces to support program comprehension\n*   Comprehension of specific types of software systems\n*   Comprehension in the context of diverse software process models and specific lifecycle activities\n*   Comprehension of software artifacts\n*   Comprehension and legal issues\n*   Automated tool support for program comprehension\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template. All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version.\n\n## Review and Evaluation Criteria\n\nResearch papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. The reviewers will remain anonymous and signing of reviews will not be permitted in the review.\n\nSubmissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n\n*   Soundness\n*   Significance\n*   Novelty\n*   Verifiability\n*   Presentation\n\n## Author Response Period\n\nICPC 2025 will offer an author response period. In this period, the authors will have the opportunity to inspect the reviews, and answer specific questions raised by the program committee.\n\n## Publication and Presentation\n\nUpon notification of acceptance, all authors of accepted papers will receive further instructions for preparing the camera-ready versions of their submissions. If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to register for ICPC 2025, attend the conference, and present the paper in person. All accepted papers will be published in the conference electronic proceedings.\n\n## Awards\n\nA subset of the Research Track papers accepted for presentation at ICPC 2025 will be invited to be revised and extended for consideration in a thematic special issue of the Springer Empirical Software Engineering Journal (EMSE). The best papers of the research track will be awarded with an ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at ICPC. In addition, ICPC 2025 will feature ICPC Honorable Mentions, special awards that will be assigned, on the basis of the program committee reports, to the papers that have applied extremely novel and/or outstanding research methods to the problem of interest.\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://icpc2025-technical.hotcrp.com](https://icpc2025-technical.hotcrp.com)\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Coen De Roover, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium\n*   Gema Rodríguez-Pérez, University of British Columbia (UBC), Canada\n*   Gabriele Bavota, Software Institute @ Università della Svizzera Italiana, Switzerland\n*   Alexandre Bergel, University of Chile, Chile\n*   Bernhard Berger, Hamburg University of Technology, Germany\n*   Dirk Beyer, LMU Munich, Germany\n*   David Binkley, Loyola University Maryland\n*   Carolin Brandt, Delft University of Technology, Netherlands\n*   John Businge, University of Antwerp; Flanders Make; University of Nevada at Las Vegas, Belgium\n*   Gül Calikli, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom\n*   Fernando Castor, University of Twente, Netherlands\n*   Gemma Catolino, University of Salerno, Italy\n*   Oscar Chaparro, William & Mary, United States\n*   Eunjong Choi, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Japan\n*   Michael L.
