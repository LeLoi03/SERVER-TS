  "Summary": "The 7th International Conference on Adaptive Instructional Systems (AIS), affiliated with the HCI International Conference, will be held in Gothenburg, Sweden from June 22-27, 2025.  The conference aims to understand the theory and enhance the state-of-practice for adaptive instructional systems, which are artificially intelligent, computer-based systems that guide learning experiences by tailoring instruction and recommendations based on the goals, needs, preferences, and interests of each individual learner or team.",
  "Call for Papers": "# AIS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 7th International Conference on Adaptive Instructional Systems (AIS) will be held jointly with HCI International 2025 from **June 22-27, 2025**, at the **Gothia Towers Hotel and Swedish Exhibition & Congress Centre in Gothenburg, Sweden**.\n\n## Conference Goal\n\nThe goal of the Adaptive Instructional Systems (AIS) Conference is to understand the theory and enhance the state-of-practice for adaptive instructional systems (AISs). AISs are defined as artificially intelligent, computer-based systems that guide learning experiences by tailoring instruction and recommendations based on the goals, needs, preferences, and interests of each individual learner or team in the context of domain learning objectives.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe related topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Instructional Theories Applied to Adaptive Instruction\n*   Adaptive Systems for Learning, Education, and Training\n*   Adaptive Tools and Methods for Individual Learners and Teams\n*   Designing Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) User Interfaces (UIs) for Personalization\n*   Assessment of Learner and Team States for Adaptive Instructional Decisions\n*   Quantitative and Qualitative Measures of Learners during Adaptive Instruction\n*   Sensors and Data Sources for Assessment during Adaptive Instruction\n*   Modeling Learner States, Patterns, and Trends\n*   Theoretical Frameworks for Adaptive Instruction\n*   Learning Engineering\n*   User-Centered Design Principles for Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs)\n*   Optimizing Learning through Superior User Experiences (UXs)\n*   Role of Artificial Intelligence in Adaptive Instruction\n*   Authoring Adaptive Instructional Systems (AISs) for Cognitive, Affective, Psychomotor, and Collaborative Tasks\n*   Interaction Design for Effective Adaptive Instructional Systems\n*   Conceptual Models and Interoperability Standards for Adaptive Instructional Systems\n*   Augmentation Technologies (Tools and Methods) for Adaptive Instruction\n*   AIS User Interfaces (UIs) for Enhanced Usability, Learnability, Satisfaction, and Accessibility\n*   Evaluating the Effectiveness of Adaptive Instructional Systems\n*   Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence in Adaptive Learning Experiences\n*   Interoperability and Compatibility of AIS Technologies\n*   Adaptive Training & Education for:\n    *   Psychomotor Tasks in Live, Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality Environments\n    *   Medical Diagnoses and Intervention\n    *   STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) Education\n    *   Professional Development\n    *   AIS Use in Under-Resourced Contexts\n\n## Submission\n\nSubmission deadlines are available at the HCII 2025 website: [https://2025.hci.international/submissions.html](https://2025.hci.international/submissions.html)\n\nSubmit your Paper Proposal: [https://cms.hci.international/2025/index.php?jump_th=409656](https://cms.hci.international/2025/index.php?jump_th=409656) (Please create an account to the Conference Management System before you proceed with the submission)\n\n## Chairs\n\n*   Robert A.
