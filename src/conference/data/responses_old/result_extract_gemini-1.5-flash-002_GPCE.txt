  "Call for Papers": "# GPCE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE 2025) will be held in **Bergen, Norway from June 30 - July 4, 2025**.\n\nGPCE is a programming languages conference focusing on techniques and tools for code generation, language implementation, and product-line development. This is the 24th edition of the conference.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nGPCE seeks conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and technical contributions to its topics of interest, which include but are not limited to:\n\n*   program transformation, staging,\n*   macro systems, preprocessors,\n*   program synthesis,\n*   code-recommendation systems,\n*   domain-specific languages,\n*   generative language workbenches,\n*   language embedding, language design,\n*   domain engineering,\n*   software product lines, configurable software,\n*   feature interactions,\n*   applications and properties of code generation,\n*   language implementation,\n*   AI/ML techniques for generative programming,\n*   generative programming for AI/ML techniques,\n*   low code / no code approaches.\n\nGPCE promotes cross-fertilization between programming languages and software development and among different styles of generative programming in its broadest sense.\n\n## Paper Categories\n\nGPCE solicits four kinds of submissions:\n\n*   **Full Papers:** reporting original and unpublished results of research that contribute to scientific knowledge for any GPCE topic. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography.\n*   **Short Papers:** presenting unconventional ideas or new visions in any GPCE topics. Short paper submissions must not exceed 6 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text “(Short Paper)” appended to their titles.\n*   **Tool Demonstrations:** presenting tools for any GPCE topic. Tool demonstration submissions must have the text “(Tool Demonstration)” appended to their titles.\n*   **Generative Pearl:** an elegant essay about generative programming. Generative Pearl submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text “(Generative Pearl)” appended to their titles.\n\n## Paper Selection\n\nThe GPCE program committee will evaluate each submission according to the following selection criteria:\n\n*   Novelty\n*   Significance\n*   Evidence\n*   Clarity\n\n## Best Paper Award\n\nThe GPCE program committee will select the best paper among accepted papers. The authors of the best paper will be given the best paper award at the conference.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nAll submissions must use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”. Be sure to use the latest LaTeX templates and class files, the SIGPLAN sub-format, and 10-point font. Consult the sample-sigplan.tex template and use the document-class `\\documentclass[sigplan,anonymous,review]{acmart}`.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Submission:** March 26, 2025\n*   **Paper Submission (Extended):** April 9, 2025\n*   **Round 2 Author response deadline:** April 10, 2025\n*   **FTfJP Submission Deadline:** April 15, 2025\n*   **PLF+PLAID Submission deadline:** April 20, 2025\n*   **DEBT Submission Deadline:** April 25, 2025\n*   **VORTEX Abstract submission deadline:** April 25, 2025\n*   **Review Notification:** May 9, 2025\n*   **Round 2 Notification:** April 25, 2025\n*   **Final Notification:** May 19, 2025\n*   **Artifact submission deadline (firm):** April 28, 2025\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://gpce25.hotcrp.com/](https://gpce25.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## ACM Artifact Badges\n\nStarting the 2024 edition, we want to give authors the chance to apply for an ACM Artifact Badge. Even though the artifact submission is not mandatory, we recommend authors to submit their artifacts to reach a higher impact with their research.\n\nMore information on ACM Artifact Badges: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current)\n\n## Organizing Committee\n\n*   Nada Amin, Program Chair, Harvard University, United States\n*   Amir Shaikhha, General Co-Chair, University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n*   Sebastian Erdweg, General Co-Chair, JGU Mainz, Germany\n*   Jeremy Yallop, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Guillaume Allais, University of Strathclyde, United Kingdom\n*   Zena M.
