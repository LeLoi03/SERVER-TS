  "Call for Papers": "# AIED 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025) will take place between **July 22-26, 2025 in Palermo, Italy**.\n\n## Theme\n\n“AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future”\n\nThe AIED 2025 conference centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education. By harnessing AI’s capacity to personalize learning experiences, educators can address the diverse needs of students and mitigate educational disparities, particularly among underserved and marginalized communities. This year’s theme also underscores the critical importance of ethical AI integration, ensuring that these advanced technologies are deployed responsibly to uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and privacy.\n\n## Tracks\n\nAIED 2025 solicits empirical and theoretical papers relating to both AI and education in the following research tracks:\n\n1.  **AIED architectures and tools:**  Focuses on novel advances in engineering and development of AIED systems.  Includes multi-agent architectures, tangible interfaces, wearables, speech technologies, virtual and augmented reality, A/B experimentation platforms, and innovative learning application architectures.\n2.  **Machine learning and Generative AI:**  Covers advances in or applications of AI-based techniques within education, involving knowledge representation and machine learning. Includes natural language processing, video data mining, modeling learner processes, and evaluation techniques.\n3.  **Learning, teaching, and pedagogy:**  Addresses approaches to teaching, learning, and evaluations of AIED systems and environments. Includes AI-assisted tutoring, motivational diagnosis, learner engagement, and learning analytics.\n4.  **Human-centered design and design-based research:**  Focuses on design principles for AIED systems, and understanding contextual and individual factors influencing user interactions. Includes human-AI hybrid systems, human-AI partnership, user-centered design, and evaluation focused on human-centeredness.\n5.  **Teaching AI:**  Involves methods, principles, or technologies for teaching AI or supporting the development of AI literacy. Includes studies on skills and knowledge for understanding, using, and critically evaluating AI.\n6.  **Ethics, Equity, and AIED in Society:** Takes a broad perspective on AIED's societal impact, including ethics, equity, and inclusion. Includes studies on socio-economic, gender, and racial issues, and AIED ethical frameworks and principles.\n7.  **Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modeling for Education:** Includes conceptual or theoretical models, methods, and knowledge representation related to AIED research. Includes theoretical contributions to modeling learners, teachers, and learning processes.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\n*   **Full papers:** Present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work (12 pages excluding references; for a long oral presentation).\n*   **Short papers:** Describe novel and interesting results (6 pages excluding references; for a short oral presentation).\n\nSubmissions must follow Springer policies on publication: [https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v](https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v).\n\n## Review Process\n\nAll submissions will undergo a double-masked review process by three program committee members, followed by a metareview by a senior member.\n\n## Important Dates (full and short papers, main submission)\n\n*   **Submissions open:** December 20, 2024\n*   **Abstracts due:** February 5, 2025\n*   **Papers due:** February 12, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** March 26, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready paper due:** May 2, 2025\n\nAll deadlines are anywhere on earth (AoE).  There will be NO extensions."
