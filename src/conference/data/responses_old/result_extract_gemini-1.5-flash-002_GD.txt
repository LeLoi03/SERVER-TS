  "Call for Papers": "# GD 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 33rd International Symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization (GD 2025) will be held in **Norrköping, Sweden from September 24-26, 2025**. A pre-conference PhD school will take place on September 22-23, 2025.\n\n## Papers\n\nWe invite authors to submit papers describing original research of theoretical or practical significance to graph drawing and network visualization. To promote a balanced coverage of the field, GD has two distinct tracks, and papers submitted to one track will not compete with papers submitted to the other track. Regular papers must be submitted explicitly to one of the two tracks. However, all program committee members may review papers from either track.\n\n### Track 1: Combinatorial and algorithmic aspects\n\nThis track is mainly devoted to fundamental theoretical graph drawing advances, such as combinatorial and algorithmic aspects. Topics include (but are not limited to):\n\n*   Design and analysis of graph drawing algorithms\n*   Geometric and topological graph theory\n*   Computational topology of graphs on surfaces\n*   Graph representations\n*   Geometric advances and computing in graph drawing\n*   Combinatorics and optimization in graph drawing\n\n### Track 2: Experimental, applied, and network visualization aspects\n\nThis track is mainly devoted to the practical aspects of graph drawing, such as experimental evaluations of graph drawing related algorithms, the development and/or evaluation of related libraries and tools, or systems and interfaces in different application areas. Topics include (but are not limited to):\n\n*   Engineering of graph drawing algorithms and network visualization systems\n*   Interfaces, methods, and high-quality tools for interacting with graphs and networks\n*   Benchmarks and experimental studies in the context of graph drawing and network visualization\n*   Cognitive studies on network visualization aesthetics and user interaction\n*   Visualization of networks in real-world applications\n*   Machine learning methods in graph drawing & network visualization\n*   Graph drawing & network visualization for AI explainability\n\nAuthors of accepted applied papers are encouraged to show a demo of their software/system during the poster session.\n\n### Short Papers\n\nIn addition to the above two tracks, there will be a separate category for short papers. Here we welcome smaller and less elaborate contributions on relevant topics.\n\n## Remote Presentation\n\nFor authors who cannot present their paper in person, we offer the possibility for remote presentation, which must be declared at submission time. Authors of accepted papers in this category have to register for the conference. Papers in this category are evaluated and selected by the program committee by applying the same high standards as for the other tracks. In addition, the authors have to submit a recording of their presentation two weeks after the submission of the paper. The remote submission chair can influence the score of papers in this track based on the quality of the recorded talk and even reject submissions if the quality of the recorded talk is inappropriate. There is a limit of six remote presentations.\n\n## Posters & Contest\n\nSubmissions of posters on graph drawing, network visualization, and related areas are solicited. The poster session will provide a forum for the communication of late-breaking research results (which may also appear elsewhere) to the GD community. Authors of posters should prepare an abstract that must be submitted together with the poster itself. Each submission will thus consist of two PDF files (the abstract and the poster).\n\nDetails about the traditional Graph Drawing Contest, which is held at the conference, are provided at the [website](https://mozart.diei.unipg.it/gdcontest/2025/).\n\n## Rules for Submission\n\n*   Results that have been previously published (or are scheduled for publication) in another conference proceedings or journal, as well as simultaneous submissions of results to other conferences with published proceedings or journals are not permitted, except for poster submissions.\n*   With the exception of remote presentations, each paper or poster must be presented at the conference by an author, otherwise the paper can be excluded from publication in the proceedings.\n*   ChatGPT and similar large language models may be used to improve the paper’s language, but its use should be mentioned as a footnote and the authors remain responsible for the full paper. In particular, the unattributed use of any such tools in the creation of the paper’s scientific content is forbidden.\n\n## Submission Format\n\nThe proceedings will be published in the LIPIcs series. Submissions have to be prepared in accordance with the [LIPIcs author instructions](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author).\n\n*   For the submission, the use of the LaTeX class file [gd-lipics-v2.cls](../../assets/template/gd-lipics-v2.cls) is requested.\n*   Submissions must not exceed the following limits:\n    *   500 lines for full papers\n    *   225 lines for short papers\n    *   80 lines for posters’ abstracts\n*   The above limits do not include front matter (title, authors, and affiliations), references, or appendices.\n*   In addition, the main content of the paper must not exceed the following page limits excluding references:\n    *   15 pages for long papers\n    *   7 pages for short papers\n    *   3 pages for posters’ abstracts\n\n## Paper Submission, Proceedings, and Special Issues\n\nPapers should be submitted electronically via [Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gd2025).\n\nThe proceedings will be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series and are available open access. Selected papers from both tracks will be invited for submission to a special issue of the Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications (JGAA). The authors of two selected papers in Track 2 will be invited to submit a substantially extended and enhanced version of their work to IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG).\n\n## Lightweight Double-Blind Review Process\n\nThe review process will be handled in a lightweight double-blind mode. This means that authors are not allowed to reveal their identity in the submitted paper, but are free to disseminate draft versions of the paper prior to the conference and to give talks on the topic as they normally would.\n\n## Awards\n\nFor each of the two tracks, the Program Committee of GD 2025 will bestow a Best Paper Award. In addition, to recognize the effort of participants to present their work and to prepare their posters in a clear and elegant way, there will be a Best Presentation Award and a Best Poster Award voted on by the GD 2025 attendees.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are understood to be 23:59 AoE.\n\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** June 3, 2025\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** June 10, 2025\n*   **Notification of paper acceptance:** July 23, 2025\n*   **Poster submission deadline:** August 22, 2025\n*   **Notification of poster acceptance:** September 1, 2025\n*   **Final versions due:** TBA\n*   **Symposium:** September 24–26, 2025"
