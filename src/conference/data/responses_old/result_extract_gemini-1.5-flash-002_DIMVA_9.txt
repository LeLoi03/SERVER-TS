  "Call for Papers": "# DIMVA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 22nd Conference on Detection of Intrusions and Malware & Vulnerability Assessment (DIMVA '25) will be held from **July 9 to 11, 2025 at Graz University of Technology, Austria.**\n\nDIMVA serves as a premier forum for advancing the state of the art in the broader areas of intrusion detection, malware analysis, and vulnerability assessment. Each year, DIMVA brings together international experts from academia, industry, and government to present and discuss novel research in these areas.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nDIMVA solicits submissions of high-quality, original scientific papers presenting novel research on malware analysis, intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, and related systems security topics. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n**Intrusions:**\n\n*   Novel approaches and domains\n*   Insider detection\n*   Prevention and response\n*   Data leakage, exfiltration, and poisoning\n*   Result correlation and cooperation\n*   Evasion and other attacks\n*   Potentials and limitation\n*   Operational experiences\n*   Privacy, legal, and social aspects\n*   Targeted attacks\n*   Analysis or detection of cryptocurrency heists\n\n**Malware:**\n\n*   Automated analyses\n*   Behavioral models\n*   Prevention and containment\n*   Classification\n*   Lineage\n*   Forensics and recovery\n*   Underground economy\n*   Vulnerabilities in malware\n*   Financially targeted malware (e.g., ransomware, DeFi)\n\n**Vulnerability Detection:**\n\n*   Vulnerability prevention\n*   Vulnerability analysis\n*   Exploitation and defenses\n*   Hardware vulnerabilities\n*   Situational awareness\n*   Active probing\n*   Vulnerabilities in decentralized systems\n\n## Types of Submissions Solicited\n\nWe invite **full papers** for submission that present novel and mature research results. Full papers are limited to 20 pages in Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and appendices. Papers that do not follow these formatting guidelines may be rejected without review.\n\nWhile we do not accept short papers, we encourage authors to submit a poster instead, presenting original, still ongoing work that has not yet reached the maturity required for a full paper. For more information, please refer to the Call for Posters.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nDIMVA 2025 will adopt a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations must be excluded from the paper. Furthermore, authors should avoid obvious self-references, and should cite their own previous work in third person, whenever necessary. Papers that are not properly anonymized risk being rejected without review.\n\nSubmissions must be original work and may not be under submission to another venue at the time of review. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to physically present the submitted work at the conference, for the paper to be included in the proceedings.\n\n## Important Dates (AoE)\n\n**Cycle 1:**\n\n*   Submission: December 10, 2024 (extended!)\n*   Notification (accept/reject): January 27, 2025 (extended!)\n*   Submission Site: [https://dimva25.hotcrp.com/](https://dimva25.hotcrp.com/)\n\n**Cycle 2:**\n\n*   Submission: February 19, 2024 (extended!)\n*   Notification (accept/reject): April 2, 2025\n*   Submission Site: [https://dimva25r2.hotcrp.com/](https://dimva25r2.hotcrp.com/)\n\n*   Camera-ready deadline: April 30, 2025\n*   Conference: July 9 to 11, 2025\n\n## Call for Posters\n\nHigh-quality posters facilitate discussions about recent research findings, encourage meaningful interactions with interested attendees, showcase ongoing projects, and present innovative ideas. DIMVA invites submissions of posters that highlight preliminary results, ongoing work, or recently published research.\n\n*   Submission: up to April 11th, 2025\n*   Notification: April 21st, 2025\n*   Camera-ready: April 30th, 2025\n*   Submission System: [https://dimva25posters.hotcrp.com/](https://dimva25posters.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\nSubmissions that report experiments with data gathered from human subjects should disclose whether the research received approval from an institutional ethics review board (IRB), if applicable, and what measures were adopted to minimize risks to privacy.\n\nSubmissions that describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties (e.g., in case of probing of network devices), and how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software or system vendors or owners before publication.\n\n## Contact\n\nIf you have any questions, please contact the program chairs at [pc-chairs@dimva.org](mailto:pc-chairs@dimva.org)."
