The conference is organized by the COAL research group of the Instituto de Computación (InCo), FING, UdelaR. ICPM is the leading event for process mining, where key actors such as vendors, consultants, customers, end-users, students, and researchers can meet to discuss ideas, share insights, foster innovation, and explore new frontiers in the field.",
  "Call for Papers": "# ICPM 2025: Call for Research Papers\n\nThe International Conference on Process Mining (ICPM) is the leading global forum for researchers, practitioners, and developers in process mining. The 7th edition of ICPM will be held in **Montevideo, Uruguay, from October 20-24, 2025**.\n\n## Topics for Research Papers\n\nICPM 2025 invites groundbreaking contributions in both technical and empirical process mining research. Submissions should clearly articulate their contributions and novelty. Unless they are purely formal or conceptual, papers are expected to include evaluations (in case of technical papers) or present newly collected data (in case of empirical papers). To enhance replicability and impact, authors are strongly encouraged to provide supplementary resources, such as used datasets, publicly accessible implementations, and experimental packages for empirical studies.\n\nICPM 2025 welcomes submissions across a broad spectrum of topics, including but not limited to:\n\n### Technical Research in Process Mining\n\n*   Novel process mining techniques for:\n    *   Process discovery\n    *   Conformance checking\n    *   Performance measurement\n    *   Predictive and prescriptive process monitoring\n    *   Comparative process analysis\n    *   Formal foundations of process mining\n    *   Conceptual models related to process mining\n    *   Process mining visualizations\n### Empirical Research in Process Mining\n\n*   Case studies and applications\n*   Experiments involving process mining algorithms\n*   Humans-in-the-loop experiments\n*   Surveys\n*   Interview-based studies\n\n## Types of Contributions & Submission Instructions\n\nICPM 2025 welcomes two types of contributions:\n\n1.  **Regular Research Papers:** Regular research papers should present completed research with clearly outlined contributions. Accepted regular research papers will be presented in the main track of the conference. Length: Maximum of 8 pages. Format: Papers must follow the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society conference proceedings guidelines (8.5″ × 11″, two-column format). Templates for LaTeX and Word are available here: [https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)\n2.  **Posters:** Poster submissions provide a platform for presenting new ideas or ongoing, promising work. Authors can gather feedback and engage with the community in a dedicated poster session. Poster papers will be reviewed but not published in the conference proceedings. Length: Maximum of 4 pages. Format: Use the IEEE templates provided above. In addition, authors of poster submissions should add “(Poster)” to the title of their submission to clearly distinguish them as such.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   All submissions must be original and not submitted elsewhere during the review process.\n*   The use of AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of the paper. Any sections utilizing AI-generated content must include citations to the AI system used.\n*   Submissions should be made through the ICPM 2025 submission system at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icpm2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icpm2025) (ICPM 2025 track).\n*   All papers must be written in English.\n\n## Review Process\n\nEach submission will be reviewed by at least one senior process committee member and two additional reviewers. A discussion period will follow the reviews to finalize decisions.\n\n## Presentation and Copyright\n\nAt least one author of each accepted contribution is required to register for the conference, present their work, and sign a copyright release form.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 23:59 AoE, i.e., Anywhere on Earth.\n\n*   **Research Papers**\n    *   Abstract submission: May 15, 2025\n    *   Paper submission: May 22, 2025\n    *   Notification: July 11, 2025\n    *   Camera-ready: August 22, 2025\n*   **Workshop Papers**\n    *   Workshop proposal deadline: February 14, 2025\n    *   Acceptance/rejection/negotiation notification: March 7, 2025\n    *   Abstract Submission: July 18, 2025\n    *   Papers Submission: July 25, 2025\n    *   Paper Acceptance Notification: August 22, 2025\n    *   Pre-workshop Camera-Ready Papers: September 22, 2025\n    *   Workshops: October 20, 2025\n    *   Post-workshop Camera-Ready Papers: November 4, 2025\n*   **Demo Papers**\n    *   Extended abstract submission: August 15, 2025\n    *   Notification of Acceptance: September 9, 2025\n    *   Camera-Ready: September 23, 2025\n*   **Doctoral Consortium**\n    *   Submission deadline: August 1, 2025\n    *   Notification of acceptance: September 11, 2025\n    *   Camera-ready due: September 23, 2025\n*   **Best PhD Thesis**\n    *   Application submission deadline: July 11, 2025\n    *   Winner announcement: During ICPM 2025\n*   **Process Discovery Contest**\n    *   Submission deadline: September 12, 2025\n    *   Disclosure of the data set: September 13, 2025\n    *   Winner notification: September 19, 2025\n    *   Winner announcement: During ICPM 2025\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n*   Hajo Reijers, Utrecht University, Netherlands\n*   Jana-Rebecca Rehse, University of Mannheim, Germany\n*   Jochen De Weerdt, KU Leuven, Belgium"
