  "Call for Papers": "# SAC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) has been a primary gathering forum for applied computer scientists, computer engineers, software engineers, and application developers from around the world. SAC 2025 is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP), and will be held in **Catania, Sicily, Italy**.\n\n## Intelligent Robotics and Multi-Agent Systems (IRMAS) Track\n\nThe technical track on Intelligent Robotics and Multi-Agent Systems (IRMAS) will be organized for the eleventh time in SAC 2025, exploiting the inherent synergy between Robotics and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), thus aiming to bring together these highly related and exciting research fields.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\n*   Autonomous robots\n*   Multi-agent systems (MAS)\n*   Multi-robot systems and cooperative robots\n*   Distributed coordination and optimization\n*   Swarm robotics and bio-inspired intelligence\n*   Robot localization, mapping and navigation\n*   Deployment, coverage and patrolling\n*   Informative planning and adaptive sampling\n*   Sensor fusion and multimodal perception\n*   Cooperative and distributed perception\n*   Self-adaptation, deep learning and reinforcement learning\n*   Collaborative robots\n*   Real-world applications of MAS\n*   Human-robot interaction\n*   Human multi-robot interaction\n*   Human-swarm interaction\n*   Field robotics\n*   MAS in mobile ad-hoc sensor networks\n*   Social and service robotics\n*   Microrobotics and nanorobotics\n*   Entertainment and educational robots\n*   Simulation and programming tools for MAS\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper Submission:** October 13, 2024 (deadline extended – final deadline)\n*   **Author Notification:** November 20, 2024\n*   **Camera-ready copies:** November 29, 2024\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nOriginal papers addressing any of the listed topics of interest (or related topics) will be considered. Each submitted paper will be fully refereed and undergo a blind review process by at least three referees. Paper size is limited to 8 pages. A maximum of 2 additional pages may be included for an additional fee. The reviews will be double-blind: authors’ names and affiliations must not appear in the paper, self-citations should be in the third person, and authors must avoid disclosing their identity by any means.\n\nFor accepted papers, registration for the conference is required by at least one of the authors or a proxy, who must attend SAC and present the paper in person. This is a strict requirement for the paper to be included in the ACM SAC 2025 proceedings.\n\nGraduate students are invited to submit research abstracts (maximum 4 pages) to the Student Research Competition (SRC).\n\n## Track Chair\n\n*   Rui P.
