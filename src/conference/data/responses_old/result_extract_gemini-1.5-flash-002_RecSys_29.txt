  "Call for Papers": "# RecSys 2025: Call for Contributions\n\nThe 19th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys 2025) will take place from **September 22 to 26, 2025, in Prague, Czech Republic**.\n\nRecSys is the leading conference for research on the foundations and applications of recommendation technologies.\n\n## Call for Full Papers\n\nWe welcome high-impact original papers that contribute to all aspects of recommender systems.  The RecSys community values recommender systems’ human and economic impacts as much as the underlying algorithms.  We prioritize the quality of submitted work and place greater emphasis on the impact of each contribution.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Submissions will be handled electronically via EasyChair.\n*   The abstract is due by April 1st, 2025 (required), and the full paper is expected by April 8th, 2025.\n*   Submissions should be anonymous and will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee and overseen by a Senior PC member.\n*   There will be a rebuttal phase.\n*   At the time of submission, information for all authors and authorship order must be established — no changes will be allowed after the review process begins.\n*   Authors must declare conflicts of interest with PC and SPC members before submitting the full paper.\n*   RecSys 2025 has a no dual submission policy.\n*   Contributions must be self-contained, limited to 8 pages (using the ACM 2-column template), with up to 2 pages for references.  Appendices also count towards the 8-page limit. No supplementary materials will be accepted.\n*   At least one author from each accepted submission must attend the conference in person to present their work and participate in the Q&A session. Remote presentations or videos will not be permitted for accepted contributions.\n\n## Important Dates for Full Papers\n\nDeadlines refer to 23:59 (11:59 pm) in the AoE (Anywhere on Earth) time zone.\n\n*   **Full paper abstracts due:** April 1, 2025\n*   **Full papers due:** April 8, 2025\n*   **Author rebuttal period for Full papers:** May 20-26, 2025\n*   **Full paper notifications:** July 3, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready due:** July 21, 2025 (strict)\n\n## Relevant Areas & Topics\n\n*   Human-centered recommendation approaches\n*   Adaptive algorithms\n*   Explanation methods and interfaces\n*   Human-in-the-loop model learning and validation\n*   Innovative user interfaces\n*   Novel interaction paradigms\n*   Novel methods for improving explainability\n*   Novel methods for preference elicitation\n*   Novel perspectives on transparency\n*   Studies on real-time events influence on preferences\n*   User control of RecSys\n*   User experiments and studies of recommendation applications\n*   Societal recommender systems\n*   Adapting recommendation algorithms to suit different cultural contexts and multilingual users\n*   Addressing global digital divides\n*   Bias, fairness, bubbles, and ethics of recommender systems\n*   Diversity and inclusion models\n*   Eco-aware recommendation models\n*   Ensuring equitable access to digital resources\n*   Implications of recommendation algorithms when the main stakeholders are understudied populations\n*   Recommendation models for sustainable tourism\n*   Studying the effects of recommendation systems on cultural and global diversity lenses\n*   Supporting understudied communities by elevating diverse and underrepresented content\n*   Sustainable Recommender Systems Development\n*   Computational innovations, evaluation, and real-world applications\n*   Building large-scale, standardized datasets for benchmarking algorithms\n*   Case studies of real-world implementations\n*   Conversational and natural language recommender systems\n*   Cross-domain recommendation\n*   Design of usability studies\n*   Economic models and consequences of recommender systems\n*   Generative models in recommender systems\n*   Legal and regulatory aspects of recommender systems\n*   Knowledge-based recommender systems\n*   Multimodal approaches for recommendation\n*   Multi-stakeholder recommendations\n*   Novel evaluation metrics beyond accuracy\n*   Privacy and security\n*   Recommendation models for education and learning-related technologies\n*   Studies that investigate the relationship between evaluation metrics and real-world outcomes\n*   Tailoring recommendations for applications beyond e-commerce\n\n## Formatting\n\nACM’s archival publication format separates content from presentation in the Digital Library to enhance accessibility and improve the flexibility and resiliency of our publications. All authors should submit manuscripts for review in a double-column format.\n\n## Review Process\n\nRecSys follows a mutually anonymous review process. Papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee and overseen by a Senior PC member.\n\n## Authorship Policy & Conflict of Interests\n\nAuthors are strongly encouraged to carefully review ACM’s authorship policy before submitting their papers. All authors must be listed in the correct order in EasyChair by the submission deadline.\n\n## Anonymity\n\nThe peer review process is mutually anonymous. This means that all submissions must not include any information that identifies the authors or their organizations.\n\n## Pre-print Policy\n\nPlease carefully consider pre-print constraints. Any violation of this policy could cause your paper to be desk-rejected.\n\n## Use of AI Policy\n\nAuthors must follow the ACM Policy on the use of generative AI software tools.\n\n## Plagiarism Policy\n\nPlagiarism is a matter that we take very seriously.\n\n## Ethical Review for Human-Subjects Research\n\nACM RecSys expects all authors to comply with ethical and regulatory guidelines associated with human subjects research.\n\n## Desk Rejection Policy\n\nSubmissions that do not meet the requirements for anonymity, length, or formatting; violate dual submission policy and/or any of ACM’s policies on use of AI or academic dishonesty—such as plagiarism, author misrepresentation, or falsification—may be rejected by the chairs without further consideration.\n\n## Publication and Open Access\n\nBy submitting a manuscript to an ACM Publication, authors acknowledge that they are subject to all ACM Publications Policies.\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n*   Marco de Gemmis, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Italy\n*   Sole Pera, TU Delft, The Netherlands\n\n## Call for Short Papers\n\nWe welcome high-impact original papers that contribute to all aspects of recommender systems.\n\n## Important Dates for Short Papers\n\nDeadlines refer to 23:59 (11:59 pm) in the AoE (Anywhere on Earth) time zone.\n\n*   **Short paper abstracts due:** April 22, 2025\n*   **Short papers due:** April 29, 2025\n*   **Author rebuttal period for Short papers:** June 5-10, 2025\n*   **Short paper notifications:** July 3, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready due:** July 21, 2025 (strict)\n\n## Call for Reproducibility Papers\n\nThe reproducibility of empirical results is a cornerstone of scientific research and a prerequisite to ensure continuous progress in our field. ACM RecSys 2025 therefore strongly encourages submissions that replicate or analyze prior works in similar or alternative settings or contribute to an increased level of reproducibility in the future.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nDeadlines refer to 23:59 (11:59 pm) in the AoE (Anywhere on Earth) time zone.\n\n*   **Full papers:**\n    *   Abstr.: April 1, 2025\n    *   Paper: April 8, 2025\n
