  "Call for Papers": "# CHI 2025: Call for Participation\n\nThe ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems will take place in **Yokohama, Japan, from April 26 to May 1, 2025**, at the **PACIFICO Yokohama**. The conference will also support remote attendance.\n\n## Theme\n\nThe conference embraces the theme of Ikigai, a Japanese concept referring to what gives a person a sense of purpose, a reason for living. The CHI community consists of people with many passions and talents, people from different disciplines and walks of life. In harnessing our ‘Ikigai’ into a communal ‘IkiCHI’ we can be greater than the sum of our efforts and offer unique contributions to solving the difficult challenges ahead.\n\n## Submission Venues and Details\n\nCHI 2025 offers authors a number of ways to publish and present work, interact, discuss, and learn, along with dedicated opportunities for students.
