  "Call for Papers": "# MASCOTS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 33rd International Symposium on the Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation of Computer and Telecommunication Systems (MASCOTS 2025) will take place from **October 21-23, 2025**, at the **Amphithéâtre Roussy, Sorbonne University in Paris, France.**\n\nThe MASCOTS conference is a well-established forum for state-of-the-art research on the measurement, modeling, and performance analysis of computer systems and networks.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include (but are not limited to):\n\n*   Big data and advanced machine learning techniques for system design, optimization, and cybersecurity\n*   Cloud/edge/fog technologies\n*   Combining quality of service and cybersecurity in system performance\n*   Computer architectures, multi-core processors, accelerators (e.g., GPUs), and memory systems\n*   Computer networks, protocols, and algorithms\n*   Databases and big data systems and technologies\n*   Internet-of-Things\n*   Mobile systems\n*   Multimedia systems\n*   Operating systems and virtualization technologies\n*   Security in computer and communication systems\n*   Smart grids and cyber-physical systems\n*   Social networks\n*   Storage and file systems\n*   Sustainable (or energy-efficient) computing\n*   Web systems, enterprise applications, and web services\n*   Wireless, mobile, ad-hoc, and sensor networks\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nPapers should be submitted through EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mascots2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mascots2025)\n\nAll submissions must be formatted in IEEE style using two-columns and may be up to 8 pages in length, including tables, figures, appendices, and references. Guidelines regarding paper formatting are available at the IEEE Manuscript Templates for Conference Proceedings. If using LaTeX, we suggest using the following: `\\documentclass[10pt,conference,letterpaper]{IEEEtran}`.\n\n*   Single blind review process will be used; the authors’ names may be present within the pdf files submitted for review.\n*   Papers must be unpublished and must not be submitted or under review for publication elsewhere.\n*   Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore, subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements.\n*   Accepted papers will only be included in the program if there is one distinct registered author per paper.\n*   A selection of accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended version to the prestigious Performance Evaluation (PEVA) journal.\n*   Some of the best submitted papers that fall below the acceptance threshold for the main conference program will be invited to the MASCOTS’25 Workshop. If they are orally live presented at the workshop by one registered author, they will then be published in the MASCOTS’25 proceedings as 4-page short papers.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** May 18th, 2025 AoE\n*   **Notifications:** August 8th, 2025\n*   **Author registration deadline:** September 5th, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready:** September 12th, 2025"
