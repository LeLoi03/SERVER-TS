"Call for Papers": "# ICGT 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 18th International Conference on Graph Transformation (ICGT 2025) will be held in **Koblenz, Germany, from June 11-12, 2025**, co-located with STAF 2025.\n\n## Aims and Scope\n\nThe use of graphs and graph-like structures as a formalism for specification and modelling is widespread in all areas of computer science as well as in many fields of computational research and engineering.  ICGT aims at fostering exchange and collaboration of researchers from different backgrounds working with graphs and graph transformation, either in contributing to their theoretical foundations or by applying established formalisms to classical or novel areas.\n\n## Tracks\n\nICGT 2025 has two tracks:\n\n*   ICGT Research Papers\n*   ICGT Journal-First\n\n## Submission Types\n\nAuthors are invited to submit research papers in three possible categories. The accepted papers will be published as an LNCS volume.\n\n1.  **Regular research papers:** including papers describing applications and case studies. Papers will be evaluated with respect to their originality, significance, and technical soundness. Additional material intended for reviewers (but not publication) may be included in a clearly marked appendix. **16 pages** in the LNCS style, excluding references and appendices.\n2.  **Tool presentation papers:** which demonstrate the main features and functionality of graph-based tools. A tool presentation may have an appendix with a detailed demo description which will be reviewed but not included in the proceedings. **8 pages** in the LNCS style, excluding references and appendices.\n3.  **Blue Skies:** reporting on new research directions or ideas which are not yet sufficiently developed to fit in other categories. **8 pages** in the LNCS style, excluding references and appendices.\n\nFurthermore, there will also be a **Journal-First track** allowing for previously published work (in book chapters, journals, or other conferences since 2021) to be presented at ICGT 2025.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are by end-of-day, AoE (UTC-12h).\n\n*   **Abstracts:** February 4, 2025 (extended)\n*   **Paper Submission:** February 11, 2025 (extended)\n*   **ICGT Journal-First Paper Submission:** April 22, 2025\n*   **Notification:** March 25, 2025\n*   **ICGT Journal-First Notification:** April 29, 2025\n*   **Final version due:** April 15, 2025\n*   **Conference:** June 11-12, 2025\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=staf2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=staf2025)\n\n## Special Issue\n\nAuthors of the best papers at the conference will be invited to prepare and submit extended journal versions to be considered for publication in a special issue after an independent round of peer review (details TBA)."
