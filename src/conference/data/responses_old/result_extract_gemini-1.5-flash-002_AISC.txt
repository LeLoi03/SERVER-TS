  "Call for Papers": "# AISC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Australasian Information Security Conference (AISC 2025) will be held as part of Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW 2025, [http://acsw.core.edu.au/](http://acsw.core.edu.au/)) on **February 13, 2025**.\n\nAISC 2025 welcomes contributions from various fields, including system security, network security, cybersecurity, and cryptology. The accepted papers will be submitted to the ACM library.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nAuthors are invited to submit original research papers on provable and practical security. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Provable security for asymmetric cryptography\n*   Provable security for symmetric cryptography\n*   Provable security for physical attacks\n*   Privacy and anonymity technologies\n*   Secure cryptographic protocols and applications\n*   Security notions, approaches, and paradigms\n*   Leakage-resilient cryptography\n*   Lattice-based cryptography and post-quantum cryptography\n*   Steganography and steganalysis\n*   Blockchain and cryptocurrency\n*   IoT security\n*   Cloud security\n*   Access control\n*   Privacy-enhancing technologies\n*   Database security\n*   Big data security and privacy\n*   Biometric security\n*   Network security\n*   Formal methods for security\n*   Embedded systems security\n*   Lightweight security\n*   Cyber-physical security\n*   ML security\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Author instructions and LaTeX/Word templates for ACM publications can be found at: [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)\n*   Papers should be submitted via EasyChair at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acsw2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=acsw2025)\n*   All submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted to another conference or journal for consideration of publication.\n*   Submissions must be fully anonymous with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references.\n*   Submissions must be written in English and have at most 20 pages including bibliography using the ACM package with no changes to the style. Submissions can exceed 20 pages, but any content beyond 20 pages should be placed in the Appendix.\n\n## New OA Publishing Model for ICPS\n\nIn the new model, all ICPS papers published in the DL will automatically be made OA, and production/OA fees will no longer be charged to conference organizers. Papers that fall into the following categories will be published in the DL at no charge:\n\n*   If the corresponding author is affiliated with an institution participating in ACM’s transformative ACM Open model. A list of the 700+ institutions currently participating in ACM Open is available [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/open-access/acm-open-access-program).\n*   If the country in which your institution is located is on [this list of countries](https://www.acm.org/publications/open-access/acm-open-access-program) covered by ACM’s agreements with EIFL and Research4Life and/or classified by the World Bank as low-income countries.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper Submission:** November 15, 2024\n*   **Notification:** December 26, 2024\n*   **Camera-ready:** January 10, 2025\n*   **Conference date:** February 13, 2025"
