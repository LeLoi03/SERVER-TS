  "Call for Papers": "# ACM CCS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) will be held in **Taipei, Taiwan from October 13-17, 2025.**\n\nCCS seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice.\n\n## Review Cycles\n\nCCS has two review cycles in 2025. For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:\n\n*   **Accept:** Papers will be accepted for publication and presentation at the conference, possibly after minor changes.\n*   **Minor revision:** Papers are promising but need minor additional work. Authors will be given the opportunity to resubmit.\n*   **Reject:** Papers are declined.\n\nPapers rejected from the first review cycle may not be submitted again to the second review cycle.\n\n## Paper Submission Information\n\n*   All submissions must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the corresponding deadline.\n*   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings.\n*   All submissions should be properly anonymized.\n*   Authors may submit up to a maximum of 7 papers for Cycle B.\n\n## Mandatory Reviewing\n\nAuthors submitting 3 papers or more may be required to submit reviews for other papers at CCS 2025. Authors who fall into this category will be requested to provide information for review matching and complete an attestation for reviewing ethics. Authors failing to provide the requested information may see their paper desk-rejected.\n\n## Withdrawing Policy\n\nA paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper cannot be withdrawn.\n\n## Paper Format\n\nSubmissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format using \"sigconf\" 2-column format, no more than 12 pages long, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.\n\n## Providing Artifacts at Submission Time\n\nSubmissions whose claimed contributions rely on artifacts (e.g., code, models, data sets) are expected to make these accessible to the reviewers, unless there are good reasons not to, in which case these reasons must be mentioned in the submission.\n\n## Optional Artifact Evaluation\n\nA special call for artifacts will follow. All authors of accepted papers (including shepherd approved and minor revisions) are encouraged to submit artifacts for AE.\n\n## Conference Tracks\n\nACM CCS features a multi-track format. Each track operates as a separate mini-conference, with its own Track Chairs and Track Program Committee.  At the time of submission, authors must select one track.\n\n### Program Co-Chairs\n\n*   David Lie (University of Toronto)\n*   VÃ©ronique Cortier (CNRS, Loria)\n\n### Track Chairs\n\n*   Software Security\n*   Web Security\n*   Network Security\n*   Security Usability and Measurement\n*   Machine Learning and Security\n*   Formal Methods and Programming Languages\n*   Hardware, Side Channels, and Cyber Physical Systems\n*   Applied Cryptography\n*   Blockchain and Distributed Systems\n*   Privacy and Anonymity\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe conference requires cooperation from both authors and program committee members to ensure a fair review process. Authors must report all program committee members who, in their opinion, have a conflict of interest.\n\n## Policy for Peer-Review Integrity\n\nAll SIGSAC-sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. All authors, PC members, and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies.\n\n## Important Dates - First Review Cycle\n\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** January 2, 2025 (Mandatory)\n*   **Full paper submission deadline:** January 9, 2025\n*   **Notification of early-rejection papers:** February 10, 2025\n*   **Author rebuttal period:** March 3-6, 2025\n*   **Rebuttal deadline:** March 6, 2025\n*   **Author notification:** March 28, 2025\n\n## Important Dates - Second Review Cycle\n\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** April 7, 2025 (Mandatory)\n*   **Full paper submission deadline:** April 14, 2025\n*   **Notification of early-rejection papers:** May 16, 2025\n*   **Author rebuttal period:** June 5-10, 2025\n*   **Rebuttal deadline:** June 10, 2025\n*   **Author notification:** July 1, 2025\n\n## Submission Site\n\n*   **Cycle A:** [https://ccs2025a.hotcrp.com/](https://ccs2025a.hotcrp.com/)\n*   **Cycle B:** [https://ccs2025b.hotcrp.com/](https://ccs2025b.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Visa Information\n\nFor potential CCS attendees, please check this link for applying for a VISA or entry permit (if applicable): [https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/visa/#china](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/visa/#china)"
