  "Call for Papers": "# PKAW 2024: Call for Papers\n\nThe Principle and Practice of Data and Knowledge Acquisition Workshop (PKAW 2024) was held at the 21st Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence (PRICAI 2024) in **Kyoto, Japan in November 2024**.\n\nPKAW provides a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss the state-of-the-art in the areas of knowledge acquisition and machine intelligence (MI, also Artificial Intelligence, AI).\n\n## Areas of Interest\n\nAll aspects of AI, machine learning, knowledge acquisition, data engineering, and management for intelligent systems including (but not restricted to):\n\n*   **Knowledge Acquisition:** Fundamental views on knowledge, algorithmic approaches, tools and techniques, evaluation of techniques, tools and methods, ontology and its role, knowledge acquisition applications\n*   **Knowledge Representation and Discovering:** Knowledge representation learning, temporal knowledge graph, data linkage, data analytics and mining, big data acquisition and analysis, machine learning/deep learning, Semantic Web, the Linked Data and the Web of Data\n*   **Responsible Data/Knowledge Management and System:** Transparency, explainability, trust, and accountability, privacy and security, other ethical concerns\n*   **Knowledge-aware Application:** Question answering, recommendation system, domain-related application\n*   **Human-centric Knowledge Engineering:** Human-machine collaboration, integration, interaction, delegation, dialog, hybrid approaches combining knowledge engineering and machine learning\n*   **Other Topics:** Experience and lesson learned, reproducibility and negative results of knowledge engineering, innovative user interfaces, crowd-sourcing for data generation and problem solving\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nPKAW will not accept any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for, has already been published in, or has already been accepted for publication in, a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. If part of the work has been previously published, authors are strongly encouraged to cite and compare/contrast the new contributions with the parts that were already published before. The paper must substantially extend the previously published work.\n\nPKAW 2024 adopts a single-blind rule for the reviewing process, i.e., the authors do not know the names of the reviewers, but the reviewers can infer the names of the authors from the submission.\n\nProceedings of PKAW 2024 will be published by Springer as a volume of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series. All papers for the review should be submitted electronically using the conference management tool in PDF format and formatted using the Springer LNAI template. The main content of the paper should not exceed 12 pages long (excluding references). For accepted papers, the LaTeX source files and a camera-ready version are required to be submitted using the Springer LNAI template. For Springer LNAI format templates, please visit the Springer’s website below.\n\n[Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) Template](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[PKAW 2024 Paper Submission Site](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PKAW2024)\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are at the end of the day specified, anywhere on Earth (UTC-12).\n\n*   **Paper Submission:** August 1, 2024\n*   **Acceptance Notification:** September 15, 2024\n*   **Camera-Ready Submission:** September 22, 2024\n*   **Workshop Date:** November 18-19, 2024\n\n## Contact\n\nFor any questions, please contact Dr. Shiqing Wu ([shiqing.wu@uts.edu.au](mailto:shiqing.wu@uts.edu.au)) and Dr. Xing Su ([xingsu@bjut.edu.cn](mailto:xingsu@bjut.edu.cn))."
