  "Summary": "The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH 2025) will be held in Singapore from October 12-18, 2025.  SPLASH 2025 will be co-located with ICFP and its satellite events.",
  "Call for Papers": "# OOPSLA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming systems, languages, and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.\n\n## OOPSLA 2025 Review Process\n\nPACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing. Each paper will typically receive three or more reviews. You will get an opportunity to respond to these reviews before decisions are finalized.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are firm and are Anywhere on Earth (AoE).\n\n### Round 1\n\n*   **Submission:** October 15, 2024\n*   **Author Response:** December 3 - 6, 2024\n*   **Author Notification:** December 18, 2024\n*   **Revision Submission:** February 4, 2025\n*   **Author Notification:** February 18, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready:** February 28, 2025\n*   **OOPSLA Artifacts Notification Round 1:** February 21, 2025\n*   **OOPSLA Artifacts Submission Round 1:** January 3, 2025\n*   **OOPSLA Artifacts Kick-the-Tires Round 1:** January 6 - 17, 2025\n\n### Round 2\n\n*   **Submission:** March 25, 2025\n*   **Author Response:** May 26 - 29, 2025\n*   **Author Notification:** June 18, 2025\n*   **Submission of Revisions:** July 29, 2025\n*   **Author Notification of Revisions:** August 12, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready:** August 22, 2025\n*   **OOPSLA Artifacts Submission Round 2:** June 27, 2025\n*   **OOPSLA Artifacts Kick-the-Tires Round 2:** June 30 - July 11, 2025\n*   **OOPSLA Artifacts Notification Round 2:** August 15, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   **Template:** Use the ACM template. Use `\\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review]{acmart}` at the top of your paper.\n*   **Page Limit:** Initial submissions must be at most 23 pages. Revisions can go up to 25 pages.\n*   **Anonymity:** PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Your papers must omit author names and institutions, use the third person when referencing your work, and anonymize supplementary material.\n*   **Novelty:** Papers must describe unpublished work not currently submitted for publication elsewhere.\n*   **Data-Availability Statement:** Add a section just before references titled Data-Availability Statement. Indicate whether an artifact exists, its nature and limitations, and whether it will be submitted for Artifact Evaluation.\n*   **Submission System:** [HotCRP](https://oopsla2425.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Publication\n\nPACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal. All papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge (USD 400), but payment is not required.\n\n## Reserve Reviewer Policy\n\nFor each paper, at least one senior author must — unless exempt under the criteria below — register as a reserve reviewer. They must list their information on the submission form, and they must register themselves on TPMS.\n\n## Contact\n\nYou can reach the two RC Chairs (Shriram and Sukyoung) through this email: [oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com)"
