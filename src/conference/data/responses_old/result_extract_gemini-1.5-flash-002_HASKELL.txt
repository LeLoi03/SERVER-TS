The symposium presents original research on Haskell, discusses practical experience and future development of the language, and promotes other forms of declarative programming.",
  "Call for Papers": "# Haskell 2025: Call for Papers and Talks\n\nThe ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2025 will be co-located with the 2025 International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) and the 2025 International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH) in **Singapore from October 12-18, 2025**.\n\nThe Haskell Symposium presents original research on Haskell, discusses practical experience and future development of the language, and promotes other forms of declarative programming.\n\n## New This Year\n\nIn addition to the regular Call for Papers track, there is a separate Call for Talks track.\n\n## Call for Talks\n\nTalk proposals need not be full-length and should report work in progress relevant to Haskell language design, theory, tools, or applications. Talk proposals will be evaluated by the PC for novelty and relevance to the Haskell community, but are not expected to include finished results. Talk proposals will not be distributed to attendees, but authors of talk proposals may provide links to materials to be included on the program.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nTopics of interest include:\n\n*   **Language design:** with a focus on possible extensions and modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the status quo;\n*   **Theory:** such as formal semantics of the present language or future extensions, type systems, effects, metatheory, and foundations for program analysis and transformation;\n*   **Implementations:** including program analysis and transformation, static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and distributed architectures, memory management, as well as foreign function and component interfaces;\n*   **Libraries:** that demonstrate new ideas or techniques for functional programming in Haskell;\n*   **Tools:** such as profilers, tracers, debuggers, preprocessors, and testing tools;\n*   **Applications:** to scientific and symbolic computing, databases, multimedia, telecommunication, the web, and so forth;\n*   **Functional Pearls:** being elegant and instructive programming examples;\n*   **Experience Reports:** to document general practice and experience in education, industry, or other contexts;\n*   **Tutorials:** to document how to use a particular language feature, programming technique, tool or library within the Haskell ecosystem;\n*   **System Demonstrations:** based on running software rather than novel research results.\n\n## Submission Details\n\nThe tentative submission deadline is **September 15, 2025**. Detailed information will be released closer to the deadline.\n\n## Formatting\n\nSubmitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines. Authors should use the `acmart` format, with the `sigplansub` format for ACM proceedings. For details, see: [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format)\n\nIt is recommended to use the `review` option when submitting a paper; this option enables line numbers for easy reference in reviews.\n\n## Lightweight Double-blind Reviewing\n\nHaskell Symposium 2025 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:\n\n1.  Author names and institutions must be omitted, and\n2.  References to authors’ own related work should be in the third person.\n\n## Page Limits\n\n*   Regular paper: 12 pages\n*   Functional pearl: 12 pages\n*   Tutorial: 12 pages\n*   Experience report: 6 pages\n*   Demo proposal: 2 pages\n\nThere is no requirement that all pages are used. In all cases, the list of references is not counted against these page limits.\n\n## Deadlines\n\n*   **Paper submission:** June 9, 2025 (Mon)\n*   **Notification:** July 17, 2025 (Thu)\n\nDeadlines are end of day Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12).\n\n## Submission\n\nSubmissions must adhere to SIGPLAN’s republication policy, and authors should be aware of ACM’s policies on plagiarism. Program Committee members are allowed to submit papers, but their papers will be held to a higher standard.\n\nPapers should be submitted through HotCRP at: [https://haskell25.hotcrp.com/](https://haskell25.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Keynotes\n\n*   TBD\n*   Richard A. Eisenberg\n*   Simon Peyton Jones\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Andreas Abel, Gothenburg University, Sweden\n*   Patrick Bahr, IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark\n*   Matthew Fluet, Rochester Institute of Technology, United States\n*   Adam Gundry, Well-Typed LLP, United Kingdom\n*   Xuejing Huang, IRIF, France\n*   Hideya Iwasaki, Meiji University\n*   Patricia Johann, Appalachian State University\n*   Hsiang-Shang ‘Josh’ Ko, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan\n*   András Kovács, University of Gothenburg and Chalmers University of Technology\n*   Andres Löh, Well-Typed LLP, United Kingdom\n*   J. Garrett Morris (Co-chair), University of Iowa, United States\n*   Liam O'Connor, Australian National University, Australia\n*   Maciej Piróg, University of Wrocław, Poland\n*   Arnaud Spiwack, Tweag, France\n*   Meng Wang, University of Bristol, United Kingdom\n*   Li-yao Xia, INRIA Saclay, France\n*   Ningning Xie (Co-chair), University of Toronto, Canada\n*   Gergő Érdi, Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore"
