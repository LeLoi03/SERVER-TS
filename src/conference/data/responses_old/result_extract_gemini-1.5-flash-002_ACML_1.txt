  "Call for Papers": "# ACML 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 17th Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML 2025) will take place between **December 8th - 12th, 2025, in Taipei, Taiwan**.\n\nThe conference calls for high-quality, original research papers in the theory and practice of machine learning. The conference also solicits proposals focusing on frontier research, new ideas, and paradigms in machine learning. Submissions from all parts of the world are encouraged.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nACML 2025 offers two publication tracks: the conference track and the journal track. At least one author of each accepted paper (for both tracks) must present the paper at the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper not being published. All deadlines are at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth) unless otherwise specified.\n\n### New in 2025\n\nTo maintain high-quality peer review and support our growing community, each submission to ACML 2025 must nominate at least one author to serve as a reviewer, unless at least one author has served as an area chair. The nominated author should satisfy the below requirement:\n\n*   Published at least one first-author paper and published at least one paper (not necessarily the first author) in top venues including but not limited to ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, ACML, AAAI, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, or other equivalent venues.\n\nSubmissions without at least one author serving as a reviewer or area chair will be desk rejected. If your submission cannot nominate any authors that satisfy the above requirement, please email the PCs before 23 June 2023 through acml_2025_programchairs@googlegroups.com. You need to include the OpenReview submission ID in the email so we can process your information.\n\n### Conference Track\n\n*   **Page limit:** 16 pages with references\n*   **Proceedings:** Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR)\n*   **Submission Deadline:** July 16, 2025\n*   **OpenReview Submission Link:** [https://openreview.net/group?id=ACML.org/2025/Conference_Track](https://openreview.net/group?id=ACML.org/2025/Conference_Track)\n\n### Journal Track\n\n*   **Page limit:** 20 pages (including references, appendices, etc.)\n*   **Submission Deadline:** May 30, 2025\n*   **OpenReview Submission Link:** [ACML 2025 Journal Track](https://openreview.net/group?id=ACML.org/2025/Journal_Track#tab-your-consoles)\n*   **Springer Natureâ€™s manuscript submission system:** TBD\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth) unless otherwise specified.\n\n### Conference Track Dates\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** June 16, 2025\n*   **Reviews released to authors:** August 4, 2025\n*   **Author rebuttal deadline:** August 11, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notification:** September 1, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready submission deadline:** September 22, 2025\n\n### Journal Track Dates\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** May 30, 2025\n*   **1st round review results released to authors:** July 3, 2025\n*   **Revised manuscript submission deadline:** July 31, 2025\n*   **2nd round review results released to authors:** August 15, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notification:** September 1, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready submission deadline:** September 22, 2025\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   **General machine learning:** Active learning, Bayesian machine learning, Clustering, Imitation Learning, Learning to Rank, Meta-Learning, Multi-objective learning, Multiple instance learning, Multi-task learning, Neuro-symbolic methods, Online learning, Optimization, Reinforcement learning, Relational learning, Self-supervised learning, Semi-supervised learning, Structured output learning, Supervised learning, Transfer learning, Unsupervised learning, Weakly-supervised learning, Learning with noisy labels, Other machine learning methodologies\n*   **Deep learning:** Architectures, Deep reinforcement learning, Generative models, Multi-modality learning, Large-language models and other foundation models, Deep learning theory, Other topics in deep learning\n*   **Theory:** Bandits, Computational learning theory, Game theory, Optimization, Statistical learning theory, Other theories\n*   **Datasets and reproducibility:** Implementations, libraries, ML datasets and benchmarks, Other topics in reproducible ML research\n*   **Trustworthy machine learning:** Accountability, explainability, transparency, Adversarial learning, Causality, Fairness, Privacy, Robustness, AutoML, Other topics in trustworthy ML\n*   **Learning in knowledge-intensive systems:** Knowledge refinement and theory revision, Multi-strategy learning, Other systems\n*   **Applications:** Bioinformatics, Biomedical informatics, Climate science, Collaborative filtering, Computer vision, Healthcare, Human activity recognition, Information retrieval, Natural Language Processing, Social good, Social networks, Web search, ML for science, Other applications"
