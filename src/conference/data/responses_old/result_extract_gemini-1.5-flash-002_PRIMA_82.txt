  "Call for Papers": "# PRIMA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 26th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Multi-Agent Systems (PRIMA 2025) will be held in **Modena, Italy, from December 16-19, 2025**.\n\nPRIMA 2025 invites submissions of original, unpublished work strongly relevant to Multi-Agent Systems. Apart from theoretical work, we encourage the submission of reports on the development of applications or prototypes of deployed agent systems, and of experiments that demonstrate novel agent system capabilities. In addition to this, we also encourage the submission of position and review papers that are of particular relevance to the multi-agent community.\n\n## Topics\n\n*   Logic and Reasoning\n*   Agent and Multi-Agent Learning\n*   Engineering Multi-Agent Systems\n*   Agent-Based Modeling and Simulation\n*   Collaboration & Coordination\n*   Trust and Reputation\n*   Institutions and Organizations\n*   Algorithmic Game Theory\n*   Computational Social Choice\n*   Human-Agent Interaction\n*   Decentralized Paradigms\n*   Ethics and Social Issues\n*   Application Domains for Multi-Agent Systems\n\n## Types of Submissions\n\n*   Full papers (16 pages plus references)\n*   Short papers (4 pages plus references)\n*   Position papers (2 pages plus references)\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nThe papers submitted must be in the LNCS format. All submitted papers must be in a form suitable for double-blind review. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from the paper.  When referring to one's own work, use the third person rather than the first person.\n\n## Submission\n\nThe papers can be submitted via [CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PRIMA2025/Submission/Index).\n\n## Review Process\n\nAll papers will be reviewed by at least 2-3 experts in the area.\n\n## Publication\n\nAll accepted papers will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series (LNCS/LNAI).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Submission Deadline:** July 15, 2025 (AoE, UTC-12)\n*   **Paper Submission Deadline:** July 22, 2025 (AoE, UTC-12)\n*   **Notification of Acceptance:** September 29, 2025 (AoE, UTC-12)\n*   **Camera Ready Submission:** October 13, 2025 (AoE, UTC-12)\n\n## Organizers\n\n*   **General Chairs:**\n    *   Angelo Ferrando, UNIMORE\n    *   Vadim Malvone, Télécom Paris\n*   **Program Chairs:**\n    *   Federico Bergenti, Università di Parma\n    *   Catalin Dima, Université Paris-Est Créteil\n*   **PhD Day Chairs:**\n    *   James Ortiz, Télécom Paris\n    *   Marija Slavkovik, University of Bergen\n*   **Sponsorship Chairs:**\n    *   Paolo Burgio, UNIMORE\n    *   Filippo Muzzini, UNIMORE\n*   **Local Chairs:**\n    *   Giacomo Cabri, UNIMORE\n    *   Stefania Monica, UNIMORE\n*   **Publicity Chair:** Vladana Perlić, Télécom Paris"
