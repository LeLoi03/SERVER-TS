  "Call for Papers": "# EMNLP 2025: Call for Main Conference Papers\n\nThe 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025) will be held in **Suzhou, China from November 5th to November 9th, 2025**.\n\n## Overview\n\nEMNLP 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research on empirical methods for Natural Language Processing. EMNLP 2025 aims to curate a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.\n\n## Paper Submission Information\n\nPapers may be submitted to the ARR 2025 May cycle: [https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR). Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR may be committed to EMNLP via the commitment link: [https://openreview.net/group?id=EMNLP](https://openreview.net/group?id=EMNLP).\n\n## Mandatory Reviewing Workload\n\nDuring the ARR submission process, authors will be required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing in this reviewing cycle. Questions or clarifications should be addressed to ARR directly.\n\n## Additional Policies\n\nBased on feedback, EMNLP is planning to implement additional policies to incentivize a lower volume of higher-quality submissions and higher-quality reviews. These policies will be announced separately.\n\n## Submission Topics\n\nEMNLP 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Safety and Alignment in LLMs\n*   AI/LLM Agents\n*   Human-AI Interaction/Cooperation\n*   Retrieval-Augmented Language Models\n*   Mathematical, Symbolic, and Logical Reasoning in NLP\n*   Computational Social Science, Cultural Analytics, and NLP for Social Good\n*   Code Models\n*   Interpretability, Model Editing, Transparency, and Explainability\n*   LLM Efficiency\n*   Generalizability and Transfer\n*   Dialogue and Interactive Systems\n*   Discourse, Pragmatics, and Reasoning\n*   Low-resource Methods for NLP\n*   Ethics, Bias, and Fairness\n*   Natural Language Generation\n*   Information Extraction and Retrieval\n*   Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics\n*   Machine Translation\n*   Multilinguality and Language Diversity\n*   Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond\n*   Neurosymbolic approaches to NLP\n*   Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation\n*   Question Answering\n*   Resources and Evaluation\n*   Semantics: Lexical, Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and Other areas\n*   Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining\n*   Speech Processing and Spoken Language Understanding\n*   Summarization\n*   Hierarchical Structure Prediction, Syntax, and Parsing\n*   NLP Applications\n\n### Special Theme: Interdisciplinary Recontextualization of NLP\n\nThis year’s theme aims to highlight the need for broader connections with other fields to understand and intensify NLP’s impact. The goal is to increase our awareness of how advances in NLP can impact other fields, and design better strategies to measure that impact both within and across disciplines.\n\n## Two Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to EMNLP\n\nEMNLP 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference.\n\n## Important Dates for EMNLP 2025\n\n*   ARR submission deadline (long & short papers): May 19, 2025\n*   Commitment deadline: July 31, 2025\n*   Notification of acceptance (long & short papers): August 20, 2025\n*   Camera-ready papers due (long & short): September 19, 2025\n*   Main Conference (dates for Workshops/Tutorials TBD): November 5-9, 2025\n\nAll deadlines are 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).\n\n## Paper Submission Details\n\nBoth long and short paper submissions should follow all of the ARR submission requirements:\n\n*   Long Papers (8 pages)\n*   Short Papers (4 pages)\n\nFinal versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers’ comments.\n\n## Presentation at the Conference\n\nAll accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options.\n\n## Contact Information\n\n*   General Chair: Dirk Hovy, Bocconi University\n*   Program Chairs: Christos Christodoulopoulos, Amazon; Tanmoy Chakraborty, Indian Institute of Technology Delhi; Carolyn Rose, Carnegie Mellon University; Violet Peng, University of California, Los Angeles\n*   For questions related to paper submission and the review process: [editors@aclrollingreview.org](mailto:editors@aclrollingreview.org)\n*   For questions about commitment and post-review topics: [emnlp2025-programchairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:emnlp2025-programchairs@googlegroups.com)"
