  "Call for Papers": "# ICALP 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 52nd EATCS International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP 2025) will take place in **Aarhus, Denmark, from July 8-11, 2025**.  Workshops will take place on July 7, 2025.\n\nICALP is the main conference and annual meeting of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS).\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions to ICALP 2025 use the HotCRP system:\n\n*   Submission server Track A: [icalp25-a.hotcrp.com](https://icalp25-a.hotcrp.com)\n*   Submission server Track B: [icalp25-b.hotcrp.com](https://icalp25-b.hotcrp.com)\n\n**Guidelines:**\n\n1.  Papers must present original research on the theory of computer science. No prior publication and no simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed. Authors are encouraged to also make full versions of their submissions freely accessible in an online repository such as ArXiv, HAL, ECCC.\n2.  Submissions take the form of an extended abstract of no more than 15 pages, excluding references and a clearly labelled appendix. The appendix may consist either of omitted proofs or of a full version of the submission, and it will be read at the discretion of program committee members. The use of the LIPIcs document class is an option, but not required. The extended abstract has to present the merits of the paper and its main contributions clearly, and describe the key concepts and technical ideas used to obtain the results. Submissions must provide the proofs which can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be verified.\n3.  Submissions are anonymous. The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).\n4.  Submissions authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed.\n5.  The submissions are done via HotCRP to the appropriate track of the conference. The use of pdflatex or similar pdf generating tools is mandatory and the page limit is strict (see point 2.). Papers that deviate significantly from these requirements risk rejection without consideration of merit.\n6.  During the rebuttal phase, authors will have from March 21-24, 2025, the opportunity to view and respond to initial reviews. Further instructions will be sent to authors of submitted papers before that time.\n7.  At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register for the conference, and all talks are in-person. In exceptional cases, there may be support for remotely presenting a talk.\n8.  Papers authored only by students should be marked as such upon submission in order to be eligible for the best student paper awards of the track.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submissions:** February 8, 2025 (anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Rebuttal:** March 21-24, 2025\n*   **Author notification:** April 14, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready version:** April 28, 2025\n*   **Early registration:** To be announced\n*   **Conference:** July 8-11, 2025 (Workshops on July 7)\n\n**Deadlines are firm; late submissions will not be considered.**\n\n## Tracks\n\n*   **Track A:** Algorithms, Complexity and Games\n*   **Track B:** Automata, Logic, Semantics, and Theory of Programming\n\n## Awards\n\nDuring the conference, the following awards will be delivered:\n\n*   the EATCS award\n*   the Presburger award\n*   the EATCS distinguished dissertation award\n*   the best papers for Track A and Track B\n*   the best student papers for Track A and Track B\n\n## Proceedings\n\nICALP proceedings are published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series. This is a series of high-quality conference proceedings across all fields in informatics established in cooperation with Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz Center for Informatics. LIPIcs volumes are published according to the principle of Open Access, i.e., they are available online and free of charge. The accepted papers will need to comply with the LIPIcs style.\n\n## Invited Speakers\n\n*   Anupam Gupta, NYU, USA\n*   Dana Ron-Goldreich, Tel Aviv University, Israel\n*   Mary Wootters, Stanford University, USA\n*   Hongseok Yang, KAIST, Korea"
