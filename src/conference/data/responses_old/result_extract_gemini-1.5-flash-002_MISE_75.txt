  "Summary": "The 2nd International Workshop on Methodological Issues with Empirical Studies in Software Engineering (WSESE 2025) will be held in Ottawa, Canada from April 27th to May 3rd, 2025, as a co-located event with ICSE 2025.  The workshop aims to increase awareness of the importance of quality and appropriateness in the methods applied during the different stages of software engineering empirical studies to yield reliable results and to disseminate this knowledge to the broader SE community. This year, there is a special emphasis on Machine Learning (ML).",
  "Call for Papers": "# WSESE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 2nd International Workshop on Methodological Issues with Empirical Studies in Software Engineering (WSESE 2025) will be co-located with ICSE 2025 in **Ottawa, Canada, from April 27th to May 3rd, 2025**.\n\n## Theme and Goals\n\nWith the steep increase in empirical studies and the advent of secondary studies that aggregate their results, a main concern is their quality. The workshop’s aim is to increase awareness of the importance of quality and appropriateness in the methods applied during the different stages of software engineering empirical studies to yield reliable results and to disseminate this knowledge to the broader SE community. This year, there is a special emphasis on Machine Learning (ML).\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not restricted to:\n\n*   Issues with the motivation and definition of appropriate research questions.\n*   Issues with the operationalization, e.g., missing standard metrics.\n*   Issues with the systematic identification of threats to validity and how to address them.\n*   Issues selecting an appropriate study design and the consequences of that selection.\n*   Issues with drawing appropriate conclusions from the findings and generalizing them.\n*   Issues with aggregating results from individual studies.\n*   Issues with reproduction, replication, or families of studies.\n*   Issues with quantitative, qualitative approaches and combined approaches.\n*   Issues with understanding failures and successes: lessons learned.\n\n## Paper Categories\n\n*   **Technical papers (6-8 pages including references):** formally describe studies, explain how they were designed and executed to overcome challenges, highlight concrete results, and describe any advances to the state-of-the-art.\n*   **Experience reports / Work in progress (4-6 pages including references):** describe the experience in conducting studies and lessons learned that address methodological issues.\n*   **Vision / Position papers (2-4 pages including references):** describe new directions in conducting empirical studies including convincing arguments supported by clear rationale.\n*   **Panel proposals (1-2 pages including references):** discuss hot topics about conducting empirical studies.\n\nPapers must describe original work that has not been submitted to or presented at other forums (although the studies described may have been). Accepted papers will be published in the ICSE workshop proceedings.\n\n## Submission Information\n\nSubmissions will be made via HotCRP. Papers must be formatted according to [ICSE 2025 guidelines](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2025/icse-2025-research-track#submission-process). Please note that WSESE does not follow a double-anonymous review process.\n\n## Important Dates (AoE, UTC-12h)\n\n*   **Submission of papers (extended):** November 18, 2024\n*   **Notification:** December 8, 2024\n*   **Camera-ready:** February 5, 2025\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://wsese2025.hotcrp.com/](https://wsese2025.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Organizing Committee\n\n*   Sira Vegas, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Spain\n*   Andreas Jedlitschka, Fraunhofer IESE, Germany\n*   Sabato Nocera, University of Salerno, Italy\n*   Nyyti Saarimäki, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Silvia Abrahão, Universitat Politècnica de València, Spain\n*   Claudia Ayala, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Spain\n*   Ayşe Başar, Ryerson University, Canada\n*   Beatriz Bernárdez, University of Seville, Spain\n*   Neil Ernst, University of Victoria, Canada\n*   Filomena Ferrucci, University of Salerno, Italy\n*   Davide Fucci, Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden\n*   Marcela Fabiana Genero Bocco, University of Castilla-La Mancha, Spain\n*   Marcos Kalinowski, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), Brazil\n*   Valentina Lenarduzzi, University of Oulu, Finland\n*   Silverio Martínez-Fernández, UPC-BarcelonaTech, Spain\n*   Nachiappan Nagappan, Meta Platforms, Inc., United States\n*   Gregorio Robles, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Spain\n*   Pilar Rodriguez, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, Spain\n*   Per Runeson, Lund University, Sweden\n*   Daniela S.
