The following is information about the Research and Industry Tracks. For CFPs for Special Session Tracks, please refer to the corresponding webpages on the ADMA 2025 website.\n\n*   **Research Track:** This track focuses on original research in data mining, covering applications, algorithms, software, and systems. Submissions will undergo double-blind peer review.\n*   **Industry Track:** This track focuses on applied research and real-world implementations of data mining solutions. Submissions should highlight practical value, industrial significance, and innovative deployments. The single-blind review process allows authors to include identity and affiliation details.\n\n**Note:** ALL track submissions must follow the LNAI (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence) format. Templates and formatting details are available in Springer's Author Instructions. Papers must not exceed 15 pages in LNAI format. Accepted papers will be published in Springer's LNAI and indexed in EI and DBLP. The ADMA is recognized as a C-level conference by CCF (China Computer Federation).\n\n## Important Dates (AoE Time)\n\n*   **Paper Submission Deadline (All Tracks):** May 8, 2025\n*   **Paper Notification (All Tracks):** July 27, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready Submission Deadline (All Tracks):** August 10, 2025\n*   **Conference Dates:** October 22 to 24, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nThe paper should be in English and contain unpublished contributions to the data mining and related fields. Manuscripts must be prepared in accordance with the LNAI (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence) format. For the template and details on the LNCS style, see Springer's Author Instructions.
