  "Call for Papers": "# SRDS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 44th International Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS 2025) is a forum for researchers and practitioners interested in distributed systems design, development, and evaluation, with an emphasis on reliability, availability, safety, dependability, security, verification, and real-time aspects. SRDS 2025 will be held in **Porto, Portugal, from September 29 – October 2, 2025 (TBC)**.\n\n## Types of Submissions\n\nWe welcome the following types of submissions:\n\n*   Research papers describing original research as well as design, development, and experimental results of distributed systems;\n*   Practical experience reports (PER) describing ongoing industrial projects, prototype systems, and exploratory or emerging applications;\n*   Tool papers describing the architecture, implementation, and usage of substantive tools to support research, development, and operation of reliable distributed systems.\n\nPapers will be assessed using criteria appropriate to each category.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n(All deadlines are at 23:59 AOE)\n\n*   **Abstract Submission:** April 25th, 2025\n*   **Full Paper Submission:** May 2nd, 2025\n*   **Notification to Authors:** June 27th, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready and author registration:** July 7th, 2025\n*   **Conference dates:** September 29 – October 2, 2025 (TBC)\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nPapers must be written in English. Research Papers, Practical Experience Reports, and Tool Papers should be no longer than 10 pages, excluding references (for which there is no page limit), following the IEEE two-column format for conference proceedings. Additional details to substantiate the main claims of the paper, such as proofs, data tables, or code snippets, can be included in a clearly marked appendix beyond the page limit, and read at the reviewers’ discretion.\n\nAll submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind reviewing, where the identities of the authors are withheld from the reviewers.\n\nSubmissions that do not conform to the above anonymization and formatting guidelines (e.g., are too long, use fonts or line spacing smaller than what is indicated) or are unoriginal, previously published, or under submission to multiple venues concurrently, will be desk rejected without review.\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://hotcrp.inesctec.pt/srds25/](https://hotcrp.inesctec.pt/srds25/)\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe major areas of interest include the following topics:\n\n*   Dependability, security, and privacy of distributed systems\n*   Techniques and algorithms advancing the state-of-the-art in fault tolerance, fault recovery, robustness, self-stabilization, self-healing, scalability, and real-time for distributed systems\n*   Methods and tools for designing, implementing, verifying, validating, and operating dependable and secure distributed applications, middleware, operating systems, virtual machines, and hardware\n*   Analytical, simulative, and experimental assessment of dependable and secure distributed systems\n\n## Best Paper Awards\n\nAwards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper. To be eligible for the best student paper award, at least one of the paper authors must be a full-time student at the time of submission, and the student(s) must have made a significant contribution to the paper. The latter should be indicated at submission time. All accepted papers will compete for the “Prof. C. V. Ramamoorthy Best Paper Award”.\n\n## Contact\n\nIf you have any questions regarding paper submission, please do not hesitate to contact the conference PC Chairs:\n\n*   Amy Babay, University of Pittsburgh, USA, [babay@pitt.edu](mailto:babay@pitt.edu)\n*   Valerio Schiavoni, University of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, [valerio.schiavoni@unine.ch](mailto:valerio.schiavoni@unine.ch)"
