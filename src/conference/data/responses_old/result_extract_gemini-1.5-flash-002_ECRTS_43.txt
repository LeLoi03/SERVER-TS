  "Call for Papers": "# ECRTS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 37th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS 2025) will be held in **Brussels, Belgium, from July 8–11, 2025**.\n\nECRTS is the premier European venue in the area of real-time systems and, alongside RTSS and RTAS, ranks as one of the top three international conferences on this topic.\n\n## Scope and Topics of Interest\n\nPapers on all aspects of timing requirements in computer systems are welcome. Systems of interest include not only hard real-time systems but also time-sensitive systems in general (e.g., systems with soft requirements expressed in terms of tail latency, latency SLAs, QoS expectations, etc.). Typical applications are found not only in classical embedded and cyber-physical systems, but also increasingly in cloud or edge computing contexts and often stem from domains such as automotive, avionics, telecommunications, healthcare, robotics, and space systems, among others.\n\nTo be in scope, papers must address some form of timing requirement, broadly construed. Prospective first-time authors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with works accepted in past editions of the conference, which are publicly available at [drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS).\n\nECRTS welcomes theoretical and practical contributions (including tools, benchmarks, and case studies) to the state of the art in the design, implementation, verification, and validation of time-sensitive systems. We particularly encourage papers on industrial case studies and the application of real-time technology to real systems. We welcome practical contributions even without novel theoretical insights or formal proofs, provided they are of interest to the research community and/or industry. Whenever relevant, we encourage authors to present experimental results (preferably based on real data, but synthetic test cases are acceptable when adequately motivated).\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   all elements of time-sensitive SOFTWARE SYSTEMS\n*   COMPUTER HARDWARE design and hardware/software integration for embedded systems\n*   REAL-TIME NETWORKS\n*   REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS\n*   foundational SCHEDULING and PREDICTABILITY questions\n*   static and dynamic techniques for RESOURCE DEMAND ESTIMATION\n*   MACHINE LEARNING techniques in safety-critical systems\n*   FORMAL METHODS for the verification and validation of real-time systems\n*   SECURITY aspects of real-time systems\n*   the interplay of timing predictability and other NON-FUNCTIONAL QUALITIES\n\n## Open Access\n\nAll accepted papers will be published as open-access proceedings in collaboration with LIPIcs (Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics). Once published, the proceedings of ECRTS 2025 will be publicly accessible at [drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS).\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nSubmitted manuscripts are limited to 20 pages of technical content, excluding the bibliography. Every accepted paper must be presented by one of the authors at the conference.\n\nECRTS papers follow the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics paper template. You can download the [LIPIcs template](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author) and see the typesetting instructions here.\n\nTo submit a paper to ECRTS, please carefully review and follow the [submission instructions and guidelines](https://www.ecrts.org/submission-instructions/).\n\n## Double-Blind Peer Reviewing\n\nECRTS will follow a double-blind peer reviewing process. Authors will submit blinded manuscripts (that do not reveal author identity or affiliation), and reviewers will not be made aware of author identities.\n\n## Shadow Peer Review Process\n\nFor the first time this year, ECRTS will offer the authors a Shadow Technical Program Committee (TPC) option. The Shadow TPC is designed to train future reviewers by providing them with hands-on experience in the paper review process.\n\n## Artifact Evaluation\n\nTo improve the results’ reproducibility and encourage reuse, authors of accepted papers with a computational component will be invited to submit their code and/or their data to an optional artifact evaluation process.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** February 28, 2025 (Firm)\n*   **Notification:** April 21, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready deadline:** May 16, 2025\n*   **Early registration deadline:** June 13, 2025\n*   **Conference:** July 8 - 11, 2025\n\nDeadlines are UTC-12 (Anywhere on Earth)\n\n## Submission Website\n\n[https://ecrts25.hotcrp.com/](https://ecrts25.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Registration Page\n\n[https://www.ecrts.org/registration/](https://www.ecrts.org/registration/)"
