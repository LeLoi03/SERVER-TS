  "Call for Papers": "# IFIP PERFORMANCE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe IFIP PERFORMANCE 2025 conference will be held at the **Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on November 11-14, 2025.**\n\nThis conference aims to bring together researchers interested in understanding and improving the performance of computing and communication systems using state-of-the-art quantitative models and solution techniques.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission site opens:** May 1, 2025\n*   **Abstract submission:** May 25, 2025\n*   **Full paper submission:** June 1, 2025\n*   **Notification to authors:** July 30, 2025\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe invite submissions of research papers focusing on algorithm design, mathematical analysis and modeling, simulation, and measurement techniques for computer systems and communication networks. We particularly welcome contributions that introduce novel performance evaluation methods or creatively apply existing techniques to predict or gain insights into key design trade-offs across a wide range of computing, networked, and cyber-physical systems.\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nThe IFIP Performance 2025 conference accepts submissions in two categories:\n\n*   **Regular papers:** 20 pages\n*   **Short papers:** 10 pages\n\n### Format of Regular Paper Submissions\n\nRegular papers should not exceed 20 pages for technical content, including all tables and figures (references are excluded from the page limit). Authors are recommended to use the Elsevier article class `elsarticle.cls` (with the 3p document class option) to prepare their manuscript and BibTeX to generate their bibliography. See also the guide for authors: [https://www.elsevier.com/journals/performance-evaluation/0166-5316/guide-for-authors](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/performance-evaluation/0166-5316/guide-for-authors).\n\nAuthors may include an appendix (of unrestricted length) but only to justify the technical correctness of the claims stated in the main paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. However, the appendix should serve as supplementary material only, as reviewers will evaluate the novelty and significance of the submission based on the main content of the paper and are not obligated to review the appendix.\n\n### Format of Short Paper Submissions\n\nShort papers are limited to 10 pages for technical content, including all tables and figures (references are excluded from the page limit). Authors may include an appendix (of unrestricted length) but only to justify the technical correctness of the claims stated in the main paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. However, the appendix should serve as supplementary material only, as reviewers will evaluate the novelty and significance of the submission based on the main content of the paper and are not obligated to review the appendix.\n\nAccepted short papers will be published in a special ACM Performance Evaluation Review (PER) issue. Please find the style files [here](https://performance2025.sciencesconf.org/resource/page/id/1).\n\n### Instructions for All Submissions\n\nPapers must be submitted through the hotCRP platform ([https://performance2025.hotcrp.com/](https://performance2025.hotcrp.com/)) in printable PDF form. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review.\n\nAll submissions will be reviewed using a double-blind review process. The identity of authors and referees will not be revealed to each other.\n\n## Tracks\n\nIFIP Performance uses “soft” tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions. Regardless of the selected track, all submissions will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element.\n\n*   Learning\n*   Measurement & Applied Modelling\n*   Systems\n*   Theory\n\n## Ethical Considerations\n\nPapers describing experiments with users or user data should follow the basic principles of ethical research, e.g., beneficence, minimal risk, voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues.\n\n## Diversity & Inclusiveness\n\nAs part of our efforts to foster diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or conference presentation."
