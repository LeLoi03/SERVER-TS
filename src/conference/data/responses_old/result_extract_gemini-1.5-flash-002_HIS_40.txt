  "Call for Papers": "# HAIS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 20th International Conference on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence Systems (HAIS 2025) will be held in **Salamanca, Spain, on October 16-17, 2025**.\n\nHAIS 2025 combines symbolic and sub-symbolic techniques to construct more robust and reliable problem-solving models. Hybrid intelligent systems are popular due to their capabilities in handling many real-world complex problems, involving imprecision, uncertainty, and vagueness, high-dimensionality. They provide us with the opportunity to use both our knowledge and raw data to solve problems in a more interesting and promising way.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Special Sessions proposal deadline:** March 15, 2025\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** May 1, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notification:** May 15, 2025\n*   **Submission of revised papers:** June 1, 2025\n*   **Final version submission:** June 15, 2025\n*   **Payment deadline:** July 1, 2025\n*   **Conference Dates:** October 16-17, 2025\n\n## Publication\n\nHAIS 2025 proceedings will be published by Springer in its series of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence – LNAI (part of its prestigious Lecture Notes in Computer Science – LNCS series). All submissions will be refereed by experts in the field based on originality, significance, quality, and clarity. Every submitted paper to HAIS’25 will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.\n\nAll accepted papers must be presented by one of the authors who must register for the conference and pay the fee.
