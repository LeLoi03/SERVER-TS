"Call for Papers": "# ICFP 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) is an annual programming language conference that provides a forum for researchers and developers to hear about the latest work on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming.  This year, for the first time in history, ICFP will be co-located with SPLASH and its satellite events as a part of the joint ICFP/SPLASH 2025 conference.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nPACMPL issue ICFP 2025 seeks original papers on the art and science of functional programming. Submissions are invited on all topics from principles to practice, from foundations to features, and from abstraction to application. The scope includes all languages that encourage functional programming, including both purely applicative and imperative languages, as well as languages with objects, concurrency, or parallelism.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\n*   Language Design\n*   Implementation\n*   Software-Development Techniques\n*   Foundations\n*   Analysis and Transformation\n*   Applications\n*   Education\n\n## Special Categories of Papers\n\nIn addition to research papers, PACMPL issue ICFP solicits two kinds of papers that do not require original research contributions: Functional Pearls, which are full papers, and Experience Reports, which are limited to half the length of a full paper.\n\n### Functional Pearls\n\nA Functional Pearl is an elegant essay about something related to functional programming.  A submission that is intended to be treated as a pearl must be marked as such on the submission web page and should contain the words “Functional Pearl” somewhere in its title or subtitle.\n\n### Experience Reports\n\nThe purpose of an Experience Report is to describe the experience of using functional programming in practice.  Both in the papers and in any citations, the title of each accepted Experience Report must end with the words “(Experience Report)” in parentheses.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Submissions must be in PDF format, printable in black and white on US Letter sized paper and interpretable by common PDF tools.\n*   All submissions must adhere to the “ACM Small” template.\n*   There is a limit of 25 pages for a full paper or Functional Pearl and 12 pages for an Experience Report; in either case, the bibliography and an optional clearly marked appendix will not be counted against these limits.\n*   Submissions will be accepted at [https://icfp25.hotcrp.com/](https://icfp25.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Double-Blind Reviewing Process\n\nICFP 2025 will use a full double-blind reviewing process. This means that identities of authors will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted papers.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission Deadline:** February 27, 2025\n*   **Author Response:** April 28 - May 1, 2025\n*   **Notification of Conditional Acceptance:** May 23, 2025\n*   **Deadline for Submitting Revisions:** June 12, 2025\n*   **Final Decision Notification:** June 27, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready Deadline:** July 11, 2025"
