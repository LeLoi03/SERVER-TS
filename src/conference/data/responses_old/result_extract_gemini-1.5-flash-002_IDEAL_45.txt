  "Call for Papers": "# IDEAL 2024: Call for Papers\n\nThe 25th International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning (IDEAL 2024) was held in **Valencia, Spain from November 20-22, 2024**.\n\nIDEAL is an annual international conference dedicated to emerging and challenging topics in intelligent data analytics and associated learning systems and paradigms.\n\n## Topics\n\nIDEAL 2024 core themes or topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Big Data Analytics\n*   Machine Learning & Deep Learning\n*   Data Mining\n*   Information Retrieval and Management\n*   Bio and Neuro-Informatics\n*   Bio-Inspired Models\n*   Agents and Hybrid Intelligent Systems\n*   Real-world Applications of Intelligent Techniques\n\n## Instructions for Authors\n\nAuthors are invited to submit their manuscripts (in pdf format) written in English by the deadline via the conference online submission system. All submissions will be peer-reviewed by experts in the field based on originality, significance, quality, and clarity. All contributions must be original, must not have been published elsewhere, and must not have been submitted elsewhere during the review period. Papers must not exceed 12 pages (including references) and must comply with the format of Springer LNCS/LNAI Proceedings (see www.springer.com/lncs).\n\n### Short Papers\n\nTo encourage emerging results and novel initial developments, especially from PhD students and young researchers, we accept short papers (within 6 LNCS pages, including references). Such papers will also go through our rigorous peer-review process for their novelty and soundness with a quicker turn-around time. Although short papers are mainly for the main track, they can be submitted to any relevant Special Session too (information will be available). The submission system will treat any paper within 6 pages as short papers and PC chairs will ensure a speedy review of them.\n\n## Special Sessions & Workshops\n\nYou are welcome to submit a proposal for a Special Session or Workshop on a focused, active, or emerging topic in the scope of IDEAL.  If researchers and prospective organizers are interested in proposing another Special Session, please submit a one-page proposal by May 31 to IDEAL Programme Co-Chairs [antonio.tallon@diesia.uhu.es,jjordan@dsic.upv.es], including the following information:\n\n*   The title of the special session\n*   The organizers with their affiliations\n*   A description of why the topic is of special interest and how it fits into the scope of IDEAL.\n\nEach special session preferably consists of four or more presentations. Special sessions receiving less than 3 accepted papers will be merged into the main track.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission Deadline:** July 19, 2024 (Final Extension)\n*   **Special Session Papers Submission Deadline:** July 26, 2024\n*   **Notification:** September 9, 2024 (Extended)\n*   **Camera-ready Version & Registration:** September 9, 2024\n*   **Conference dates:** November 20-22, 2024\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nSubmission site: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IDEAL2024](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IDEAL2024)\n\n## Best Paper Awards\n\nIDEAL 2024 will be awarding Best Papers awards in several categories, sponsored by Springer and IEEE CIS UK & Ireland Chapter. A selection of the best papers presented at IDEAL 2024 will be published in a fast-track format in Expert Systems journal ([https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14680394](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14680394)).\n\n## Journal Special Issues\n\nAuthors of all selected accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended and improved version for consideration for Special Issues in the following journals:\n\n*   Expert Systems (Wiley), JCR Q2, [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14680394](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14680394)\n*   Inteligencia Artificial – Iberoamerical Journal of Artificial Intelligence (Iberamia), JCR Q2, [https://journal.iberamia.org/index.php/intartif](https://journal.iberamia.org/index.php/intartif)\n*   International Journal of Interactive Multimedia and Artificial Intelligence (Unir), JCR Q2, [https://www.ijimai.org/journal/](https://www.ijimai.org/journal/)\n\n## Organization\n\nIDEAL 2024 is organized by the Universitat Politècnica de València, technically co-sponsored by the IEEE CIS UK & Ireland Chapter.
