  "Call for Papers": "# SPAA '25: Call for Papers\n\nThe 37th ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA ’25) will run on **July 28—August 1, 2025 in Portland, Oregon**.\n\nPapers will be submitted through HotCRP on the [submission site](https://spaa25.hotcrp.com).\n\n## Submission Categories\n\nSubmissions are sought in all areas of parallel and distributed computing, including algorithms, data structures, computational models, complexity theory, architectures, performance engineering, languages, runtime systems, compilers, programming systems, and networking systems. Papers that are purely theoretical, purely experimental, or contain both theory and experiments are welcome.\n\n*   **Regular Papers:** A regular paper submission must report on original research that has not been previously or concurrently published. Each paper should have no more than 20 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the acmart LaTeX class with acmsmall option. Use of a different format is grounds for summary rejection.\n*   **Brief Announcements:** Examples of good brief announcements include: work in progress, announcement of tools/libraries, challenge problems posted to the community, and corrections to earlier results. Submitted manuscripts may not exceed six single-column pages for brief announcements excluding the bibliography.\n\n## Important Deadlines\n\n*   **Abstract registration:** February 21, 2025, 11:59 pm AoE\n*   **Full papers submission:** February 28, 2025, 11:59 pm AoE\n*   **Rebuttal Period:** April 22–29, 2025, 11:59 pm AoE\n*   **Notification:** May 20, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready:** June 20, 2025\n\n## Submission Overview\n\nPlease indicate in the title of your submission whether this is a regular paper or a brief announcement. All regular rejected papers will automatically be considered for brief announcements. Titles of regular papers that should not be considered for this option should mention “full paper only” after the title. Submissions must use the final ACM “acmsmall” format from [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). More details are at [https://spaa.acm.org/submission-guidelines/](https://spaa.acm.org/submission-guidelines/)\n\n## Theory vs. Experiments\n\nA submission naturally falls into one of the following three categories:\n\n1.  Theory (main contributions are theoretical)\n2.  Experiments (main contributions are experimental)\n3.  Theory and Experiments (main contributions are a mix of theory and experiments)\n\nTo help assign suitable reviewers, please indicate which category the submission belongs to during the submission process.\n\n## Double-Blind Policy\n\nSPAA 2025 will employ a lightweight double-blind review process. That means, the submission should omit authors’ names, affiliations, and contact information. In addition, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, the reference should be made in the third person.\n\n## Conflict of Interest Policy\n\nTo ensure a fair and high-quality reviewing process, we ask ALL authors of a submitted paper to register their conflicts with the PC members at the submission site. The following categories are considered as a conflict of interest:\n\n1.  Academic advisor or advisee (with no time limit)\n2.  Postdoctoral mentor or mentee (with no time limit)\n3.  Collaborators within the past three years\n4.  Members of the same institution within the past 3 years\n5.  Family members or close friends\n6.  Someone involved in an alleged incident of harassment\n7.  Anyone whose relationship with an author would prevent the reviewer from being objective in his/her assessment"
