  "Call for Papers": "# ASPLOS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nASPLOS, the ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, is the premier academic forum for multidisciplinary applied computer systems research spanning hardware, software, and their interaction.  ASPLOS 2025 will take place in **Rotterdam, co-located with EuroSys 2025, from March 30 to April 3, 2025.**\n\n## Submission Deadlines\n\nASPLOS 2025 has three submission deadlines – spring, summer, and fall – to encourage authors to submit their papers when they are ready.  ASPLOS 2025 will allow the authors of some submissions to apply a major revision to their submission.\n\n### Spring Cycle\n\n*   **Abstract Deadline:** February 23, 2024\n*   **Paper Deadline:** March 1, 2024\n*   **Author Response Period:** May 15-20, 2024\n*   **Notification Date:** June 6, 2024\n*   **Submission Site:** [https://asplos25spring.hotcrp.com/](https://asplos25spring.hotcrp.com/)\n\n### Summer Cycle\n\n*   **Abstract Deadline:** June 17, 2024\n*   **Paper Deadline:** June 24, 2024\n*   **Author Response Period:** September 9-13, 2024\n*   **Notification Date:** October 2, 2024\n*   **Submission Site:** [https://asplos25summer.hotcrp.com](https://asplos25summer.hotcrp.com)\n\n### Fall Cycle\n\n*   **Paper Deadline:** October 18, 2024 (No abstract deadline for this cycle.)\n*   **Author Response Period:** January 13-15, 2025\n*   **Notification Date:** January 27, 2025\n*   **Submission Site:** [https://asplos25fall.hotcrp.com](https://asplos25fall.hotcrp.com)\n\n**All deadlines are AoE.**\n\n## Scope and Expectations\n\nThe scope of ASPLOS 2025 covers all practical aspects related to the three main ASPLOS disciplines: computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems, as well as closely-related associated areas.  We seek original, high-quality research submissions that improve and further the knowledge of applied computer systems, with emphasis on the intersection between the main ASPLOS disciplines.\n\nAlphabetically sorted areas of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Existing, emerging, and nontraditional compute platforms at all scales\n*   Heterogeneous architectures and accelerators\n*   Internet services, cloud computing, and datacenters\n*   Memory, storage, networking, and I/O\n*   Power, energy, and thermal management\n*   Profiling, debugging, and testing\n*   Security, reliability, and availability\n*   Systems for enabling parallelism and computation on big data\n*   Virtualization and virtualized systems\n\n## Resubmissions\n\nAuthors of resubmitted work must describe in a separate note—to be uploaded to the submission site at submission time—the changes since the previous submission(s).  Submissions rejected from ASPLOS must not be submitted to the next two subsequent review cycles.\n\n## Major Revisions\n\nIn addition to Accept and Reject outcomes, ASPLOS 2025 will offer some submissions a “Major Revision” decision.  Revised submissions can use 13 pages (the same length as camera-ready versions, and 2 pages more than the original submission).\n\n## Anonymization\n\nASPLOS employs a double-blind review process. You must make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission.\n\n## Anonymized Supplemental Material\n\nSupplemental material may be submitted as a single-but-separate anonymized PDF file without page limit.\n\n## Declaring Conflicts of Interest\n\nAuthors must register all their conflicts in their HotCRP submission page.  Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers.\n\n## Declaring Authors\n\nDeclare all the authors of the submission upfront. Addition/removal of authors once the submission is accepted will have to be approved by the program chairs.\n\n## Declaring Areas and Topics\n\nASPLOS emphasizes multidisciplinary research. Submissions should ideally emphasize synergy of two or more of the three main ASPLOS disciplines: computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems (broadly interpreted).\n\n## Originality and Concurrent Submissions\n\nBy submitting a manuscript to ASPLOS, the authors guarantee that the manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any conference, journal, or workshop.\n\n## Ethical and Other Obligations\n\nAuthors are not allowed to break anonymity when interacting with known ASPLOS PC/ERC members, e.g., by mentioning/identifying work that they plan to submit to ASPLOS or have already submitted and is currently under review.\n\n## Formatting and Editing\n\nWe will use the same format template for submission and camera-ready versions. Submissions must be printable PDF files.  When creating your submission, you must use the sigplan proceedings template of ACM’s acmart Latex class.\n\n## Author Response Period\n\nASPLOS 2024 will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting.\n\n## Accepted Papers\n\nSubmissions selected by the program committee will be conditionally accepted, subject to revision and approval by a committee member acting as a shepherd. Accepted papers will be allowed two additional pages in the proceedings (and up to two more with a fee of $200 per page).\n\n## Artifact Evaluation\n\nArtifact evaluation will continue in 2025 as has become a tradition at ASPLOS. Please refer to the [ASPLOS 2025 AEC](https://sites.google.com/view/asplos25aec/home) web page for more information.\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n[asplos2025pcchairs@gmail.com](mailto:asplos2025pcchairs@gmail.com)"
