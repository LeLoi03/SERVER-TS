  "Call for Papers": "# HotMobile 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Twenty-sixth International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (ACM HotMobile 2025) continues the series of highly selective, interactive workshops focused on mobile applications, systems, and environments, as well as their underlying state-of-the-art technologies.  HotMobile's small workshop format makes it ideal for presenting and discussing new directions or controversial approaches.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nWe solicit submissions of papers that (1) focus primarily on systems and applications and (2) propose new directions of research, advocate non-traditional approaches to old (or new) ideas, or generate controversy and discussion.  We especially encourage papers that:\n\n*   Identify fundamental open questions\n*   Advocate a new approach\n*   Offer a constructive critique of the state-of-the-art\n*   Debunk existing assumptions\n*   Report unexpected early results\n*   Report on promising but unproven ideas\n*   Propose new evaluation methods\n\nNovel ideas need not be supported by full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations suffice. The program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion.\n\nWe take a broad view of Mobile Systems research. This includes:\n\n*   Novel applications, environments, and devices supporting mobility\n*   Operating system and distributed system support for mobile computing\n*   Wearable computing, internet of things, edge computing, sensing, and context-awareness\n*   HCI issues related to mobile computing\n*   Security and privacy of mobile computing\n*   Management, configuration, and deployment of systems supporting mobility\n*   Wireless technology, as it pertains to mobile systems and applications\n*   Social issues related to mobile computing\n*   System and application support for the use of ML and AI on mobile platforms\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Hard deadline for submissions:** October 11th, 2024, 11:59 pm AoE\n*   **Acceptance notification:** December 16th, 2024\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions should contain 6 or fewer U.S. letter pages in PDF format, including all references, figures, and tables. The submissions should not be anonymous. The submissions must meet the following formatting requirements:\n\n*   Font size no smaller than 10pt.\n*   Font size of the bibliography no smaller than 9pt.\n*   Double-column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column.\n*   Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches x 11 inches).\n\nWe recommend the use of the \"sigconf\" ACM proceedings template, available at: [http://www.acm.org/](http://www.acm.org/), with the font size of the main body amended to 10pt.\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://hotmobile2025.hotcrp.com/](https://hotmobile2025.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Call for Posters and Demos\n\nHotMobile seeks proposals for posters and live demonstrations describing novel work on mobile systems, applications, and services. Posters and demonstrations will be presented during a reception at the workshop.  The poster/demo session is meant to introduce new or ongoing work and provide opportunities for authors to interact directly with workshop attendees.\n\n## Important Dates (Posters and Demos)\n\n*   **Submission deadline (extended):** January 20th, 2025 â€“ AOE\n*   **Submission Site:** [https://hotmobile25-posterdemo.hotcrp.com](https://hotmobile25-posterdemo.hotcrp.com)\n\n## Submission Guidelines (Posters and Demos)\n\nSubmissions must include an extended abstract no longer than one 8.5x11-inch page, including all figures and references. The poster/demo should be uploaded to [https://hotmobile25-posterdemo.hotcrp.com/](https://hotmobile25-posterdemo.hotcrp.com/). More details on the submission process are on the website."
