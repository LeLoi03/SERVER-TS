Failure to anonymize submissions will result in desk rejection.\n\nEach research paper should provide a contribution covering one or more of the following categories: methodological, technical, applications, and systems.\n\n*   Methodological papers\n*   Technical papers\n*   Application papers\n*   System papers\n\nEach paper should include an evaluation of its contributions, such as user studies, benchmarking, and/or comparison with existing systems/techniques/methods.\n\n## Submission Length\n\nWe welcome paper submissions between 4 and 9 pages, not including references. Submissions may include an additional 2 pages of references. Supplementary materials should be provided in a separate file. Authors are encouraged to submit videos to aid the program committee in reviewing their submissions.\n\n## Topics\n\nIEEE VR 2025 seeks contributions in VR/AR/MR and 3DUI including, but not limited to, the following topics:\n\n*   360° video\n*   3D and volumetric display and projection technology\n*   3D authoring\n*   3D user interfaces\n*   Accessibility of immersive interfaces\n*   Audio interfaces and rendering\n*   Collaborative interactions\n*   Computer graphics techniques\n*   Crowd simulation\n*   Cybersickness\n*   Diversity and gender issues\n*   Embodied agents, virtual humans and (self-)avatars\n*   Ethical issues\n*   Evaluation methods\n*   Haptic interfaces and rendering\n*   Human factors and ergonomics\n*   Immersive analytics and visualization\n*   Immersive applications and games\n*   Input devices\n*   Locomotion and navigation\n*   Mediated and diminished reality\n*   Mobile, desktop or hybrid 3DUIs\n*   Modeling and simulation\n*   Multi-user and distributed systems\n*   Multimodal capturing and reconstruction\n*   Multimodal/cross-modal interaction and perception\n*   Multisensory interfaces and rendering\n*   Perception and cognition\n*   Presence, body ownership, and agency\n*   Redirection\n*   Software architectures, toolkits, and engineering\n*   Teleoperation and telepresence\n*   Therapy and rehabilitation\n*   Touch, tangible and gesture interfaces\n*   Tracking\n*   User experience and usability\n*   XR technology infrastructure\n\n## Review Process\n\nThe review process will have two cycles.\n\n### Review Cycle I (Submission to Initial notification)\n\nSubmissions will be assigned to two members of the VR 2025 International Program Committee (IPC): a coordinator (primary) and a secondary reviewer.\n\n### Review Cycle II (Initial notification to Final decision)\n\nThe revision of each conditionally accepted paper will be reviewed by its coordinator, who will make a final recommendation regarding acceptance. Should the conditions for acceptance not be met, the paper will be rejected.\n\n## Additional Guidelines\n\n*   Abstract Submission\n*   Ethics and Responsibility\n*   Participant Diversity\n*   Review Duties for Authors\n*   Presentation at the Conference\n*   Submission Language\n*   Previous Publication and Plagiarism\n*   AI-generated Text\n*   Submission Anonymity\n*   Pre-dissemination through public online repositories\n*   Videos\n\n## Contacts\n\n**Technical Papers Chairs:**\n\n*   Daisuke Iwai, University of Osaka, Japan\n*   Luciana Nedel, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil\n*   Tabitha Peck, Davidson College, USA\n*   Voicu Popescu, Purdue University, USA"
