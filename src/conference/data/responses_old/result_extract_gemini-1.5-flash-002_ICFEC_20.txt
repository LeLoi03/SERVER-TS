  "Call for Papers": "# ICFEC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 9th IEEE International Conference on Fog and Edge Computing (ICFEC 2025) will take place in conjunction with the 25th International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid 2025) from **May 19-22, 2025, in Tromsø, Norway**.\n\nICFEC 2025 seeks high-quality contributions covering both theory and practice in systems research and emerging domain-specific applications related to next-generation distributed systems that cover different parts of the cloud-edge compute continuum. This covers different computing models, including mist computing, edge computing, multi-access edge computing, fog computing, and mobile cloud computing.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nSome representative topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Data centers and infrastructures along the compute continuum\n*   Mobility management along the compute continuum\n*   Federated learning and distributed machine learning in and for the compute continuum\n*   5G/6G for the compute continuum\n*   Middleware and runtime systems for the compute continuum\n*   Programming models for the compute continuum\n*   Storage and data management platforms along the compute continuum\n*   Scheduling and resource management for the compute continuum\n*   Security, privacy, trust, and provenance issues for the compute continuum\n*   Distributed consensus and blockchains in the compute continuum\n*   Modeling and simulation for and in the compute continuum\n*   Performance monitoring and metering of infrastructures along the compute continuum\n*   (Big) Data processing in the compute continuum\n*   Energy-efficient computing in the compute continuum\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nWe invite original manuscripts that have neither been published elsewhere nor are under review at a different venue. Papers should follow the IEEE template for conference proceedings. Authors should submit papers, written in English, electronically in PDF format, and may not exceed 8 letter-size pages in length, including all figures, tables, and references. Apart from full papers, authors may also submit poster papers, which may not exceed 2 pages in length.\n\nPapers may be submitted online via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icfec2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icfec2025)\n\nPapers that are accepted for publication may be accepted as REGULAR papers (8 pages), SHORT papers (5 pages), or POSTER papers (2 pages), depending on the reviewers' recommendations.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE, UTC-12 timezone).\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** January 23, 2025 (Fixed!)\n*   **Author notification:** February 28, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready submission:** March 28, 2025\n*   **Conference (on-site in Tromsø, Norway):** May 19-22, 2025\n\n## Publication\n\nAll accepted papers will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press (EI-Index) and included in the IEEE Digital Library. For publication, each accepted paper is required to be registered by one of its authors, and at least one author is required to attend and present the paper at the conference."
