  "Call for Papers": "# PACT 2025: Call for Papers\n\nPACT 2025 will be held in **Irvine, California, USA, from November 3-6, 2025.**\n\n## Scope\n\nThe International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques (PACT) is a unique technical conference at the intersection of hardware and software, with a special emphasis on parallelism. PACT brings together researchers from computer architectures, compilers, execution environments, programming languages, and applications to present and discuss their latest research results, tools, and practical experiences.\n\n## Submission Categories\n\nPACT seeks submissions in two categories:\n\n*   Research Papers\n*   Tools and Practical Experience (TPE) Papers\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nPACT welcomes submissions on topics including, but not limited to:\n\n*   Parallel architectures, including accelerators for AI and other domains\n*   Compilers and tools for parallel architectures\n*   Applications and experimental studies of parallel processing\n*   Computational models for concurrent execution\n*   Multicore, multithreaded, superscalar, and VLIW architectures\n*   Compiler and hardware support for reducing memory latencies\n*   Support for correctness in hardware and software\n*   Reconfigurable parallel computing\n*   Dynamic translation and optimization\n*   I/O issues in parallel computing and their application impact\n*   Parallel programming languages, algorithms, and applications\n*   Middleware and runtime system support for parallel computing\n*   Application-specific parallel systems\n*   Distributed computing architectures and systems\n*   Heterogeneous systems leveraging various accelerators\n*   In-core and in-chip accelerators and their optimization\n*   Applications of machine learning to parallel computing\n*   Large-scale data processing, including in-memory computing accelerators\n*   Insights from modern parallel applications for architecture and compiler design\n\n## Research Papers\n\nResearch papers will be evaluated by the PACT Program Committee based on:\n\n*   Relevance\n*   Novelty/Originality\n*   Significance\n*   Results\n*   Comparison to Prior Work\n\n## Tools and Practical Experience (TPE) Papers\n\nTPE papers focus on practical applications, industry challenges, and experience reports. The title of a TPE paper must include the prefix “TPE:”.\n\nTPE papers will be evaluated based on:\n\n*   Originality\n*   Usability\n*   Documentation\n*   Benchmark Repository\n*   Availability\n*   Foundations\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions are due **April 18, 2025**, via the conference submission site: [https://pact25.hotcrp.com](https://pact25.hotcrp.com).\n\n*   **Format:** Papers are limited to 10 pages (excluding references) in ACM 8.5” x 11” format, double-column, 9pt font (e.g., using the sigconf LaTeX template). Templates are available on the ACM Author Gateway: [https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/taps-production-workflow).\n*   **Abstract:** Papers must include an abstract of under 300 words.\n*   **Originality:** Submissions must contain original material not previously published or under review elsewhere.\n*   **TPE Papers:** Must be prefixed with “TPE:” in the title.\n*   **Double-Blind Review:** The review process is double-blind. Submissions must not include author names, affiliations, or self-references that reveal authorship.\n*   **Legibility:** Figures and graphs must be readable without magnification.\n*   **Submission Format:** Papers must be submitted in PDF format.\n*   **Supplementary Material:** A single anonymized PDF may be uploaded with additional proofs, results, or datasets. Reviewers are not required to consult supplementary material.\n*   **Posters:** Poster submissions must follow the same formatting guidelines but are limited to 2 pages. Papers not accepted for full presentation will automatically be considered for posters unless authors opt out in their abstract submission.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nAuthors must declare all conflicts of interest with PC members and external reviewers at submission time. Papers with undeclared or false conflicts may be rejected.\n\n## Artifact Evaluation\n\nAuthors of accepted papers are encouraged to submit their artifacts for evaluation. The Artifact Evaluation Committee assesses availability, functionality, and reproducibility. Successful artifacts will receive a seal of approval in the published paper. Authors can include a 2-page Artifact Appendix in the final paper.\n\n## Camera-Ready Instructions\n\n*   Page Limit: The final version must not exceed 11 pages, with an optional 2-page Artifact Appendix.\n*   Extra Pages: Up to 2 additional pages may be purchased for $200 per page.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are firm at midnight anywhere on Earth (AoE).\n\n*   **Abstract Submission Deadline:** April 11, 2025\n*   **Paper Submission Deadline:** April 18, 2025\n*   **Rebuttal Period:** June 24-27, 2025\n*   **Author Notification:** July 28, 2025\n*   **Artifact Submission:** August 8, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready Deadline:** September 15, 2025"
