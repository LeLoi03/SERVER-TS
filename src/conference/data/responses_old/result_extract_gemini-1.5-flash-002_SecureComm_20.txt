  "Call for Papers": "# SecureComm 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 21st EAI International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Networks (SecureComm 2025) will be held as a **hybrid conference** in **Xiangtan, China, from July 4-6, 2025**.\n\nSecureComm brings together researchers and practitioners in academic, industry, and government to explore important research directions in the field of secure communications and networking. The conference seeks submissions of high-quality research contributions. Topics of interest encompass all areas of secure communications and networking. Topics in less related areas will be considered if a clear connection to secure communication and networking is demonstrated. Topics addressing interdisciplinary challenges in different application domains are welcome.\n\n## Topics\n\n*   Security and privacy in computer networks (e.g., wired, wireless, mobile, hybrid, sensor, vehicular, satellite, 5G, 6G, ad hoc, peer-to-peer, and software-defined networks)\n*   Security and privacy in systems with strong secure communication and networking elements (e.g., security in the cloud, IoT, cyber-physical systems, edge and fog computing, and teleconferencing)\n*   Security and privacy in Web3.0 and metaverse\n*   Distributed ledger technologies (e.g., blockchain, smart contracts, and cryptocurrencies) and decentralized applications (e.g., DeFi)\n*   Security protocols at all network layers and for different applications (e.g., for secure routing, naming/addressing, network management, remote authentication and attestation)\n*   Physical layer security (e.g., jamming, GPS spoofing)\n*   Network attacks and forensics (e.g., DDoS, MitM, malware, botnets, side-channel attacks, phishing/pharming, cybersquatting), defenses (e.g., network intrusion detection and prevention, firewalls, packet filters, moving target defence)\n*   Applications of cryptography (e.g., Analysis of deployed cryptography and cryptographic protocols, Cryptographic implementation analysis, New cryptographic protocols with real-world applications)\n*   Security analysis (e.g., Malware analysis, Automated security analysis of source code and binaries, Program analysis)\n*   Data-driven security and measurement studies (e.g., Measurements of fraud, malware or spam; Measurements of human behavior and security)\n*   Cybercrime investigation and attribution\n*   Cyber threat intelligence and cyber incident responses\n*   Anonymous and privacy-aware communications (e.g., Tor, darknet)\n*   Internet censorship and circumvention\n*   Secure communication and networking applications (e.g., industry 4.0, energy, transportation, smart cities)\n*   Quantum key distribution and other quantum-based secure communications\n*   Visualization of secure communications and networking\n*   Privacy-preserving computing in secure communication and networking (e.g., privacy-preserving machine learning)\n*   The resilience of computer networks and critical infrastructures\n*   Web and mobile security and privacy\n*   Defending false information online (e.g., mis-, dis- and mal-information)\n*   Socio-technical aspects of secure communications and networking (e.g., usability, human behaviors, legal issues, cybercrime, economics)\n*   Security and privacy of contact tracing and other COVID-19 related digital interventions with a core element on telecommunications or networking\n\n## Publication\n\nAll registered papers will be submitted for publishing by Springer â€“LNICST series and made available through [SpringerLink Digital Library](https://link.springer.com/conference/securecomm).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Early Registration deadline:** April 10, 2025\n*   **Main Track Full Paper Submission deadline:** March 1, 2025\n*   **Main Track Notification deadline:** April 15, 2025\n*   **Main Track Camera-ready deadline:** June 1, 2025\n*   **Late Track Full Paper Submission deadline:** April 10, 2025\n*   **Late Track Notification deadline:** May 10, 2025\n*   **Late Track Camera-ready deadline:** June 1, 2025\n*   **Posters & Demos Track Full Paper Submission deadline:** May 1, 2025\n*   **Posters & Demos Track Notification deadline:** May 15, 2025\n*   **Posters & Demos Track Camera-ready deadline:** June 1, 2025\n*   **Workshop Proposals deadline:** March 15, 2025\n*   **Tutorials Proposal Submission Deadline:** May 15, 2025\n*   **Conference dates:** July 4-6, 2025"
