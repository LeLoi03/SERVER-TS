  "Call for Papers": "# MPLR 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 22nd International Conference on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR 2025, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems. The conference will be held on **October 14, 2025, at the Marina Bay Sands Convention Centre in Singapore**.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe areas of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n### Languages and Compilers\n\n*   Managed languages (e.g., Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C#, F#, Clojure, Groovy, Kotlin, R, Smalltalk, Racket, Rust, Go, Lua, MATLAB, Raku, Pony, …)\n*   Domain-specific languages\n*   Language design\n*   Compilers and interpreters\n*   Type systems and program logics\n*   Language interoperability\n*   Parallelism, distribution, and concurrency\n\n### Virtual Machines\n\n*   Portable intermediate representations (e.g., JVM, WebAssembly, RPython, …)\n*   Managed runtime systems (e.g., GraalVM, Android Runtime (ART), V8, JavaScriptCore, .NET, …)\n*   VM design and optimization\n*   VMs for mobile and embedded devices\n*   VMs for real-time applications\n*   Memory management and garbage collection\n*   Hardware/software co-design\n*   Persistence\n\n### Techniques, Tools, and Applications\n\n*   Static and dynamic program analysis\n*   Testing and debugging\n*   Refactoring\n*   Program understanding\n*   Program synthesis\n*   Security and privacy\n*   Performance analysis and monitoring\n*   Compiler and program verification and model checking\n\n## Submission Categories\n\nMPLR accepts three types of submissions:\n\n*   **Regular research papers:** describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms. (Format: up to 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix)\n*   **Work-in-progress research papers:** describing hot topics or promising new ideas. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix)\n*   **Industry and tool papers:** presenting technical challenges and solutions for managed language platforms in the context of deployed applications and systems. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix; up to 12 pages allowed if justified by the content)\n\nAccepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library, except if the authors prefer not to be included.\n\nMPLR 2025 submissions must conform to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions and to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy. See [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication).\n\nMPLR 2025 will not hold its own poster session. Please consider submitting to the SPLASH poster track.\n\n## Author Instructions\n\nSubmissions need to use the ACM SIGPLAN format with the `sigplan` style.  All submissions need to be in PDF format. MPLR now uses double-blind reviewing.  Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer.\n\n## Submission Site\n\n[https://mplr25.hotcrp.com](https://mplr25.hotcrp.com)\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h).\n\n*   **Paper Submission Deadline:** June 11, 2025\n*   **Paper Author Notification:** July 28, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready for Papers:** August 25, 2025\n*   **Conference Date:** October 14, 2025\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Tony Hosking, Australian National University, Australia\n*   Beatrice Åkerblom, Stockholm University\n*   Björn Franke, University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom\n*   Conrad Watt, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore\n*   David Leopoldseder, Oracle Labs, Austria\n*   Dimi Racordon, EPFL, LAMP, Switzerland\n*   Hannes Payer, Google\n*   Jeremy Singer, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom\n*   Koich Sasada, Stores, Inc., Japan\n*   Marc Feeley, Université de Montréal, Canada\n*   Matthew Gaudet, Mozilla, Canada\n*   Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, Shopify, Canada\n*   Michael D.
