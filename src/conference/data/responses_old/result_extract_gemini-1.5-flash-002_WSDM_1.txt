  "Call for Papers": "# WSDM 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 18th ACM International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining (WSDM 2025) will take place in **Hannover, Germany from March 10th-14th, 2025**.\n\nWSDM is a highly selective conference that includes invited talks, as well as refereed full papers. WSDM publishes original, high-quality papers related to search and data mining on the Web and the Social Web, with an emphasis on practical yet principled novel models of search and data mining, algorithm design and analysis, economic implications, and in-depth experimental analysis of accuracy and performance.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nOriginal papers emphasizing novel algorithmic approaches are particularly encouraged. Application-oriented papers that make innovative technical contributions to research are welcome. Visionary papers on new and emerging topics are particularly encouraged.\n\nAuthors are explicitly discouraged from submitting papers that do not clearly present their contribution with respect to previous works, that contain only incremental results, and that do not provide significant advances over existing approaches.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are 11:59 pm anywhere on earth.\n\n*   **Abstract Deadline:** August 9, 2024\n*   **Papers Due:** August 14, 2024\n*   **Notifications:** October 23, 2024\n*   **Camera Ready:** December 18, 2024\n*   **Conference:** March 10-14, 2025\n\n## List of Topics\n\nWSDM proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library. We invite papers in the areas below, with example topics listed for each area:\n\n*   **Web Search:** Algorithms for web-scale search; Adversarial search; Search user interfaces and interaction; Distributed search, metasearch, peer-to-peer search; Local and mobile search; Multimedia web search, cross-lingual search; Query analysis and query processing; Search benchmarking and evaluation; Search user behavior and log analysis; Search with Foundation Models\n*   **Web Mining and Content Analysis:** Crawling and indexing web content; Web recommender systems and algorithms; Clustering, classification, and summarization of web data; Data, entity, event, and relationship extraction; Knowledge acquisition and automatic construction of knowledge bases; Large-scale graph analysis; Semantic search, faceted search, and knowledge graphs; Multimodal data mining; Scalable algorithms for mining web data; Opinion mining and sentiment analysis; Web traffic and log analysis; Web measurements, web evolution, and web models.\n*   **Web of Things, Ubiquitous and Mobile Computing:** Algorithms for web-scale search; Adversarial search; Search user interfaces and interaction; Distributed search, metasearch, peer-to-peer search; Local and mobile search; Multimedia web search, cross-lingual search; Query analysis and query processing; Search benchmarking and evaluation; Search user behavior and log analysis; Search with Foundation Models\n*   **Privacy, Fairness, Interpretability:** Fairness and accountability in ranking, recommendations, and advertising; Explainability in web systems; Model and algorithm transparency; Interpretable models of individual and social behavior; Web search and data mining under privacy constraints; Fairness and interpretability in applications of web mining for social good.\n*   **Social Networks:** Link prediction and community detection; Social network analysis and graph algorithms; Computational social science; Influence and viral marketing in social networks; Social sensing; Searching social and real-time content; Social network dynamics; Sampling, experiments, and evaluation in social networks; Social media analysis: blogs and friendship networks; Social network analysis, theories, models and applications; Social reputation and trust.\n*   **Intelligent Assistants:** Voice search, conversational search, and dialog systems; Personal assistants, dialogue models, and conversational interaction; Task-driven search; Zero-query and implicit search.\n*   **Crowdsourcing and Human Computation:** Collaborative search and question answering; Human-in-the-Loop and Collaborative Human-AI systems.\n*   **Emerging and Creative Applications:** Mental health and well-being support systems; Web mining for social good; Systems and algorithms for urban applications such as smart cities/buildings/etc; Online education systems; Monitoring and prevention of epidemics; Social chatbots.\n*   **Information Integrity:** Systems and algorithms for monitoring and detection of misinformation and fake news; Prevalence and virality of misinformation; Misinformation sources and origins; Source and content credibility; Detecting and combating spamming, trolling aggression, dog whistles, and toxic online behaviors; Methods for detecting and mitigating low-quality and offensive content, bullying and hate speech; Polarization, extremism and radicalization; Echo chambers and filter bubbles.\n*   **Foundation Models:** Use of large language models (LLMs) and other foundation models for web search and data mining, including but not limited to the following tasks: Generative question answering; Indexing and query analysis; Pre-training and self-supervised learning for web-based tasks; Development of new user interfaces and user experiences; Support to information integrity.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Papers can be submitted through CMT: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/WSDM2025](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/WSDM2025)\n*   Manuscripts must be submitted in PDF according to the new ACM format published in ACM guidelines (use documentclass[sigconf,anonymous,review]{acmart}).\n*   Submissions should not exceed eight pages including any diagrams or tables, plus up to two additional pages for references and discussion of ethical considerations.\n*   Submissions must be self-contained and in English.\n*   PDF files submitted must be anonymized.\n*   Authors may submit supplementary material (up to 100MB compressed in .zip format).\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n*   Dr. Marc Najork, Distinguished Research Scientist, Google DeepMind\n*   Prof. Meeyoung Cha, Director, MPI-SP, Professor, KAIST\n*   Prof. Marie-Francine (Sien) Moens, Director, LIIR Research lab, Professor, KU Leuven\n\n## General Chairs\n\n*   Prof. Wolfgang Nejdl, Director, L3S Research Center, Professor, Leibniz Universität Hannover\n*   Prof. Sören Auer, Director, TIB Hannover, Professor, Leibniz Universität Hannover"
