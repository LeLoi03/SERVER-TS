  "Summary": "PADL 2025, the 27th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages, was held at the Curtis Hotel Denver in Denver, Colorado, from January 20-21, 2025.  The symposium is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming.",
  "Call for Papers": "# PADL 2025: Call for Papers\n\nPADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, database and constraint programming, and theorem proving.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Innovative applications of declarative languages\n*   Declarative domain-specific languages and applications\n*   Practical applications of theoretical results\n*   New language developments and their impact on applications\n*   Declarative languages and software engineering\n*   Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications\n*   Practical experiences and industrial applications\n*   Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom\n*   Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages\n\nPADL 2025 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches related to applications, design, and implementation of declarative languages going beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example, advanced database languages and contract languages, as well as verification and theorem-proving methods that rely on declarative languages.\n\n## Submissions\n\nPADL 2025 welcomes:\n\n*   **Regular papers:** (max. 15 pages, excluding references)\n*   **Short papers:** (max. 8 pages, excluding references)\n*   **Extended abstracts:** (max. 3 pages)\n\nAll page limits exclude references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style ([https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)).\n\nThe review process of PADL 2025 is double-anonymous.\n\n## Submission Link\n\n[https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/padl2025](https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/padl2025)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract submission:** October 11, 2024\n*   **Paper submission:** October 18, 2024\n*   **Notification to authors:** November 14, 2024\n*   **Final version:** November 24, 2024\n*   **Symposium:** January 20-21, 2025\n\n## Student Grants\n\nPADL 2025 encourages students to participate in the symposium by providing some student grants to partially cover the registration and travel costs.  The selection process will give preference to students who present their papers at the symposium. Students from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.\n\n## Awards\n\n*   **Best Student Paper Award:** Zachary Hansen, Yuliya Lierler: “SM-based Semantics for Answer Set Programs Containing Conditional Literals and Arithmetic”\n*   **Best Student Paper Honorable Mention:** Kento Takyu, Kazunori Ueda: “Enhancing a Hierarchical Graph Rewriting Language based on MELL Cut Elimination”\n\n## Registration for PADL 2025\n\nThe registration for PADL 2025 is handled separately from POPL. At least one author of each accepted paper must register specifically to PADL.  Early registration deadline is December 29, 2024.\n\n## Programme Chairs\n\n*   Esra Erdem, Sabanci University, Turkey\n*   German Vidal, Universitat Politecnica de Valencia, Spain\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Ozgur Akgun, University of St Andrews, St Andrews, UK\n*   Nada Amin, Harvard University\n*   Marcello Balduccini, Saint Joseph's University, USA\n*   Mutsunori Banbara, Nagoya University\n*   Clara Benac Earle, Universidad Politécnica de Madrid\n*   Malgorzata Biernacka, University of Wrocław\n*   Manuel Carro, IMDEA Software Institute and Universidad Politécnica de Madrid\n*   Laura M.
