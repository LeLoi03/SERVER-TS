  "Call for Papers": "# ACL 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025) will take place in **Vienna, Austria from July 27 to August 1st, 2025**.\n\n## Submission\n\nACL 2025 will use [ACL Rolling Review](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) (ARR) as a reviewing system.\n\n**Submission deadline (all papers are submitted to ARR): February 15, 2025**\n\n## Key Dates\n\n*   **ARR reviews & meta-reviews available to authors of the February cycle:** April 15, 2025\n*   **Commitment deadline for ACL 2025:** April 20, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** May 15, 2025\n*   **Withdrawal deadline:** May 30, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready papers due:** May 30, 2025\n*   **Tutorials & Welcome Reception:** July 27, 2025\n*   **Main Conference Dates:** July 28 - 30, 2025\n*   **Workshops:** July 31 - August 1, 2025\n\n**All deadlines are 11.59 pm UTC -12h (anywhere on earth).**\n\n## Overview\n\nACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. ACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and by the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.\n\nPapers submitted to ACL 2025, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics.\n\n## Submission Topics\n\nACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas (in alphabetical order):\n\n*   Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics\n*   Dialogue and Interactive Systems\n*   Discourse and Pragmatics\n*   Efficient/Low-Resource Methods for NLP\n*   Ethics, Bias, and Fairness\n*   Generation\n*   Human-Centered NLP\n*   Information Extraction\n*   Information Retrieval and Text Mining\n*   Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP\n*   Language Modeling\n*   Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics\n*   Machine Learning for NLP\n*   Machine Translation\n*   Multilinguality and Language Diversity\n*   Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond\n*   NLP Applications\n*   Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation\n*   Question Answering\n*   Resources and Evaluation\n*   Semantics: Lexical and Sentence-Level\n*   Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining\n*   Speech recognition, text-to-speech and spoken language understanding\n*   Summarization\n*   Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing\n\n### Special Theme: Generalization of NLP Models\n\nACL 2025 will have a new theme with the goal of reflecting and stimulating discussion about the current state of development of the field of NLP: Generalization of NLP Models.\n\nThe possible topics of discussion include (but are not limited to) the following:\n\n*   How can we enhance the generalization of NLP models across various dimensions—compositional, structural, cross-task, cross-lingual, cross-domain, and robustness?\n*   What factors affect the generalization of NLP models?\n*   What are the most effective methods for evaluating the generalization capabilities of NLP models?\n*   While Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhance the generalization of NLP models, what are the key limitations of LLMs in this regard?\n\n## Submission Details\n\n*   Long Papers: (8 pages)\n*   Short Papers: (4 pages)\n*   Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers’ comments.\n\n## Review Process\n\nACL 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference.\n\n## Presentation at the Conference\n\nAll accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline may be subject to desk rejection.\n\n## Contact\n\n*   General Chair: Roberto Navigli\n*   Program Chairs: Wanxiang Che, Joyce Nabende, Mohammad Taher Pilehvar, Ekaterina Shutova\n*   For questions related to paper submission, email: [editors@aclrollingreview.org](mailto:editors@aclrollingreview.org)\n*   For all other questions, email: [acl2025pcs@gmail.com](mailto:acl2025pcs@gmail.com)"
