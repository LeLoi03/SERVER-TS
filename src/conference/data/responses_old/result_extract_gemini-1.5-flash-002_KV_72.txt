  "Call for Papers": "# ICML 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025) will be held in **Vancouver, Canada, from July 13–19, 2025**.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nWe invite submissions of papers on original and rigorous research of significant interest to the machine learning community for the main conference proceedings. All papers will be reviewed in a double-blind process, and accepted papers will be presented at the conference.\n\n*   Papers must be prepared and submitted as a single file: 8 pages for the main paper, with unlimited pages for references, the impact statement, and appendices. There will be no separate deadline for the submission of supplementary material. The final versions of accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main paper.\n*   We require that, barring exceptional circumstances, at least one of the authors of accepted papers attend the conference in person to present the paper.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include (but are not limited to):\n\n*   General Machine Learning\n*   Deep Learning\n*   Evaluation\n*   Theory of Machine Learning\n*   Machine Learning Systems\n*   Optimization\n*   Probabilistic Methods\n*   Reinforcement Learning\n*   Trustworthy Machine Learning\n*   Application-Driven Machine Learning\n\n## Important Dates and Submission Site\n\n*   **Submission site open:** January 9, 2025\n*   **Suggested OpenReview account creation deadline:** January 9, 2025\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** January 23, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Full paper submission deadline:** January 30, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)\n\nAbstracts and papers can be submitted through OpenReview: [https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2025/Conference)\n\n## Policies\n\n*   **Deadlines:** Abstract and paper submission deadlines are strict. In no circumstances will extensions be given.\n*   **Changes to abstract/title/authorship:** The author list cannot be changed after the abstract deadline. After the abstract deadline, authors may be reordered, but any additions or removals must be justified in writing and approved on a case-by-case basis by the program chairs. Approval will be granted only in exceptional circumstances.\n*   **Reciprocal Reviewing Requirement:** All submissions must have at least one author who agrees to serve as a reviewer for ICML. Additionally, every author with 4 or more submissions must agree to serve as a reviewer for ICML. Submissions that do not meet this reciprocal review requirement may be desk rejected.\n*   **Double-Blind Review:** All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any information with the intention or consequence of violating the double-blind reviewing policy.\n*   **Dual Submission:** Authors may not submit papers that are identical, or substantially similar, to versions that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals.\n*   **Use of Generative AI:** Authors are allowed to use generative AI tools such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in writing or research. However, authors must take full responsibility for all content in their paper, including any content generated by AI tools that might be construed as plagiarism or scientific misconduct.\n*   **Ethical Conduct for Peer Review:** Authors are expected to follow standard ethical conduct for peer review. If you believe someone may be engaging in unethical conduct, please notify ICML by filling out the Ethics Violation Reporting form.\n*   **Impact Statements:** Authors are required to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This statement should be in a separate section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements, before References), and does not count toward the paper page limit.\n*   **Lay summaries:** Authors of accepted papers will be required to submit a short “lay summary” of their work (also called \"plain language summary\") in OpenReview when submitting their camera-ready paper."
