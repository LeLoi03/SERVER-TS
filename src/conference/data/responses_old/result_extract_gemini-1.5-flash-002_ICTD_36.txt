"Call for Papers": "# AIED 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025) will take place between **July 22-26, 2025 in Palermo, Italy**.\n\n## Theme\n\n“AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future”\n\nThe AIED 2025 conference centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education. By harnessing AI’s capacity to personalize learning experiences, educators can address the diverse needs of students and mitigate educational disparities, particularly among underserved and marginalized communities. This year’s theme also underscores the critical importance of ethical AI integration, ensuring that these advanced technologies are deployed responsibly to uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and privacy.\n\n## Tracks\n\nFor its main paper submissions, AIED 2025 solicits empirical and theoretical papers relating to both AI and education in the following lines of research and application, which represent our research tracks:\n\n*   Track 1 – AIED architectures and tools\n*   Track 2 – Machine learning and Generative AI\n*   Track 3 – Learning, teaching and pedagogy\n*   Track 4 – Human-centered design and design-based research\n*   Track 5 – Teaching AI\n*   Track 6 – Ethics, Equity, and AIED in Society\n*   Track 7 – Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modelling for Education\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nWe invite the following main submissions to the conference, to be submitted directly to one of the above research tracks:\n\n*   **Full paper submission:** Full papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Full papers will be presented as long oral talks. Papers submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper.\n*   **Short paper submission:** Short papers are expected to describe novel and interesting results to the overall community at large. The goal is to give novel but not necessarily mature work a chance to be seen by other researchers and practitioners and to be discussed at the conference. Short papers will be presented as short oral talks.\n\nSubmissions must follow Springer policies on publication (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process): [https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v](https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v).\n\n## Review Process\n\nAll submissions will be reviewed by three members of the program committee, followed by a metareview conducted by a senior member of the program committee (all double-masked) to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation.\n\n## Anonymity\n\nThe review process will be double-masked, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous. To this end, authors should:\n\n*   Eliminate all information that could lead to their identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, projects and/or systems)\n*   Cite own prior work (if needed) in the third person\n*   Eliminate acknowledgments and references to funding sources\n\n## Important Dates (full and short papers, main submission)\n\n*   **Submissions open:** December 20, 2024\n*   **Abstracts due:** February 12, 2025\n*   **Papers due:** February 19, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance to authors:** April 2, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready paper due:** May 2, 2025"
