The conference seeks academic, industry, and government submissions on all theoretical and practical aspects of cryptology and network security, and its extended domains in modern computing systems.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nHigh-quality papers on unpublished research and implementation experiences may be submitted. All papers must be original and not substantially duplicated work that has been published at, or is simultaneously submitted to, a journal or another conference or workshop.\n\n*   All submissions must be written in English and span no more than 20 pages in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format, including title, abstract, and bibliography.  A Springer template can be found in Overleaf.\n*   The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level understandable by a non-expert reader and explain the context to related work.\n*   Submitted papers may contain supplementary material in the form of well-marked appendices or a separate file archive (particularly for source code, data files, etc.). Note that supplementary material will not be included in the proceedings. The main paper should be intelligible without requiring the reader to consult the supplementary material.\n*   Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations.\n*   The conference will also consider short papers of up to eight pages in the LNCS format, excluding the bibliography (max 2 pages).\n*   All submissions must be processed with LaTeX2e according to the instructions given by Springer. Submitted manuscripts must be typeset in plain Springer LNCS format.\n*   Papers must be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cans2025).\n*   The deadline for registering new submissions is April 28 (anywhere on earth, AoE).
