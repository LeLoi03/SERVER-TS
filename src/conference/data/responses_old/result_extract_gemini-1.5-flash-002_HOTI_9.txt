  "Call for Papers": "# Hot Interconnects 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 32nd IEEE Symposium on High-Performance Interconnects, Hot Interconnects (HotI 2025), will take place **virtually from Wednesday, August 20 – Friday, August 22, 2025**.\n\nHot Interconnects is the premier international forum for researchers and developers of state-of-the-art hardware and software architectures and implementations for interconnection networks of all scales, ranging from multi-core, on-chip interconnects to those within systems, clusters, data centers, and clouds.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\n*   Systems software for communication\n*   Novel and innovative interconnect architectures\n*   Accelerator interconnects, e.g., NVLINK, Infinity Fabric\n*   Network software/hardware designed for AI/ML workloads\n*   Multi-core processor interconnects\n*   System-on-Chip Interconnects\n*   Chiplet-interconnect technologies such as UCIe and BOW\n*   Advanced chip-to-chip communication technologies\n*   Optical interconnects\n*   Protocol and interfaces for inter-processor communication\n*   Survivability and fault-tolerance of interconnects\n*   High-speed packet processing engines and network processors\n*   System and storage area network architectures and protocols\n*   High-performance host-network interface architectures\n*   High-bandwidth and low-latency I/O\n*   Pb/s switching and routing technologies\n*   Innovative architectures for supporting collective communication\n*   Novel communication architectures to support cloud & grid computing\n*   Centralized and distributed cloud interconnects\n*   Requirements driving high-performance interconnects\n*   Traffic characterization for HPC systems and commercial data centers\n*   Software-defined networking and software overlay networks\n*   Software for network bring-up, configuration and performance management (OpenFlow, OpenSM)\n*   Data Center Networking\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nThis year we invite papers to be submitted either as regular (long) papers (up to 10 pages) or as hot topic papers (up to 4 pages). Hot topic papers could be positional papers, industry papers, or papers describing hot-off-the-press breaking research results and will be judged accordingly and independently from the regular papers.\n\nPapers need sufficient technical detail to judge quality and suitability for presentation. Submissions must conform to [IEEE ethics standards](https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/author-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-policies/).\n\nSubmissions should include title, author, abstract, and paper in double-column, see [IEEE format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) for details.\n\nPapers will be submitted electronically through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=hoti2025) and will undergo a single-blind review process.\n\n*   Regular papers: up to 10 pages (including technical content and figures), excluding references and any appendices. Appendices (if any) are limited to 5 pages (the limit might be extended upon committee approval in advance). Reproducibility appendices are encouraged but no official verification is provided by the HotI program committee.\n*   Hot topic papers: up to 4 pages (including technical content and figures) excluding references. Appendices are not allowed for hot topic papers.\n\nMaterials other than the abstract, main paper body, and references will be read at the committee’s discretion.\n\nAccepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. We plan to invite the best papers for an [IEEE Micro](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=50) Special issue submission.\n\nAfter a paper is accepted, the authors must follow the conference and [IEEE CPS guidelines](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/about/corporate/strategic-initiatives/ethics/ieee-conf-policy-on-ethics-and-plagiarism.pdf) in publishing the paper.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper abstract deadline:** May 9, 2025\n*   **Submission deadline:** May 23, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** June 27, 2025"
