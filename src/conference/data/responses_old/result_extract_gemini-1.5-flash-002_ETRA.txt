  "Summary": "The 2025 ACM Symposium on Eye Tracking Research & Applications (ETRA) will be held in Tokyo, Japan from May 26 to May 29, 2025. The aim of ETRA is to bring together researchers and practitioners from across fields with the common goal of continuing to move eye tracking research forward.",
  "Call for Papers": "# ETRA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 2025 ACM Symposium on Eye Tracking Research & Applications (ETRA) will be held in **Tokyo, Japan from May 26 to May 29, 2025**.\n\n## Call for Long Papers\n\nThe symposium presents advances and innovations in oculomotor research, gaze tracking systems, eye tracking applications, gaze-based interaction, and eye movement data analysis. We invite high-quality papers in all areas of eye tracking research and applications and welcome submissions from all domains, including visuomotor neuroscience, perception, and cognition.\n\nPapers must be original and not accepted previously for publication or under review elsewhere. At least one author must register and present accepted work at the conference. Accepted full papers will be published as journal articles in special issues of either PACM CGIT or PACM HCI with the authorsâ€™ choice.\n\n**Required this year:** With burgeoning technological and social applications of eye-tracking research, we now require authors to discuss the potential societal risks that might result from its publication. Authors are required to include a privacy and ethics statement of two to three sentences related to their study findings or new advancements made possible by their developed methods. The privacy and ethics statement should clearly address the broader impacts of their work as it relates to the authors' interpretation of privacy, fairness, safety, human rights, data sovereignty, or future misuse and any benefit/risk trade-off resulting from this research.\n\n## Call for Short Papers\n\nAuthors are also invited to submit original work in a shorter format. A short paper should provide a focused and concise, yet significant, contribution to the current state of the art while not delving into broad discussion.\n\nAll short paper submissions will undergo a double-blind review process assessing the originality and technical quality of the work, as well as the relevance for eye-tracking research and applications. Accepted papers will be archived in the conference proceedings and will be available in the ACM Digital Library as \"ETRA '25 Short Papers\".\n\n**Required this year:** With burgeoning technological and social applications of eye-tracking research, we now require authors to discuss the potential societal risks that might result from its publication.

Research contributions are welcomed across a range of topics including, but not limited to:\n\n**Data Analysis:**\n\n*   Novel methods such as deep learning and other machine learning-based methods\n*   Scanpath analysis and classification\n*   Clustering of gaze data\n*   Event detection\n*   Large-scale data processing\n\n**Prediction methods:**\n\n*   Gaze prediction\n*   Action, intent, or attribute prediction\n\n**Visualization:**\n\n*   Visual representation of gaze patterns and other eye tracking data\n*   Visual analytics and combination with machine learning\n\n**Eye tracking devices:**\n\n*   Head-mounted eye tracking\n*   Remote eye tracking\n*   Novel sensors and wearables\n\n**Perception and cognition; Empirical studies:**\n\n*   Perception, attention, and oculomotor control\n*   Visual search and scene perception\n*   Eye movements in reading and communication\n*   Eye-hand coordination\n*   Eye tracking in naturalistic tasks\n*   In-the-wild studies\n\n**Gaze based interaction:**\n\n*   Novel interaction methods\n*   Virtual and augmented reality\n*   Multi-modal interaction\n*   Security and privacy\n\n**Applications:**\n\n*   Education\n*   Driving\n*   Medical / Health\n*   Virtual/Augmented Reality\n*   Graphics and virtual avatars\n*   Media accessibility\n\n## Important Dates\n\n(Time Zone AoE/Anywhere on Earth)\n\n### Long Paper\n\n*   **Abstract submission (mandatory):** October 26, 2024\n*   **Paper submission:** November 1, 2024\n*   **First round reviews and notifications:** January 7, 2025\n*   **Revisions due:** February 18, 2025\n*   **Second round reviews and notifications:** March 13, 2025\n*   **Camera ready deadline:** March 31, 2025\n*   **Conference date:** May 26 - May 29, 2025\n\n### Short Paper\n\n*   **Abstract submission (mandatory):** January 14, 2025\n*   **Paper submission:** January 21, 2025\n*   **First round reviews and notifications:** March 8, 2025\n*   **Camera ready deadline:** March 31, 2025\n*   **Conference date:** May 26 - May 29, 2025"
