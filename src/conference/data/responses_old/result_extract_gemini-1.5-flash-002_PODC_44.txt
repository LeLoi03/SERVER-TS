  "Call for Papers": "# PODC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 44th ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC 2025) will be held in **Huatulco, Mexico, from June 16-20, 2025**.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing is an international forum on the theory, design, analysis, implementation, and application of distributed systems and networks. We solicit papers in all areas of distributed computing. Papers from all viewpoints, including theory, practice, and experimentation, are welcome. The goal of the conference is to improve understanding of the principles underlying distributed computing.\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n*   Biological distributed algorithms and systems\n*   Blockchain and decentralized finance protocols\n*   Coding and reliable communication\n*   Communication networks\n*   Combinatorics and topology of distributed computing\n*   Concurrency, synchronization, and persistence\n*   Design and analysis of distributed algorithms\n*   Distributed and cloud storage\n*   Distributed and concurrent data structures\n*   Distributed computation for large-scale data\n*   Distributed graph algorithms\n*   Distributed machine learning and artificial intelligence\n*   Distributed operating systems, middleware, databases\n*   Distributed resource management and scheduling\n*   Fault-tolerance, reliability, self-organization, and self-stabilization\n*   Game-theoretic approaches to distributed computing\n*   High-performance, cluster, cloud, and grid computing\n*   Internet applications\n*   Languages, verification, and formal methods for distributed systems\n*   Lower bounds and impossibility results for distributed computing\n*   Mobile computing and autonomous agents\n*   Multiprocessor and multi-core architectures and algorithms\n*   Peer-to-peer systems, overlay networks, and social networks\n*   Population protocols\n*   Quantum and optics based distributed algorithms\n*   Replication and consistency\n*   Security and cryptography in distributed computing\n*   Specifications and semantics\n*   System-on-chip and network-on-chip architectures\n*   Transactional memory\n*   Wireless, sensor, mesh, and ad hoc networks\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are at 23:59 AoE.\n\n*   **Abstract submission:** February 4, 2025\n*   **Full paper submission:** February 8, 2025\n*   **Notification:** April 17, 2025\n\n## Submission Page\n\n[https://podc25.hotcrp.com](https://podc25.hotcrp.com)\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nA submitted paper should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A submission should strive to be accessible to a broad audience, as well as having sufficient details for experts in the area.\n\n### Regular Papers\n\nA regular paper must report on original research that has not been previously published. It is not permitted to submit the same material concurrently to journals or conferences with proceedings.\n\n### Brief Announcements\n\nA brief announcement may describe work in progress or work presented elsewhere. A brief announcement may also report on original research results that can be fully presented in the limited space available. The title of a brief announcement must begin with “Brief Announcement: ”.\n\n## Submission Format\n\nAll submissions should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Alternatively, papers can also be submitted by using the official ACM Master article LaTeX template acmart.cls, version 1.80 or greater, using the following documentclass instruction: `\\documentclass[acmsmall,nonacm,anonymous]{acmart}`. The template is available at [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).\n\n## Double-blind Reviewing\n\nThe conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way.\n\n## Conflict of Interest\n\nIndications of conflicts of interest will be required in the submission form.\n\n## Publication\n\nAccepted regular papers of up to 10 pages and brief announcements of up to 3 pages in two-column ACM proceedings format will be included in the conference proceedings. They must be formatted with the ACM Master templates using `\\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}`.\n\nIf more space than available in the proceedings for an accepted paper is needed, a full version must be available publicly, e.g., on arXiv, by the due date for the proceedings version, and the proceedings version must refer to this.\n\nIt is expected that papers that are published at PODC 2025 are presented by one of the authors in person at the conference. In exceptional circumstances (e.g., because of visa issues), a limited number of exceptions can be approved by the PC chair. A paid conference registration by one of the authors of each accepted paper will be required in any case.\n\nExtended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of the journal Distributed Computing. Up to two selected papers will be considered for publication in the Journal of the ACM."
