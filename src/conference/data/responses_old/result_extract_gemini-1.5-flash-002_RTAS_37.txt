  "Summary": "The 31st IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS 2025) will be held in Irvine, USA, from May 6–9, 2025, as part of CPS-IoT Week. RTAS is a top-tier conference focusing on systems with timing requirements.  The conference welcomes papers describing applications, case studies, methodologies, tools, algorithms, or operating systems, middleware, or hardware innovations that contribute to the state of the art in the design, implementation, validation, verification, and evolution of systems with timing requirements.",
  "Call for Papers": "# RTAS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 31st IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS 2025) will be held in **Irvine, USA, from May 6-9, 2025**, as part of CPS-IoT Week.\n\nRTAS is a top-tier conference with a focus on systems with timing requirements. RTAS’25 welcomes papers describing applications, case studies, methodologies, tools, algorithms, or operating systems, middleware, or hardware innovations that contribute to the state of the art in the design, implementation, validation, verification, and evolution of systems with timing requirements.\n\n## Tracks\n\nRTAS’25 consists of two tracks:\n\n*   Track 1: Systems and Applications\n*   Track 2: Applied Methodologies and Foundations\n\n## Scope and Guidelines\n\nTo be in scope, papers must explicitly consider at least one of the following:\n\n*   Some kind of timing requirements\n*   Improvements or innovations that directly support the fundamental properties of systems with timing requirements\n\n### Timing Requirements\n\nThe timing requirements of interest are broadly defined and include not only classical hard real-time constraints, but also soft real-time, probabilistic, quality-of-service (QoS), throughput, or latency requirements.  The authors should specifically state the types of timing-related properties addressed by the contribution(s) presented in their paper.\n\n### Improvements or Innovations to Support the Fundamental Properties of Systems with Timing Requirements\n\nWork that supports the design, implementation, validation, or evaluation of deterministic, predictable, dependable, efficient, or next-generation systems with timing requirements are welcome. The authors should specifically state how their work can be used or built upon to ultimately achieve systems with timing requirements beyond the state of the arts.\n\n### Application Area\n\nThe application area can be any type of systems with timing requirements, including, but not limited to:\n\n*   Resource-constrained embedded systems\n*   Distributed cyber-physical systems (CPS)\n*   Cloud/edge/fog computing systems\n*   Cloud data centers\n*   Internet of Things (IoT)\n*   Mobile computing\n*   Robotics\n*   Smart grid\n*   Smart cities\n*   Middleware and frameworks\n*   Machine learning and signal processing algorithms\n\nRTAS welcomes both papers backed by formal proofs, as well as papers that focus exclusively on empirical validation of timing requirements, e.g., using traces or performance models inferred from data. Research results from fundamental research, (case-driven) applied research, and (pragmatic) industry practice are all in scope.\n\n## Review Process\n\nRTAS’25 follows a double-anonymous peer reviewing process: author identities and affiliations will not be revealed to reviewers. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a response to reviews before acceptance decisions are made, solely to provide clarifications and correct misconceptions. The response will not allow authors to introduce new material beyond the original submission or promise such material for the camera-ready version. There will be an optional artifact evaluation process for accepted papers that assesses the reproducibility of the work.\n\n## Submission Portal\n\n[https://rtas25.hotcrp.com/](https://rtas25.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n(All times are UTC-12, or “anywhere on earth,” unless otherwise stated.)\n\n*   Submission Deadline (Firm): Thursday, November 14, 2024\n*   Author Response Period: Wednesday, January 8 – Sunday, January 12, 2025\n*   Author Notification: Thursday, January 23, 2025\n*   BP (Brief Presentation) Submission Deadline: February 18, 2025\n*   AE (Artifact Evaluation) Submission Deadline: February 25, 2025\n*   Camera-Ready: Monday, March 31, 2025\n*   Conference Date: Tuesday, May 6 – Friday, May 9, 2025\n\n## Contact\n\nPlease direct any questions to Tam Chantem ([tchantem@vt.edu](mailto:tchantem@vt.edu)) and include Geoffrey Nelissen ([g.r.r.j.p.nelissen@tue.nl](mailto:g.r.r.j.p.nelissen@tue.nl)) in the CC field. Please be sure to have “RTAS” on the subject line."
