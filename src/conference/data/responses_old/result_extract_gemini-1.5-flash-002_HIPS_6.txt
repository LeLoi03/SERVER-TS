  "Call for Papers": "# HIPS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 30th International Workshop on High-Level Parallel Programming Models and Supportive Environments (HIPS 2025) will be held as a full-day meeting at the IPDPS 2025 conference in **Milan, Lombardy, Italy, on June 3, 2025**.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   High-level and domain-specific programming systems\n*   Language/compiler support for AI/ML and Cybersecurity/Privacy (e.g., ML-based auto-tuning)\n*   Application of Large Language Models in high-level programming environments\n*   Higher-level programming support for quantum computing/quantum simulation\n*   Programming Models and Tools for the Edge-Cloud-HPC Continuum\n*   Task-based programming systems\n*   (Scalable) programming tools and tools for power & performance analysis, modeling, monitoring and debugging, and core correctness\n*   Compiler analysis and optimization techniques\n*   OS and architectural support for parallel programming and debugging\n*   Software and system support for extreme scalability including fault tolerance and power-aware HPC\n*   Programming environments for heterogeneous multicore systems and accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs\n*   Solutions for programming paradigms for GPUs from different hardware vendors\n*   Dynamism in applications and system resources\n*   Performance portability\n*   Efforts for improving the sustainability of scientific software\n*   Languages and runtime support for multi-science/coupled codes, including but not limited to ensemble computing and uncertainty quantification\n*   New programming languages and constructs for exploiting parallelism and locality\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission due date:** January 27, 2025 (extended), Anywhere on Earth (AoE)\n*   **Author notification:** February 21st, 2025 AoE\n*   **Camera-ready papers:** March 13th, 2025 AoE\n\n## Submission\n\nAuthors are invited to submit original papers in two separate tracks:\n\n*   **Full papers:** May not exceed 10 single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and references. The authors, if accepted, will have the opportunity to present their work during the workshop.\n*   **Short papers:** May not exceed 4 single-spaced double-column pages using 10-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and references. The authors, if accepted, will have the opportunity to give a short presentation during the workshop.\n\nAll submissions should be formatted according to the IPDPS paper style (IEEE conference style, single-blind). Please submit papers through [the IPDPS-HIPS Linklings site](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/ipdps/?page=Submit&id=HIPSWorkshopFullSubmission&site=ipdps2025).\n\n## Proceedings\n\nThe accepted full papers will be published in the IPDPS 2025 Workshops proceedings by the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. (Short papers will not appear in the proceedings.) Presentation of an accepted paper at the conference is a requirement of publication. Any paper that is not presented at the conference will not be included in IEEE Xplore.\n\n## Registration\n\nAttendance at this workshop is part of the registration for IPDPS 2025. See [here](http://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2025/2025-registration.html) to register.\n\nNote: at least one author of each paper must be registered for the symposium by March 31st in order for the paper to be published in the proceedings. It must be a full registration unless the sole author of the paper is a student."
