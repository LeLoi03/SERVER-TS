  "Call for Papers": "# VRST 2025: Call for Participation\n\nThe ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Virtual Reality Software and Technology (VRST 2025) will be held from **November 12-14, 2025**.\n\n## Topics\n\nVRST 2025 welcomes paper submissions relating (but not limited) to the following XR areas:\n\n*   Display technology and interaction devices\n*   Low-latency and high-performance software and applications\n*   Multi-user and distributed XR\n*   XR software environments and authoring systems\n*   Interaction techniques\n*   Tracking and sensing\n*   Multimodal XR including haptics, smell, taste, and brain-computer interfaces\n*   Audio & music processing, sound synthesis, and sonification\n*   XR-related computer vision, computer graphics, and rendering techniques\n*   Immersive analytics\n*   Diversity and Inclusion in XR\n*   XR-related modeling and simulation techniques\n*   Avatars and virtual humans, virtual embodiment, and body-ownership illusions\n*   Teleoperation and telepresence\n*   Performance testing, user experience, and empirical studies\n*   Locomotion and navigation\n*   Perception, presence, and cognition\n*   XR applications, e.g. training, medical, fabrication\n*   Multi-disciplinary research projects involving innovative use of XR\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*Each deadline is 23:59:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth) == GMT/UTC-12:00 on the stated day, no matter where the submitter is located.*\n\n*   **Paper Abstracts Due:** July 7, 2025\n*   **Papers (all materials) Due:** July 14, 2025\n*   **Author Notification for Papers:** September 1, 2025\n*   **Revised Papers Due:** September 8, 2025\n*   **Final Author Notification for Papers:** September 12, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready Papers Due:** September 15, 2025\n*   **Conference:** November 12 â€“ 14, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAll accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library in the VRST collection.\n\n### Format\n\nPaper submissions must be anonymous for a double-blind review process. All submissions should be prepared using the Word or LaTeX templates from the official ACM Master article template packages and TAPS ([https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow)).\n\n### Submission Lengths\n\n*   **LaTeX:** 4 to 9 pages, double column, excluding references\n*   **Word:** approx. 8,000 words including space for figures, tables, etc.\n\n### Anonymity Guidelines\n\nFor initial Paper submissions, authors are asked to remove all author and institution information and remove any clues that would directly identify any of the authors.\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\nSubmissions may be (optionally) accompanied by additional materials such as images, videos, or electronic documents. These materials do not form a part of the official submission. They will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers.\n\n### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nWhen designing and presenting user evaluations, please consider the following: User evaluations using non-representative or homogeneous participant populations can introduce biases in the results and conclusions.\n\n### Accessibility\n\nWe ask authors to try to be as inclusive as possible when preparing a submission. For instance, please provide alt-text for figures and tables and make supplemental videos accessible with subtitles.\n\n### Policies\n\nAt least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present their work in person at the conference. As the conference is in-person only, there will not be any opportunity to present remotely.\n\n## Submission System\n\nPlease use the Precision Conferences System (PCS) to submit your work: [https://new.precisionconference.com/vrst2025](https://new.precisionconference.com/vrst2025)\n\n## Contact\n\n[papers2025@vrst.acm.org](mailto:papers2025@vrst.acm.org)\n\n*   Daniel Zielasko, Trier University, Germany\n*   Kangsoo Kim, University of Calgary, Canada\n*   Rick Skarbez, La Trobe University, Australia"
