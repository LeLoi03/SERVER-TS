  "Call for Papers": "# WCNC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC) is a top-ranked, flagship conference of the IEEE Communications Society, bringing together researchers from academia, industry, and government. IEEE WCNC 2025 will be hosted in **Milan, Italy, from March 24-27, 2025**.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nProspective authors are invited to submit their works in the form of research papers describing significant and innovative contributions to the field of wireless communications and networking, in accordance with the four technical tracks listed below. Accepted and presented papers will be published in the IEEE WCNC 2025 Conference Proceedings and submitted to IEEE Xplore.\n\nProposals for half- or full-day tutorials and workshops are also invited in all communication and networking topics.\n\n## Tracks\n\n*   **Track 1: Physical Layer and Communication Theory**\n*   **Track 2: Medium Access Control and Networking**\n*   **Track 3: Resource Allocation and Machine Learning**\n*   **Track 4: Emerging Technologies, Network Architectures, and Applications**\n\n[Click here to see the PDF version](https://wcnc2025.ieee-wcnc.org/sites/wcnc2025.ieee-wcnc.org/files/2025%20WCNC%20Call%20of%20Papers_MILAN%20DRAFT6.pdf)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper Submissions Deadline:** October 14, 2024 (Firm Deadline)\n*   **Notification of Acceptance:** December 20, 2024\n*   **Camera-Ready Papers:** January 24, 2025\n*   **Conference:** March 24–27, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   The page length limit for all initial submissions for review is **SIX (6) printed pages (10-point font)** and must be written in English. Initial submissions longer than six pages will be rejected without review.\n*   All final submissions of accepted papers must be written in English with a maximum paper length of six (6) printed pages (10-point font) including figures. No more than two (2) additional printed pages (10-point font) may be included in final submissions, and the extra pages (the 7th and 8th pages) will incur an over-length page charge of US$100 for each page.\n*   All final papers must be submitted to the IEEE Conference eXpress website. Please refer to the acceptance letter for the instructions on how to upload final papers.\n*   You may also use one of the following templates for Microsoft Word: A4, US letter.  Download Standard IEEE conference templates for LaTeX formats >>\n*   Only PDF files will be accepted for the review process, and all submissions must be done through EDAS.\n*   During the initial paper submission process via EDAS, it is the authors' responsibility to ensure that the author list and the paper title of the submitted pdf file is an exact match to the author list and paper title on the EDAS registration page.\n*   The IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (including its removal from IEEE Explore) if the paper is not presented at the conference.\n*   Papers are reviewed on the basis that they do not contain plagiarized material and have not been submitted to any other conference at the same time (double submission). These matters are taken very seriously and the IEEE Communications society will take action against any author who engages in either practice. \n*   To be published in the IEEE WCNC 2025 Conference Proceedings and to be eligible for publication in IEEE Xplore®, an author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the FULL or LIMITED (member or non-member) rate, and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference unless the TPC Chair grants permission for a substitute presenter in advance of the event and who is qualified both to present and answer questions. Non-refundable registration fees must be paid prior to uploading the final IEEE formatted, publication-ready version of the paper. For authors with multiple accepted papers, one FULL or LIMITED registration is valid for up to 3 papers."
