  "Call for Papers": "# IEEE CCEM 2025: Call for Submissions\n\nThe Thirteenth IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing in Emerging Markets (CCEM 2025) will be held at **Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Mysuru, from July 31st to August 2nd, 2025**.\n\n## Conference Scope\n\nOver the past few years, cloud computing has been a dominating and revolutionary paradigm in information technology, and it is starting to have an impact on a wide range of sectors, including government, finance, telecommunications, education, retail, energy and utilities, and transportation.  Cloud computing continues to remain the future with studies suggesting more than 50% of all information technology will transition to a new paradigm within the next five to ten years.\n\nThis transformation has great implications for emerging markets, which have the potential to leapfrog mature markets in their adoption of cloud computing and combine cloud computing and mobile technologies, AI, Gen AI & Meta AI, etc. to introduce unique services that can transform the lives of billions, drive a much larger scale of adoption, and challenge existing price points, while presenting unique challenges in areas such as security and user interfaces to Industry 4.0.\n\n## Call for Technical Research Papers\n\nWe invite research paper submissions on all topics relevant to Cloud Computing in Emerging Markets. Papers should typically include:\n\n*   A clear description of the problem being addressed\n*   An overview of and comparison to related work\n*   The theoretical framework/model proposed by the authors\n*   Experimentation details and experimental results\n*   Conclusions\n\nPapers will be reviewed by an international program committee, which will ensure that only high-quality papers with originality and novelty are accepted for presentation in the conference.\n\nThe papers can be either:\n\n*   A full research paper (maximum 8 pages)\n*   A short research paper (5 pages)\n\nIEEE CCEM has adopted a double-blind reviewing process. Please submit your Technical Research Papers through Microsoft CMT for CCEM 2025: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IEEECCEM2025/Submission/Index](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IEEECCEM2025/Submission/Index)\n\n## Awards\n\n*   IEEE TCSVC - The Best Student Research Paper - Winner\n*   The Best Student Research Paper - Runner Up\n\n## Call for TechnoBizPlan Showcase Proposals\n\nThe TechnoBizPlan-Showcase session at CCEM enables start-up companies, established companies, professionals, students, and faculties to demonstrate their cutting-edge capabilities and ideas in the field of cloud computing. TechnoBizPlan proposals should typically include:\n\n*   An overview of the technology innovations being leveraged\n*   Top use cases for the innovation & product/service offerings\n*   Comparison to competing technologies and alternatives, market analysis, financials, risk assessment & mitigation\n*   Link to a three-minute or less uploaded YouTube video demo\n\nThe best pitch will win the \"13th IEEE CCEM 2025 TechnoBizPlan Competition Award\".\n\n## Awards\n\n*   The Best TechnoBiz Showcase Proposal - Winner\n*   The Best TechnoBiz Showcase Proposal - Runner Up\n\n## Call for Student Project Showcase Proposals\n\nThe Student-Project-Showcase offers an opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to do more constructive academic projects to analyze how cloud computing can be leveraged to assuage problems of emerging markets. The submission paper should have at least one Professor/Mentor from their college/university and should typically include:\n\n*   An overview of the technology innovations being leveraged\n*   Top use cases for the innovations\n*   Comparison to competing technologies and alternatives, architecture design, and implementation challenges\n*   URL of a maximum three-minute YouTube video\n\n## Awards\n\n*   The Best Student Project Showcase Proposal - Winner\n*   The Best Student Project Showcase Proposal - Runner Up\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Last date for All Papers submission:** April 30, 2025\n*   **Notification of Acceptance Date:** May 12, 2025\n*   **Early bird Registration Deadline:** June 11, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready Submission Due Date:** July 16, 2025\n*   **IEEE CCEM Main Conference:** July 31, August 1, and August 2, 2025"
