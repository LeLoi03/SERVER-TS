  "Call for Papers": "# Discovery Science 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 28th International Conference on Discovery Science (DS 2025) will be held in **Ljubljana, Slovenia, from September 22-26, 2025**.\n\nThe conference provides an open forum for intensive discussions and exchange of new ideas among researchers working in different areas of Artificial Intelligence and the data sciences, focusing on discovering and advancing scientific knowledge.\n\n## Topics\n\nThis year’s edition of Discovery Science welcomes works that focus on the following topics, which will be the subject of special sessions within the conference:\n\n*   Explainable AI 4 Science\n*   Symbolic regression 4 Science\n*   Semantic technologies 4 Science\n*   Foundation models 4 Science\n*   Physics informed NNs 4 Science\n\nIn addition to the main sessions, the conference will also include parallel one-day events dedicated to the following topics:\n\n*   AI & Environmental sciences\n*   AI & HPC\n*   AI & Biomedicine\n*   AI & Materials sciences\n*   AI & Physics\n*   AI & Space\n*   Challenges in Applied AI\n\nThe conference’s relevant topics include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Machine Learning\n*   Reinforcement learning\n*   AutoML, Meta-Learning, Planning to Learn\n*   Representation learning\n*   Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining\n*   Anomaly and Outlier Detection\n*   Learning from Complex Data\n*   Time-Series Analysis\n*   Spatial, Temporal and Spatiotemporal Data Analysis\n*   Unstructured Data Analysis\n*   Learning on graphs and other topologies\n*   Complex Network Analysis\n*   Causal Modelling and reasoning\n*   Neurosymbolic & hybrid AI systems\n*   Data and Knowledge Visualization\n*   Explainable AI and Interpretable Machine Learning\n*   Human-Machine Interaction for Knowledge Discovery and Management\n*   AI and High-performance Computing, Grid and Cloud Computing\n*   Optimization\n*   AI and Cybersecurity\n*   AI Creativity\n*   Process Discovery and Analysis\n*   Evaluation of Models and Predictions in Discovery Setting\n*   Applications of the above techniques in scientific domains\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll dates are specified as 23:59:59 SST (Standard Samoa Time / Anywhere on Earth)\n\n*   **Submission starts:** April 1, 2025\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** May 17, 2025\n*   **Full paper submission deadline:** May 24, 2025\n*   **Deadline for review submission:** June 24, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** July 7, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready version, author registration:** July 18, 2025\n\n## Submission Procedure\n\nContributions, written in English, must be formatted according to the guidelines of the Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer-Verlag. Submissions are handled via [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DS2025/](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DS2025/).\n\n### Main Conference\n\nWe invite original contributions that have not been previously published to another venue. The page limit for contributions submitted to the main conference, including special sessions, is 15 pages in the LNCS format (note that 15 pages in LNCS format is roughly equivalent to 8 pages in NeurIPS format). This includes figures, title pages, references, and appendices.\n\n### One-day event (Workshops)\n\nWe invite original technical/position papers or contributions discussing published works. For the parallel one-day events, the page limit for contributions is 2 pages in LNCS format, including figures, title pages, references, and appendices. Submissions to the parallel one-day events are non-archival, and therefore will not be included in the conference proceedings."
