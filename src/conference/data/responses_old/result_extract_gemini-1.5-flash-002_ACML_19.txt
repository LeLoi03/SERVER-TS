  "Call for Papers": "# ACML 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 17th Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML 2025) will take place between **December 9th and 12th, 2025, in Taipei, Taiwan**.\n\nThe conference calls for high-quality, original research papers in the theory and practice of machine learning. The conference also solicits proposals focusing on frontier research, new ideas, and paradigms in machine learning. Submissions from all parts of the world are encouraged.\n\n## Publication Tracks\n\nACML 2025 offers two publication tracks: the conference track and the journal track. At least one author of each accepted paper (for both tracks) must present the paper at the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper not being published. All deadlines will be at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth) unless otherwise specified.\n\n### New in 2025\n\nTo maintain high-quality peer review and support our growing community, each submission to ACML 2025 must nominate at least one author to serve as a reviewer, unless at least one author has served as an area chair. The nominated author should satisfy the below requirement:\n\n*   Published at least one first-author paper and published at least one paper (not necessarily the first author) in top venues including but not limited to ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, ACML, AAAI, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, or other equivalent venues.\n\nSubmissions without at least one author serving as a reviewer or area chair will be desk rejected. If your submission cannot nominate any authors that satisfy the above requirement, please email the PCs before June 23, 2023, through the following email: `acml_2025_programchairs@googlegroups.com`. You need to include the OpenReview submission ID in the email so we can process your information.\n\n### Conference Track\n\n**(16-page limit with references)** The proceedings will be published as a volume of Proceedings of Machine Learning Research Workshop and Conference Proceedings (PMLR).\n\n*   **Submission Deadline:** July 16, 2025\n*   **Reviews released to authors:** August 4, 2025\n*   **Author rebuttal deadline:** August 11, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notification:** September 1, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready submission deadline:** September 22, 2025\n\nSubmit your manuscript via OpenReview: [https://openreview.net/group?id=ACML.org/2025/Conference_Track](https://openreview.net/group?id=ACML.org/2025/Conference_Track)\n\n### Journal Track\n\n**Submission Deadline:** May 30, 2025\n\nFor the journal track, the abstract and the paper must be submitted to two different systems simultaneously:\n\n1.  Submit the title, abstract, and full manuscript via OpenReview: [ACML 2025 Journal Track | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ACML.org/2025/Journal_Track#tab-your-consoles)\n2.  Submit the full manuscript via Springer Nature’s manuscript submission system at: TBD. Choose “Special Issue for ACML 2025” as the article type.\n\nFailure to submit to both systems will result in desk rejection of the paper.\n\n*   **1st round review results released to authors:** July 3, 2025\n*   **Revised manuscript submission deadline:** July 31, 2025\n*   **2nd round review results released to authors:** August 15, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notification:** September 1, 2025\n*   **Conditional Camera-Ready Manuscript Submission Deadline:** September 22, 2025\n*   **Final Camera-Ready Manuscript Submission Deadline:** December 25, 2025\n\n## Topics\n\nTopics of interest include but are not limited to:\n\n*   **General machine learning:** Active learning, Bayesian machine learning, Clustering, Imitation Learning, Learning to Rank, Meta-Learning, Multi-objective learning, Multiple instance learning, Multi-task learning, Neuro-symbolic methods, Online learning, Optimization, Reinforcement learning, Relational learning, Self-supervised learning, Semi-supervised learning, Structured output learning, Supervised learning, Transfer learning, Unsupervised learning, Weakly-supervised learning, Learning with noisy labels, Other machine learning methodologies\n*   **Deep learning:** Architectures, Deep reinforcement learning, Generative models, Multi-modality learning, Large-language models and other foundation models, Deep learning theory, Other topics in deep learning\n*   **Theory:** Bandits, Computational learning theory, Game theory, Optimization, Statistical learning theory, Other theories\n*   **Datasets and reproducibility:** Implementations, libraries, ML datasets and benchmarks, Other topics in reproducible ML research\n*   **Trustworthy machine learning:** Accountability, explainability, transparency, Adversarial learning, Causality, Fairness, Privacy, Robustness, AutoML, Other topics in trustworthy ML\n*   **Learning in knowledge-intensive systems:** Knowledge refinement and theory revision, Multi-strategy learning, Other systems\n*   **Applications:** Bioinformatics, Biomedical informatics, Climate science, Collaborative filtering, Computer vision, Healthcare, Human activity recognition, Information retrieval, Natural Language Processing, Social good, Social networks, Web search, ML for science, Other applications\n\nThe Journal Track also welcomes overview or position papers."
