  "Call for Papers": "# TASE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 19th International Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Software Engineering (TASE 2025) will be held in **Limassol, Cyprus, on July 14-16, 2025**.\n\n## Overview\n\nTASE 2025 aims to bring together researchers and developers from academia and industry with an interest in the theoretical aspects of software engineering. We invite submission of research papers on topics covering all theoretical aspects of software engineering, including those describing applications of theoretical computer science in industrial applications and software engineering methodologies.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nAuthors are invited to submit high-quality technical papers describing original and unpublished work in all theoretical aspects of software engineering. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n### Software Engineering\n\n*   Software processes and workflows\n*   Software architectures and design\n*   Software product lines\n*   Requirements engineering\n*   Model-driven software engineering\n*   Software testing and quality assurance\n*   Software safety, security, and reliability\n*   Reverse engineering and software maintenance\n*   Component-based software engineering\n*   Feature-oriented programming\n*   Program synthesis\n*   Use of AI and large language models in software engineering\n\n### Formal Methods and Theoretical Computer Science\n\n*   Deductive verification\n*   Model checking\n*   Theorem proving, decision procedures, SAT and SMT\n*   Specification languages\n*   Program logics and calculi\n*   Formal languages and automata theory\n*   Run-time verification and monitoring\n*   Integration of formal methods\n*   Formal methods for AI systems, and vice versa\n\n### Programming Language Design and Technology\n\n*   Formal semantics\n*   Abstract interpretation and program analysis\n*   Language paradigms (object-oriented, functional, declarative, etc.)\n*   Type systems and behavioral typing\n*   Compiler design\n*   Domain-specific languages\n\n### Tools and Application Areas\n\n*   Software tools putting theory into practice\n*   Cyber-physical, embedded, and real-time systems\n*   Distributed and concurrent systems\n*   Semantic web and web services\n*   Service-oriented programming and cloud computing\n*   Quantum circuits and programs\n*   Cryptographic algorithms\n\n## Submission\n\nSubmissions to the conference must not have been published or be concurrently considered for publication elsewhere. All submissions will be judged on the basis of originality, contribution to the field, technical and presentation quality, and relevance to the conference. The proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Papers should be written in English and should not exceed 16 pages (excluding bibliography) for long papers and 6 pages (excluding bibliography) for short papers in LNCS format.\n\nSubmissions should be made through the TASE 2025 submission page, handled by the EasyChair conference management system:\n\n[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tase2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=tase2025)\n\nThe authors of a selected subset of accepted papers will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to a special issue in the journal Science of Computer Programming ([https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/science-of-computer-programming](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/science-of-computer-programming)).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Submission:** February 15, 2025 - March 1, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Paper Submission:** February 21, 2025 - March 8, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Author Notification:** April 1, 2025 - April 5, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Camera-ready Version and Author Registration:** May 1, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Conference:** July 14-16, 2025"
