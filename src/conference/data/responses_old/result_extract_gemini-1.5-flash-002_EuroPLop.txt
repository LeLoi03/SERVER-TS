  "Summary": "EuroPLoP is the premier European conference on patterns and pattern languages.  The 30th European Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, People, and Practices will be held from July 2-6, 2025, in Kloster Irsee, Germany.  The conference accepts papers on patterns, pattern languages, their theory, and their practical application focusing on computing and related fields.",
  "Call for Papers": "# EuroPLoP 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 30th European Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, People, and Practices (EuroPLoP 2025) will be held from **July 2-6, 2025, in Kloster Irsee, Germany.**\n\nEuroPLoP is the premier European conference on patterns and pattern languages. This 30th anniversary edition will feature special activities and the presence of important figures from the conference's history.\n\n## Call for Pattern Papers\n\nWe encourage submissions on software-related topics and other topics. EuroPLoP is open to synergies with other fields and therefore accepts up to 20% of pattern papers on non-computing topics. EuroPLoP accepts papers containing patterns or pattern languages, as well as papers related to the theory and the practical application of patterns. EuroPLoP also accepts excerpts from Ph.D. theses or book projects.\n\nWe particularly welcome submissions on the following topics (theory and practice):\n\n*   **Software/Systems Engineering, Classical Software Design Patterns:** Patterns in software and systems architecture, design, and implementation\n*   **Patterns in Human-computer-interface (HCI) design and architecture**\n*   **Patterns for improving software quality and software verification**\n*   **Reports, studies, or empirical evaluations of using patterns and pattern languages**\n*   **Modern Development and Operations Paradigms:** Patterns in agile processes, e.g., XP, Scrum, DevOps, CI/CD\n*   **Patterns in API Design & Management, Microservices, SOA, Serverless**\n*   **Patterns in Domain Driven Design (DDD), Model-driven Development & Eng.**\n*   **Patterns in Business, Organization, Innovation, and Requirements Engineering:** Patterns for business, organization, requirements engineering, and process management\n*   **Patterns for design thinking / lateral thinking, innovation processes, and creativity**\n*   **Patterns for transformations of corporate processes and alternative business cultures**\n*   **Education and Learning Patterns:** Patterns in education, collaboration, and interdisciplinary topics\n*   **Reports of using patterns in education**\n*   **Gamification patterns**\n*   **Patterns in Cloud and the Internet of Things:** Patterns in (Industrial) IoT, Cyber-Physical-Systems, embedded devices, control systems\n*   **Hardware/Software Co-Design patterns**\n*   **Patterns about safety, security, reliability, or dependability**\n*   **Patterns for cloud/fog/edge/embedded environments and isomorphic computing**\n*   **Patterns in Emerging Topics:** Hyper-automation, robotic process automation, digital transformation, Industry 4.0 patterns\n*   **Decentralized systems patterns**\n*   **Patterns for AI and machine learning**\n*   **Patterns for virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and immersive applications**\n*   **Patterns for multi-experience environments and people-centric smart spaces**\n*   **Meta Topics:** Pattern Theory / Theoretical arguments about patterns\n*   **Empirical evaluations of patterns and pattern languages**\n*   **Reflections on the history of patterns**\n*   **Perspectives on the future of patterns**\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Deadline for initial paper submission:** February 17, 2025 (extended)\n*   **Acceptance for shepherding:** March 10, 2025\n*   **Start of shepherding:** March 10, 2025\n*   **Deadline for improved paper version (for PC review):** May 5, 2025\n*   **Deadline for focus group proposals:** May 16, 2025\n*   **Acceptance notification; Registration opens:** May 28, 2025\n*   **Author Registration Deadline:** June 4, 2025\n*   **End of shepherding; Deadline for conference version of paper:** June 16, 2025\n*   **Registration closes:** June 23, 2025\n*   **Conference:** July 2-6, 2025\n*   **Deadline for proceedings version of paper:** September 30, 2025\n\n## Paper Submission Process\n\nThe submission runs through three quality gates before the final proceedings are published.  The submission system is available at [https://www.europlop.net/submission/](https://www.europlop.net/submission/).\n\n## Paper Submission Format\n\nThe final submission for publication must be formatted using the Springer template, but you can use any format for drafts and intermediate versions. We recommend 10 pages as a guideline and especially welcome shorter papers.  See examples at [https://europlop.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pattern_introduction_pack.zip](https://europlop.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pattern_introduction_pack.zip).\n\n## Conference Chairs\n\n*   Conference Chair: Eduardo Guerra, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, [eduardo dot guerra at unibz dot it](mailto:eduardo.guerra@unibz.it)\n*   Program Chair: Tsvetelina Plummer, NielsenIQ, [tsvetelina dot plummer at nielseniq dot com](mailto:tsvetelina.plummer@nielseniq.com)\n*   Focus Group Chair: Dennis Dubbert, Technische Hochschule Cologne, [dennis dot dubbert at th-koeln dot de](mailto:dennis.dubbert@th-koeln.de)"
