  "Call for Papers": "# CASC 2025: Call for Papers and Participation\n\nThe CASC workshop series has been running for over two decades to explore the interaction of computer algebra and scientific computing. CASC 2025 will be held in **Dubai, The United Arab Emirates, from November 24 – 28, 2025**.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe topics addressed in the workshop cover:\n\n1.  The theory of symbolic computation and its implementation in computer algebra systems.\n2.  All other areas of scientific computing in regards to their benefit from or use of computer algebra methods and software.\n3.  Applications of the above throughout the natural sciences and engineering.\n\nWe welcome papers on both fundamental research and implementation issues. We also accept survey papers but these MUST BE CLEARLY LABELLED as such in the title.\n\n## Conference Participation Options\n\nWe encourage wide participation at the workshop. We offer a variety of participation options:\n\n1.  **Participation with an accompanying paper in LNCS:**\n    *   CASC has a long-running relationship with the Springer book series Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) to publish conference proceedings.\n    *   Work submitted here should contain an original research result.\n    *   Submissions should be prepared in the LNCS style and not exceed 20 pages. Survey papers may have up to 25 pages.\n2.  **Participation with abstract only:**\n    *   Participants may opt to submit an extended abstract instead. These should have at least 2 and at most 4 pages in the LNCS style. They must contain the main results of the talk (without proofs).\n    *   They will be lightly reviewed and distributed locally at the conference.\n    *   We see three main audiences for this option:\n        *   Those who wish to talk on previously published work (in which case that work should be clearly cited in the abstract).\n        *   Those whose work is not yet ready for publication, but wish to receive feedback.\n        *   Those who plan to submit a journal paper on the work shortly.\n\n## Accompanying Topical Collection of Mathematics in Computer Science\n\nCASC has formed a relationship with the Springer Birkhäuser journal Mathematics in Computer Science (MCS) for an ongoing series of topical collections on topics presented at CASC workshops. Work submitted here must be of journal quality and will be reviewed to the usual standards of MCS. Submission will be opened after the conference for authors of extended abstracts presented at that year's conference.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** May 18th, 2025\n*   **Notification to Authors:** July 13th, 2025\n*   **Submission of Final Version:** August 10th, 2025\n*   **Conference:** November 24 – 28, 2025"
