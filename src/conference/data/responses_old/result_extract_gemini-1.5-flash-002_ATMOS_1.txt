  "Call for Papers": "# ATMOS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 25th Symposium on Algorithmic Approaches for Transportation Modeling, Optimization, and Systems (ATMOS 2025) will be held in connection with ALGO 2025 in **Warsaw, Poland, on September 18-19, 2025**.\n\n## Scope\n\nSince 2000, ATMOS brings together researchers and practitioners who are interested in all aspects of algorithmic methods and models for transport optimization. The symposium provides a forum for the exchange and dissemination of new ideas and techniques. The aim of making transportation better gives rise to very complex and large-scale optimization problems requiring innovative solution techniques and ideas from algorithms, mathematical optimization, theoretical computer science, and operations research.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe symposium welcomes papers addressing the following topics:\n\n*   Congestion Modelling and Reduction\n*   Crew and Duty Scheduling\n*   Demand Forecasting\n*   Delay Management\n*   Design of Pricing Systems\n*   Electromobility\n*   Infrastructure Planning\n*   Intelligent Transportation Systems\n*   Models for User Behaviour\n*   Line Planning\n*   Mobile Applications for Transport\n*   Mobility-as-a-Service\n*   Multi-modal Transport Optimization\n*   Routing and Platform Assignment\n*   Route Planning in Road and Public Transit Networks\n*   Rostering\n*   Timetable Generation\n*   Tourist Tour Planning\n*   Traffic Guidance\n*   Vehicle Scheduling\n\nThe symposium also welcomes papers applying and advancing the following techniques:\n\n*   Algorithmic Game Theory\n*   Approximation Algorithms\n*   Combinatorial Optimization\n*   Graph and Network Algorithms\n*   Heuristics and Meta-heuristics\n*   Mathematical Programming\n*   Methods for the Integration of Planning Stages\n*   Online and Real-time Algorithms\n*   Simulation Tools\n*   Stochastic and Robust Optimization\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** June 30, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Notification to authors:** August 5, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready submission:** August 24, 2025\n*   **Symposium:** September 18-19, 2025\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nAuthors are invited to submit high-quality manuscripts reporting original unpublished research in the topics related to the symposium. Simultaneous submission to other journals or conferences with published proceedings is not allowed.\n\nBy submitting a paper, the authors acknowledge that in case of acceptance, at least one of the authors must register at ALGO/ATMOS 2025, attend the conference on-site, and present the paper.\n\nSubmissions must be in the form of a single PDF file prepared according to the [author instructions](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/OASIcs#author) and using the [LaTeX OASIcs style file](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/OASIcs#author) and must be submitted electronically via the [EasyChair submission system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atmos2025).\n\n## Submission Types\n\nATMOS 2025 accepts two types of submissions, both of which will be reviewed with the same quality standards by the Program Committee:\n\n*   **Regular paper submissions:** The target length for the main body (excluding the bibliography, the front page(s) (authors, affiliation, keywords, abstract, …)) is 12-15 pages. The total paper may not exceed 20 pages. Regular papers will be allotted up to 20 pages in the proceedings.\n*   **Short paper submissions:** A short paper submission should have at least 4 and at most 6 pages. Short papers will be allotted up to 6 pages in the proceedings.\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Valentina Cacchiani, University of Bologna, Italy\n*   David Coudert, INRIA, France\n*   Twan Dollevoet, Erasmus University Rotterdam, the Netherlands\n*   Mattia D’Emidio, University of L’Aquila, Italy\n*   Lukas Graf, University of Passau, Germany\n*   Loïc Hélouët, INRIA Rennes, France\n*   Richard Lusby, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark\n*   Gabor Maroti, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Germany\n*   Matus Mihalak, University of Maastricht, the Netherlands\n*   Léa Ricard, EPFL, Switzerland\n*   Jonas Sauer (co-chair), University of Bonn, Germany\n*   Philine Schiewe, Aalto University, Finland\n*   Christiane Schmidt, Linköping University, Sweden\n*   Marie Schmidt (co-chair), University of Würzburg, Germany\n*   Sebastian Stiller, Technical University Braunschweig, Germany\n*   Sabine Storandt, University of Freiburg, Germany\n\n## Steering Committee\n\n*   Alberto Marchetti-Spaccamela, Sapienza Università di Roma, Italy\n*   Marie Schmidt, Universität Würzburg, Germany\n*   Anita Schöbel, University of Kaiserslautern-Landau, Germany\n*   Christos Zaroliagis, University of Patras, Greece (Chair)"
