  "Call for Papers": "# RTSS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 46th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS’25) will be held from **December 2–5, 2025, in Boston, MA, USA** at **Boston University’s Center for Computing & Data Sciences**.\n\n## Scope of the Conference\n\nThe IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the field of real-time systems, where researchers and practitioners showcase innovations covering all aspects of real-time systems, including theory, design, analysis, implementation, verification, evaluation, and experience. RTSS’25 continues the tradition of embracing new and emerging areas of real-time systems research.\n\n## Tracks\n\nRTSS’25 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems theory and practice. Manuscripts may be submitted to either the **real-time systems and foundations track (Track 1)** or the **design and applications track (Track 2)**.\n\n### Track 1: Real-Time Systems and Foundations\n\nTrack 1 focuses on the practical and theoretical foundations that enable predictable timing in computing systems.  This includes core real-time operating systems components, schedulability analysis and scheduling algorithms, theoretical foundations of real-time systems, and verification methods.  Topics of interest also cover timing analysis, real-time and time-sensitive networking, and AI for real-time systems.\n\n### Track 2: Design and Applications\n\nTrack 2 focuses on real-time systems in a broader systems context, particularly emphasizing novel research on designs, implementations, and applications where real-time requirements are an integral part of a larger system or objective. Areas of interest include:\n\n*   Cyber-Physical Systems\n*   Real-Time System Design for Artificial Intelligence\n*   HW-SW Integration and System-Level Design\n*   Internet of Things (IoT)\n\n## Surveys and User Studies\n\nEmpirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field is also welcome.\n\n## Proceedings and Awards\n\nAll accepted papers will appear in the main program and proceedings (provided they are presented at the conference). A selection of papers will receive recognition as outstanding papers and will be highlighted as such in the proceedings. Best paper and best student paper awards will be presented at the conference, along with an award for the best presentation.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission Deadline (firm):** May 22, 2025 (anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Author Response Period:** July 14-17, 2025\n*   **Author Notification:** July 25, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready Deadline:** September 16, 2025 (tentative)\n*   **Conference:** December 2–5, 2025\n\n## General Chair\n\nRich West\n\n## Program Chair\n\nBjörn Brandenburg\n\n## Local Organization Chair\n\nRenato Mancuso"
