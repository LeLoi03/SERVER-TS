The conference covers all aspects of securing transactions and systems. Original works focusing on both fundamental and applied real-world deployments on all aspects surrounding commerce security are solicited. Submissions need not be exclusively concerned with cryptography. Systems security and interdisciplinary works are particularly encouraged.\n\n## Submission Categories\n\nContributions are sought in the following categories:\n\n*   Research papers (regular papers, short papers, and systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers)\n*   Workshop proposals\n*   Tutorial proposals\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll submissions are accepted until 23:59, AoE UTC-12.\n\n*   **Paper submission:** October 11, 2024\n*   **Paper notification:** December 6, 2024\n*   **Final pre-proceedings papers:** February 14, 2025\n*   **Workshop and tutorial submission:** September 13, 2024*\n*   **Workshop and tutorial notification:** September 27, 2024\n*   **Conference:** April 14–18, 2025\n\n*Late workshop and tutorial submissions considered on a rolling basis, as space allows.\n\n## Satoshi Grace Period\n\nBased on the last (least significant) hex character of the random number published by Ethereum's Beacon Chain in slot 10100000 (denoted \"RANDAO Reveal\"), a possible extension to the paper deadline was offered:\n\nThe random number in slot 10100000 is `0x8fbc79eb733d3fef8d218a0924bda4a0ff676317790dc58c278a462f7d9c03aed1618be49df1fd77e44f0c8ef260e0ea14c7bda670d0262cc473a6a87b67eb21dcef93e75dd29d98f1c3872432e9de58e2b20f602795baa551c082cea435d52e`, and the FC25 submission deadline is thus **October 11, 2024**.\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nResearch paper submissions must be uploaded through the conference submission website: [https://crypto.unibe.ch/fc25/](https://crypto.unibe.ch/fc25/)\n\nWorkshop and tutorial proposals should be sent by email to [fc25workshops@ifca.ai](mailto:fc25workshops@ifca.ai) and should not be anonymized.\n\n## Paper Format\n\nPapers must be formatted in standard LNCS format and submitted as PDF files. Submissions in other formats will be rejected.\n\n## Anonymous Submission\n\nRegular and short research paper submissions as well as SoKs must be anonymized with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references.\n\n## Original Submissions\n\nAuthors may submit only work that does not substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has been accepted for publication to any other peer-reviewed conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal.\n\n## Ethics and Etiquette\n\nAuthors are required to read and follow this information on ethics and etiquette.\n\n## Conflict of Interest\n\nAuthors must report in the submission site any conflicts with program committee members.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\n*   **Regular Research Papers:** Submissions are limited to 15 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices.\n*   **Short Papers:** Short paper submissions are limited to 8 pages in standard LNCS format, excluding references.
