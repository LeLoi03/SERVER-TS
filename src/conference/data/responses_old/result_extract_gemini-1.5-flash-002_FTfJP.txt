  "Call for Papers": "# FTfJP 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Formal Techniques for Judicious Programming (FTfJP) workshop will be held in **Bergen, Norway on July 3-4, 2025**, alongside ECOOP 2025.\n\nFTfJP aims to bring together people working in formal techniques and programming languages.  The workshop welcomes submissions on technical contributions, case studies, experience reports, challenge proposals, tools, and position papers.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nExample topics of interest include:\n\n*   Language design and semantics\n*   Type systems\n*   Concurrency and new application domains\n*   Specification and verification of program properties\n*   Program analysis (static or dynamic)\n*   Program synthesis\n*   Security\n*   Pearls (programs or proofs)\n\n## Paper Categories\n\nWe solicit two categories of papers:\n\n*   **Full Papers (12 pages, excluding references):** present a technical contribution, case study, or detailed experience report. Ongoing work is particularly welcome.\n*   **Short Papers (6 pages, excluding references):** should advocate a promising research direction, or otherwise present a position likely to stimulate discussion at the workshop.\n\nBoth types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the workshop. Submissions will be peer-reviewed and evaluated based on their clarity and their potential to generate interesting discussions. Reviewing will be single-blind.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nPapers must be formatted according to the guidelines for Springer LNCS papers: [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).\n\nSubmissions should be made via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ftfjp2025](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ftfjp2025). There is no need to indicate the paper category (long/short).\n\nWe plan that accepted papers will be published as post-proceedings in JOT (Journal of Object Technology), though authors will be able to opt out of this publication, if desired. At least one author of an accepted paper must register to the workshop by the early registration date and attend the workshop to present the work and participate in the discussions.\n\n## Important Dates (AoE, UTC-12h)\n\n*   **Submission Deadline:** April 15, 2025\n*   **Notification:** May 21, 2025\n*   **Workshop Date:** July 3, 2025\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Crystal Chang Din (PC Chair, University of Bergen, Norway)\n*   Richard Bubel (PC Member, Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany)\n*   Syed Ali Asadullah Bukhari (PC Member, Maynooth University, Ireland)\n*   Claire Dross (PC Member, AdaCore, France)\n*   Erik Ernst (PC Member, Google Inc., Denmark)\n*   Marie Farrell (PC Member, The University of Manchester, United Kingdom)\n*   Carlo A. Furia (PC Member, Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), Switzerland)\n*   Atsushi Igarashi (PC Member, Kyoto University, Japan)\n*   Marie-Christine Jakobs (PC Member, LMU Munich, Germany)\n*   Taylor T Johnson (PC Member, Vanderbilt University, United States)\n*   Matthew Lutze (PC Member, Aarhus University)\n*   Wojciech Mostowski (PC Member, Halmstad University)\n*   Wytse Oortwijn (PC Member, TNO-ESI, Netherlands)\n*   Violet Ka I Pun (PC Member, Western Norway University of Applied Sciences, Norway)\n*   Anton Wijs (PC Member, Eindhoven University of Technology, Netherlands)\n*   Elena Zucca (PC Member, University of Genoa, Italy)\n\n## Steering Committee\n\n*   Rosemary Monahan (Steering Committee Chair, National University of Ireland, Ireland)\n*   Werner Dietl (Steering Committee Member, University of Waterloo, Canada)\n*   Radu Grigore (Steering Committee Member, Facebook, United Kingdom)\n*   Gary T.
