  "Call for Papers": "# ALGOWIN 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe International Symposium on Algorithmics of Wireless Networks (ALGOWIN 2025), previously known as ALGOSENSORS, will be held at the **Faculty of Physics, University of Warsaw, Poland, from September 18-19, 2025** as part of ALGO 2025.\n\nALGOWIN is an international forum dedicated to the algorithmic aspects of wireless networks. It covers algorithmic issues arising in wireless networks of all types of computational entities, static or mobile, including sensor networks, sensor-actuator networks, autonomous robots, and drones. The focus is on the design and analysis of algorithms, models of computation, graph and network algorithms, and experimental analysis.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Ad Hoc Networks\n*   Autonomous Mobile Robots\n*   Communication Protocols\n*   Complexity and Computability\n*   Computational Models\n*   Data Aggregation and Fusion\n*   Distributed Aspects of Group Search\n*   Dynamic Networks\n*   Temporal Graphs\n*   Energy Management, Power Saving Schemes\n*   Fault Tolerance and Dependability\n*   Game Theoretic Aspects\n*   Infrastructure Discovery\n*   Internet of Things\n*   Localization\n*   Medium Access Control\n*   Mobility and Dynamics\n*   Obstacle Avoidance\n*   Pattern Formation\n*   Performance Evaluation, Experimental Analysis\n*   Population Protocols, Swarm Computing\n*   Resource Efficiency\n*   RFID Algorithms\n*   Routing and Data Propagation\n*   Self-stabilization, Self-* Properties\n*   Sensor Networks\n*   Systems and Testbeds\n*   Time Synchronization\n*   Topology Control\n*   Tracking\n*   Unmanned Autonomous Entities\n*   Virtual Infrastructures\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission deadline:** June 6, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Notification:** August 1, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready due:** August 29, 2025\n*   **Conference:** September 18-19, 2025\n\n## Invited Speaker\n\nThomas Erlebach, University of Durham, UK\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nPapers are to be submitted electronically using the EasyChair server: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=algowin2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=algowin2025).\n\nSubmissions must be in the form of a single PDF file prepared using the LNCS LaTeX templates and style files (available, together with Springer’s authors’ guidelines, from [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)).\n\nEach submission should consist of the main part of the paper, not exceeding 12 pages (including the title page and excluding the references), plus an optional clearly marked appendix (to be read at the discretion of the program committee). Any figure pertaining to the main part of the paper should be included therein (within the 12-page limit). The first page must include an indication of whether the paper is eligible for the best student paper award.\n\n## Proceedings\n\nThe conference proceedings will be published in the Springer “Lecture Notes in Computer Science” series after the conference (expected October 2025).\n\n## Special Issue\n\nSelected papers will be invited to a special issue of the Theoretical Computer Science journal.\n\n## Awards\n\nAwards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper. The awards are kindly sponsored by Springer."
