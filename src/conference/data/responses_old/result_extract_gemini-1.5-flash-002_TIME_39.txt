  "Call for Papers": "# TIME 2024: Call for Papers\n\nThe 31st International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning (TIME 2024) was held from **October 28-30, 2024 in Montpellier, France.**\n\nTIME has been for more than twenty years the only yearly multidisciplinary international event dedicated to the topic of time in computer science. The purpose of the symposium is to bring together active researchers in different research areas involving temporal representation and reasoning. The symposium also welcomes research papers on the related topics of spatial and spatio-temporal representation and reasoning.\n\n## Topics\n\nIn this symposium, in addition to theoretical and practical work in Artificial Intelligence, Databases, and Logic and Reasoning, submissions focusing on the development, deployment, and evaluation of Machine Learning Systems that fall under the scope of the symposium are invited. Such systems papers will be evaluated primarily on the quality of the empirical evaluation and reusability. Topics for TIME 2024 include (but are not limited to):\n\n*   Spatial and temporal reasoning\n*   Time in natural language processing\n*   Reasoning about action and change\n*   Complex event recognition and forecasting\n*   Planning and planning languages\n*   Ontologies of time and space-time\n*   Belief and uncertainty in temporal knowledge\n*   Temporal learning and discovery\n*   Temporal data models and query languages\n*   Temporal query processing and indexing\n*   Temporal data mining\n*   Stream data management\n*   Spatio-temporal data management, including moving objects\n*   Data currency and expiration\n*   Indeterminate and imprecise temporal data\n*   Temporal constraints\n*   Specification and verification of systems\n*   Verification of software and web applications\n*   Synthesis and execution\n*   Model checking algorithms and implementations\n*   Temporal logics for infinite-state systems\n*   Runtime verification of temporal properties\n*   Temporal aspects of agent- and policy-based systems\n*   Temporal networks\n*   Temporal argumentation frameworks\n*   Automata-theoretic techniques for temporal reasoning\n*   Temporal knowledge graphs\n*   Time-series data management\n*   Events and time series explanations in healthcare\n\n## Submission\n\nThe submission link was available at [cmt3.research.microsoft.com/TIME2024/](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/TIME2024/).\n\n## Guidelines\n\nTIME 2024 accepted submissions in PDF format, no longer than 12 pages excluding references and appendix. The appendix was limited to 5 pages, and the reviewers may or may not take it into account for their recommendation. Submissions must be formatted following the [LIPIcs instructions](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author) and preferably redacted in LaTeX.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   Symposium paper submission deadline: July 5, 2024\n*   Paper acceptance/rejection notification date: August 14, 2024\n*   Camera-ready submission deadline: August 28, 2024\n*   Registration deadline: October 18, 2024\n*   Symposium Date: October 28–30, 2024\n\n**Note:** All deadlines are AoE (Anywhere on Earth)."
