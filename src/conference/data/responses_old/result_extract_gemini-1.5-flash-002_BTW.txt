  "Summary": "The BTW 2025 conference, the 21st Conference on Database Systems for Business, Technology and Web, will be held in Bamberg, Germany, from March 3-7, 2025.  It's the most important database conference in the German-speaking area, serving as a forum for scientists, practitioners, and users to discuss topics in database and information systems technology.",
  "Call for Papers": "# BTW 2025: Call for Research Papers\n\nThe BTW conference is the most important database conference in the German-speaking area.  For more than three decades, it has served to network scientists from the data management community in Germany and its neighboring countries, as well as practitioners from industry.\n\n## Tracks and Topics\n\nContributions will be organized in five tracks. Authors can assign their papers to more than one track.\n\n*   **Database Technologies and Systems:** Query processing and optimization, storage and physical database design, indexing, access methods, data management on modern hardware, transaction processing and concurrency control, data warehousing and analytics, implementation and architecture of database systems, parallel, distributed, and cloud-based data processing, NoSQL systems, performance analysis and benchmarking.\n*   **Text, Semi-structured Data and IR:** User aspects of retrieval applications, system and foundational aspects, retrieval models, query processing and ranking, efficiency and scalability, machine learning, deep learning and neural models, text mining and text analysis, natural language processing, applications such as web and social media search, professional and domain-specific search, evaluation research of retrieval systems, users, and/or applications.\n*   **Data Engineering, Data Science & Machine Learning:** Green-IT, sustainability, data ethics, and FAIR data management, data analytics, mining, intelligent systems and machine learning, data transformation, integration, linkage and interoperability, data preparation, cleaning, profiling, and visualization, data provenance, versioning, and reasoning, data streaming and dataflow engines, batch- and ETL-processing systems, schema engineering, evolution, and optimization, metadata management and recording, data processing on modern hardware, distributed systems, and cloud, semantic data and knowledge bases, benchmarks for data engineering algorithms and workflows.\n*   **Database Languages & Theory:** All topics of the other tracks are in principle suitable, but this track is primarily interested in work focusing on foundational aspects concerning the principles and theory of data management.\n*   **Innovations and Use Cases:** This track emphasizes papers that bridge the gap between foundational database research and the innovative deployment of these technologies.  Topics include implementation and architectural advancements of database systems, particularly for distributed and big data solutions; integration and performance optimization of database technologies in the cloud; application of Data Engineering, AI, machine learning methods, and language models within database systems to drive innovation and operational efficiency; exploration of data protection, security measures, and ethical considerations within industrial data systems.\n\n## Submission Process\n\n*   The review process will include a feedback phase, allowing authors to submit a revision letter.\n*   The scientific program and the industrial program will be merged at the conference.\n*   Authors will be asked to choose one or more tracks that best fit their paper.\n*   The organization team encourages authors to ensure the repeatability and reproducibility of their experiments and analyses.\n*   Both long papers (original papers or review papers) and short papers (on current projects and ongoing research) can be submitted.\n*   Submissions should be written in English.\n*   Contributions must correspond to the layout specifications of the conference proceedings (LNI style, see [https://gi.de/service/publikationen/lni](https://gi.de/service/publikationen/lni)).\n    *   Page limit (not including references): 20 pages for long papers and 10 pages for short papers.\n*   Submissions exceeding the page limit will be rejected without review.\n*   The accepted papers will be published in the Lecture Notes in Informatics (LNI) of the GI.\n\n## Review Criteria\n\n*   Short papers: thematic fit to the conference, degree of innovation, convincing presentation.\n*   Long articles: as above, as well as a careful evaluation and/or proof.\n*   Practical contributions: thematic fit to the conference, degree of innovation, convincing presentation, degree of use/impact.\n\n## Submission\n\nSubmissions via [https://www.conftool.com/btw2025/](https://www.conftool.com/btw2025/) from July 2024 onwards. All research track papers are subject to single-anonymity requirement.\n\n## Deadlines\n\n*   **Submission deadline for abstracts:** September 13, 2024\n*   **Papers are due:** October 2, 2024 (11:59 pm, GMT+1)"
