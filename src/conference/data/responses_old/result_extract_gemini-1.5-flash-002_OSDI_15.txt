  "Call for Papers": "# OSDI '25: Call for Papers\n\nThe 19th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI '25) will be co-located with the 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (USENIX ATC '25) and take place on **July 7–9, 2025, in Boston, MA, USA**.\n\n## Overview\n\nOSDI seeks to present innovative, exciting research in computer systems. OSDI brings together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in a premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implications of systems software. OSDI emphasizes innovative research and quantified or insightful experiences in systems design and implementation.\n\nOSDI takes a broad view of the systems area and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data, embedded systems, virtualization, networking as it relates to operating systems, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interface to related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, and databases. We encourage contributions with highly original ideas, new approaches, and groundbreaking results.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract registrations due:** December 3, 2024, 5:59 pm EST (10:59 pm UTC)\n*   **Complete paper submissions due:** December 10, 2024, 5:59 pm EST (10:59 pm UTC)\n*   **Reviews available:** March 6, 2025\n*   **Author responses due:** March 10, 2025\n*   **Notification to authors:** March 25, 2025\n*   **Final papers due:** June 5, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process by a member of the program committee.\n\n*   Submitted papers must be no longer than 12 single-spaced 8.5\" x 11\" pages, including figures and tables, plus as many pages as needed for references.\n*   Accepted papers will be allowed 14 pages in the proceedings, plus references.\n*   Papers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review, and no deadline extensions will be granted for reformatting.\n*   The paper review process is double-blind. Authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions.\n*   Registering abstracts a week before paper submission is an essential part of the paper-reviewing process.\n*   Papers must be in PDF format and must be submitted via the submission system: [https://osdi25.usenix.hotcrp.com/](https://osdi25.usenix.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\nAuthors may upload supplementary material in files separate from their submissions. PC members are not required to read supplementary material when reviewing the paper, so each paper should stand alone without it.\n\n## Conflicts\n\nWhen registering your abstract, you must provide information about conflicts with PC members. A PC member is a conflict if and only if one or more of the following circumstances applies:\n\n*   **Institution:** You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years (not counting concluded internships), or are going to begin employment at the same institution during the review period.\n*   **Advisor:** You have a past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee.\n*   **Collaboration:** You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, program co-chairship, or editorship within the past two years (December 2022 through December 2024).\n*   **Personal:** You are close family relatives (spouses, domestic partners, parents, or children).\n\n## Author Response Period\n\nOSDI will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting.\n\n## Revise and Resubmit\n\nOSDI '25 will continue the option to revise and resubmit for some of the rejected papers.\n\n## Program Co-Chairs\n\n*   Lidong Zhou, Microsoft\n*   Yuanyuan Zhou, University of California, San Diego"
