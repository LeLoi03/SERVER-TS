  "Call for Papers": "# COORDINATION 2025: Call for Papers\n\nCOORDINATION 2025 is the 27th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages, one of three conferences of DisCoTec 2025.  The conference will be held from **June 16-20, 2025**.\n\n## Scope\n\nModern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable, and heterogeneous components. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, providing abstractions that cleanly separate behavior from communication, increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and enhancing software development. This conference provides a forum for the growing community of researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.\n\n## Main Topics\n\nTopics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) coordination-related aspects of:\n\n*   Theoretical models and foundations for coordination\n*   Coordination of multi-agent and collective systems\n*   Coordination and modern distributed computing\n*   Session-based programming\n*   Models, languages, verification techniques, and tools for interacting smart contracts and (blockchain-based) decentralized applications\n*   Languages, methodologies, and tools for secure coordination\n*   Cybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to cybersecurity\n*   Nature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination\n*   Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures\n*   Dynamic software architectures\n*   Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application domains\n*   Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments\n*   Coordination in business process management\n*   Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures\n*   Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination\n\n## Submission Categories\n\n*   **Regular papers:** (12-18 pages, not counting references and appendices) describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Companion artifacts to regular submissions will be reviewed by the Artefact Evaluation Committee, but the acceptance of the paper is decoupled from the acceptance of the artefact (does not depend on it). The acceptance of the artefact, however, is conditional to the acceptance of the paper.\n*   **Survey papers:** (16-25 pages, not counting references and appendices) describing important results and success stories related to the topics of COORDINATION.\n*   **Tool papers:** (4-15 pages, not counting references and appendices) describing technological artifacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. The tool artifact must be submitted separately for evaluation. Acceptance of the tool artifact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted.\n\n## Artefact Submission\n\nWe invite you to also submit an associated artefact for evaluation (AE). Instructions on how to upload artifacts can be found [here](/2025/COORDINATION_Artefact_Evaluation_Guidelines.pdf).\n\n## Submission Link\n\nSubmissions are via EasyChair at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2025).\n\n## Publication\n\nThe COORDINATION proceedings will be published by Springer as an LNCS-IFIP volume and will comprise accepted submissions from all categories.\n\n## Important Dates (Extended)\n\n*   **Abstract submission:** February 14, 2025\n*   **Paper submission:** February 21, 2025\n*   **Artefact submission:** February 28, 2025\n*   **Artefact kick-the-tires - problem reports:** March 10, 2025\n*   **Artefact kick-the-tires - author response:** March 17, 2025\n*   **Artefact notification:** April 4, 2025\n*   **Paper notification:** April 4, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready:** April 23, 2025 (TBC)\n*   **Conference:** June 16-20, 2025\n\nDeadlines expire at 23:59 anywhere on earth on the dates displayed above."
