  "Call for Papers": "# FormaliSE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 13th edition of the FormaliSE conference will take place as a co-located conference of ICSE 2025 from **April 27-28, 2025, in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada**.\n\n## About FormaliSE\n\nHistorically, formal methods academic research and practical software development have had limited mutual interactions — except possibly in specialized domains such as safety-critical software. In recent times, the outlook has considerably improved: on the one hand, formal methods research has delivered more flexible techniques and tools that can support various aspects of the software development process — from user requirements elicitation, to design, implementation, verification and validation, as well as the creation of documentation. On the other hand, software engineering has developed a growing interest in rigorous techniques applied at scale.\n\nThe FormaliSE conference series promotes work at the intersection of the formal methods and software engineering communities, providing a venue to exchange ideas, experiences, techniques, and results. We believe more collaboration between these two communities can be mutually beneficial by fostering the creation of formal methods that are practically useful and by helping develop higher-quality software.\n\n## Areas of Interest\n\n*   requirements formalization and formal specification\n*   approaches, methods and tools for verification and validation\n*   formal approaches to safety and security related issues\n*   analysis of performance and other non-functional properties based on formal approaches\n*   scalability of formal method applications\n*   integration of formal methods within the software development lifecycle (e.g., change-management, continuous integration, regression testing, and deployment)\n*   model-based engineering approaches\n*   correctness-by-construction approaches for software and systems engineering\n*   application of formal methods to specific domains, e.g., autonomous, cyber-physical, intelligent, and IoT systems\n*   formal methods for AI-based systems (FM4AI), and AI applied in formal method approaches (AI4FM)\n*   formal methods in a certification context\n*   case studies developed/analyzed with formal approaches\n*   experience reports on the application of formal methods to real-world problems\n*   guidelines to use formal methods in practice\n*   usability of formal methods\n\n## Paper Categories\n\nWe accept papers in three categories:\n\n*   **Full research papers:** describing original research work and results. We encourage authors to include validation of their contributions by means of a case study or experiments. We also welcome research papers focusing on tools and tool development.\n*   **Case study papers:** discussing a significant application that suggests general lessons learned and motivates further research, or empirically validates theoretical results (such as a technique’s scalability).\n*   **Research ideas papers:** describing new ideas in preliminary form, in a way that can stimulate interesting discussions at the conference, and suggest future work.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAll papers submitted to the FormaliSE 2025 conference must be written in English, must be unpublished original work, and must not be under review or submitted elsewhere at the time of submission. Submissions must comply with the FormaliSE’s lightweight double-anonymous review process (see below).\n\n*   Full research papers and case study papers can take up to 10 pages including all text, figures, tables and appendices, but excluding references.\n*   Research ideas papers can take up to 4 pages, plus up to 1 additional page solely for references.\n*   All submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template.\n\n## Review Process\n\nEach paper will be reviewed by at least three program committee members that will judge its overall quality in terms of its soundness, significance, novelty, verifiability, and presentation clarity.\n\n## Publication\n\nAll accepted papers are published as part of the ICSE 2025 Proceedings in the ACM and IEEE Digital Libraries. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference and present the paper at the conference — physically or, if the circumstances do not allow so, virtually. Failure to register an author will result in a paper being removed from the proceedings.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract submissions:** November 18, 2024\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** November 25, 2024\n*   **Notifications:** January 13, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready papers due:** February 5, 2025\n*   **Early registration deadline:** February 18, 2025\n\n## Keynotes\n\n*   **Assuring AI in Autonomous Driving: Challenges and Emerging Approaches**\n    *   Krzysztof Czarnecki, University of Waterloo, Canada\n*   **Adversarial Perturbations and Self-Defenses for Large Language Models on Coding Tasks**\n    *   Corina S. Pasareanu, Carnegie Mellon University Silicon Valley, NASA Ames Research Center\n\n## Venue\n\n*   Rogers Centre, Ottawa (formerly Shaw Centre)\n*   Offsite Special Venue\n*   Reception venue: National Arts Centre"
