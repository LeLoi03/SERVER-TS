  "Call for Papers": "# PSB 2026: Call for Papers, Abstracts, and Demonstrations\n\nThe thirtieth Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing (PSB 2026) will be held from **January 3-7, 2026, at the Fairmont Orchid on the Big Island of Hawaii**.\n\nPSB will bring together top researchers from around the world to exchange research results and address open issues in all aspects of computational biology.\n\n## Sessions\n\nTo provide focus for the very broad area of biological computing, PSB is organized into a series of specific sessions. Each session will involve both formal research presentations and open discussion groups:\n\n*   **AI and Machine Learning in Clinical Medicine:** Bridging or Separating Model Intelligence and Human Expertise\n*   **Biological molecular function:** methods and benchmarks for finding function in biological dark matter\n*   **Fairness and Bias in Biomedical AI/ML:** Defining Goals and Putting Them Into Practice\n*   **Precision Medicine:** Integrating large-scale data and intermediate phenotypes for understanding health and treating disease\n*   **Systems Biology and Network Analysis:** From Multi-omics Integration to Biological Mechanisms\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nPapers must be submitted to the [PSB 2026 paper management system](http://psb.wufoo.com/forms/psb-paper-submission/).\n\n*   The accepted file format is PDF (Adobe Acrobat preferred).\n*   Files should be named with the last name of the first author (e.g., altman.pdf).\n*   Hardcopy submissions or unprocessed TEX or LATEX files or electronic submissions not submitted through the paper management system will be rejected without review.\n*   Each paper must be accompanied by a cover letter.\n*   Submitted papers are limited to twelve (12) pages (NOT including the cover letter, title page with author list, or references) in our publication format.\n*   Color images are accepted for publication at no additional charge.\n*   Supplemental material may be referenced by URL (PSB will not host supplemental material).\n\n## Publication\n\nAll accepted papers will be published electronically and indexed in PubMed. Authors are responsible for ensuring that the manuscript is deposited into the NIHMS upon acceptance for publication. Per WSP, authors may post their submitted manuscript (preprint) at any time on their personal website, in their company or institutional repository, in not-for-profit subject-based preprint servers or repositories, and on scholarly collaboration networks (SCNs) which have signed up to the STM sharing principles.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submissions due:** August 1, 2025, 11:59 PM PT\n*   **Notification of paper acceptance:** September 8, 2025\n*   **Final paper deadline:** October 1, 2025, 11:59 PM PT\n*   **Abstract deadline:** December 1, 2025, 11:59 PM PT\n*   **Meeting:** January 3-7, 2026\n\n## Travel Support\n\nPartial travel support may be offered to many PSB attendees, but no one is guaranteed travel support. The online travel support application form will open in August, with a deadline of October 15, 2025, at 11:59 PM PT.\n\n## Contact\n\nContact PSB ([psb.hawaii@gmail.com](mailto:psb.hawaii@gmail.com)) for additional information about paper submission requirements."
