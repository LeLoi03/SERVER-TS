  "Call for Papers": "# EUSFLAT 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 14th Conference of the European Society for Fuzzy Logic and Technology (EUSFLAT 2025) will take place in **Riga, Latvia from July 21-25, 2025.**\n\nThere are two types of publications related to the EUSFLAT 2025 Conference:\n\n1.  **Full papers** in the conference proceedings (published in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer)\n2.  **Abstracts** in the joint Book of Abstracts (published by the University of Latvia)\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Special sessions proposals deadline:** November 10, 2024\n*   **Full paper submission deadline:** February 28, 2025\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** March 31, 2025\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** April 30, 2025\n\n## Abstract Submission\n\nSubmitted abstracts are supposed to be of at most 1-page length. There is neither LaTeX nor MS Word format template as just plain text is expected. The abstract must be submitted through the EasyChair system: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eusflat2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eusflat2025).  Do not enclose any attachment; edit the abstract directly in the online window of the EasyChair system. In the system, you can choose one of the proposed special sessions or the general track of EUSFLAT 2025.\n\n## Full Paper Submission\n\nAuthors should consult [Springer’s authors’ instructions](Springer_Instructions_for_Authors_of_Proceedings_CS.pdf) and use the proceedings template, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. The LaTeX templates are also available in Overleaf. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers.\n\nThe length of a submission is at most 12 pages in the LNCS/CCIS one-column page format. The paper must be written in English and submitted in PDF via the EasyChair system ([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eusflat2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eusflat2025)) by the given deadline. In the system, you can choose one of the proposed special sessions or the general track of EUSFLAT 2025.\n\nOne full registration will allow acceptance of one paper. Each additional accepted paper associated with the same registration will be subject to an additional fee. Please check the box \"Student Paper\" during submission of the paper if you want to apply for the Best Student Paper Award.\n\n## Special Sessions\n\n*   SS01 - Interval Uncertainty\n*   SS02 - Representing and Managing Uncertainty: different scenarios, different tools\n*   SS03 - Mathematical Fuzzy Logic\n*   SS04 - Soft Methods in Statistical Inference and Data Analysis\n*   SS05 - Fuzzy Implication Functions\n*   SS06 - Information fusion techniques based on aggregation functions, preaggregation functions and their generalizations\n*   SS07 - Fuzzy metric spaces and their generalizations: theory and applications\n*   SS08 - New contexts in aggregation theory\n*   SS09 - Modeling Complex Dynamics: Adapting Analytical Tools for Diverse Scenarios\n*   SS10 - Soft computing, uncertainty and imprecision in image processing\n*   SS11 - Fuzzy Relations and Applications\n*   SS12 - The Role and Value of Information in Decision Making\n*   SS13 - Generalized quantifiers, logical syllogisms and applications\n*   SS14 - Advancements and Applications of Fuzzy Theory and Fuzzy Control\n\n## General Chairs\n\n*   Martin Štěpnička, University of Ostrava\n*   Susana Montes, University of Oviedo, Spain\n*   Svetlana Asmuss, University of Latvia\n\n## Plenary Speakers\n\n*   Bernard De Baets, Ghent University, Belgium\n*   Humberto Bustince, Universidad Publica de Navarra, Spain\n*   Oscar Cordón, University of Granada, Spain\n*   Katarzyna Kaczmarek-Majer, Systems Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences Warsaw, Poland\n*   Ulrich Bodenhofer, University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Hagenberg, Austria\n*   Andris Ambainis, University of Latvia, Riga, Latvia"
