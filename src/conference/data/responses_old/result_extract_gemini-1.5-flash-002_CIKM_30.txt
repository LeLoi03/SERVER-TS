  "Call for Papers": "# CIKM 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2025) will take place from **November 10-14, 2025, in Coex, Seoul, Korea**.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe encourage submissions of high-quality research papers on the general areas of artificial intelligence, data science, databases, information retrieval, and knowledge management. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   Data acquisition and processing (e.g., IoT Data, Data Quality, Data Privacy, Mitigating Biases, Data Wrangling, Data exploration, Data Preparation, Valuation, and Trading)\n*   Data Integration and aggregation (e.g., Semantic Processing, data provenance, data linkage, data fusion, knowledge graph, data warehousing, data lake, privacy and security, modeling, information credibility)\n*   Efficient data processing (e.g., serverless, data-intensive computing, database systems, indexing and compression, architectures, distributed data systems, dataspaces, customized hardware)\n*   Special data processing (e.g., multilingual text, sequential, stream, time series, spatio-temporal, (knowledge) graph, multimedia, scientific, and social media data)\n*   Analytics and machine learning (e.g., OLAP, data mining, machine learning and AI, scalable analysis algorithms, algorithmic biases, event detection and tracking, algorithmic interpretability)\n*   Neural Information and knowledge processing (e.g., graph neural networks, domain adaptation, transfer learning, network architectures, neural ranking, neural recommendation, and neural prediction)\n*   Information access and retrieval (e.g., Information Retrieval with Large Language Models, Question Answering and Dialogue Systems, Open-ended Question Answering Systems, Generation of Knowledge Graphs from Unstructured data, Retrieval Models, Query Processing, Personalization, Recommender Systems, Filtering Systems)\n*   Users and interfaces for information systems (e.g., user behavior analysis, user interface design, perception of biases, interactive information retrieval, interactive analysis, spoken interfaces)\n*   Evaluation (e.g., performance studies, benchmarks, online and offline evaluation, best practices)\n*   Crowdsourcing (e.g., task assignment, worker reliability, optimization, trustworthiness, transparency, crowdsourcing in the era of large language models)\n*   Mining multi-modal content (e.g., natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, content understanding, knowledge extraction, knowledge representations)\n*   Data presentation (e.g., visualization, summarization, readability, VR, speech input/output)\n*   Fairness, Ethics, and Explainability in Information and Knowledge Management (e.g., fairness, accountability, ethics, explainability)\n*   Applications (e.g., urban systems, biomedical and health informatics, legal informatics, crisis informatics, computational social science, data-enabled discovery, social networks, education, business)\n*   Generative AI for Data and Knowledge Management (e.g., GenAI for structured and unstructured data processing, GenAI for data synthesis and simulation, GenAI for information summarization, content creation, and visualization)\n*   Resource Efficient Generative AI models for knowledge management (e.g., model compression, distributed learning, and leveraging edge computing to reduce computational overhead.)\n\n## Paper Submissions\n\nAuthors are invited to submit original, full-length research papers that are not previously published, accepted to be published, or being considered for publication in any other forum.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nManuscripts should be submitted to the CIKM 2025 Easychair site in PDF format, using the 2-column ACM sigconf template ([https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)). Full papers cannot exceed 9 pages, including an appendix, plus unlimited references (paper content is limited to 9 pages).\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are at 11:59 pm in the Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone.\n\n*   **Full Papers Abstract Deadline:** May 16, 2025\n*   **Full Papers Final Deadline:** May 23, 2025\n*   **Papers Notifications:** August 4, 2025\n*   **Camera Ready Deadline:** August 27, 2025\n\n### Workshops & Tutorials\n\n*   **Tutorials Proposal Submission:** June 14, 2025\n*   **Workshops Proposal Submission:** June 28, 2025\n*   **Tutorials Proposal Notification:** July 8, 2025\n*   **Workshops Proposal Notification:** July 19, 2025\n\n## PC Chairs Contact Information\n\nFor more information, contact the PC chairs at [cikm2025-pc@easychair.org](mailto:cikm2025-pc@easychair.org)\n\n*   Carl Yang, Emory University, USA\n*   Senjuti Basu Roy, New Jersey Institute of Technology, USA\n*   Jessie Li, Yunqi Academy of Engineering, China\n*   Jaap Kamps, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands"
