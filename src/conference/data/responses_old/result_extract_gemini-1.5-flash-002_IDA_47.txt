  "Summary": "The Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2025) will take place in Konstanz, Germany, from May 7-9, 2025. IDA’s mission is to promote ideas over performance: a solid motivation can be as convincing as an exhaustive empirical evaluation. The IDA symposium is intentionally small-scale and single-track to create an open atmosphere that encourages discussion.",
  "Call for Papers": "# IDA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Symposium on Intelligent Data Analysis (IDA 2025) will take place from **May 7-9, 2025, in Konstanz, Germany**.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nContributions written in English must be formatted according to the guidelines of the Lecture Notes of Computer Science (LNCS) series by Springer-Verlag. These guidelines, along with templates, are available here: [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).\n\n*   We strongly recommend using the LNCS template for LaTeX.\n*   The page limit for any contribution, including figures, title pages, references, and appendices, is 10 to 12 pages in LNCS format.\n*   Submission of the camera-ready version of the paper has to include the authors’ consent to publish on the above Springer LNCS website. Please use the consent form we provide [here](http://ida2025.blogs.dsv.su.se/files/2025/02/IDA2025-license-to-publish-agreement.docx), which contains necessary information.\n*   Authors may not submit any paper that is under review elsewhere or that has been accepted for publication in a journal or another conference; neither will they submit their papers elsewhere during the review period of IDA 2025.\n*   The authors, their contact information, or affiliations may not be changed after the paper submission deadline.\n*   If the paper is accepted, at least one of the authors must register for the conference and present the paper in person in Konstanz.\n\n## Submission\n\nPapers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. The submission interface is available here: [Microsoft CMT – Regular Track Submission](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/IDA2025)\n\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** November 22, 2024\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** November 29, 2024\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** February 3, 2025 (UPDATED)\n*   **Camera-ready and registration:** February 28, 2025\n\nYou have to submit your abstract and title by November 22 and the corresponding full papers by November 29. All dates are specified as 23:59 SST (Standard Samoa Time / Anywhere on Earth).\n\n## Review Process\n\nSubmissions will undergo a single-blind review process; author identities are known to reviewers. The reviewing process will address this issue explicitly: referees will evaluate papers based on novelty, technical quality, potential impact, and clarity. Furthermore, each submission will be reviewed by one of the senior program committee (SPC) members. Any paper for which an SPC makes a convincing argument about how it addresses the symposium’s goals will be accepted independent of the overall review score.\n\n## Call for PhD Forum Papers\n\nYou will find the Call for PhD forum [here](https://ida2025.org/phd-forum/).\n\n## Contact\n\n[https://twitter.com/@ida_symposia](https://twitter.com/@ida_symposia)\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/IDAsymposia/](https://www.facebook.com/IDAsymposia/)"
