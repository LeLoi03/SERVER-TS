  "Call for Papers": "# FPL 2025: Call for Papers â€” Regular Track\n\nThe 35th International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL 2025) will be held from **September 1-5, 2025 in Leiden, The Netherlands.**\n\n## Conference Overview\n\nThe International Conference on Field-Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL) was the first and remains the largest conference dedicated to the rapidly growing field-programmable logic and reconfigurable computing area. Over the past 34 years, many key advances in reconfigurable system architectures, applications, embedded processors, design automation methods, and tools have been first published in the FPL conference proceedings. The conference brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry worldwide.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe welcome contributions on (but not limited to) the following topics related to FPL:\n\n*   Architectures and Technology\n*   Design Methods and Tools\n*   Application Acceleration\n*   Safety-Critical Applications\n*   Programming Models and Languages\n*   High-Performance Computing\n*   System Software and Environment Support\n*   Security of Reconfigurable Systems\n\n## Submission Information\n\nWe encourage two types of submissions:\n\n*   **Long papers:** limited to eight pages plus two pages of references (i.e., the references do not count in the eight pages, and references must not exceed two pages).\n*   **Short papers:** limited to four pages plus one page of references (i.e., the references do not count in the four pages, and references must not exceed one page). Please use the subtitle \"Short Paper\" in the submission.\n*   **Survey papers:** prepared as long papers (limited to eight pages plus two pages of references), with the subtitle \"Survey paper\".\n\nPage limits are strict, and papers exceeding this limit will be rejected automatically. For both types of submissions, the abstract is limited to 300 words. After the abstract submission deadline, the author list and order entered in the system cannot be changed anymore.\n\nAll contributions must be submitted electronically in PDF format and follow the IEEE double-column format. Templates are available directly from IEEE ([https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)).\n\nThe submission link is [https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fpl2025](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fpl2025).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Extended Abstract submission:** March 14 - 21, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Extended Full Paper submission:** March 21 - 30, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** May 27, 2025 (AoE)\n\n## Review Process\n\nFPL 2025 uses a double-blind reviewing system. Manuscripts must not identify authors or their affiliations; those that do will not be considered. References to the authors' prior work should be made in the third person in the same way one would reference work by others, with adequate anonymization to preserve double-blind reviewing. Authors can utilize tools like Anonymous GitHub to anonymize repositories if needed.\n\nAuthors guarantee that submitted papers are original and unpublished. Submissions cannot be under review or accepted elsewhere nor substantially similar to papers being considered for other conferences, journals, or workshops unless previously presented at venues without archived proceedings.\n\nAll potential conflicts of interest must be disclosed during submission, including all authors and program committee members. Conflicts include, but are not limited to, instances within the last five years where you co-authored a publication, shared funding, or had an overlapping institutional affiliation. Failure to disclose conflicts or falsely declaring conflicts to manipulate the review process may result in rejecting the submission."
