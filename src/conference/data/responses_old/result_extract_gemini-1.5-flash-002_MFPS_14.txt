  "Call for Papers": "# MFPS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 41st Conference on the Mathematical Foundations of Programming Semantics (MFPS 2025) will take place at the **University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, Scotland, from June 18-20, 2025**, jointly with CALCO.\n\nMFPS conferences are dedicated to the areas of mathematics, logic, and computer science that are related to models of computation in general, and to semantics of programming languages in particular. This is a forum where researchers in mathematics and computer science can meet and exchange ideas. The participation of researchers in neighboring areas is strongly encouraged.\n\n## Topics\n\nTopics include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n*   bio-computation\n*   concurrent qualitative and quantitative distributed systems\n*   process calculi\n*   probabilistic systems\n*   constructive mathematics\n*   domain theory and categorical models\n*   formal languages\n*   formal methods\n*   game semantics\n*   lambda calculus\n*   programming language theory\n*   quantum computation\n*   security\n*   topological models\n*   logic\n*   type systems\n*   type theory\n*   denotational and operational semantics\n*   rewrite theory\n*   proof theory\n\nWe also welcome contributions that address applications of semantics to novel areas.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll dates are Anywhere on Earth.\n\n*   **Abstract Submission:** April 8, 2025 (extended)\n*   **Paper Submission:** April 9, 2025 (extended)\n*   **Notification:** May 15, 2025 (extended)\n*   **Conference Paper:** May 24, 2025\n*   **Final (post-proceeding) versions:** Autumn 2025\n\n## Invited Speakers\n\n*   Gordon Plotkin (keynote, joint with CALCO)\n*   Chris Heunen\n*   Delia Kesner\n*   Jurriaan Rot\n\n## Special Sessions\n\n*   Quantitative Semantics, organized by Ugo Dal Lago (joint session with CALCO)\n*   Mathematics of Natural Language, organized by Mehrnoosh Sadrzadeh\n*   Types and the Extraction of Correct Programs, organized by Ulrich Berger\n\n## Program Committee\n\n*   Sandra Alves, University of Porto, Portugal\n*   Giorgio Bacci, Aalborg University, Denmark\n*   Lars Birkedal, University of Arhus, Denmark\n*   Florence Clerc, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland\n*   Robin Cockett, University of Calgary, Canada\n*   Claudia Faggian, IRIF Paris, France\n*   Giulio Guerrieri, University of Sussex, UK\n*   Shin-ya Katsumata, NII, Tokyo, Japan\n*   S. Krishna, IIT Bombay, India\n*   Clemens Kupke, University of Strathclyde, Scotland (co-chair)\n*   Elena di Lavore, University of Oxford, UK\n*   Paul Levy, University of Birmingham, UK\n*   Isabella Mastroeni, University of Verona, Italy\n*   Stefan Milius, FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany (co-chair)\n*   Daniele Nantes-Sobrinho, Imperial College London, UK\n*   Fredrik Nordvall Forsberg, University of Strathclyde, Scotland\n*   Catuscia Palamidessi, Inria, France\n*   Prakash Panangaden, McGill University, Montreal, Canada\n*   Simon Perdrix, Inria LORIA, France\n*   Elaine Pimentel, University College London, UK\n*   Alex Simpson, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia\n*   Sam Staton, University of Oxford, UK\n*   Dario Stein, Radboud University Nijmegen, The Netherlands\n*   Qiyi Tang, University of Liverpool, UK\n*   Stelios Tsampas, FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nSubmissions are made through EasyChair ([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mfps2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mfps2025)). Papers can be at most 15 pages long, excluding bibliography, and should be prepared using the MFPS macros ([https://mfpsconf.org/submissions-to-mfps/](https://mfpsconf.org/submissions-to-mfps/)).\n\n## Proceedings\n\nA preliminary version will be distributed at the meeting. Final proceedings will be published in Electronic Notes in Theoretical Informatics and Computer Science (ENTICS). This new open-access series is hosted by Episciences.org as an overlay for papers published by the CORR arXiv or HAL.\n\n## Contact\n\nFor any further information about MFPS 2025, please contact the co-chairs: Clemens Kupke and Stefan Milius ([mfps2025@easychair.org](mailto:mfps2025@easychair.org))"
