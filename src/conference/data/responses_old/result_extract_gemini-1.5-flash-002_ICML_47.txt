"Call for Papers": "# ICML 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025) will be held in **Vancouver, Canada, from July 13–19, 2025**.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nWe invite submissions of papers on original and rigorous research of significant interest to the machine learning community for the main conference proceedings. All papers will be reviewed in a double-blind process and accepted papers will be presented at the conference.\n\nPapers must be prepared and submitted as a single file: 8 pages for the main paper, with unlimited pages for references, the impact statement, and appendices. There will be no separate deadline for the submission of supplementary material. The final versions of accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main paper. We require that, barring exceptional circumstances, at least one of the authors of accepted papers attend the conference in person to present the paper.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest include (but are not limited to):\n\n*   General Machine Learning (active learning, clustering, online learning, ranking, supervised, semi- and self-supervised learning, time series analysis, etc.)\n*   Deep Learning (architectures, generative models, theory, etc.)\n*   Evaluation (methodology, meta studies, replicability and validity, human-in-the-loop, etc.)\n*   Theory of Machine Learning (statistical learning theory, bandits, game theory, decision theory, etc.)\n*   Machine Learning Systems (improved implementation and scalability, hardware, libraries, distributed methods, etc.)\n*   Optimization (convex and non-convex optimization, matrix/tensor methods, stochastic, online, non-smooth, composite, etc.)\n*   Probabilistic Methods (Bayesian methods, graphical models, Monte Carlo methods, etc.)\n*   Reinforcement Learning (decision and control, planning, hierarchical RL, robotics, etc.)\n*   Trustworthy Machine Learning (causality, fairness, interpretability, privacy, robustness, safety, etc.)\n*   Application-Driven Machine Learning (innovative techniques, problems, and datasets that are of interest to the machine learning community and driven by the needs of end-users in applications such as healthcare, physical sciences, biosciences, social sciences, sustainability and climate, etc.)\n\n## Important Dates and Submission Site\n\n*   **Submission site open:** January 9, 2025\n*   **Suggested OpenReview account creation deadline:** January 9, 2025\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** January 23, 2025 | AoE | (Jan 24 2025 12 Noon UTC-0)\n*   **Full paper submission deadline:** January 30, 2025 | AoE | (Jan 31 2025 12 Noon UTC-0)\n*   **Abstracts and papers can be submitted through OpenReview:** [https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICML.cc/2025/Conference)\n\n## Policies\n\n### Deadlines\n\nAbstract and paper submission deadlines are strict. In no circumstances will extensions be given.\n\n### Changes to abstract/title/authorship\n\nAuthors should include a full title for their paper, complete author list, and complete abstract in the submission form by the abstract submission deadline. While it is possible to edit the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts that are substantially rewritten for the full submission risk being removed without consideration. The author list cannot be changed after the abstract deadline.\n\n### Reciprocal Reviewing Requirement\n\nNew this year: Qualified authors are required to review for ICML, according to the policies below.\n\n### Double-Blind Review\n\nAll submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any information with the intention or consequence of violating the double-blind reviewing policy.\n\n### Dual Submission\n\nAuthors may not submit papers that are identical, or substantially similar, to versions that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals.\n\n### Reviewing Criteria\n\nSubmissions should report original and rigorous research of significant interest to the machine learning community. All claims must be clearly stated and supported by reproducible experiments and/or sound theoretical analysis.\n\n### Use of Generative AI\n\nAuthors are allowed to use generative AI tools such as Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist in writing or research. However, authors must take full responsibility for all content in their paper, including any content generated by AI tools that might be construed as plagiarism or scientific misconduct. We encourage authors to explain any notable ways in which these tools were used in their research methodology. LLMs are not eligible for authorship.\n\n### Ethical Conduct for Peer Review\n\nAuthors are expected to follow standard ethical conduct for peer review.\n\n### Impact Statements\n\nAuthors are required to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences.\n\n### Lay Summaries\n\nNew this year: Authors of accepted papers will be required to submit a short “lay summary” of their work (also called \"plain language summary\") in OpenReview when submitting their camera-ready paper."
