  "Call for Papers": "# UBICOMM 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Nineteenth International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies (UBICOMM 2025) will be held from **September 28, 2025 - October 02, 2025 in Lisbon, Portugal.**\n\n## Onsite and Online Options\n\nIn order to accommodate various situations, we are offering the option for either physical presence or virtual participation (pdf slides or pre-recorded videos).\n\n## Conference Overview\n\nThe rapid advances in ubiquitous technologies make fruition of more than 35 years of research in distributed computing systems, and more than two decades of mobile computing. The ubiquity vision is becoming a reality. Hardware and software components evolved to deliver functionality under failure-prone environments with limited resources. The advent of web services and the progress on wearable devices, ambient components, user-generated content, mobile communications, and new business models generated new applications and services. The conference makes a bridge between issues with software and hardware challenges through mobile communications.\n\nThe goal of the International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies, UBICOMM 2025, is to bring together researchers from the academia and practitioners from the industry in order to address fundamentals of ubiquitous systems and the new applications related to them. The conference will provide a forum where researchers shall be able to present recent research results and new research problems and directions related to them. The conference seeks contributions presenting novel research in all aspects of ubiquitous techniques and technologies applied to advanced mobile applications.\n\n## Conference Tracks\n\n*   **Ubiquity trends and challenges**\n*   **Fundamentals**\n*   **Mobility**\n*   **Slicing and 5/6/7G technologies**\n*   **Information Ubiquity**\n*   **Ubiquitous Multimedia Systems and Processing**\n*   **Wireless Technologies**\n*   **Web Services**\n*   **Ubiquitous networks**\n*   **Ubiquitous devices and operative systems**\n*   **Ubiquitous mobile services and protocols**\n*   **Ubiquitous software and security**\n*   **Collaborative ubiquitous systems**\n*   **Users, applications, and business models**\n\n## Special Track: EXPLAIN: Engineering Explainability in Adaptive Intelligent Nexus\n\nChair: Dr. Mersedeh Sadeghi, University of Cologne, Germany ([sadeghi@cs.uni-koeln.de](mailto:sadeghi@cs.uni-koeln.de))\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nOnly .pdf or .doc files will be accepted for paper submission.
