  "Call for Papers": "# ECSQARU 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 18th European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches to Reasoning with Uncertainty (ECSQARU 2025) will be held in **Hagen, Germany, on September 23-26, 2025**.\n\nECSQARU is a major forum for advances in the theory and practice of reasoning under uncertainty, focusing on bringing symbolic and quantitative aspects together.\n\n## Call for Workshops and Tutorials\n\nThe first day of the conference (September 23) will host a workshop and tutorial program.  Please see the [Call for Workshops and Tutorials](call_for_workshops_and_tutorials.txt) for more information.\n\n## Topics\n\nECSQARU 2025 welcomes papers on the theory and practice of reasoning under uncertainty. This includes the following topics, but is not limited to:\n\n*   Algorithms for uncertain inference\n*   Applications of uncertain systems\n*   Argumentation\n*   Acting under uncertainty\n*   Belief functions\n*   Belief change and belief merging\n*   Classification and clustering\n*   Decision theory and decision graphs\n*   Default reasoning and non-monotonicity\n*   Description logics with uncertainty\n*   Foundations of reasoning under uncertainty\n*   Fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic\n*   Game theory\n*   Hybrid reasoning\n*   Imprecise probabilities\n*   Inconsistency handling\n*   Information fusion\n*   Learning for uncertainty formalisms\n*   Logics for reasoning under uncertainty\n*   Markov decision processes\n*   Planning under uncertainty\n*   Possibility theory and possibilistic logic\n*   Preferences\n*   Probabilistic graphical models\n*   Probabilistic logics\n*   Qualitative uncertainty models\n*   Rough sets\n*   Uncertainty and data\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmitted papers must be original and not under review in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. They will be evaluated by peer reviews based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. The reviewing process is single-blind.\n\nAuthors of accepted papers are expected to attend the conference to present their work; at least one author of each paper must register for the conference.\n\nSubmitted papers must be at most 12 pages (excluding references) in the Springer LNCS/LNAI format: [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)\n\nPaper submission, in PDF format, will be managed through OpenReview at [https://openreview.net/group?id=ECSQARU.org/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=ECSQARU.org/2025/Conference) and will be opened on January 1, 2025. It is mandatory to register an abstract beforehand.\n\n*   **Abstract submission deadline:** May 8, 2025\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** May 15, 2025\n\nAccepted papers will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series, which is a LNCS subseries.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Workshop/Tutorial proposal:** January 23, 2025\n*   **Abstract submission:** May 8, 2025\n*   **Paper submission:** May 15, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready paper:** July 17, 2025\n*   **Conference:** September 23-26, 2025"
