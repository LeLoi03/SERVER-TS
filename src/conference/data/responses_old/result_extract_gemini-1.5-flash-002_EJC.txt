  "Call for Papers": "# EJC 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 35th International Conference on Information Modelling and Knowledge Bases (EJC 2025) will take place from **June 9-13, 2025**, at the **Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (building FEI), VSB - Technical University of Ostrava, 17. listopadu 2172/15, 708 00 Ostrava – Poruba, Czech Republic.**\n\n## Motivation\n\nInformation modelling is becoming increasingly important for researchers, designers, and users of information systems with artificial intelligence. The amount and complexity of information, the number of abstraction levels, and the size of databases and knowledge bases are continuously growing. Conceptual modelling is one of the sub-areas of information modelling and AI modelling. The aim of this conference is to bring together experts from different areas of computer science, AI and other disciplines who have a common interest in understanding and solving problems on information modelling and knowledge bases, as well as applying the results of research to practice. We also aim to recognize and study new areas of Information modelling, knowledge bases and AI to which more attention should be paid. Philosophy and logic, cognitive science, knowledge management, linguistics and cyber-physical modelling are relevant areas, too. The conference will have three categories of presentations, i.e. full papers, short papers and position papers.\n\n## Suggested Topics\n\n*   **Conceptual modelling:** Modelling and specification languages; Domain-specific conceptual modelling; Concepts, concept theories and ontologies; Conceptual modelling of large and heterogeneous systems; Conceptual modelling of spatial, temporal and semantic data; Methods for developing, validating and communicating conceptual models.\n*   **Knowledge and information modelling and discovery:** Knowledge discovery, knowledge representation and knowledge management; Advanced data mining and analysis methods; Conceptions of knowledge and information; Modelling information requirements; Intelligent information systems; Information recognition and information modelling.\n*   **Linguistic modelling:** Models of HCI; Information delivery to users; Intelligent informal querying; Linguistic foundation of information and knowledge; Fuzzy linguistic models; Philosophical and linguistic foundations of conceptual models.\n*   **Cross-cultural communication and social computing:** Cross-cultural support systems; Integration, evolution and migration of systems; Collaborative societies; Multicultural web-based software systems; Intercultural collaboration and support systems; Social computing, behavioral modelling and prediction.\n*   **Environmental modelling and engineering:** Environmental information systems (architecture); Spatial, temporal and observational information systems; Large-scale environmental systems; Collaborative knowledge base systems; Agent concepts and conceptualization; Hazard prediction, prevention and steering systems.\n*   **Multimedia data modelling and systems:** Modelling multimedia information and knowledge; Content-based multimedia data management; Content-based multimedia retrieval; Privacy and context enhancing technologies; Semantics and pragmatics of multimedia data; Metadata for multimedia information systems.\n*   **AI System Modelling:** Cyber and Physical System Modelling; Image Processing; Natural Language Processing; Computer Vision; Biological Analysis; Responsible AI.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission Deadline:** February 5, 2025 (extended)\n*   **Notification of Acceptance:** March 30, 2025\n*   **Final paper for inclusion in the conference proceedings:** April 25, 2025\n*   **IOS Press version of Papers:** September 10, 2025\n\n## Publication\n\nAll papers (full/short/position) accepted and presented in the conference are published in the conference preprint (e-book having ISSN / ISBN) by the local organizers (distributed in the conference) and after the conference in the final journal-paper publication. After the conference, authors have the opportunity to improve their papers based on the feedback at the conference. The final publication is published in the Series “Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence” by IOS Press (Amsterdam). In addition to IOS press publication, we have an invitation to publish some papers in ECTI-Transactions on Computer and Information Technology (ECTI-CIT). The papers are selected by the Editorial Board of the Journal.\n\n## Submission\n\n[http://ejc.komazawa-u.ac.jp/ejc2025review/](http://ejc.komazawa-u.ac.jp/ejc2025review/)"
