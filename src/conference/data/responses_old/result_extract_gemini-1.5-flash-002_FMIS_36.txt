  "Call for Papers": "# FormaliSE 2025: Call for Papers\n\nFormaliSE 2025, the 13th edition of the FormaliSE conference series, will take place from **April 27-28, 2025 in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada**, co-located with ICSE 2025.\n\nFormaliSE promotes work at the intersection of formal methods and software engineering communities, providing a venue to exchange ideas, experiences, techniques, and results.\n\n## Areas of Interest\n\nAreas of interest include:\n\n*   Requirements formalization and formal specification\n*   Approaches, methods, and tools for verification and validation\n*   Formal approaches to safety and security-related issues\n*   Analysis of performance and other non-functional properties based on formal approaches\n*   Scalability of formal method applications\n*   Integration of formal methods within the software development lifecycle\n*   Model-based engineering approaches\n*   Correctness-by-construction approaches for software and systems engineering\n*   Application of formal methods to specific domains (e.g., autonomous, cyber-physical, intelligent, and IoT systems)\n*   Formal methods for AI-based systems (FM4AI), and AI applied in formal method approaches (AI4FM)\n*   Formal methods in a certification context\n*   Case studies developed/analyzed with formal approaches\n*   Experience reports on the application of formal methods to real-world problems\n*   Guidelines to use formal methods in practice\n*   Usability of formal methods\n\n## Submission Categories\n\nWe accept papers in three categories:\n\n1.  **Full research papers:** describing original research work and results. We encourage authors to include validation of their contributions by means of a case study or experiments. We also welcome research papers focusing on tools and tool development.\n2.  **Case study papers:** discussing a significant application that suggests general lessons learned and motivates further research, or empirically validates theoretical results (such as a technique’s scalability).\n3.  **Research ideas papers:** describing new ideas in preliminary form, in a way that can stimulate interesting discussions at the conference, and suggest future work.\n\nAll papers submitted to the FormaliSE 2025 conference must be written in English, must be unpublished original work, and must not be under review or submitted elsewhere at the time of submission. Submissions must comply with the FormaliSE’s lightweight double-anonymous review process (see below).\n\n## Paper Lengths\n\n*   Full research papers and case study papers: up to 10 pages including all text, figures, tables, and appendices, but excluding references.\n*   Research ideas papers: up to 4 pages, plus up to 1 additional page solely for references.\n\n## Paper Format\n\nAll submissions must be in PDF format and must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (i.e., title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type). In LaTeX, use `\\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}` without including the `compsoc` or `compsocconf` options.\n\n## Lightweight Double-Anonymous Review Process\n\nFormaliSE 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous process. Authors must omit their names and institutions from the title page, cite their own work in the third person, and omit acknowledgments that may reveal their identity or affiliation. The purpose is to reduce chances of reviewer bias influenced by the authors’ identities.\n\n## Paper Selection\n\nEach paper will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.\n\n## Publication\n\nAll accepted papers are published as part of the ICSE 2025 Proceedings in the ACM and IEEE Digital Libraries. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference and present the paper at the conference — physically or, if the circumstances do not allow so, virtually. Failure to register an author will result in a paper being removed from the proceedings.\n\n## Important Dates (AoE)\n\n*   **Abstract submissions:** November 18, 2024\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** November 25, 2024\n*   **Notifications:** January 13, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready papers due:** February 5, 2025\n*   **Early registration deadline:** February 18, 2025\n\n## Keynotes\n\n*   **Assuring AI in Autonomous Driving: Challenges and Emerging Approaches** - Krzysztof Czarnecki, University of Waterloo, Canada\n*   **Adversarial Perturbations and Self-Defenses for Large Language Models on Coding Tasks** - Corina S. Pasareanu, Carnegie Mellon University Silicon Valley, NASA Ames Research Center\n\n## Venue\n\n*   **Venue:** Rogers Centre, Ottawa (formerly Shaw Centre)\n*   **Offsite Special Venue:** [link provided]\n*   **Reception venue:** National Arts Centre\n\n## Contact\n\nFor questions, use the [FormaliSE Research Track contact form](https://2025.formalise.org/contact2/Formalise-2025-papers)."
