  "Call for Papers": "# SEA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 23rd Symposium on Experimental Algorithms (SEA 2025) will be held in **Venice, Italy, from July 22-24, 2025**.\n\nSEA aims to attract papers from the Computer Science community, the Operations Research/Mathematical Programming community, and any other scientific community concerned with the role of experimentation and algorithm engineering techniques in the design and evaluation of algorithms and data structures.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nContributions solicited cover a variety of topics including, but not limited to:\n\n*   Algorithm Engineering\n*   Algorithmic Libraries and Software Repositories\n*   Algorithmic Cryptography and Security\n*   Algorithmic Natural Language Processing\n*   Algorithmics for Databases\n*   Analysis of Algorithms\n*   Approximation Algorithms\n*   Bioinformatics and Computational Biology\n*   Branch-and-Bound Algorithms\n*   Combinatorial Problems and Structures\n*   Communication Networks\n*   Computational Geometry\n*   Computational Optimization\n*   Compressed space algorithms and data structures\n*   Data Structures\n*   Distributed and Parallel Algorithms\n*   Graph Algorithms\n*   Heuristic Algorithms\n*   Integer Programming\n*   Logistics and Operations Management\n*   Machine Learning and Data Mining\n*   Mathematical Programming\n*   Multiple Criteria Decision Making\n*   Network Analysis\n*   Online Problems\n*   Randomized Algorithms\n*   Semidefinite Programming\n*   String Algorithms\n*   Streaming and External Memory Algorithms\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nThe authors should submit a paper not exceeding 12 pages, excluding the bibliography, the front page (title, keywords, abstract, ...), and a brief appendix of up to 5 pages (figures and tables should be counted as part of the space occupied by the appendix).\n\nThis year, for the first time in SEA, all papers have to be anonymized so author names and affiliations cannot be included (see Double-Blind Reviewing section). Non-anonymized papers will be desk-rejected.\n\nAuthors are required to use the LaTeX style file supplied for the LIPIcs style, without changing default values nor setting font size options in the \"documentclass\" statement ([https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author)).\n\nAll submissions have to be made via the EasyChair submission page for the conference: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sea2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sea2025).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper Submission Deadline:** February 2, 2025, AoE (extended)\n*   **Authors' notification:** March 31, 2025 (extended)\n*   **Final version due:** April 28, 2025\n\n## Best Paper Award\n\nThe program committee will identify a submission as the best paper.\n\n## Proceedings\n\nThe conference proceedings will be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs), a series of high-quality conference proceedings across all fields in informatics established in cooperation with Schloss Dagstuhl Leibniz Center for Informatics. SEA Proceedings volumes are published according to the principle of OpenAccess, i.e., they are available online and free of charge.\n\n## Double-Blind Reviewing\n\nSEA will implement a double-blind review process for the first time. As such, submissions must not disclose the authors' identities in any way. In particular, names, affiliations, and email addresses must be excluded from the paper.\n\n## Large Language Models Usage Policy\n\nPapers containing content generated by large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or images created using deep generative models (DGMs) such as StableDiffusion are not allowed, except for:\n\n1.  Generating scientific plots displaying data that the authors obtained from experiments\n2.  Polishing the text that the authors have personally written.\n\nDespite using LLMs or DGMs, authors remain fully responsible for ensuring their submissions' accuracy, originality, and quality.\n\nIf a submission includes LLM-generated text or DGM-generated images, we require the authors to disclose this information to the Program Chairs at the moment of submitting the paper."
