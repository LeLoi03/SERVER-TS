  "Call for Papers": "# Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA) 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 2025 Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA 2025) is jointly organised by Edith Cowan University and Australian Robotics and Automation Association (ARAA). The conference will be held **in person** on **December 1-3, 2025** at **ECU Joondalup Campus**.\n\nSince 1999, ACRA has brought together Australian and New Zealand researchers and students in robotics, automation, and mechatronics. It provides a forum to present a breadth of research activities to the broader Australasian community. ACRA is a quality, peer-reviewed conference featured in Scopus, Google Scholar, and other ranking engines.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   Submission of full-length papers: 7th September 2025 (23:59 AWST)\n*   Notification of paper acceptance: 15th October 2025 (23:59 AWST)\n*   Submission of camera-ready papers: 3rd November 2025 (23:59 AWST)\n\n## Topics\n\nACRA 2025 will bring together researchers, engineers, academics, students, practitioners, organisations and industries to discuss the current state of the art of research and advancement of technology in areas of Robotics and Automation, including (but not limited to):\n\n*   Mechatronics systems and design\n*   Vision for robotics\n*   Field robotics\n*   Aerial robotics\n*   Underwater and marine robotics\n*   SLAM\n*   Agricultural robotics\n*   Industrial robots and automation\n*   Service robotics\n*   Control systems\n*   Motion and path planning\n*   Healthcare robots\n*   Soft robotics\n*   Smart materials\n*   Machine learning (Artificial Intelligence) for robotics\n*   Human-machine interaction\n*   Robotics perception\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nSubmissions must be original, unpublished work containing new and interesting results that demonstrate current research in areas relevant to Robotics and Automation. All full papers submitted to ACRA 2025 will undergo a peer-review process. Each manuscript will be reviewed by at least two reviewers who will give detailed comments. If the submission is accepted, the authors will be required to submit a revised (“camera-ready”) version that takes into account this feedback. All papers are reviewed using a single-blind review process.\n\n## Paper Format\n\nACRA papers must be 6-10 pages in length (including text, references, figures and acknowledgements). Papers that do not follow these guidelines may be rejected without review.\n\n## Paper Templates\n\nPlease use this link to download the following files:\n\n*   LaTeX:\n    *   style file: acra.sty\n    *   template: acra.tex\n    *   bibtex: named.bst\n*   Microsoft Word|Star/OpenOffice:\n    *   template: acra.rtf or acra.odt\n\n## Submission portal\n\nTo make your submission, please use [this portal](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/acra/)."
