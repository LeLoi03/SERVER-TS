  "Summary": "The International Conference on Computational Science is an annual conference that brings together researchers and scientists from mathematics and computer science, as well as from various application areas, to discuss problems and solutions in the area, identify new issues, and shape future directions for research. ICCS 2025, in Singapore, will be the twenty-fifth edition in this series of highly successful conferences.",
  "Call for Papers": "# ICCS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 25th International Conference on Computational Science (ICCS 2025) will be held in **Singapore from July 7-9, 2025**.\n\n## Theme\n\n\"Making Complex Systems tractable through Computational Science\"\n\n## Scope and Topics\n\nAuthors are invited to submit manuscripts reporting original, unpublished research and recent developments in Computational Sciences. All accepted papers will be included in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series and indexed by Scopus, EI Engineering Index, Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in ISI Web of Science), and several other indexing services. The papers will contain linked references, XML versions, and citable DOI numbers.\n\nICCS 2025 invites original contributions on all topics related to Computational Science, including, but not limited to:\n\n*   Scientific Computing\n*   Problem Solving Environments\n*   Advanced Numerical Algorithms\n*   Complex Systems: Modeling and Simulation\n*   Hybrid Computational Methods\n*   Web- and Grid-based Simulation and Computing\n*   Parallel and Distributed Computing\n*   Advanced Computing Architectures and New Programming Models\n*   Visualization and Virtual Reality as Applied to Computational Science\n*   Applications of Computation as a Scientific Paradigm\n*   New Algorithmic Approaches to Computational Kernels and Applications\n*   Computational Humanities\n*   Education in Computational Science\n*   Large Scale Scientific Instruments\n*   Computational Sociology\n*   Medical and Biomedical Computational Science\n*   Computational Physics\n*   Quantum Computing\n*   Uncertainty Quantification\n*   Artificial Intelligence in Scientific Computing\n*   Complex Systems Simulations\n*   System Dynamics Models\n*   Complex Networks Models and High Performance simulations\n*   Massive Agent Based models\n\nPapers highlighting the role of Computational Science in tackling the complex problems of today and tomorrow are particularly welcome.\n\n## Paper Types and Publication\n\n| Submission Type | Published in LNCS | Pages |\n|---|---|---|\n| Full Paper | ✓ | 12-15 |\n| Short Paper | ✓ | 6-8 |\n| Abstract | — | 2 |\n\nICCS is co-organized with the Workshops on Computational Science. You can submit your paper to either the Main Conference or any of the Workshops via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccs2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccs2025).\n\n## Instructions for Authors\n\nThe manuscripts should be submitted electronically via EasyChair. The most recent versions of the Templates are available for download from this link. The LaTeX2e Proceedings Templates are also available in the scientific authoring platform Overleaf. Please also make sure to follow Springer’s [authors’ guidelines](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19242230/data/v12), as well as Springer’s [Book Authors’ Code of Conduct](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct).\n\nPapers must be based on unpublished original work and must be submitted to ICCS only. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper. ICCS lays crucial emphasis on the explicit relevance of submitted contributions to Computational Science. Papers that are more relevant to specialized conferences on very specific topics will be desk-rejected before the standard review process begins.\n\nTo promote open science and to facilitate reproducibility, ICCS encourages data and code sharing.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Workshop proposals:** January 3, 2025 (expired)\n*   **Paper submission:** February 28, 2025 (final extension – expired)\n*   **Notification to authors:** April 7, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready papers:** April 23, 2025\n*   **Author registration:** April 7 – April 23, 2025\n*   **Non-author registration (in-person only):** April 7 – June 2, 2025\n*   **Conference sessions:** July 7-9, 2025"
