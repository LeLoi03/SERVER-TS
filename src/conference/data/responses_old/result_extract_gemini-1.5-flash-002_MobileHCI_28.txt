  "Summary": "The ACM International Conference on Mobile Human-Computer Interaction (MobileHCI) brings together people from diverse areas and provides a multidisciplinary forum for academics, hardware and software developers, designers and practitioners to discuss the challenges and potential solutions for effective interaction with and through mobile devices, applications, and services. MobileHCI'25 will be held in person from September 22nd - September 26th, 2025 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. The theme is \"Diving into Mobile AI.\"",
  "Call for Papers": "# MobileHCI 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe ACM International Conference on Mobile Human-Computer Interaction (MobileHCI 2025) will be held in person from **September 22nd - September 26th, 2025 in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt.**\n\n## Theme\n\n**Diving into Mobile AI**\n\n## Topics\n\nThe MobileHCI conference seeks submissions targeted toward this year’s conference theme and topics in the following key domains:\n\n*   **Systems and Infrastructure:** The design, architecture, deployment, and evaluation of systems and infrastructures that support the development of or interaction with mobile technology.\n*   **Interaction Devices and Techniques:** The design, construction, usage, and evaluation of devices and techniques that create valuable new interactive capabilities for mobile human-computer interaction.\n*   **Applications and Experiences:** Descriptions of the design, empirical study of interactive applications, or analysis of usage trends that leverage mobile devices and systems. Application areas include health care, mobility, sustainability, social engagement, and civic engagement.\n*   **Methods and Tools:** New methods and tools designed for, or applied to, studying or building mobile user interfaces, applications, and mobile users.\n*   **Theories and Models:** Critical analysis or organizing theory with clearly motivated relevance to the design or study of mobile human-computer interaction; taxonomies of design or devices.\n*   **New Perspectives:** Well-argued and well-supported visions of the future of mobile computing; non-traditional topics that bear on mobility; underrepresented viewpoints and perspectives that convincingly bring something new to mobile research and practice.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*All deadlines are AoE*\n\n*   **Abstract Submission:** January 30, 2025\n*   **Paper Submission:** February 6, 2025\n*   **Revise and Resubmit Notifications:** March 13, 2025\n*   **Revised Submission:** May 8, 2025\n*   **Final Notifications:** May 29, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready:** June 19, 2025\n\n## Preparing the Submission\n\n### Novelty\n\nThe submission must be original work. It cannot have been published elsewhere nor be under concurrent review for publication by another conference or journal.\n\n### Length\n\nTypical page length is 4000 and 9000 words (excluding references and appendix), but any page length is allowed as long as the paper contribution is commensurate. If the paper is more than 12,000 words, we may reject it if no justification is provided. References and the appendix do not count toward the paper length. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a submission relative to its length, so papers with a length disproportionate to their contribution will likely be rejected. Shorter, more focused papers are encouraged and will be reviewed appropriately. The abstract has to be a paragraph of 150 words or less.\n\n### Formatting\n\nPapers must be in English. Authors are required to use the single-column ACM Manuscript template. Submission preparation is described on the ACM Primary Template website.\n\n### Anonymity\n\nAll submissions need to be fully anonymized. This includes any appendices or supplemental material as well as a potential acknowledgments section. Citations to the authors’ own previous work are NOT allowed to be anonymized. This allows reviewers to ensure all previous research has been taken into account. However authors should refer to their own prior work in the third person.\n\n### Supplementary Materials\n\nAll videos and supplementary material must be anonymized. Videos can be of any length and should include closed captions and audio descriptions; see Accessible Presentation Guide. Other supplementary material may include, for example, survey text, experimental protocols, source code, and data, all of which can help others replicate the work. Authors should submit any non-video supplementary material as a single .zip file, including a README file with a description of the materials. Reviewers should be able to access the contribution of the paper solely based on the main PDF submission. That is, the paper submission must stand independently without the supplementary material.\n\n### Accessibility\n\nAuthors are required to follow SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission. If authors have questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs via [diversity2025@mobilehci.acm.org](mailto:diversity2025@mobilehci.acm.org) early in the writing process.\n\n### Use of Generative AI\n\nAuthors must adhere to the ACM Policy on Authorship regarding the use of generative AI in submissions. Authors are responsible for all content produced (including plagiarism, misrepresentation, or fabrication) by these tools and must disclose their use.\n\n## Submitting\n\n### Submission Platform\n\nSubmissions are facilitated via the Precision Conference System (PCS).\n\n### Metadata Integrity\n\nChanges in author names are not allowed after the submission deadline; there are no exceptions. Changes to the order of authors are allowed only before the camera-ready deadline. The metadata is crucial to the integrity of the review process and author representation.\n\n## Selection Process\n\nWe use a refereed process, i.e., an editorial board and a set of external reviewers will review the submitted papers.\n\n## Upon Acceptance\n\n### Publication\n\nThe paper publication is archival, i.e., accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library as part of the Proceedings of ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACMHCI).\n\n### Presentation Format\n\nUpon acceptance, we will invite authors to present their papers at the conference.\n\n### Conference Registration\n\nFor each accepted paper, at least one author must register for the MobileHCI 2025 conference by the early bird registration deadline.\n\n### Demo\n\nThe Demo Chairs might invite authors of accepted papers to participate in the demo session. For this, authors have to submit an additional document describing the technical requirements for the demo.\n\n## Contact Us\n\nContact: [papers2025@mobilehci.acm.org](mailto:papers2025@mobilehci.acm.org)"
