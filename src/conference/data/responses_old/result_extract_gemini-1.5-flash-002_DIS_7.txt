  "Call for Papers": "# DIS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe ACM SIGCHI Conference on Designing Interactive Systems (DIS) 2025 will take place in **Funchal, Madeira, from July 5-9, 2025.**\n\n## Conference Theme\n\nDesigning for a Sustainable Ocean\n\nDIS 2025 encourages submissions that address the design of interactive systems in the broadest possible sense, with a particular emphasis on those that address the conference theme.\n\n## Contribution Areas\n\nDIS 2025 includes five contribution areas for submissions:\n\n*   **Critical Computing and Design Theory:** This area invites papers on critical computing, design theory, and their overlap. We welcome epistemologically pluralistic approaches spanning disciplines, theories, and methods.\n*   **Design Methods and Processes:** This area invites papers that document, innovate, and advance the methods, approaches, and processes used in interaction design, UX design, and service design.\n*   **Artifacts and Systems:** This area invites papers that analyze, evaluate, and/or reflect on artifacts and interactive systems.\n*   **Research Through Design (RtD):** The RtD area invites research that presents contributions resulting from the exploration of design practices, materials, artifacts, technologies, and interfaces.\n*   **AI and Design:** This area invites papers that make a design contribution to artificial intelligence.\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll deadlines are Anywhere on Earth time.\n\n*   **Submission Site opens:** January 3, 2025\n*   **Title and Abstract deadline:** January 13, 2025\n*   **Paper and Pictorial Submission deadline:** January 20, 2025\n*   **Notifications:** April 8, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready Completion Deadline:** April 22, 2025\n*   **DIS 2025 Conference:** July 5-9, 2025\n\n## Submission Process\n\nPlease submit papers through the [Precision Conference Submission Portal](https://new.precisionconference.com/).\n\n## Paper Length and Format\n\nPapers do not have a page limit, but a typical submission length is approximately 7,000–8,000 words excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Papers should be succinct but thorough.\n\n## Conference Chairs\n\nValentina Nisi and Nuno Jardim Nunes (Instituto Superior Técnico, University of Lisbon)\n\n## Technical Program Committee\n\nIan Oakley (KAIST), Qian Yang (Cornell University), and Clement Zheng (National University of Singapore)\n\n## Local Chairs\n\nCintia França (University of Madeira) and Paulo Bala (University of Lisbon)"
