Authors should consult [Springer’s authors’ guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for MS Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCID in their (final) papers. In addition, the corresponding author of each paper must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form.\n\nInitial submissions must be **full papers** (preferably 12 pages) and not merely abstracts. Initial submissions have to contain an anonymized PDF and non-anonymized sources. Papers will undergo double-blind reviewing by an international committee, and accepted on the basis of their scientific merit and relevance to the conference topics. Please preserve anonymity by avoiding providing information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgements, links to websites, and the literature references.\n\nEvery final paper must be accompanied by the completed and signed copyright form (Licence to Publish form for LNCS, CCIS or LNBIP).\n\nAll final submissions should be in a .zip compressed archive including:\n\n*   the source (input) files\n*   any style files, templates, and special fonts\n*   MS Word file (if using MS Word)\n*   the final Postscript (.ps) or Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file\n*   the scanned completed and signed copyright form\n\nBy submitting the paper to the ICAISC conference, the author(s) agree that they did not submit this paper to any other conference and that one of them will attend the conference to present the paper. Please note that all papers will be assigned a paper number. You will receive this number after you have completed the paper submission process. Authors are then required to use the paper number assigned to them for all future correspondence regarding this paper.\n\nThe submission system is available at [https://icaiscsystem.icaisc.eu/](https://icaiscsystem.icaisc.eu/).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Submission of papers:** April 1, 2025 (HARD DEADLINE)\n*   **Notification of acceptance:** from February 1, 2025\n*   **Submission of camera-ready papers:** April 10, 2025\n*   **Conference date:** June 22-26, 2025"
