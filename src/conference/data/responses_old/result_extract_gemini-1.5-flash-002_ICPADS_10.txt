  "Call for Papers": "# IEEE ICDCS 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 45th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (IEEE ICDCS 2025) will be held in **Glasgow, Scotland, UK, from July 20-23, 2025**.\n\n## Scope\n\nThe conference is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners to present, discuss, and exchange cutting-edge ideas and the latest findings on topics related to all aspects of distributed computing systems.\n\n## Tracks\n\nPapers can be submitted to one of the following tracks:\n\n*   Cloud Computing\n*   Distributed Algorithms\n*   Big Data, Models & Systems\n*   Distributed Fault Tolerance\n*   Distributed OS and Middleware\n*   Edge Computing\n*   IoT + CPS\n*   Mobile Computing\n*   Security, Privacy and Trust\n*   Blockchains/Databases\n*   Distributed Systems for AI/ML\n*   AI/ML for Distributed Systems\n*   Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures\n\n## Paper Submission\n\nThe Paper strand provides the opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.\n\nPapers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. All paper submissions should follow the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template ([https://template-selector.ieee.org/](https://template-selector.ieee.org/)). Each submission can have up to eleven (11) pages (including figures, tables, appendices, and references). Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review.\n\nThe paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content. To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymized GitHub repository with all source code, scripts, and data needed for the reproduction of their results.\n\nFor each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference in-person to present their work on-site. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.\n\nNote that the authors should adhere to ethics and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer to IEEE Code of Ethics and [IEEE Policy of AI-Generated Text](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/#ai-generated-text).\n\n## Paper Deadline Dates\n\n*   Time zone: Anywhere on Earth (AoE)\n*   Paper Submission Website: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icdcs2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icdcs2025) (Submission portal opens on 1 November 2024)\n*   Paper Abstract Registration: December 11, 2024\n*   Paper Submission Due: December 18, 2024\n*   Author Notification: April 2, 2025\n*   Camera-Ready Submission: April 16, 2025\n\n## Contact\n\nFor inquiries regarding the Call for Papers, email: [icdcs2025@easychair.org](mailto:icdcs2025@easychair.org)\n\n## Program Chairs\n\n*   Songqing Chen, George Mason University, USA\n*   Neeraj Suri, Lancaster University, UK\n\n## General Chairs\n\n*   Christos Anagnostopoulos, University of Glasgow, UK\n*   Iadh Ounis, University of Glasgow, UK"
