  "Summary": "The 31st International European Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing (Euro-Par 2025) will be held in Dresden, Germany, from August 25 to 29, 2025. Euro-Par is the leading European conference covering all aspects of parallel and distributed processing, ranging from theory to practice and from small to large systems.",
  "Call for Papers": "# Euro-Par 2025: Call for Papers\n\nEuro-Par is the prime European conference covering all aspects of parallel and distributed processing, ranging from theory to practice, from small to the largest parallel and distributed systems and infrastructures, from fundamental computational problems to applications, from architecture, compiler, language and interface design and implementation, to tools, support infrastructures, and application performance aspects. Participants at Euro-Par are researchers in academic institutions, government laboratories, and industrial organizations. Euro-Par aims to be the primary choice of such professionals for the presentation of new results in their specific areas. Euro-Par provides an excellent forum for focused technical discussion, as well as interaction with a large, broad, and diverse audience. In addition, Euro-Par provides a platform for a number of accompanying, technical workshops for smaller and emerging communities.\n\n## Key Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Submission:** March 3, 2025 (AoE) (extended deadline)\n*   **Paper Submission:** March 17, 2025 (AoE) (extended deadline)\n*   **Author Notification:** April 29, 2025\n*   **Camera-Ready Papers:** June 2, 2025\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   The Euro-Par 2025 proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series.\n*   Papers must be in PDF format and should not exceed 14 pages (including references).\n*   Papers must be formatted in the Springer LNCS style: [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)\n*   Papers that don’t meet these requirements might be rejected without a review.\n*   Contributions submitted elsewhere or currently under review will not be considered.\n*   All submitted papers will be checked for originality by Springer ithenticate; papers which show insufficient originality might be rejected without a review.\n*   Double-blind is optional and not required.\n*   Paper submissions are made through EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=europar2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=europar2025)\n\n## Tracks\n\n*   **Track 1 – Programming, Compilers and Performance**\n    *   Chairs: Ana Lucia Varbanescu, University of Amsterdam, Netherlands; João M.
