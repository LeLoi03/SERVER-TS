They also include complexity-theoretic investigations, both foundational and with respect to concrete problems, and new implementations of exact real arithmetic, as well as further developments of already existing software packages. We hope to gain new insights into computability-theoretic aspects of various computational questions from physics and from other fields involving computations over the real numbers.\n\n*   Computable analysis\n*   Complexity on real numbers\n*   Computable numbers, subsets and functions\n*   Theory of representations\n*   Computable differential equations\n*   Randomness and computable measure theory\n*   Algorithmic fractal dimension\n*   Effective descriptive set theory\n*   Weihrauch complexity\n*   Reverse analysis\n*   Constructive analysis\n*   Domain theory and analysis\n*   Realizability theory and analysis\n*   Models of computability on real numbers\n*   Real number algorithms\n*   Exact real number arithmetic\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nAuthors are invited to submit 1-2 pages abstracts in PDF format including references via the following webpage: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cca2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cca2025)\n\nIf full versions of papers are already available as technical reports or arXiv versions, then corresponding links should be added to the reference list.
