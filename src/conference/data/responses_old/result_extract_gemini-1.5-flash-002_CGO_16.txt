  "Call for Papers": "# CGO 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO 2025) will be held in **Las Vegas, Nevada, United States, from March 1-5, 2025**.\n\n## Call for Papers\n\nCGO is the premier venue to bring together researchers and practitioners working at the interface of hardware and software on a wide range of optimization and code generation techniques and related issues. The conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific architectural features and support for code generation and optimization.\n\nCGO now uses two submissions per year. This follows the model established by other conferences in our field in recent years, such as ASPLOS and OOPSLA. Papers submitted to the first round can either be directly accepted, rejected, or invited to submit a revised version of the paper to the second round. Papers rejected in the first round may not be submitted to the second round. For papers invited to submit a revised version, authors will be given a list of revisions that should be acted on to improve the paper. We will make every effort to ensure that the revised paper is reviewed by the same reviewers (and possibly additional reviewers), who will assess whether the revisions are satisfactory. If so, the paper will be accepted. If the revised paper is rejected, the authors may submit a further revised version in a subsequent round, which will be treated as a new submission.\n\n## Topics\n\nOriginal contributions are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:\n\n*   Code Generation, Translation, Transformation, and Optimization for performance, energy, virtualization, portability, security, or reliability concerns, and architectural support\n*   Efficient execution of dynamically typed and higher-level languages\n*   Optimization and code generation for emerging programming models, platforms, domain-specific languages\n*   Dynamic/static, profile-guided, feedback-directed, and machine learning-based optimization\n*   Static, Dynamic, and Hybrid Analysis for performance, energy, memory locality, throughput or latency, security, reliability, or functional debugging\n*   Program characterization methods\n*   Profiling and instrumentation techniques; architectural support\n*   Novel and efficient tools\n*   Compiler design, practice and experience\n*   Compiler abstraction and intermediate representations\n*   Vertical integration of language features, representations, optimizations, and runtime support for parallelism\n*   Solutions that involve cross-layer (HW/OS/VM/SW) design and integration\n*   Deployed dynamic/static compiler and runtime systems for general purpose, embedded system and Cloud/HPC platforms\n*   Parallelism, heterogeneity, and reconfigurable architectures\n*   Optimizations for heterogeneous or specialized targets, GPUs, SoCs, CGRA and Quantum Computers\n*   Compiler support for vectorization, thread extraction, task scheduling, speculation, transaction, memory management, data distribution and synchronization\n\n### Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers\n\nCGO has a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nPlease make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements before it is submitted:\n\n*   The paper must be original material that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal.\n*   Your submission is limited to eleven (11) letter-size (8.5\"x11\"), single-spaced, double-column pages, using 10pt or larger font, not including references. There is no page limit for references.\n*   Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 11 pages.\n*   Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review.\n*   Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers.\n*   Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass.\n*   Please number the pages.\n*   The paper must be written in English.\n*   The paper must be submitted in PDF.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n**Note:** AoE (UTC-12h)\n\n### First Submission Deadline\n\n*   Paper Submission: May 30, 2024\n*   Author Rebuttal Period: July 9-11, 2024\n*   Paper Notification: July 22, 2024\n\n### Second Submission Deadline\n\n*   Paper Submission: September 12, 2024\n*   Author Rebuttal Period: October 22 - 24, 2024\n*   Paper Notification: November 4, 2024\n\n## Submission Site\n\nPapers can be submitted at [https://cgo25-second-round.hotcrp.com/](https://cgo25-second-round.hotcrp.com/)\n\n## Program Committee Co-chairs\n\n*   Hugh Leather - Meta - [hleather@meta.com](mailto:hleather@meta.com)\n*   P. (Saday) Sadayappan – University of Utah – [saday@cs.utah.edu](mailto:saday@cs.utah.edu)"
