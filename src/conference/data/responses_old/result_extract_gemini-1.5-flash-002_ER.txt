  "Call for Papers": "# ER 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 44th International Conference on Conceptual Modeling (ER 2025) will take place in **Poitiers / Futuroscope, France, from October 20-23, 2025.**\n\n## Theme\n\n**BUILDING TRUST THROUGH CONCEPTUAL MODELING**\n\nThis yearâ€™s theme focuses on the important role conceptual modeling plays in creating systems that are trustworthy, inclusive, and transparent. We invite the Conceptual Modelling community to deliberate on how traditional modeling principles and frameworks can contribute and adapt to new advancements in AI, data ecosystems, and autonomous platforms while upholding ethical standards and fostering trust in digital innovations.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nWe welcome submissions of original research on a variety of topics on conceptual modeling, including well-established and emerging areas of research and practice, as well as submissions that lead to new foundations, links, applications, or enlarge current boundaries of conceptual modeling. We also invite industry reports and vision papers.\n\nSpecific examples of relevant topics include but are not limited to:\n\n### Foundations of conceptual modeling:\n\n*   Human-centred and inclusive modeling\n*   Model explainability and transparency\n*   Role of modeling in engendering trust and building trustworthy systems\n*   Automated and AI-assisted conceptual modeling\n*   Complexity management of large conceptual models\n*   Concept formalization\n*   Domain-specific modeling\n*   Discovery of models\n*   Evolution, exchange, integration, and transformation of models\n*   Justification and evaluation of models\n*   Interactive, dynamic and adaptive modeling systems\n*   Logic-based knowledge representation and reasoning\n*   Multi-level and multi-perspective modeling\n*   Ontological and cognitive foundations\n*   Quality paradigms and metrics\n*   Semantics in conceptual modeling\n*   Theories and methodologies for conceptual modeling\n*   Verification and validation of conceptual models\n\n### Conceptual modeling for:\n\n*   Data access, acquisition, integration, maintenance, preparation transformation, and visualization\n*   Data management\n*   Data-centric AI development\n*   Distributed, decentralized, ledger-based, parallel, and P2P databases\n*   Graph and network databases\n*   Object-oriented and object-relational databases\n*   SQL, NewSQL and NoSQL databases\n*   Spatial and temporal databases\n*   Event-based and stream architectures\n*   Multimedia and text databases\n*   Approximate, probabilistic, and uncertain databases\n*   Web, Semantic Web, knowledge graphs, and cloud databases\n*   Synthetic data and simulation modeling\n*   Other data spaces\n\n### Conceptual modeling in:\n\n*   AI, data mining, data science, machine learning, explainable AI, LLMs, statistics\n*   Business, climate, compliance, economics, education, energy entertainment, government, health, law, sustainability, etc\n*   Collaboration, crowdsourcing, games, and social networks\n*   Business intelligence and analytics, Data warehousing\n*   Engineering\n*   Enterprises\n*   Ethics, fairness, responsibility, or trust\n*   Digital twins, fog and edge computing, Industry 4.0, internet of things\n*   Information classification, filtering, retrieval, summarization, and visualization\n*   Scientific data management, including FAIR practices\n*   Metaverse and Extended Reality (XR)\n\n### Conceptual modeling showcased by:\n\n*   Computational tools that advance the state-of-the-art\n*   Ethnographic, qualitative, empirical case studies, and experience reports of applications\n*   Comparative and benchmarking studies\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Full paper abstracts submission (mandatory):** May 19, 2025\n*   **Full paper submission:** May 26, 2025\n*   **Author notification:** July 30, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready papers and author registration:** August 18, 2025\n\nAll deadlines are at 23:59 in the Anywhere on Earth timezone.\n\n## Submission Guidelines for Full Papers and Review Process\n\nSince the proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series, authors must submit manuscripts using the LNCS style. The page limit for submitted papers (as well as for final, camera-ready papers) is 16 pages (excluding references). ER 2025 follows a double-blind review process. Authors are therefore asked to remove all identifying information from the manuscript and use repository anonymization services to anonymize potential source code repositories and online supplementary material.\n\nManuscripts not submitted in the LNCS style or exceeding the page limit will be desk rejected. Likewise, submissions that do not primarily focus on aspects of conceptual modeling shall be rejected without undergoing formal reviewing. Papers submitted must not be under evaluation for or have already been published in, or accepted for publication, in a journal or another conference.\n\n## Submission Link\n\nTo submit your paper, please use the following link: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=er2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=er2025)\n\n## Post-Conference Special Journal Issue\n\nThe authors of selected papers will be invited to prepare a substantially revised and extended version of a Special Issue in Elsevier's Data & Knowledge Engineering (JCR 2023 Impact Factor 2.7).\n\n## Program Co-chairs\n\n*   Shazia Sadiq, University of Queensland, Australia\n*   Dominik Bork, TU Wien, Austria\n*   Roman Lukyanenko, University of Virginia, USA"
