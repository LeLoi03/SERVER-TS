  "Call for Papers": "# SAT 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 28th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT 2025) will take place from **August 11-15, 2025 at the University of Glasgow in Glasgow, Scotland.**\n\nSAT 2025 will be co-located with the 31st International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP), the 18th International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS), and the 23rd International Workshop on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT).\n\n## Scope\n\nThe scope of SAT 2025 includes all aspects of the theory and applications of propositional satisfiability broadly construed. This includes paradigms such as Boolean optimization using, e.g., MaxSAT and pseudo-Boolean (PB) solving, quantified Boolean formulas (QBF), satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), model counting, constraint programming (CP), and integer linear programming (ILP) for problems with clear connections to Boolean-level reasoning.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nTopics of interest for the SAT 2025 conference include but are not limited to:\n\n*   Theoretical advances (including algorithms, proof complexity, parameterized complexity, and other complexity issues)\n*   Practical search algorithms\n*   Knowledge compilation\n*   Implementation-level details of SAT and SMT solving tools and SAT/SMT-based systems\n*   Problem encodings and reformulations\n*   Applications (including both novel applications domains and improvements to existing approaches)\n*   Case studies and reports on scientific findings based on rigorous experimentation\n\n## Out of Scope\n\nPapers claiming to resolve significant long-standing open problems in mathematics or computer science are outside the scope of the conference.\n\n## Paper Categories\n\nSubmissions to SAT 2025 are invited in the following three categories:\n\n*   Long papers (9 to 15 pages, excluding references and appendices)\n*   Short papers (up to 8 pages, excluding references and appendices)\n*   Tool papers (up to 8 pages, excluding references and appendices)\n\n## Submission\n\nSubmissions should be made via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sat2025).\n\nPapers must be formatted in the LIPIcs LaTeX style, which is available [here](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract registration:** March 24, 2025, 23:59 AoE\n*   **Full paper submission:** April 3, 2025, 23:59 AoE\n*   **Author response:** May 5-9, 2025 AoE\n*   **Notification of decisions:** May 29, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready version submission:** TBA\n\n## Best Paper Awards\n\nLong and short papers may be considered for a best paper award. If the main authors, both in terms of work and writing, are students at the time of submission, the paper may be considered for a best student paper award.\n\n## Proceedings\n\nAccepted papers will be published as conference proceedings in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) as a free, open electronic archive with access to all. Authors will retain full rights over their work. The accepted papers will be published under a CC-BY license.\n\n## Invitation of Top Papers to AIJ and JAIR\n\nTop papers from SAT 2025 will be invited to the award-winning paper tracks in Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ) or Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)."
