  "Summary": "EICS 2025 is the seventeenth international ACM SIGCHI conference devoted to engineering interactive computing systems and their user interfaces. The conference focuses on models, languages, notations, methods, techniques, and tools that support designing, developing, validating, and verifying interactive systems.  The conference proceedings are published by ACM and appear in the ACM Digital Library.  Full papers are published in the journal PACM EICS series.",
  "Call for Papers": "# EICS 2025: Call for Full Papers & Technical Notes\n\nThe 17th ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computing Systems (EICS 2025) will take place from **June 23-27, 2025, in Trier, Germany**.\n\nEICS 2025 is the seventeenth international ACM SIGCHI conference devoted to engineering interactive computing systems and their user interfaces addressing one or more software quality factors, such as usability, user experience, reliability, security, etc.\n\n## Publication\n\nEICS Full Papers and Technical Notes are published as articles in the Journal *Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction* (PACM - EICS series).\n\n## Submission Information\n\nThere are three submission deadlines per year, and authors can choose when to submit. Papers follow the traditional journal model of reviewing: papers may be accepted after submission and review, or may be recommended for revisions and re-submission to the next round.\n\nSubmissions for the journal of this venue should present original and mature research work within the scope of the conference. Note that accepted journal papers can be either regular research papers, or technical notes. Technical Notes are shorter, more focused contributions, that focus specifically on system contributions and technical work.\n\nThere are no length restrictions on Full Papers and Technical Notes, nor any limit to the number of references that may be included. We advise authors to ensure the length of their papers is in function of the contributions. Concise and clear is often to be preferred over lengthy and verbose.\n\nFull Papers and Technical Notes should be written in the ACM format: [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions)\n\nPapers are submitted using [https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions)\n\n## Important Dates\n\nAll dates are AoE (Anywhere on Earth)\n\n### EICS PACM 2025, Round 1\n\n*   **Paper submissions:** July 26, 2024\n*   **Editorial Board assignments:** July 30, 2024\n*   **Reviewer assignments:** August 6, 2024\n*   **Review deadline:** September 9, 2024\n*   **Meta-reviews:** September 12, 2024\n*   **Reviews sent to authors:** September 16, 2024\n*   **Rebuttal deadline:** September 23, 2024\n*   **Final Meta-reviews:** September 27, 2024\n*   **PC Meeting:** October 1, 2024\n*   **Final notification:** October 3, 2024\n\n### EICS PACM 2025, Round 2\n\n*   **Paper submissions:** October 25, 2024\n*   **Editorial Board assignments:** October 28, 2024\n*   **Reviewer assignments:** November 4, 2024\n*   **Review deadline:** November 28, 2024\n*   **Meta-reviews:** December 2, 2024\n*   **Reviews sent to authors:** December 5, 2024\n*   **Rebuttal deadline:** December 12, 2024\n*   **Final Meta-reviews:** December 16, 2024\n*   **PC Meeting:** December 18, 2024\n*   **Final notification:** December 20, 2024\n\n### EICS PACM 2025, Round 3\n\n*   **Paper submissions:** February 14, 2025\n*   **Editorial Board assignments:** February 18, 2025\n*   **Reviewer assignments:** February 25, 2025\n*   **Review deadline:** March 21, 2025\n*   **Meta-reviews:** March 25, 2025\n*   **Reviews sent to authors:** March 27, 2025\n*   **Rebuttal deadline:** April 4, 2025\n*   **Final Meta-reviews:** April 8, 2025\n*   **PC Meeting:** April 10, 2025\n*   **Final notification:** April 14, 2025\n\n## Topics\n\nSubmissions advance the state of the art of the engineering of interactive systems.
