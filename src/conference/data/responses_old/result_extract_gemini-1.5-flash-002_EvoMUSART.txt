  "Call for Papers": "# EvoMUSART 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 14th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Music, Sound, Art and Design (EvoMUSART 2025) will be held in **Trieste, Italy from April 23-25, 2025.**\n\nEvoMUSART brings together researchers working on the application of Artificial Intelligence techniques in creative and artistic fields.\n\n## Areas of Interest\n\nSubmissions should concern the use of Artificial Intelligence techniques (e.g., Evolutionary Computation, Artificial Neural Networks, Artificial Life, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Swarm Intelligence) in the generation, analysis, and interpretation of art, music, design, architecture, and other creative and artistic fields. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\n\n*   **Generation:** Systems that create drawings, images, animations, sculptures, poetry, text, designs, webpages, buildings, etc.; Systems that create musical pieces, sounds, instruments, voices, sound effects, sound analysis, etc.; Systems that create artefacts such as game content, architecture, furniture, based on aesthetic and functional criteria; Robotic-based Evolutionary Art and Music; Other related artificial intelligence or generative techniques in the fields of Computer Music, Computer Art, etc.\n*   **Automation:** Techniques for automatic fitness assignment; Systems in which an analysis or interpretation of the artworks is used in conjunction with artificial intelligence techniques to produce novel objects; Systems that resort to artificial intelligence approaches to perform the analysis of image, music, sound, sculpture, or some other types of artistic object or resource.\n*   **Computer Aided Creativity and Computational Creativity:** Systems in which artificial intelligence is used to promote the creativity of a human user; New ways of integrating the user in the evolutionary cycle; Analysis and evaluation of: the artistic potential of biologically inspired art and music; the artistic processes inherent to these approaches; the resulting artefacts; Collaborative distributed artificial art environments; Contextualisation of creative AI in cultural, economic, social, political or ecological discourse.\n*   **Theory:** Computational Aesthetics, Experimental Aesthetics; Emotional Response, Surprise, Novelty; Representation techniques; Surveys of the current state-of-the-art in the area; identification of weaknesses and strengths; comparative analysis and classification; Validation methodologies; Studies on the applicability of these techniques to related areas; New models designed to promote the creative potential of biologically inspired computation.\n\n## Submission Details\n\nAccepted papers will be presented orally or as posters at the event and included in the evo* proceedings, published by Springer Nature in a dedicated volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Submissions will be rigorously reviewed for scientific and artistic merit. Submitters are strongly encouraged to provide in all papers a link for download of media demonstrating their results, whether music, images, video, or other media types.\n\nThe reviewing process will be double-blind, so please omit information about the authors in the submitted paper and anonymize links for double-blind review.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\n*   Paper submissions must be original and not published elsewhere.\n*   Submissions will be peer-reviewed by members of the program committee.\n*   Submit your manuscript in Springer LNCS format.\n*   Page limit: 14 + unlimited references pages (for EvoCOP check the page limit details)\n*   Submission link: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=evo2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=evo2025)\n*   Student Statement: If the work is student work a statement signed by all the authors should be uploaded acknowledging that is so. [Available here](https://www.evostar.org/2025/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/Model-for-authors-agreement-Outstanding-Student-mentions.docx).\n*   Authors of accepted papers will have to improve their paper on the basis of the reviewers’ comments and will be asked to send a camera-ready version of their manuscripts.\n*   At least one author of each accepted work has to register for the conference, attend the conference, and present the work.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **EvoApps Special Session Proposals:** September 8, 2024\n*   **Submission deadline:** November 15, 2024 AoE (extended)\n*   **Notification to authors:** January 10, 2025\n*   **Camera-ready submission:** January 24, 2025\n*   **Author’s mandatory registration:** February 26, 2025\n*   **Early registration deadline:** March 19, 2025\n*   **Late-Breaking Abstracts submission deadline:** April 13, 2025\n*   **EvoStar Conference:** April 23-25, 2025"
