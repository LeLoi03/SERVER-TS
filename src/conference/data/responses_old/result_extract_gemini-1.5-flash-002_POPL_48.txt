  "Call for Papers": "# POPL 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 52nd ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL 2025) will take place in **Denver, Colorado, from January 19-25, 2025**.\n\n## Scope\n\nPOPL is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.\n\n## Double-Blind Reviewing\n\nPOPL 2025 will use a full double-blind reviewing process. This means that identities of authors will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted papers.\n\n## Evaluation Process\n\nPOPL 2025 will have five Associate Chairs who will help the PC Chair monitor reviews, solicit external expert reviews for submissions when there is not enough expertise on the committee, and facilitate reviewer discussions.\n\nAs in previous years, authors will have a multi-day period to respond to reviews. Responses are optional. A response must be concise, addressing specific points raised in the reviews; in particular, it must not introduce new technical results. Reviewers will write a short reaction to these author responses.\n\n## Submission Site Information\n\nThe submission site is [https://popl25.hotcrp.com](https://popl25.hotcrp.com).\n\nAuthors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline.\n\nThe submission deadline is **11:59 PM July 11, 2024**, anywhere on earth.\n\n## Conflicts of Interest\n\nFor each submission, the authors must make sure that they properly declare all potential conflicts of interest for all of the authors of that submission.\n\n## Submission Guidelines\n\nEach paper should have no more than 25 pages of text, excluding bibliography, using the PACMPL format (specifically, the `acmart` LaTeX class with `acmsmall` option).\n\nSubmitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and the ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent paper submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar forums of publication are not allowed.\n\n## Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers\n\nAuthors of conditionally accepted papers will be invited to formally submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process.\n\n## Copyright, Publication, and Presentation\n\nAs a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support libre open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license.\n\n## Distinguished Paper Awards\n\nAt most 10% of the accepted papers of POPL 2025 will be designated as Distinguished Papers.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Paper submission deadline:** July 11, 2024\n*   **Beginning of Author Response Period:** September 11, 2024\n*   **End of Author Response:** September 20, 2024\n*   **Conditional Accept decisions announced:** October 8, 2024\n*   **Authors of conditional accepted papers send their revised versions:** October 25, 2024\n*   **Final acceptance notifications sent to authors:** November 7, 2024\n*   **Camera ready deadline:** November 22, 2024\n*   **Conference:** January 19 - 25, 2025"
