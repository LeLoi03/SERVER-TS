  "Call for Papers": "# ETRA 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe 2025 ACM Symposium on Eye Tracking Research & Applications (ETRA) will be held in **Tokyo, Japan from May 26 to May 29, 2025**.\n\n## Long Papers\n\nThe symposium presents advances and innovations in oculomotor research, gaze tracking systems, eye tracking applications, gaze-based interaction, and eye movement data analysis. We invite high-quality papers in all areas of eye tracking research and applications and welcome submissions from all domains, including visuomotor neuroscience, perception, and cognition.\n\nPapers must be original and not accepted previously for publication or under review elsewhere. At least one author must register and present accepted work at the conference. Accepted full papers will be published as journal articles in special issues of either PACM CGIT or PACM HCI with the authorsâ€™ choice.\n\n**Required this year:** With burgeoning technological and social applications of eye-tracking research, we now require authors to discuss the potential societal risks that might result from its publication. Authors are required to include a privacy and ethics statement of two to three sentences related to their study findings or new advancements made possible by their developed methods.\n\n## Short Papers\n\nAuthors are also invited to submit original work in a shorter format ([https://etra.acm.org/2025/submissionprocess.html](https://etra.acm.org/2025/submissionprocess.html)).\n\n**Required this year:** With burgeoning technological and social applications of eye-tracking research, we now require authors to discuss the potential societal risks that might result from its publication.
