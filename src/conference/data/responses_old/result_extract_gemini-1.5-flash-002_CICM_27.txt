It offers a venue for discussing problems and solutions in each of these areas and their integration.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nA comprehensive (but not exhaustive) list of topics of interest can be found on the conference website: [https://cicm-conference.org/2025/cicm.php?event=&menu=topics](https://cicm-conference.org/2025/cicm.php?event=&menu=topics)\n\n## Submission Categories\n\nFormal submissions in one of the following categories will be reviewed rigorously, and accepted papers will be published in a volume of Springer LNAI:\n\n*   **Regular papers (up to 15 pages + bibliography):** Present novel research results\n*   **Project and survey papers (up to 15 pages + bibliography):** Summarize existing results\n*   **System and dataset descriptions (4 to 5 pages + bibliography):** Present digital artifacts\n\n## Doctoral Symposium\n\nThe doctoral program provides PhD students a forum to present early results and receive constructive feedback and mentoring. To attend, submissions of two-page abstracts are expected in which the focus and research questions of the expected PhD theses are described; details on completed research tasks and remaining research plans should be given. In addition to these abstracts, a two-page CV of the applicant should also be submitted, detailing background information (name, university, supervisor), education (sought degree, previous degrees), employments, and relevant research experience (publications, attended conferences/workshops).\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Formal submissions**\n    *   Abstract deadline: April 28, 2025\n    *   Full paper deadline: May 5, 2025\n    *   Reviews sent to authors: June 16, 2025\n    *   Rebuttals due: June 20, 2025\n    *   Notification of acceptance: July 4, 2025\n    *   Camera-ready copies due: July 18, 2025\n    *   Conference: October 6-11, 2025\n*   **Doctoral Programme Applications**\n    *   Submission deadline: TBA\n*   **Workshops**\n    *   Workshop proposals: March 31, 2025 (early submissions encouraged)\n    *   Notification: Until April 11, 2025\n\n## Submission Instructions\n\nAll submissions should be made via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm25](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cicm25) using the Springer LNCS style files: [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)\n\nIf software or data is relevant to a paper, a link that provides access to the software/data must be provided to enable reproduction of results.\n\n## Best Papers\n\nCICM 2025 honors the best paper and best student paper with an award.\n\n## Invited Speakers\n\n*   Fabian Huch, Technische Universität München (TUM)\n*   Assia Mahboubi, INRIA, Nantes\n*   Daniele Nantes Sobrinho, University of Brasilia (UnB)\n*   Josef Urban, Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics (CIIRC)\n*   Joint Invited Speaker with LFSA 2025: Temur Kutsia, Research Institute for Symbolic Computation (RISC), Johannes Kepler University\n\n## Organization\n\n*   Conference organization: Mauricio Ayala-Rincón (chair, University of Brasilia, UnB, Brazil)\n*   Programme co-chairs: Peter Koepke (University of Bonn, Germany), Valeria de Paiva (Topos Institute, Berkeley, USA)\n*   Doctoral Program chairs: Marcelo Finger (USP-Sao Paulo), Claudia Nalon (UnB, Brasilia)\n*   Workshop chairs: Edward Hermann Haeusler (PUC-Rio), Thaynara Arielly de Lima (Universidade Federal de Goiás)\n*   Publicity chair: Serge Autexier (DFKI Bremen, Germany)"
