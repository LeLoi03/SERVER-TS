The International Workshop on Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms and Ethics for Governance of Multi-Agent Systems (COINE 2025) will be co-located with AAMAS 2025 in **Detroit, Michigan, USA, from May 19-23, 2025.** ([https://aamas2025.org/](https://aamas2025.org/))

## Overview

The growing pervasiveness of “open systems” raises a range of challenges and opportunities for developing technologies in the area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS). In open MAS, artificial and human autonomous agents, their modes of interaction, and the pursued goal of the system may change over time. The view of coordination and control has to be expanded to consider not only an agent-centric perspective but societal and organization-centric views as well. Moreover, in the case of open multi-agent systems, the autonomy of the agents can work against the effectiveness of the system and of the society. There is therefore a need for tools and techniques for articulating interactions in order to make MAS more effective in attaining collective goals, aligning agent behaviors with shared human values, and more trustworthy, predictable, and understandable for humans.

Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms, and ethics are five key governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. COINE is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series.

## Topics of Interest

We invite submissions that address any of the following aspects:

*   Mathematical, logical, computational, philosophical, legal, and pragmatic issues related to the issues above
*   Modeling, animation, and simulation techniques for open MAS
*   Tools, prototypes, and actual working systems
*   Topics investigating the relationship between COINE and the rapidly evolving AI landscape (e.g., including LLMs and Generative AI)
*   Topics exploring the value-aligned problems within MAS in the COINE domain
*   Experimental investigation of the effectiveness of COINE technologies
*   Challenging or innovative ideas relevant to the field

## Important Dates

*   **Paper submission:** February 25th, 2025 AoE (EXTENDED)
*   **Author notifications:** March 21st, 2025
*   **Camera-ready deadline:** April 22nd, 2025 AoE
*   **Workshop:** May 20th, 2025

CODS 2025, the premier data-centric conference in India, will be held at the **Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, from December 17-20, 2025.**

## Call for Papers: Research Track

We invite submissions of papers describing innovative and original research contributions in data science, data management, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, as well as papers describing the design, implementation, and results of applying these advances to real-world problems.  Papers can range from theoretical contributions to systems and algorithms to experimental research and benchmarking.

We invite two types of submissions:

*   **Archival papers:** 8 pages + 2 pages for references
*   **Non-archival papers:** 2 pages + 1 page references

Papers submitted to the Archival track will undergo a rigorous review process that will judge submissions for the novelty of the described approaches. The goal of the non-archival track is to provide authors with a fast-track route to get feedback for any preliminary ideas that show promising results but do not yet have the maturity to be submitted to the archival track.

Papers accepted in the archival track will appear in the conference proceedings and be published. The publication venue will be announced soon. Papers accepted in the non-archival track will be presented at the conference but not published. Unlike previous years, we will have a single-stage review process this time, i.e., there will not be a rebuttal stage and no option to submit revised papers. Authors of all accepted papers (archival and non-archival) must present their work at the conference.

The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research (CPAIOR 2025) will be held in **Melbourne, Australia, from November 10 to November 13, 2025**. The conference will be co-located with [ICAPS 2025](https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/home/).

## Conference Aim

The aim of the conference is to promote a space where researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Operations Research (OR) present innovative techniques, new applications, and original cutting-edge ideas, thereby encouraging researchers from one area to learn from the others. Of particular interest are papers that integrate concepts and methodologies from these different fields, either proposing interesting new techniques for complex/practical problems or expanding our theoretical insights and cross-field understanding. High-quality original papers from a single area are welcome when also relevant to the other communities involved. The conference also strongly encourages regular papers or experience reports showcasing CP/AI/OR techniques on challenging real-world applications.

## Topics of Interest

The program committee invites submissions that include, but are far from limited to, the following topics:

*   New methodologies in the interface between predictive and prescriptive pipelines
*   Novel relaxation and inference methods
*   New search perspectives
*   Advanced integrated methods
*   Innovative models and applications of CP/AI/OR techniques
*   Implementation or evaluation of CP/AI/OR techniques and optimization systems

## Submission Types

Submissions are of two types:

*   Regular papers (submitted for publication and presentation)
*   Extended abstracts (submitted for presentation only)

## Instructions for Regular Papers

Regular papers present original unpublished work and can be of two types:

*   Long papers (at most 15 pages plus references)
*   Short papers (at most 8 pages plus references)

Both long and short papers will undergo rigorous review and are subject to the same criteria of quality. Both types are also eligible for the distinguished paper or student paper award. Short papers are particularly encouraged for interesting and novel work in progress, for which the practical or theoretical relevance is not yet fully identified.

Submissions to CPAIOR are single blind. The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. All regular papers should be prepared in the format used for that series (LNCS instructions).

## Submission Schedule for Regular Papers

*   **Abstracts:** December 8, 2024 (AoE: anywhere on Earth)
*   **Full papers:** December 15, 2024 (AoE, no extension possible)
*   **Rebuttal Phase:** January 26-29, 2025 (AoE)
*   **Notification:** February 10, 2025
*   **Camera ready:** TBA

## Instructions for Extended Abstracts

Extended abstracts should be one or two pages in length and may present preliminary work or work already published in other outlets. The extended abstracts are submitted for presentation only (if accepted), and will not be formally published in the LNCS conference volume. A collection of the accepted extended abstracts will be published on the conference website.

## Submission Schedule for Extended Abstracts

*   **Abstract:** August 2025 (TBA)
*   **Notification:** September 2025 (TBA)

## Topics of Interest

The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW) is the premier venue for human-centered research in the design, use, and evaluation of technologies that support or affect social, cooperative, and collaborative practices in groups, organizations, communities, and networks.  Topics of interest include:

*   Social and crowd computing
*   CSCW and social computing system development
*   Methodologies and tools
*   Critical, historical, ethnographic analyses
*   Empirical investigations
*   Domain-specific social, cooperative, and collaborative applications
*   Ethics and policy implications
*   CSCW and social computing systems based on emerging technologies
*   Crossing boundaries

## Submission Process Details

CSCW 2025 uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: [https://new.precisionconference.com](https://new.precisionconference.com)

## Paper Guidelines Regarding Scope

Contributions must have a focus on social aspects of technology mediation and be properly contextualized in the CSCW literature, with clear reference to CSCW concepts and/or theories informing, being affected, or being proposed. Papers whose research contributions are primarily of relevance or benefit to individual users will be considered out of scope.  Systems-based or algorithmic research not making explicit how it involves aspects of cooperative, collaborative or social computing are not within the scope of CSCW.

## Anonymous Review Policy

Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed.  Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Images used in the paper must NOT disclose the authors' identity or suggest affiliation.

## Formatting and Length

*   Word authors: Use the old interim ACM Small template ([https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates))
*   LaTeX authors: Use the template at ([https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions)), and insert the acmsmall call.
*   Overleaf authors: Use the template at [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf), and use the acmsmall call.

Papers that use a completely different template will be desk rejected.  Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. If a paper is shorter than 5000 words or exceeds 12,000 words, it will be submitted to additional scrutiny. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be rejected.

## Policy on Use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Other AI Tools

If AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) were used in the writing of the paper beyond a simple grammar check, their use should be acknowledged and described in the text of the submitted version.

## Decisions and Deadlines

CSCW will return submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, roughly 2-4 months from the initial submission (depending on the cycle).

*   **Accept:** Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication.
*   **Minor revision:** Submissions that receive this decision will require some revisions before being accepted for publication.
*   **Major revision:** Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, then re-reviewed.
*   **Reject:** Authors of rejected papers are allowed to resubmit their papers under special conditions.
*   **Desk / Quick Reject:**  Editors will desk reject papers that do not comply with submission requirements.

## Resubmission of Rejected and Withdrawn Papers

Papers in the following categories can be resubmitted at the next submission deadline:

*   Papers that have been desk or quick rejected
*   Papers that got Minor Revisions but missed the resubmission deadline (considered withdrawn)
*   Papers that get rejected after resubmitting Major Revisions

Papers that fall in the following categories must wait an extra deadline to be resubmitted:

*   Papers that get rejected in the first review round
*   Papers that got Major Revisions but missed the resubmission deadline (considered withdrawn)

## Decision Appeal Process

CSCW has implemented a process for authors who wish to appeal a decision. Appeals must be submitted no later than seven days after the decision notification is out. Any appeal submitted after that time limit will not be pursued.

## Primary Research Paradigm

When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be asked to indicate the primary research paradigm of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment.

## Open and Transparent Science

Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods.  Authors are encouraged to use open access repositories and make their data and other material FAIR when appropriate for their work.

## Video Figures

Authors may consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission (no more than three minutes long).

## Presenting at the Conference

Accepted papers are invited to present at the corresponding conference, and authors can choose whether or not they wish to present.

## Review Process

Submissions must not substantially duplicate published work or work that has been submitted in parallel to any other journal or conference/workshop with published proceedings. Additionally, submissions may not be submitted to any other venue unless notified of rejection or withdrawn by the authors. Accepted submissions may not appear in any other conference or workshop that has proceedings.

The review process will consist of two rounds with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee will reject some submissions; the rest will proceed to the second round. At the end of the first round, the authors will be either notified of rejection, or invited to submit a response to questions from the program committee (if any). The authors' response will be used to make the final decision in the second round.

The double-blind review process will follow the IACR Conflict of Interest Policy. The authors will be asked, at submission time, to help identify program committee members with potential conflicts of interest.

## Awards

The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall Best Paper Award. The Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper(s) authored exclusively by students and postdocs (at the time of submission). As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.

## Stipends

Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. A limited number of stipends will be available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Application instructions will be posted together with other registration information.

### Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers

CT-RSA also welcomes systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers. These papers will not be judged on novel research contributions, but on their value to the research community. SoK papers should provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area; support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence; or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate for acceptance.

## Submission Guidelines

For submissions including practical evaluations, it is encouraged (but not required) to make implementations available to facilitate replicability and reproducibility.

Accepted papers (including SoK papers) will appear in the CT-RSA proceedings, published by Springer in its LNCS series.

CT-RSA is scheduled to be an in-person event. It is strongly preferred that authors of accepted papers present their work in person. Exceptions will be made only in the case of serious extenuating circumstances, such as COVID restrictions, visa delays, and other emergencies. The presenter of each paper will be given a free Full Pass to RSA Conference.

## Reviewing Process

DOUBLE-BLIND. This means that the reviewers of the paper won’t get to know the identity of the author(s), and the author(s) won’t get to know the identity of the reviewer. The authors need to ensure that their manuscripts are prepared in a way that DOES NOT GIVE AWAY THEIR IDENTITY to avoid desk rejection. Please follow these guidelines while preparing and submitting your paper:

*   Remove any identifying information, including author names, from the paper title as well as all the file names and document properties.
*   Cite your own relevant papers in the third person, e.g., replace any phrases like “as we have shown before” with “it has been shown before”.
*   Make sure the figures and figure captions do not contain any affiliation revealing your identity.
*   Remove all references to funding sources.
*   Do not include acknowledgment.

## Paper Submissions

Submitted papers should be at most 16 pages in the LNCS format excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices, with a maximum of 20 pages in total. Short papers, no longer than 12 pages in all, are also acceptable. Submissions are NOT anonymous. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, and therefore the paper should be intelligible without them. All submissions must be written in English, and only PDF files will be accepted (a Latex source file will be required for the final version of the accepted papers). The final version of the accepted papers must be in the format required for publications in the LNCS series. Papers that fail to comply with these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Submissions are to be made to the submission web site at: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dbsec2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dbsec2025).

Papers must be submitted by **March 1, 2025 (AoE)**. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. Accepted papers will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. A paper submitted to DBSec 2025 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the time it is being considered for DBSec 2025. Furthermore, after you submit to DBSec 2025, you must await our response before submitting elsewhere.

## Important Dates
