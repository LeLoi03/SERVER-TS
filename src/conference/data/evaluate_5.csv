## Ethical Considerations

Submissions that report experiments with data gathered from human subjects should disclose whether the research received approval from an institutional ethics review board (IRB), if applicable, and what measures were adopted to minimize risks to privacy.

Submissions that describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties (e.g., in case of probing of network devices), and how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software or system vendors or owners before publication.

## Submissions

There are two types of submissions: regular papers and brief announcements.

*   **Regular papers:** must report on original research that has not previously been published (and may not be concurrently submitted to other journals or conferences with proceedings).
*   **Brief announcements:** may describe work in progress or work presented elsewhere.

A paper that is not accepted as a regular paper may be invited as a brief announcement.

## Submission Format

Submissions must be in English in PDF format and they must be prepared using the LaTeX style template for LIPIcs ([https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author)) with `\documentclass[a4paper,anonymous,USenglish]{lipics-v2021}`.

Submissions must be anonymous, without any author names, affiliations, or email addresses. The contact information of the authors will be entered separately in the submission metadata.

For regular papers, there is no page limit, and authors are encouraged to use the “full version” of their paper as the submission. The initial 15 pages, excluding the title page and a table of contents, should contain a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. (Illustrative figures are encouraged.) The submission must contain all necessary details, including full proofs of all claims in the paper.

Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the first 15 pages, excluding the title page and a table of contents, will be read at the committee’s discretion. Papers submitted as brief announcements should comply with the above rules, replacing 15 pages with 5 pages.

Submissions not conforming to the submission guidelines and papers outside of the scope of the conference will be rejected without consideration.

## Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)

The use of LLMs for submission preparation is permitted, although it is highly recommended that they only be used for cosmetic changes, e.g., proofreading of the text. The use of LLMs in technical parts should be treated in the same way as any other software or system, and thus carefully described and documented in the submission.

## Anonymous Submissions

We will use a relaxed implementation of double-blind peer review. Submissions must not reveal the identity of the authors in any way.

## Conflict of Interest

The submission form provides an opportunity to specify conflicts of interest with any of the PC members and other members of the research community.

## Participation at DISC

It is expected that accepted papers and brief announcements be presented in-person at the conference.

## Publication

The proceedings will be published by LIPIcs. Regular papers will have 15 pages in the final proceedings (excluding references), and brief announcements will have 5 pages in the proceedings (including everything). If more space is needed, the authors are encouraged to post the full version e.g., on arXiv and refer to it in their paper.

## Awards

Awards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper."

## Submission

All papers and abstracts should be submitted electronically via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dna31](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dna31)

Papers must be submitted in PDF format.

## Tracks

Authors submitting a paper and/or proposal for a presentation may choose between three submission tracks:

### Track A – Full Paper

For authors who want their full papers to be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings of Informatics (LIPIcs) conference proceedings. Submissions to this track may not be previously published or simultaneously submitted to another conference or journal for publication. The paper is formatted in LaTeX using the LIPIcs-v2021 style.

*   The main text of the paper is limited to 15 pages (excluding the title page or bibliography).
*   An optional technical appendix is permitted (up to 5 pages).

### Track B – One-page abstract with accompanying material

Primarily for authors submitting experimental results who plan to submit to a journal rather than publish in the conference proceedings. For a Track B submission to be considered, it must contain at least 67% (i.e., 2/3) new content, beyond that which has been presented at previous years of the DNA conference, though substantially expanded work previously presented as a poster may be considered. Abstracts for work recently submitted to, or published in, a journal will also be considered.  A one-page abstract and supporting documentation are required.

### Track C – Poster Submissions

For authors interested in presenting their work only in the poster session. The one-page abstract should describe the primary results and their importance. At the discretion of the PC, a small number of high-quality posters may be selected for short (10-minute) presentations at the conference.

The 36th International Conference on Principles of Diagnosis and Resilient Systems (DX’25) will take place in **Nashville, TN, from September 22nd to 24th, 2025.**

## Call for Papers

Until 2023, the focus of the DX workshop series has been on the principles and applications of diagnosis, i.e., identifying root causes for encountered issues and unexpected scenarios, as well as on related techniques, such as prognostics, planning, and control. Moving forward as a conference, we expanded our focus on diagnosis in 2024 to include particularly interesting topics related to resilience, which is the intrinsic ability of a system to sustain its required operations when impacted by expected and unexpected contingencies that were potentially not considered during the system design. We are interested in papers covering resilient design, operational resilience, and related approaches spanning monitoring, anomaly detection, diagnosis, control, planning, and verification of systems.

The annual DX conference is a forum to present state-of-the-art research and experience reports, exchange and discuss emerging ideas, debate current issues, and envision future challenges. Relevant research areas include topics that relate to diagnosis, resilient design, and operational resilience, including but not limited to:

*   Anomaly and fault detection
*   Fault and root cause isolation
*   Prognosis
*   Fault-tolerant, fault-adaptive, and resilient control
*   Reconfiguration, planning, and intelligent decision-making
*   Verification and debugging at design and run-time
*   Explanation, validation, and certification

We welcome evidence-driven position papers, theory papers, experience reports, and papers that span across multiple research and application domains that, in the context, cover digital, logical, analog, mechanical, cyber-physical, biological, ecological, ethical, economical, and social systems and processes. In the 2025 DX edition, we are particularly interested in model-driven and data-driven approaches (including deep learning and LLM-based algorithms) and submissions that combine and/or compare model- and data-driven approaches.

## DX Competition (DXC’25)

The DX’25 organization committee is proud to announce that there will be a DXC’25 competition. The DXC’25 will feature challenges related to solving diagnosis problems in three application domains, where the participants may choose to tackle the challenges of one, two, or all three domains:

*   A combustion engine
*   A steam line system
*   A liquid propulsion rocket engine

## Doctoral Consortium

All PhD students working on relevant topics are encouraged to submit a description of their research to be considered for a special session focusing on mentoring their PhD research.

## Encore Papers

For recent publications in journals and major conferences (e.g., AAAI, IJCAI, ECAI, ISSRE, ICSE, and KR) relevant to DX, we welcome the submission of extended abstracts related to the publication, which must also include a discussion of the connection to DX topics.

## Resubmissions

Papers from venues without archival proceedings (e.g., workshops, ArXiv, etc.) may be resubmitted to DX, but in addition to the requirements for the respective track (full/short/…), there are requirements specific to resubmissions that have to be adhered to.

## Paper Length and Submissions

*   Full papers are limited to 20 pages (including references and appendices) in the Dagstuhl Open Access Series in Informatics format.
*   Short papers must be no longer than 14 pages.
*   Doctoral Consortium submissions must be no longer than 16 pages.
*   Papers describing DXC’25 challenge solutions may be submitted as long or short papers (14-20 pages).
*   Extended abstracts corresponding to Encore Papers must be no longer than 6 pages.
*   Industry-related submissions that do not fall into any other category are limited to 12 pages.

All papers must be submitted electronically via EasyChair as PDF files and must adhere to the submission guidelines as advertised on this conference website. The submissions will be peer-reviewed, and accepted papers will be scheduled for oral or poster presentations. While the authors are encouraged to state their preference in the presentation format at submission time, the decision is at the discretion of the conference chairs.

By submitting a paper, all authors agree that for each accepted paper, at least one of the authors will register for the conference and attend in person (attending the conference virtually is not acceptable). PhD candidates must attend the conference and present their accepted Doctoral Consortium entries. Please note that a registration accounts for one accepted paper only. Exceptions require the organizers’ consent, and for up to one additional paper, an additional fee will be applied to cover publication costs. Please note that the registration fees are not refundable.

The program committee reserves the right to reject without review submissions that exceed the page limits, violate the specified submission guidelines on the conference website, or are submitted in formats other than PDF. All submissions must be made through the conference EasyChair site.

## DX Competition (DXC’25)

The DX’25 organization committee is proud to announce that there will be a DX competition, where the contestants can enter their solutions for addressing diagnosis problems in three benchmarks. The evaluations will be provided before the DX paper submission deadline, so that the contestants can incorporate their results into corresponding papers.

*   The LiU-ICE benchmark covers some challenging problems of fault diagnosis of technical systems.
*   The SLIDe (Steam Line Intrusion Detection) benchmark is devoted to evaluating diagnostic algorithms.
*   The LUMEN (Liquid Upper stage demonstrator Engine) benchmark focuses on the fuel turbopump subsystem of the rocket engine.

For more information about the benchmark, we refer the interested reader to the [DXC’25 repository](https://vehsys.gitlab-pages.liu.se/dx25benchmarks/), where we offer detailed information about the challenges and also about how to enter the competition. Please note that the submission deadline will be April 21st (extended), and we aim to hold office hours where contestants may ask questions about the tracks periodically. Please do not hesitate to contact any of the individual benchmark chairs or the co-chairs for the competition to discuss questions that you might have about the competition. Feedback will be provided around May 1st, so that it can be integrated into your complementing paper submission to the DX conference (deadline May 8th). We would appreciate if you would reach out to us by April 1st about your interest in participating in the competition.

The 26th ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC’25) will take place at **Stanford University, Stanford, CA, from July 7-10, 2025**.

## TL;DR for Seasoned Authors

*   Authors must submit abstracts by February 3 and full papers by February 10.
*   Papers submitted to EC’25 must select one of four methodological tracks and several content areas.
*   New this year: papers that have been submitted to a journal can be submitted to EC as long as they have not been accepted and have not received a request for revision. If they have received a revise and resubmit they CANNOT be submitted to EC.
*   EC’25 is continuing the forward-to-journal option as in previous years.
*   EC’25 is currently planned as a primarily in-person event.

## Policy for Accepted Papers

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend and present the paper. Exceptions will be made in rare cases such as severe illness, visa denial, or a death in the family. In approved instances, authors will have the opportunity to present their work in the online preview week, either live or self-recorded. The presentation time will be 18 minutes.

## Submission Instructions

*   Submit a Paper: [https://ec2025.hotcrp.com/](https://ec2025.hotcrp.com/)
*   The body of the submission (excluding the title page and the bibliography) may be up to 18 pages long.
*   Authors will be required to format their submissions using the [EC’25 LaTex style files](https://ec25.sigecom.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ec25-submission-style-files.zip), which uses a single-column format with 10-point font. Papers that do not use the EC’25 LaTex style files or violate the page limit may be rejected without review.

## Tracks

Each submission must select one of four tracks that differ along methodological dimensions:

*   **Theory:** Typical papers in this track make progress on existing theoretical problems, propose new ones, or introduce significant new techniques that could be applied more broadly.  Track chairs: Nima Haghpanah, Annie Liang, Ruta Mehta, Mallesh Pai, Grant Schoenebeck
*   **Applied Modeling:** Typical papers in this track propose and analyze novel models that capture real-world phenomena or provide fresh perspectives on previously studied applied problems. Track chairs: Nick Arnosti, Eduardo Azevedo, Sigal Oren
*   **Empirics:** Typical papers in this track draw significant insights from real or synthetic data, through access to new data sources or experiments, or through novel analysis of existing data sources or experiments. Track chairs: Chiara Farronato, Denis Nekipelov
*   **AI:** Typical papers in this track apply the methods and models of artificial intelligence, including both theoretical and computational approaches, to topics at the intersection of economics and computing. Track chairs: Annie Liang, Grant Schoenebeck, Nisarg Shah

## Areas

Each submission must select at least one content area from the list provided below.  Content areas will be used to match papers with a member of the Senior Program Committee (SPC) who is assigned to at least one of the paper’s areas. SPCs are responsible for shepherding papers through the review process and for making accept/reject recommendations to the Track and Program Chairs.

*   Agent-based modeling
*   Algorithmic fairness and data privacy
*   Auctions and pricing
*   Behavioral economics and bounded rationality
*   Blockchain and cryptocurrencies

## Alternative Venues

We will ask the authors to specify alternative venues to which they would consider submitting the paper.

## Review Process

Each paper will be reviewed in detail by at least two referees. There will be two stages of review, with some decisions announced on March 27 after first-round reviews, and the remaining decisions announced on May 17 after a second round of reviews. Between April 22-25, authors of papers undergoing second-round reviewing will be able to submit responses to the reviews, which will be taken into account by the review team.

The review process is double blind.

## Submission of code and data

In the interest of reproducibility, authors are strongly encouraged to submit their code and data, if any. Such material should be archived as a single zip file and submitted as supplementary material.

## One-page extended abstract option

To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper.

## Submission of publicly available work

It is acceptable to submit work that has been presented in public (provided there are no published proceedings) or has been uploaded to arXiv or similar online archives, provided the submission itself is anonymized.

## Simultaneous submissions to journals

It is acceptable to simultaneously submit a paper to EC’25 and to a journal, or to submit a paper that is already under review at a journal as long as the paper (a) has not been accepted by the journal, and (b) has not received a request for a revision (revise and resubmit, major or minor revision) by the journal.

## No other simultaneous submissions

The following submissions are not allowed: (a) papers that are currently under review at another archival conference, (b) papers that have been accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference before the EC’25 submission deadline, (c) papers in which one or more of the contributions have previously been published or accepted for publication in a journal or archival conference.

## Highlights beyond EC

Papers that have already been published (or have been accepted for publication) in conferences or journals other than EC can be nominated (including self-nominations) for inclusion in a special plenary session at EC’25 called “Highlights beyond EC”.

## Forward to journal

As in prior years, authors of accepted papers will have the option to select the forward-to-journal option to have the reviews forwarded to a journal of their choice.  Our partner journals are:

## Abstracts – Talks and Posters

We invite abstracts for research that is topical to bioinformatics and computational biology, which is in progress (unpublished) or previously published within the last 18 months for consideration for oral and/or poster presentation.

Your abstract should be submitted to the Communities of Special Interest (COSI) or Open Session Track that most accurately reflects the area of the work. (You will have the option to identify two other tracks that may also be suited to your research area during your submission). You can learn more about COSIs [here](https://www.iscb.org/communities-of-special-interest).

*   Talks and posters are organized according to scientific topics covered by the COSIs and open sessions listed below.
*   Abstracts are not limited to COSI and open session topics. If the topic falls outside the listed COSIs you can choose the ""General Computational Biology"" area.
*   Your abstract should convey a scientific result and should not be an advertisement for any commercial software package.
*   Multiple presentations of the same talk as an oral presentation are not permitted. Research may be presented as both a talk and a poster if and only if submitted as two individual submissions with two different presenters. Having the same person deliver two (or more) different talks is NOT PERMITTED on the same topic. A presenting author may present NO MORE THAN ONE talk or poster on the same topic.
*   ISCB strongly prefers that scientific research accepted for oral presentation be presented in-person at the conference venue.  Remote presentation options will be granted for reasons such as maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. If your research is accepted for oral presentation and you are unable to present in person, ISCB requires notification at the time of acceptance and no later than May 15, 2025. If unable to participate in person you will need to request a waiver by writing to [presentationwaiver@iscb.org](mailto:presentationwaiver@iscb.org).
*   Any pre-approved virtual presenters will be required to provide a pre-recorded talk for the virtual platform library in advance of the conference.
*   ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models ([https://www.iscb.org/iscb-policy-statements/iscb-policy-for-acceptable-use-of-large-language-models](https://www.iscb.org/iscb-policy-statements/iscb-policy-for-acceptable-use-of-large-language-models))

The 21st European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) will be held in **Koblenz, Germany, from June 10-11, 2025**, as part of STAF 2025 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations).

ECMFA is the premier European forum dedicated to advancing the state of knowledge and fostering the application of all aspects of MBE and related approaches.  Its focus is on engaging the key figures of research and industry in a dialog that will result in stronger and more effective practical application of MBE, hence producing more reliable software based on state-of-the-art research results.

## Call for Papers

We are soliciting papers presenting original research on all aspects of model-based engineering. Two types of submissions are possible:

*   **Foundation Papers:** dealing with modeling foundations, such as metamodeling, model transformations, model validation, verification and testing, model engineering methods and tools, and related aspects.
*   **Application Papers:** dealing with the application of modeling techniques, including experience reports on the use of MBE methods and tools, industrial case studies, or successful applications of MBE practices in industry or in public administration, with significant modeling lessons learned. All applications must have been done in real contexts and at least one of the authors of the paper must be from the company or administration where the application took place.

## Submission Process

Submissions must conform to the JOT LaTeX template ([https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip](https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip)) and must not exceed 14 pages (including figures, references, and appendices). Secondary studies may use 2 additional pages for references only. Failure to conform to these guidelines may result in disqualification of the paper. No simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed; any concurrent submission will be deemed as a serious breach of scientific ethics, resulting in the immediate rejection of the paper and appropriate action will be taken.

All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through EasyChair ([link to be published](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=staf2025)).

## Topics of Interest

*   Foundations of MBE, including model transformations, domain-specific languages, verification and validation approaches, etc.
*   Novel paradigms, formalisms, applications, approaches, frameworks, or processes for model-based engineering such as low-code/no-code development, digital twins, etc.
*   Interplay between MBE with and for AI-based systems.
*   Application of MBE methods, tools, and techniques to specific domains, e.g., automotive, aerospace, cyber-physical systems, robotics, Artificial Intelligence or IoT.
*   Successful use of MBE in connection with other disciplines and approaches, such as Artificial Intelligence, DevOps, Open Source, or Safety Assurance.
*   Educational aspects of MBE.
*   Tools and initiatives for the successful adoption of MBE in industry.

## Review Criteria and Process

The program committee will assess all papers for novelty, significance, technical quality, rigor, and suitability for the conference. Contributions can be submitted to any of the two submission periods. In both rounds, each submitted paper can be recommended by the Program Committee to be accepted-as-is, accepted with minor revisions, undergo major revisions, or rejected.

## Artifacts

Artifacts are recommended but not required, for the initial submission. Depending on the papers, reviewers may take the existence of artifacts as a positive signal about the work. Also, depending on the papers, artifacts may be required as a condition for publication.

## Publication

All accepted papers will be published as platinum open-access journal publications in JOT. At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.

ECOOP 2025 will be held in **Bergen, Norway, from June 30 to July 4, 2025.**

ECOOP is Europe’s longest-standing annual Programming Languages conference, bringing together researchers, practitioners, and students to share their ideas and experiences in all topics related to programming languages, software development, systems and applications. ECOOP welcomes high-quality research papers relating to these fields in a broad sense.

## Tracks

*   Technical Papers
*   Artifact Evaluation
*   Colocated Events & Workshops
*   Doctoral Symposium

## Call for Papers: Technical Papers

ECOOP solicits innovative solutions to real problems as well as evaluations of existing solutions. Authors are asked to pick one of the following categories:

*   Research
*   Replication
*   Experience
*   Pearls/Brave New Ideas

## Submissions

Submission must not have been published, or have major overlap with previous work.  Proceedings are published in open access by Dagstuhl LIPIcs in the Dagstuhl LIPIcs LaTeX-style template. To reduce friction when resubmitting, ACM’s PACMPL and TOPLAS formatted papers can be submitted as such (with the understanding that if accepted, they will be reformatted).

ECOOP uses double-anonymous reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must omit author names and institutions, and use the third person when referencing the authors’ own work.

There is no page limit on submissions, but authors must understand that reviewers have a fixed time budget for each paper, so the length of the feedback is likely to be unaffected by length. Brevity is a virtue. Authors also have to consider that the camera-ready version must be (at most) 25 pages in LIPIcs format (not including references).

## Important Dates

All deadlines are AoE (UTC-12h).

The 23rd EUSSET Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (ECSCW 2025) will take place from **June 30th to July 4th, 2025 in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK**.

ECSCW is a single-track conference that contributes to developing an interdisciplinary and global community, supported by EUSSET, the European Society for Socially Embedded Technologies. The conference format facilitates critical discussion across disciplinary and national borders in the field.

## Call for Conference Papers

We invite researchers and practitioners to submit Conference Papers to the EUSSET CSCW 2025. With Conference Papers, authors have the opportunity to publish concise and focused empirical or conceptual studies to support progress in a specific sub-domain of CSCW. This category is similar to last year’s Notes category.

This could include, but is not limited to, the following:

*   A new methodology for designing or examining CSCW technologies
*   Insights from the implementation of an IT system supporting collaboration
*   First experiences and insights from the use of a new system supporting collaboration
*   A case study of collaborative technology in a domain not typically studied in CSCW research
*   A discussion or unfolding of new CSCW theory

We look forward to previously unpublished, concise, and insightful submissions that make substantive progress in a field of CSCW and can benefit from presentation and discussion at the EUSSET CSCW conference. If you are submitting a Conference Paper on accessibility or assistive technology, please refer to the SIGACCESS guidelines on writing about disability. If you have a provocative, challenging idea that still needs more shaping and discussion, you might want to consider Exploratory Papers instead.

## Submission Format and Process

While the length of Conference Papers is flexible, we expect they will be no longer than 6,000 words without references. Longer versions should be justified (using the specific text field on EasyChair). All authors must follow the Conference Papers template available in [Latex](https://ecscw.eusset.eu/2025/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ECSCW-2025-Submissions-Template.zip) (Overleaf template), [RTF](https://ecscw.eusset.eu/2025/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ECSCW-2025_Template.rtf), or [MS Word](https://ecscw.eusset.eu/2025/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ECSCW-2025_Template.doc) format. Submissions should be in PDF format and must be ANONYMIZED. Conference Papers submissions will undergo a double-blind, single-round peer review.

Submissions will be selected for presentation based on the opinions of the reviewers. No shepherding or additional rounds of reviews are planned.

The 37th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS 2025) will be held in **Brussels, Belgium, from July 8–11, 2025**.

ECRTS is the premier European venue in the area of real-time systems and, alongside RTSS and RTAS, ranks as one of the top three international conferences on this topic.

## Scope and Topics of Interest

Papers on all aspects of timing requirements in computer systems are welcome. Systems of interest include not only hard real-time systems but also time-sensitive systems in general (e.g., systems with soft requirements expressed in terms of tail latency, latency SLAs, QoS expectations, etc.). Typical applications are found not only in classical embedded and cyber-physical systems, but also increasingly in cloud or edge computing contexts and often stem from domains such as automotive, avionics, telecommunications, healthcare, robotics, and space systems, among others.

To be in scope, papers must address some form of timing requirement, broadly construed. Prospective first-time authors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with works accepted in past editions of the conference, which are publicly available at [drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS).

ECRTS welcomes theoretical and practical contributions (including tools, benchmarks, and case studies) to the state of the art in the design, implementation, verification, and validation of time-sensitive systems. We particularly encourage papers on industrial case studies and the application of real-time technology to real systems. We welcome practical contributions even without novel theoretical insights or formal proofs, provided they are of interest to the research community and/or industry. Whenever relevant, we encourage authors to present experimental results (preferably based on real data, but synthetic test cases are acceptable when adequately motivated).

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   all elements of time-sensitive SOFTWARE SYSTEMS
*   COMPUTER HARDWARE design and hardware/software integration for embedded systems
*   REAL-TIME NETWORKS
*   REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS
*   foundational SCHEDULING and PREDICTABILITY questions
*   static and dynamic techniques for RESOURCE DEMAND ESTIMATION
*   MACHINE LEARNING techniques in safety-critical systems
*   FORMAL METHODS for the verification and validation of real-time systems
*   SECURITY aspects of real-time systems
*   the interplay of timing predictability and other NON-FUNCTIONAL QUALITIES

## Open Access

All accepted papers will be published as open-access proceedings in collaboration with LIPIcs (Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics). Once published, the proceedings of ECRTS 2025 will be publicly accessible at [drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS).

## Paper Submission

Submitted manuscripts are limited to 20 pages of technical content, excluding the bibliography. Every accepted paper must be presented by one of the authors at the conference.

ECRTS papers follow the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics paper template. You can download the [LIPIcs template](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author) and see the typesetting instructions here.

To submit a paper to ECRTS, please carefully review and follow the [submission instructions and guidelines](https://www.ecrts.org/submission-instructions/).

## Double-Blind Peer Reviewing

ECRTS will follow a double-blind peer reviewing process. Authors will submit blinded manuscripts (that do not reveal author identity or affiliation), and reviewers will not be made aware of author identities.

## Shadow Peer Review Process

For the first time this year, ECRTS will offer the authors a Shadow Technical Program Committee (TPC) option. The Shadow TPC is designed to train future reviewers by providing them with hands-on experience in the paper review process.

## Artifact Evaluation

To improve the results’ reproducibility and encourage reuse, authors of accepted papers with a computational component will be invited to submit their code and/or their data to an optional artifact evaluation process.

## Important Dates

*   **Submission deadline:** February 28, 2025 (Firm)
*   **Notification:** April 21, 2025
*   **Camera-ready deadline:** May 16, 2025
*   **Early registration deadline:** June 13, 2025

The Eurographics Symposium on Parallel Graphics and Visualization (EGPGV) aims to foster the exchange of experiences and knowledge on leveraging and defining new trends in parallel graphics and visualization. This area is important due to the widespread availability of multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and cluster systems.

EGPGV 2025 will take place on **June 2, 2025**, and will be co-located with EuroVis 2025, held **June 2 to June 6, 2025, in Luxembourg City, Luxembourg**.

## Topics of Interest

EGPGV seeks papers on graphics and visualization that involve parallel computing and/or focus on very large data sets. Papers on techniques, data structures, algorithms, systems, and applications are welcomed. Parallel computing includes high-performance computing and cloud environments, (multi-)GPU computing and heterogeneous, hybrid architectures, and shared and/or distributed memory architectures. Further, papers focused on processing very large data sets (either for visualization or graphics) are welcomed, even if they do not have a particular focus on parallelism.

Typical symposium topics include:

*   Computationally and data-intensive rendering
*   Scientific visualization (e.g., volume, flow, and tensor visualization)
*   Machine learning as applied to parallel graphics, visualization, and/or large data analytics
*   Information visualization and visual analytics
*   In situ analytics and in situ visualization
*   Out-of-core processing of large data sets for visualization or graphics
*   Simulations for virtual environments (physics-based animation, collision detection, acoustics)
*   Mesh processing, level-of-detail, and geometric methods
*   Visual computing (image- and video-based rendering, image processing and exploitation, segmentation)
*   Scheduling, memory management, and data coherence
*   Parallelization approaches and algorithms, such as MapReduce
*   Database-related methods, algorithms or approaches, and query-based visualization
*   Advanced hardware for data handling or visualization
*   Large and high-resolution displays, virtual environments
*   Scientific, engineering, and industrial applications
*   Data analytics on large scientific data sets

In general, appropriate topics for the symposium fall into one of four categories:

1.  parallel graphics,

The Educational Data Mining Conference 2025 (EDM 2025) will be held in **Palermo, Italy, from July 20-23, 2025**.

## Theme

New Goals, New Measurements, New Incentives to Learn: In a world where AI can excel and outperform humans in many cognitive tasks, educational systems need to reconsider their goals from the ground up. As AI is expected to reshape the labor market, the social mechanisms that have shaped students’ incentives to learn may diminish or, at the very least, change. This presents an opportunity, and perhaps even a necessity, for communities like EDM to help learners of all ages find their own voices and take greater responsibility for their learning journey. Reshaping goals and priorities would also require developing new ways to measure learning gains and processes to include more complex constructs, like critical thinking, creativity, and the ability to evaluate and incorporate new information.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   Developing new techniques for mining educational data
*   Bridging EDM research and learning sciences
*   Actionable advice rooted in educational data mining research, experiments, and outcomes
*   Evaluating the efficacy of curriculum and interventions
*   Domain Knowledge Modeling
*   Educational Recommenders, Instructional Sequencing, and Personalized Learning
*   Equity, Privacy, Transparency, and Fairness
*   Human Factors, Transparency, and Explainability
*   Learner Cognitive and Behavior Modeling and its association with performance
*   Learner Knowledge and Performance Modeling
*   Comparing Human and Artificial Intelligence
*   Learning Analytics
*   Social and Collaborative Learning
*   Reproducibility
