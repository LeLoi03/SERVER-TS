FDG 2025 will be held in **Graz, Austria, from April 15-18, 2025**, with a one-day excursion to Vienna on April 15th.

## Theme: Accessible Worlds, United Through Play

This theme underscores the vital role of gaming in fostering inclusive communities, strengthening work of diverse groups, and making games and gaming accessible for all. Works addressing this theme could look at the creation of accessible gaming environments, enhancing connectivity among varied gaming communities, and promoting equitable, interdisciplinary and sustainable collaboration in game development, game design, and game studies. The conference theme extends to diversity, equity and inclusivity in both the gaming experience and its creation, and we encourage papers that investigate these aspects in broad terms.

## Paper Submissions

FDG invites authors to submit papers reporting new research. Authors may submit either full papers (typically up to ten pages in length, excluding references and appendices), or short papers (up to six pages, one column or four pages, two columns in length, including references).  The length of these submissions should be commensurate with contribution of the paper, in the judgment of reviewers; papers that are significantly longer than recommended page limits without clear justification (e.g., significant use of images) may be desk rejected. Note that reviewers are not required to read material in appendices during the peer-review process; full papers should not exceed 20 pages including appendices.

This year FDG is also providing the option for “Abstract Only” submissions. Accepted abstracts will not be published in the conference proceedings, but abstract authors will be given an opportunity to give an oral presentation of their work at the conference.

Submissions are handled using the FDG 2025 EasyChair system: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fdg2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fdg2025).

## ACM Open Access Fees

This year, ACM has implemented a new system whereby authors are required to pay open access fees (called an Article Processing Charge).  Many institutions have funding available to cover publication costs such as this. If your institution lacks such funding, and all paper authors also lack grant/gift funding to cover such fees, the Foundations of Digital Games conference can reimburse you for these fees.  For 2025 ACM is providing a subsidy on APC pricing for ICPS, as follows:

*   The 2025 subsidized APC rate for ICPS papers will be $350.
*   For papers where any of the authors is a member of ACM, the APC rate will be $250.
*   For ICPS papers whose corresponding author is based in a lower-middle-income country, the APC rate will be $175.
*   For ICPS papers whose corresponding author is based in a lower-middle-income country and where any of the authors is a member of ACM, the APC rate will be $125.
*   For ICPS papers whose corresponding author is based in a low-income country, no APC is required.

The subsidized pricing will apply to all papers that are processed through the ACM eRights system from 12:00 noon (US Eastern time) on March 6, 2025.

The 28th Forum on Specification and Design Languages (FDL 2025) is an international event where academics and industrials exchange their results, experiences, advances, and new trends related to languages, tools, and techniques for developing software and hardware systems.  The conference will be held in **Schloß Rheinfels, St. Goar, Germany, from September 10-12, 2025**.

## Scientific Areas

FDL is based on the four following non-limiting scientific areas:

*   **Languages:** Domain-specific languages for software, execution platforms, allocations environment, contracts, abstractions, and refinements are of interest, together with the associated design methods, frameworks, and tools.
*   **Semantics:** Formal definitions, compilers, interpreters, typing, abstraction/refinement are of interest, together with the underlying specification frameworks or new approaches for their specification, modeling, and model transformation.
*   **Verification and Analysis:** Innovative static analysis, testing, debugging, model checking, machine learning-based analysis, or design space exploration are of interest, together with the underlying models, tools, and frameworks.
*   **Simulation:** Innovative simulation techniques, virtual prototypes, digital twins, collaborative simulation, hybrid simulations, or runtime abstraction/refinement are of interest with special attention on the efficiency and correctness of simulations and their underlying tools and frameworks.

## Topics of Interest

Cross-fertilization between the above areas, in particular in the context of system engineering, is of great interest. Topics include, but are not limited to:

*   Languages and formalisms in model-based system design for modeling, testing, verification, and simulation
*   Languages for knowledge representation about system designs
*   Models of computations considering concurrency and time like dataflow computing, synchronous and functional languages, event-based languages, etc.
*   Modeling languages and tools for modeling (cyber-)physical environments or networks
*   Formal methods and languages for modeling, specification, and verification
*   System design for modern hardware architectures like multi/manycore processors, and heterogeneous platforms, accelerators including GPUs and FPGAs
*   High-level hardware and software synthesis, virtual prototyping, and design space exploration
*   Modeling and programming languages for smart contracts and distributed ledger technologies
*   Case studies from typical application areas like healthcare, automotive, Industry 4.0, etc.

## Paper Categories

The following categories of papers are presented orally at the conference and will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore:

*   **Research Papers:** Original papers with clear research contributions and evaluation (8 pages plus references)
*   **Special Session Papers:** Call for organizing special sessions on a specific topic (2-page session proposals). Papers within the special session follow the same peer reviewing and publishing process as for research papers (8 pages plus references).
*   **Wild-and-Crazy-Idea Papers:** Papers with well-explained fundamentally new ideas without rigorous evaluation (4 pages plus references)
*   **Tool Papers:** Papers about new tools, their methods, and successful case studies (6 pages plus references). Tool papers may not describe new research ideas, and rather present on a solid implementation of existing methods that are made publically available to the community.
*   **Work-in-progress Extended Abstracts:** Submission of 2-page papers (extended abstracts) describing ongoing work where final results are not yet available but where potential solutions are already mature enough to be discussed at the conference.

## Ph.D. Forum Extended Abstracts

Submission of 2-page papers (extended abstracts, single blind) about planned and ongoing work on Ph.D. theses that can be discussed at the conference.

## Formatting and Submission Guidelines

Authors should submit papers in double columns, IEEE format as PDF through the submission system. All submitted papers must describe original, unpublished work, and must not be under consideration for publication elsewhere.

*   Initial submissions are double-blind (to avoid initial bias), but author names become available to reviewers during discussion and before the final decision.
*   Submissions must be clearly tagged to determine the submission category by using the `\IEEEspecialpapernotice` keyword.
*   Please submit your paper via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fdl2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=fdl2025)

## Camera Ready for IEEE Xplore Proceedings

The deadline for the submission of the final version of the paper is July 19, 2025.

## Review Process

FPL 2025 uses a double-blind reviewing system. Manuscripts must not identify authors or their affiliations; those that do will not be considered. References to the authors' prior work should be made in the third person in the same way one would reference work by others, with adequate anonymization to preserve double-blind reviewing. Authors can utilize tools like Anonymous GitHub to anonymize repositories if needed.

Authors guarantee that submitted papers are original and unpublished. Submissions cannot be under review or accepted elsewhere nor substantially similar to papers being considered for other conferences, journals, or workshops unless previously presented at venues without archived proceedings.

All potential conflicts of interest must be disclosed during submission, including all authors and program committee members. Conflicts include, but are not limited to, instances within the last five years where you co-authored a publication, shared funding, or had an overlapping institutional affiliation. Failure to disclose conflicts or falsely declaring conflicts to manipulate the review process may result in rejecting the submission."

## Double-Anonymous Review Process

In order to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, the FSE 2025 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process.

## Submission Policies

The authors must follow the “ACM Policy on Authorship” released April 20, 2023, and its accompanying FAQ, including the following points:

*   Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work.
*   If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.

## Open Science Policy

The 31st Fast Software Encryption Conference (FSE 2025) will take place in **Rome, Italy, on March 17-21, 2025.**  FSE 2025 is organized by the **International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR)**.

## General Information

The scope of FSE concentrates on fast and secure primitives for symmetric cryptography, including the design and analysis of block ciphers, stream ciphers, encryption schemes, hash functions, message authentication codes, (cryptographic) permutations, authenticated encryption schemes, cryptanalysis and evaluation tools, and security issues and solutions regarding their implementation.

Since 2017, FSE also solicits submissions for Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. These papers aim at reviewing and contextualizing the existing literature in a particular area in order to systematize the existing knowledge in that area.

## Publication Model

From 2017, FSE has moved to an open-access journal/conference hybrid model. Submitted articles undergo a journal-style reviewing process. Accepted papers are published in Gold Open Access (free availability from day one) by the Ruhr University of Bochum in an issue of the newly established journal IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology (ToSC).

The yearly FSE event will consist of presentations of the articles accepted to the journal IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology as well as invited talks and social activities. This new model has been established as a way to improve reviewing and publication quality while retaining the highly successful community event FSE.

## Stipends

Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration waived. A limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students whose papers are accepted and who will present the paper themselves are encouraged to apply if such assistance is needed. Requests for stipends should be sent to the General Chairs.

The 33rd International Symposium on Graph Drawing and Network Visualization (GD 2025) will be held in **Norrköping, Sweden from September 24-26, 2025**. A pre-conference PhD school will take place on September 22-23, 2025.

## Papers

We invite authors to submit papers describing original research of theoretical or practical significance to graph drawing and network visualization. To promote a balanced coverage of the field, GD has two distinct tracks, and papers submitted to one track will not compete with papers submitted to the other track. Regular papers must be submitted explicitly to one of the two tracks. However, all program committee members may review papers from either track.

### Track 1: Combinatorial and algorithmic aspects

This track is mainly devoted to fundamental theoretical graph drawing advances, such as combinatorial and algorithmic aspects. Topics include (but are not limited to):

*   Design and analysis of graph drawing algorithms
*   Geometric and topological graph theory
*   Computational topology of graphs on surfaces
*   Graph representations
*   Geometric advances and computing in graph drawing
*   Combinatorics and optimization in graph drawing

### Track 2: Experimental, applied, and network visualization aspects

This track is mainly devoted to the practical aspects of graph drawing, such as experimental evaluations of graph drawing related algorithms, the development and/or evaluation of related libraries and tools, or systems and interfaces in different application areas. Topics include (but are not limited to):

*   Engineering of graph drawing algorithms and network visualization systems
*   Interfaces, methods, and high-quality tools for interacting with graphs and networks
*   Benchmarks and experimental studies in the context of graph drawing and network visualization
*   Cognitive studies on network visualization aesthetics and user interaction
*   Visualization of networks in real-world applications
*   Machine learning methods in graph drawing & network visualization
*   Graph drawing & network visualization for AI explainability

Authors of accepted applied papers are encouraged to show a demo of their software/system during the poster session.

### Short Papers

In addition to the above two tracks, there will be a separate category for short papers. Here we welcome smaller and less elaborate contributions on relevant topics.

## Remote Presentation

For authors who cannot present their paper in person, we offer the possibility for remote presentation, which must be declared at submission time. Authors of accepted papers in this category have to register for the conference. Papers in this category are evaluated and selected by the program committee by applying the same high standards as for the other tracks. In addition, the authors have to submit a recording of their presentation two weeks after the submission of the paper. The remote submission chair can influence the score of papers in this track based on the quality of the recorded talk and even reject submissions if the quality of the recorded talk is inappropriate. There is a limit of six remote presentations.

## Posters & Contest

Submissions of posters on graph drawing, network visualization, and related areas are solicited. The poster session will provide a forum for the communication of late-breaking research results (which may also appear elsewhere) to the GD community. Authors of posters should prepare an abstract that must be submitted together with the poster itself. Each submission will thus consist of two PDF files (the abstract and the poster).

Details about the traditional Graph Drawing Contest, which is held at the conference, are provided at the [website](https://mozart.diei.unipg.it/gdcontest/2025/).

## Rules for Submission

*   Results that have been previously published (or are scheduled for publication) in another conference proceedings or journal, as well as simultaneous submissions of results to other conferences with published proceedings or journals are not permitted, except for poster submissions.
*   With the exception of remote presentations, each paper or poster must be presented at the conference by an author, otherwise the paper can be excluded from publication in the proceedings.
*   ChatGPT and similar large language models may be used to improve the paper’s language, but its use should be mentioned as a footnote and the authors remain responsible for the full paper. In particular, the unattributed use of any such tools in the creation of the paper’s scientific content is forbidden.

## Submission Format

The proceedings will be published in the LIPIcs series. Submissions have to be prepared in accordance with the [LIPIcs author instructions](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author).

*   For the submission, the use of the LaTeX class file [gd-lipics-v2.cls](../../assets/template/gd-lipics-v2.cls) is requested.
*   Submissions must not exceed the following limits:
    *   500 lines for full papers
    *   225 lines for short papers
    *   80 lines for posters’ abstracts
*   The above limits do not include front matter (title, authors, and affiliations), references, or appendices.
*   In addition, the main content of the paper must not exceed the following page limits excluding references:
    *   15 pages for long papers
    *   7 pages for short papers
    *   3 pages for posters’ abstracts

## Paper Submission, Proceedings, and Special Issues

Papers should be submitted electronically via [Easychair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=gd2025).

The proceedings will be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series and are available open access. Selected papers from both tracks will be invited for submission to a special issue of the Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications (JGAA). The authors of two selected papers in Track 2 will be invited to submit a substantially extended and enhanced version of their work to IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG).

## Lightweight Double-Blind Review Process

The review process will be handled in a lightweight double-blind mode. This means that authors are not allowed to reveal their identity in the submitted paper, but are free to disseminate draft versions of the paper prior to the conference and to give talks on the topic as they normally would.

## Awards

For each of the two tracks, the Program Committee of GD 2025 will bestow a Best Paper Award. In addition, to recognize the effort of participants to present their work and to prepare their posters in a clear and elegant way, there will be a Best Presentation Award and a Best Poster Award voted on by the GD 2025 attendees.

All deadlines are understood to be 23:59 AoE.

The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2025 will be co-located with the 2025 International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) and the 2025 International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH) in **Singapore from October 12-18, 2025**.

The Haskell Symposium presents original research on Haskell, discusses practical experience and future development of the language, and promotes other forms of declarative programming.

## New This Year

In addition to the regular Call for Papers track, there is a separate Call for Talks track.

## Call for Talks

Talk proposals need not be full-length and should report work in progress relevant to Haskell language design, theory, tools, or applications. Talk proposals will be evaluated by the PC for novelty and relevance to the Haskell community, but are not expected to include finished results. Talk proposals will not be distributed to attendees, but authors of talk proposals may provide links to materials to be included on the program.

## Call for Papers

Topics of interest include:

*   **Language design:** with a focus on possible extensions and modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the status quo;
*   **Theory:** such as formal semantics of the present language or future extensions, type systems, effects, metatheory, and foundations for program analysis and transformation;
*   **Implementations:** including program analysis and transformation, static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and distributed architectures, memory management, as well as foreign function and component interfaces;
*   **Libraries:** that demonstrate new ideas or techniques for functional programming in Haskell;
*   **Tools:** such as profilers, tracers, debuggers, preprocessors, and testing tools;
*   **Applications:** to scientific and symbolic computing, databases, multimedia, telecommunication, the web, and so forth;
*   **Functional Pearls:** being elegant and instructive programming examples;
*   **Experience Reports:** to document general practice and experience in education, industry, or other contexts;
*   **Tutorials:** to document how to use a particular language feature, programming technique, tool or library within the Haskell ecosystem;
*   **System Demonstrations:** based on running software rather than novel research results.

## Submission Details

The tentative submission deadline is **September 15, 2025**. Detailed information will be released closer to the deadline.

## Formatting

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines. Authors should use the `acmart` format, with the `sigplansub` format for ACM proceedings. For details, see: [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format)

It is recommended to use the `review` option when submitting a paper; this option enables line numbers for easy reference in reviews.

## Lightweight Double-blind Reviewing

Haskell Symposium 2025 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:

1.  Author names and institutions must be omitted, and
2.  References to authors’ own related work should be in the third person.

## Page Limits

*   Regular paper: 12 pages
*   Functional pearl: 12 pages
*   Tutorial: 12 pages
*   Experience report: 6 pages
*   Demo proposal: 2 pages

There is no requirement that all pages are used. In all cases, the list of references is not counted against these page limits.

## Deadlines

*   **Paper submission:** June 9, 2025 (Mon)
*   **Notification:** July 17, 2025 (Thu)

Deadlines are end of day Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12).

## Submission

Submissions must adhere to SIGPLAN’s republication policy, and authors should be aware of ACM’s policies on plagiarism. Program Committee members are allowed to submit papers, but their papers will be held to a higher standard.

Papers should be submitted through HotCRP at: [https://haskell25.hotcrp.com/](https://haskell25.hotcrp.com/)
