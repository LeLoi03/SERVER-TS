*   **Conference dates:** January 7-10, 2025

## Submission Instructions

Authors should register and submit their paper via the [hotcrp submission site](https://itcs2025.hotcrp.com/) by the above strict deadlines. The font size should be at least 11 point, and the paper should be single column. Beyond these, there are no formatting requirements. Authors are required to submit a COI declaration upon submission.

## Review Process

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. (Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.)

## Prior, Simultaneous, and Subsequent Submissions

Results published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS. Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed. Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences.

## Online Posting

Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the arXiv, the ECCC, or the Cryptology ePrint archive. It is generally expected that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers, with proofs, available before the conference begins.

## Accepted Papers

All the talks are expected to be in person. The talks in the conference will not be recorded, and instead, the authors of each paper will be asked to upload a 20-25 minute talk, which will be posted online.

## Graduating Bits

Participants near to graduation (on either side) will be given an opportunity to present (in 2-3 minutes) their results, research, plans, personality, and so on during the ""Graduating bits"" session. Details on how to participate will be provided closer to the conference date.

## Awards

The committee may award a ""best student paper"" award.

## Code of Conduct

ITCS is committed to an inclusive conference experience, respectful of all participants, and free from any discrimination or harassment.

## Proceedings

The accepted papers will be published by LIPIcs in the electronic proceedings of the conference.

The symposium is a premier international conference dedicated to advancing research and applications in biomedical imaging.","# ISBI 2025: Call for Academic Software Demos

The International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2025) will be held from **April 14–17, 2025 at the Hyatt Regency Houston Downtown in Houston, TX, USA**.

## Call for Academic Software Demos

We welcome proposals for in-person demos of academic, open, free, and non-commercial software. The software may or may not be directly associated with accepted ISBI 2025 papers and abstracts, but should still have relevance to accepted ISBI 2025 work. The academic demo sessions of ISBI 2025 will aim to showcase recent developments in the field, software used in ISBI 2025 papers, all relevant to the ISBI community. This will be an opportunity for presenters to perform live demos of their code/software while interacting with conference attendees face-to-face. Note that these demos are separate from ISBI’s commercial booths.

## Demo Guidelines

Demos should focus on open science, reproducible research, clinically-translational work, and soft skills development. Demos should provide material for all levels of expertise, including students, early career scientists, professionals, and clinical users. Demos should primarily focus on the (relatively mature) tools developed by the presenters rather than results.

### Demo Format

All accepted demos will be in-person in an assigned conference hall during the main conference. Each demo will be provided with a small table, power outlet, wireless (shared) Internet, and a monitor during its assigned time slot. Submissions should list all other supporting equipment that will be needed per demo, so the conference committee may do their best to arrange them. Demo presenters are expected to bring their own laptops/PCs as needed for their demo.

### Demo Fee

There will be a $140 fee for the demo package (table, poster board, screen, power connection) to be paid upon registration. This fee must be paid by the presenter of the relevant paper the demo is attached to, who will be attending the conference, in addition to their conference attendee fee.

### Demo Proposal

Proposals should be no more than one (1) page in 12-point font submitted as a single PDF file. Demo proposals should contain the following sections:

*   Title, brief topic overview, and brief expected learning outcomes. All titles must have the prefix “Demo:”
*   One “representative image”
*   Relevance to ISBI community
*   List any GitHub or otherwise public software related URLs
*   Target audience
*   Presenter information (not included in page limit)

### Important Dates

All deadlines are 11:59 pm USA (PST)

*   **Demo proposals due:** February 24, 2025
*   **Accept/Reject notification:** February 28, 2025
*   **Deadline to submit any update on requested materials needed:** March 7, 2025

## Submission

In submitting a paper, the authors warrant that should the paper be accepted, the final paper will be prepared in time for inclusion into the published proceedings and that one of the authors will attend the conference and present the paper. The proceedings will be published after the conference – we endeavor to submit to IEEE Xplore; the committee reserves the right to withdraw any paper from the proceedings that is not presented at the conference.

The conference will consist of a mix of oral and poster sessions. No distinction will be made between the two types of presentation in the proceedings: authors may request the type of presentation they consider most appropriate for their paper; however, the final decision will be made by the program committee.

See the submission page [here](https://ecs.wgtn.ac.nz/Events/IVCNZ2025/CallForPapers).

## Submission Guidelines

Each submission (in any category) must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template, specified in the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines ([https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)). All papers will be reviewed by at least three members from the program committee. If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to attend the workshop in-person with an author registration and present the paper for it to be published in the ICST 2025 workshop proceedings.

### Full and Short Papers

We invite submissions for full papers (up to 10 pages, including references) as well as short papers (up to 4 pages, including references). Accepted papers in these two categories – full and short – will be part of the proceedings of IWCT 2025.

### Journal-First

The aim of the Journal-First (JF) submission category is to further enrich the program of IWCT, as well as to provide an overall more flexible path to publication and dissemination of original research that is within the scope of IWCT. A submission in this category must adhere to the following criteria:

*   It should be clearly within the scope of the workshop.
*   It should be recent: it should have been accepted and made publicly available in a journal (online or in print) by January 1, 2023, or more recently.
*   It has not been presented at, and is not under consideration for, Journal-First tracks of other conferences or workshops.
*   The submission has to be in the form of a 2-page extended abstract and has to provide a concise summary of the published journal paper.

### Posters

In addition to the traditional program topics from the past years, we offer a low-threshold opportunity – especially targeting industry – to present activities within the scope of the workshop to the participants of IWCT. A tool demonstration can be given alongside a poster.

## Important Dates (AoE (UTC-12h))

*   **Submission deadline (all categories):** January 10, 2025
*   **Notification:** February 3, 2025
*   **Camera-ready submission (all categories):** March 8, 2025

For the first time, JSSPP will be a two-day event.","# JSSPP 2025: Call for Submissions

The 28th Workshop on Job Scheduling Strategies for Parallel Processing (JSSPP 2025) will be held in conjunction with the 39th IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS'2025) from **June 3-4, 2025 in Milan, Italy**.

JSSPP welcomes Regular Papers (RP), as well as descriptions of Open Scheduling Problems (OSP) and Workload Traces (WT) coming from interesting scheduling domains.

## Call for Regular Papers (RP)

JSSPP solicits regular papers that focus on challenges in parallel scheduling, including but not limited to:

*   Design of new scheduling approaches.
*   Performance evaluation of scheduling approaches, including methodology, benchmarks, and metrics.
*   Fulfilling additional constraints in scheduling systems, like job priorities, price, energy requirements (Green Computing), accounting, load estimation, and quality of service guarantees.
*   Impact of scheduling strategies on system utilization, application performance, user-friendliness, cost efficiency, and energy efficiency.
*   Scaling and architecture of very large scheduling systems.
*   Operational challenges: Capacity planning, service level assurance, reliability.
*   Interaction between schedulers on different levels (e.g., processor vs cluster) and tenancy domains (single and multi-tenant)
*   Interaction between applications/workloads, e.g., efficient batch job and container/Pod/VM co-scheduling within a single system, etc.
*   Experience reports from large-scale compute production systems.
*   GPU/Accelerator (co)scheduling.
*   AI/ML-inspired scheduling approaches.

## Call for Workload Traces (WT)

JSSPP welcomes papers introducing workload traces from workloads of real systems that offer challenges in the context of this workshop. These submissions should include:

*   Anonymized (if needed) workload artifacts that describe a significant share of individual units of resource scheduling (jobs, pods, VMs, functions, etc.) during a period of life in a parallel computing system.
*   A description of the parallel system running these workloads.
*   An analysis of the traces, modeling key workload features and highlighting scheduling challenges in their hosting systems.

We ask submitters to employ known workload description languages (e.g., SWF) to represent their traces or to attach schemas that allow interpreting them. The submission of artifacts that model the workloads is also encouraged.

## Call for Open Scheduling Problems (OSP)

JSSPP welcomes papers describing open problems in large-scale scheduling. We believe that clearly described real-world scheduling problems will help both the industry and the scientific communities to bridge the gap that often prevents the adoption of newly proposed scheduling techniques in practice.

Submissions must include a concise description of the key metrics of the system and how they are calculated, as well as anonymized data publication of the system workload and production schedule. Ideally, anonymized operational logs would also be published, though we understand this might be more difficult.

## Submission Format

Paper formatting requirements are the same for Regular Papers, Workload Traces, and OSP-related submissions. Papers should be no longer than 20 single-spaced pages, 10pt font, including figures and references. All submissions must follow the LNCS format. See the instructions at Springer's website: [http://www.springer.com/lncs](http://www.springer.com/lncs) or in the [Submission section](index.php?page=submission).

All papers in scope will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.

The 22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR 2025) will take place in **Melbourne, Australia, from November 11-17, 2025**.

## Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) is a well-established and vibrant field of research within Artificial Intelligence. KR builds on the fundamental thesis that knowledge can often be represented in an explicit declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated symbolic reasoning engines. This enables the exploitation of knowledge that would otherwise be implicit through semantically grounded inference mechanisms. KR has contributed to the theory and practice of various areas of AI, including agents, automated planning, robotics, and natural language processing, and to fields beyond AI, including data management, semantic web, verification, software engineering, computational biology, and cybersecurity.

The KR conference series is the leading forum for timely, in-depth presentation of progress in the theory and practice of the representation and computational management of knowledge.

## Call for Papers

KR 2025 solicits papers presenting novel results on the principles of KR, which clearly contribute to the formal foundations of the field or show the applicability of KR techniques to implemented or implementable systems. We welcome papers from other areas that demonstrate clear use of, or contributions to, the principles or practice of KR. We also encourage ""reports from the field"" of applications, experiments, developments, and tests.

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions are limited to fifteen (15) single-column letter-size pages in Springer LNCS format ([http://www.springer.com/la/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](http://www.springer.com/la/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)). This page limit includes figures and references, but it does not include an optional appendix. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be placed in the appendix, which will be read by the program committee members at their discretion. In particular, appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.

The conference employs a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Papers should be submitted electronically via the EasyChair submission system at [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=latin2024](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=latin2024).

Simultaneous submission of papers to any other conference with published proceedings, as well as the submission of previously published papers, is not allowed. Papers must be written in English. For each accepted paper, at least one author must register and attend the symposium (in person) to present it. Moreover, an author cannot register for multiple papers. That is, each accepted paper must have its own registrant."
