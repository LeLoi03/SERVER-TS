The Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management. The 2025 conference will be held in **Berlin, Germany**.

## Mission

The PODS community aims to provide a solid scientific basis for data management, developing solutions that ensure high levels of efficiency, scalability, usability, expressiveness, robustness, security, clarity, and privacy.

## Scope

PODS seeks scientific articles that present contributions to modeling, application and system building in the context of data management. At a time when computer science is increasingly data-centric, PODS pays special attention to those papers that help in the urgent process of integrating data management techniques within broader computer science.

## Topics of Interest

Topics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to:

*   Database processing: Query evaluation, query optimization, schema management, distributed data processing, approximate data processing
*   Database design: Data models, query languages, schemas, constraints
*   Database access: Data structures, access methods, concurrency, transactions
*   Data quality: Data consistency, data cleaning, data discovery, data exploration
*   Data analysis: Data mining, machine learning, information extraction, data streams
*   Uncertainty: Incomplete data, inconsistent data, probabilistic data
*   Interoperability: Mappings and views, data integration, data exchange, ontology-based data access
*   Responsible data management: Access control, privacy, security, verification, ethical aspects of data management
*   Human-database interaction: data summarization, data visualization, explanation for database queries
*   Connections between database principles and other disciplines

## Submission

*   Submission Site: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025)
*   Format: ACM ""acmsmall"" proceedings stylesheet
    *   `\documentclass[acmsmall,review,anonymous]{acmart}`
    *   A submission can be up to **15 pages**, not including references, plus unlimited space for references.
    *   Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, of unlimited length, that should be incorporated at submission time; online appendices are not allowed.
    *   Papers that are longer than 15 pages or do not cohere with the required format style risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
*   Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms and accepted papers will be published in a PODS 2025 issue of the PACMMOD (https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod) journal.
*   PODS will apply a double-blind reviewing process.

## Double-anonymous reviewing

Submissions must adhere to the following:

*   Author names and institutions must be omitted.
*   References to the authorsâ€™ own related work should be in the third person.
*   Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed.

## Merit-based acceptance

*   The paper selection will be merit-based.
*   The program committee will judge the work based on originality, quality, clarity of presentation, relevance to the field, and technical depth.
