## Doctoral Consortium

The aim of the Doctoral Consortium is to provide a framework for students to present their ongoing research work, meet other students and researchers, and obtain feedback on lines of research for the future.

## Submission

All proposed papers must be submitted in electronic form (PDF format) using the DCAI conference management system: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dcai25](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dcai25)

## Review Process

All submitted papers will undergo a thorough review process; each paper will be refereed by at least three experts in the field based on relevance, originality, significance, quality, and clarity.

## Publication

Accepted papers will be included in DCAI Proceedings. At least one of the authors will be required to register and attend the symposium, where they will present the paper, this will allow for its inclusion in conference proceedings. All the accepted papers will be published by Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems series of Springer Verlag.
