This stage of the review process will be double-blind. We will strive to have all other submissions receive a total of at least three reviews.

### Review Cycle II

The revision of each conditionally accepted paper will be reviewed by its coordinator, who will make a final recommendation regarding acceptance. Should the conditions for acceptance not be met, the paper will be rejected.

The 25th WABI Conference on Algorithms in Bioinformatics will be held at the **University of Maryland, in College Park, MD, USA, from August 20 - 22, 2025**.

WABI is an international conference covering research in algorithmic work in bioinformatics, computational biology, and systems biology. The emphasis is mainly on discrete algorithms and machine learning methods that address important problems in molecular biology, that are founded on sound models, that are computationally efficient, and that provide evidence of their potential usefulness in practice, preferably by testing on appropriately chosen simulated or real datasets. The goal is to present recent research results, including significant work-in-progress, and to identify and explore directions of future research.

The committee can decide to split the awards over multiple papers, or not to offer an award. Papers eligible for the best student paper can have non-student co-authors, but the main work in a paper that is a candidate for the best student paper award must be done by co-authors that were students at the time of submission, and the award can be received only by such co-authors. It must be indicated at the time of submission whether a paper is a candidate for this award."
