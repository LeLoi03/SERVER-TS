## Topics

AAAI-25 welcomes submissions reporting research that advances artificial intelligence, broadly conceived. The conference scope includes machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, multiagent systems, knowledge representation, human-in-the-loop AI, search, planning, reasoning, robotics and perception, and ethics.

In addition to fundamental work focused on any one of these areas, we expressly encourage work that cuts across technical areas of AI (e.g., machine learning and computer vision; computer vision and natural language processing; or machine learning and planning), bridges between AI and a related research area (e.g., neuroscience; cognitive science), or develops AI techniques in the context of important application domains, such as healthcare, sustainability, transportation, and commerce.

## Tracks

*   Main Technical Track
*   Special Track on AI for Social Impact
*   Special Track on AI Alignment

The 16th Annual Meeting of the Asian Association for Algorithms and Computation (AAAC 2025) will take place on **May 31 and June 1, 2025**, at the **City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.**

We invite submissions of abstracts presenting original research or surveys of existing results in theoretical computer science. The meeting is a face-to-face event, and at least one author of each submission is expected to register and give the talk at the venue.

## Topics

All areas of theoretical computer science, especially design and analysis of algorithms and complexity theory.

## Submissions

Authors are invited to submit one-page (A4) abstracts (in pdf format) that can be based on original results or surveys of existing results of authors. Informal working notes including the one-page abstracts will be distributed at the meeting, which does not prevent any form of future publication of the same work. All submissions should be made electronically through the EasyChair Conference System: [https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=aaac2025](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=aaac2025)."
