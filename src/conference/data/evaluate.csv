## Special Tracks

In addition to the Main Research Track, we invite authors to consider the following special tracks:

*   **BlueSky (up to 8 pages):** Papers that present visionary ideas, long-term challenges, and research opportunities that are outside of the current mainstream topics in the field.
*   **Dataset/Tool (up to 5 pages):** Papers that present a novel curated dataset, a novel synthetic dataset generation process, or the design and implementation of a novel tool incorporating previously proposed research and technologies.
*   **Systematization of Knowledge (up to 12 pages):** Papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge in a relevant area to our community.
*   **Work in Progress (up to 5 pages):** Papers that present early-stage research problems and results that might not be fully developed.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Submissions must be in PDF format using ACMâ€™s double-column ""sigconf"" template ([https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions)).
*   No more than 10 pages long, excluding up to 2 pages of bibliography and well-marked appendices.
*   All submissions must be anonymous.
*   All submissions must contain a significant original contribution.
*   At least one author from each accepted paper must register for the conference prior to the camera-ready deadline and is expected to present it in person at the conference (remote presentations are possible only in exceptional cases).

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract Submission Deadline:** March 31, 2025
*   **Paper Submission Deadline:** March 31, 2025
*   **Author Notification:** April 28, 2025
*   **Conference Dates:** July 8 - 10, 2025
