The Thirty-Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25) will be held in **Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the Pennsylvania Convention Center from February 25 to March 4, 2025**.

The purpose of the AAAI conference series is to promote research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and foster scientific exchange between researchers, practitioners, scientists, students, and engineers across the entirety of AI and its affiliated disciplines.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) such as ChatGPT are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis.
*   AAAI’2025 furthermore follows AAAI policy that any AI system, including Generative Models such as Chat-GPT, BARD, or DALL-E, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers published by AAAI and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in papers published by AAAI.
*   Authors assume full responsibility for content, including checking for plagiarism and veracity of all text.

## Tracks

*   Main Track
*   AI for Social Impact
*   AI Alignment

## Important Dates

Note: all deadlines are “anywhere on earth” (UTC-12)

*   **July 8, 2024:** AAAI-25 web site open for paper submission

## Review Criteria

All submissions will be rigorously evaluated by expert reviewers to assess whether the contributions of the paper are substantive enough to warrant publication in AAAI.

The contributions may be theoretical, methodological, algorithmic, empirical, integrative (connecting ideas and methods across disparate subfields of AI), or critical (e.g., principled analyses and arguments that draw attention to fundamentally wrong choice of goals, assumptions, or approaches).

## Special Tracks

*   **AI for Social Impact:** Submissions to this track will be reviewed according to a rubric that emphasizes the fit between the techniques used and a problem of social importance, rather than simply rewarding technical novelty.
*   **AI Alignment:** This track is motivated by the fact that as we begin to build more and more capable AI systems, it becomes crucial to ensure that the goals and actions of such systems are aligned with human values.

## Overview

ACL 2025 invites the submission of long and short papers featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. ACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and by the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.

Papers submitted to ACL 2025, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics.

## Submission Topics

ACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas (in alphabetical order):

*   Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics
*   Dialogue and Interactive Systems
*   Discourse and Pragmatics
*   Efficient/Low-Resource Methods for NLP
*   Ethics, Bias, and Fairness
*   Generation
*   Human-Centered NLP
*   Information Extraction
*   Information Retrieval and Text Mining
*   Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP
*   Language Modeling
*   Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics
*   Machine Learning for NLP
*   Machine Translation
*   Multilinguality and Language Diversity

### Special Theme: Generalization of NLP Models

ACL 2025 will have a new theme with the goal of reflecting and stimulating discussion about the current state of development of the field of NLP: Generalization of NLP Models.

The possible topics of discussion include (but are not limited to) the following:

*   How can we enhance the generalization of NLP models across various dimensions—compositional, structural, cross-task, cross-lingual, cross-domain, and robustness?
*   What factors affect the generalization of NLP models?
*   What are the most effective methods for evaluating the generalization capabilities of NLP models?
*   While Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhance the generalization of NLP models, what are the key limitations of LLMs in this regard?

## Submission Details

*   Long Papers: (8 pages)
*   Short Papers: (4 pages)
*   Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers’ comments.

## Review Process

ACL 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference.

## Submission Instructions

Submit your Regular Paper via OpenReview: [https://openreview.net/group?id=acmmm.org/ACMMM/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=acmmm.org/ACMMM/2025/Conference)

## Multimedia/Multimodality Policy

The SIGMM community seeks to distinguish itself from other communities such as NeurIPS, CVPR, and ECCV. Our focus lies in promoting research that is inherently multimedia or multimodal in nature. While papers that involve unimedia/unimodal processing will not necessarily be rejected, papers that make multimedia/multimodal research contributions will be preferred for publication in the conference proceedings. Out-of-scope submissions may be desk-rejected.

## Paper Format

Submitted papers (.pdf format) must use the ACM Article Template ([https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)).

## Policy on Authorship and Generative AI Tools

Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work.

## Length

Submitted papers may consist of up to 8 pages. Up to two additional pages may be added for references. The reference pages must only contain references. Overlength papers will be rejected without review. Optionally, you may upload supplementary material that complements your submission (50Mb limit).

## Blinding

Paper submissions must conform with the “double-blind” review policy. This means that the authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the names of the authors.

## Originality

Papers submitted to ACM Multimedia must be the original work of the authors. They may not be simultaneously under review elsewhere.

## Hard Topic Theme: Automated Detection and Patching of Software Vulnerabilities

This year's hard topic theme solicits research results and technologies that advance our ability to automatically identify and fix software security vulnerabilities.

## Submission Types

*   **Technical Papers:** We solicit papers offering novel contributions in any aspect of applied security. Papers are encouraged on results that have been demonstrated to be useful for improving information systems security and that address lessons learned from the actual application. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with proceedings. Please ensure that your submission is a PDF file of a maximum of 11 pages, excluding well-marked references and appendices limited to 5 pages. Committee members are not required to read the appendices.
*   **Case Studies:** The Case Studies in Applied Security Track is a critical part of the technical conference. It is an opportunity for professionals to share information that is current without writing a detailed technical paper, but enables attendees to learn about the next generation of products and solutions. It is open to anyone in the community such as vendors, network providers, systems integrators, government civil/federal/military programs or users across the spectrum of computer security applications.
*   **Panels:** Panels should encourage audience participation and focus on the sharp edges of a topic where there is controversy or where there are widely varying positions. A typical panel proposal should list the moderator, three panel members and an abstract of the proposed topic.
*   **Posters:** The poster session provides an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present their new and innovative preliminary work in an informal, interactive setting. Conference attendees can learn about novel on-going research projects that might not yet be complete, but whose preliminary results are already interesting.
*   **Works in Progress:** The Works in Progress (WiP) session offers short presentations (5 minutes maximum) of ongoing work. These presentations highlight the most current work in both business and academia, emphasizing goals and value added, accomplishments to date, and future plans. Special consideration is given to topics that discuss real-life security experience, including system implementation, deployment, and lessons learned.
*   **Workshops:** ACSAC workshops are on up to date topics that attendees usually rate to provide a useful and exciting forum for information technology professionals (e.g., standards developers, software developers, security engineers, security officers) to exchange ideas, concerns, and opinions.
*   **Artifacts Competition:** This competition invites the submission of applied cybersecurity artifacts that have been published in previous years in academic or industry venues. In particular, the competition aims to identify previously published applied security artifacts that have demonstrated meaningful impact for the security and privacy research communities.
*   **Student Conferenceships:** ACSAC offers conferenceships to enable students to attend the conference. This program will help pay for some of the cost to attend ACSAC.

## General Submissions and Speaking Proposals

ACSAC does not accept ""speaking proposals"" per se; however, you are encouraged to submit suggestions in the form of a one paragraph description of a topic and a biography of the proposed presenter. Depending on a proposal's technical content, it may be acceptable as a case study. If a full paper is available, it may be acceptable as a technical paper. If a presentation by a group of related speakers is contemplated, a proposal for this session may be acceptable as a panel. If a proposal for a half day or full day seminar is appropriate, it may be acceptable as a professional development course. If a one or two page technical write-up is available that describes work that is not yet completed, it may be acceptable as a poster. Finally, if your have an interest in a full day interactive dialogue, exchanging ideas, opinions and concerns between multiple presenters and attendees, consider being a workshop presenter.

The 16th International Conference on Ambient Systems, Networks, and Technologies (ANT 2025) will be held in **Patras, Greece, from April 22-24, 2025**.

ANT 2025 is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results, and practical development experiences from all Ambient Systems, Networks, and Technologies-related areas.

ANT 2025 will be held in conjunction with the 8th International Conference on Emerging Data and Industry (EDI40).

## Scope

Ambient systems can be viewed as interconnected systems that exist anywhere and everywhere in the environment. These systems are able to work together in the network collaboratively or competitively to provide human users with their daily technological needs, during which these systems remain invisible. This concept has emerged as a major research area with many potential applications. This is because of the multi-disciplinary nature of the themes required such as ubiquitous and pervasive computing, artificial intelligence, networks and communications, data science, Internet of Things, Smart Entities, etc.

## Publication

All ANT 2025 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series online.

Procedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect ([www.sciencedirect.com](http://www.sciencedirect.com/)), and will be freely available worldwide.

All papers in Procedia will be indexed by:

*   Scopus ([www.scopus.com](http://www.scopus.com/))

## Instructions for Authors

Submissions must be done via the HotCRP website. The link will be announced shortly before the paper deadline.

*   ACNS 2025 will be an in-person conference. Authors submitting a paper must ensure that one of the authors can present the paper at the conference in person.
*   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published (other than preprint) or accepted for publication or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings.
*   ACNS encourages promising students to submit and present their results at the conference.

### Submission Guidelines

*   Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references.
*   Each submission must begin with a title, short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader.
*   All submissions must be submitted in PDF format, following the unmodified LNCS format and typeset using the corresponding LaTeX class file.
*   They must fit within a page limit of 20 pages, including title and abstract, figures, etc., but excluding references.
*   Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following the main body of the paper; however, reviewers are not required to read or review any supplementary material, and submissions are expected to be intelligible without it.

## Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)

ACNS 2025 solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. We encourage the authors to distinguish SoK submissions by adding the “SoK:” prefix to the title.

## Conflicts of Interest

The program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and program committee members to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest.

## Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure

Where research identifies a vulnerability, we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. It is the committee’s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days to 90 days ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.

## Diversity and Inclusion

ACNS is committed to promoting diversity and inclusion in our community. If you have suggestions, concerns, or complaints related to biases or sexual harassment, we encourage you to reach out to the Conference Co-Chairs.

We encourage authors to be mindful of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing.

## Paper Submission (Proceedings Track)

The proceedings track is the standard AISTATS paper submission track. Papers will be selected via a rigorous double-blind peer-review process. All accepted papers will be presented at the Conference as contributed talks or as posters and will be published in the Proceedings.

## Formatting and Supplementary Material

Submissions are limited to 8 pages excluding references using the LaTeX style file we provide below (the page limit will be 9 for camera-ready submissions). The number of pages containing only citations and the reproducibility checklist is not limited. You can also submit a single file of additional supplementary material which may be either a pdf file (such as proof details) or a zip file for other formats/more files (such as code or videos). Note that reviewers are under no obligation to examine the supplementary material.

## Anonymization Requirements

The AISTATS review process is double-blind. All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any information that can violate the double-blind reviewing policy, such as the author names or their affiliations, acknowledgements, or links that can infer any author’s identity or institution. Self-citations are allowed as long as anonymity is preserved.

## Dual Submissions

Submitted manuscripts should not have been previously published in a journal or in the proceedings of a conference, and should not be under consideration for publication at another conference at any point during the AISTATS review process. Submissions as extended abstracts (4 pages or less), to workshops or non-archival venues (without a proceedings), or to arXiv, will not be considered a concurrent submission.

## Use of Large Language Models and Image Deep Generative Models

Regarding the use of Large Language Models (LLMs like GPT-4) and/or large image deep generative models (image DGMs such as StableDiffusion) for AISTATS submissions:

LLMs and image DGMs are not allowed for the following use cases:

*   Fully automatically generating text of more than one page, unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis.
*   Generating quantitative figures (such as learning curves), unless the produced images are presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis."

## Submission Format

We invite submissions of three different formats:

1.  Original Research Papers
2.  Abstract-based Presentations
3.  Industry Demonstrations

### (1) Original Research Papers

We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of NLP and CL.

*   Long papers should be 7-8 pages
*   Short papers should be 3-4 pages.
*   Both short and long papers may include unlimited pages of references.

Accepted papers will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site.

*   Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly, submitted papers should not include the identity of the author(s).
*   Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.

### (2) Abstract-based Presentations

To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialization of international results, we invite 1-2 page presentation abstracts. The organizers may offer the opportunity to give an oral or poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site.

Submissions should include the presentation title and abstract, the name of the presenter, any publications relating to the work, and any information on collaboration with the local ALTA community.

Abstracts will not be published in the proceedings but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent, and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged.

### (3) Industry Demonstrations

To encourage industry participation and networking opportunities, we are thrilled to announce a track for industry demonstrations, which provides an exciting opportunity for industry researchers to showcase their NLP applications. You should submit a proposal that is 1-2 pages long, containing (1) a description of the software, tools or applications that will be presented and how NLP techniques are used to address a specific problem and (2) a brief introduction of your organization. The proposals will be reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to select demonstrations that best align with the interests of the ALTA community.

## Multiple Submission Policy

Original research papers under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We require that you declare at submission that your paper has been submitted to another venue and identify the venue.

## Paper Submission

Authors should [submit their papers via OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ALTA.asn.au/2024/Workshop) using the ‘‘ALTA 2024 Workshop Submission’’ button.
