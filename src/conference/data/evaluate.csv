The 2nd International Workshop on Methodological Issues with Empirical Studies in Software Engineering (WSESE 2025) will be co-located with ICSE 2025 in **Ottawa, Canada, from April 27th to May 3rd, 2025**.

## Theme and Goals

With the steep increase in empirical studies and the advent of secondary studies that aggregate their results, a main concern is their quality. The workshop’s aim is to increase awareness of the importance of quality and appropriateness in the methods applied during the different stages of software engineering empirical studies to yield reliable results and to disseminate this knowledge to the broader SE community. This year, there is a special emphasis on Machine Learning (ML).

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

*   Issues with the motivation and definition of appropriate research questions.
*   Issues with the operationalization, e.g., missing standard metrics.
*   Issues with the systematic identification of threats to validity and how to address them.
*   Issues selecting an appropriate study design and the consequences of that selection.
*   Issues with drawing appropriate conclusions from the findings and generalizing them.
*   Issues with aggregating results from individual studies.
*   Issues with reproduction, replication, or families of studies.
*   Issues with quantitative, qualitative approaches and combined approaches.
*   Issues with understanding failures and successes: lessons learned.

## Paper Categories

*   **Technical papers (6-8 pages including references):** formally describe studies, explain how they were designed and executed to overcome challenges, highlight concrete results, and describe any advances to the state-of-the-art.
*   **Experience reports / Work in progress (4-6 pages including references):** describe the experience in conducting studies and lessons learned that address methodological issues.
*   **Vision / Position papers (2-4 pages including references):** describe new directions in conducting empirical studies including convincing arguments supported by clear rationale.
*   **Panel proposals (1-2 pages including references):** discuss hot topics about conducting empirical studies.

Papers must describe original work that has not been submitted to or presented at other forums (although the studies described may have been). Accepted papers will be published in the ICSE workshop proceedings.

## Submission Information

Submissions will be made via HotCRP. Papers must be formatted according to [ICSE 2025 guidelines](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2025/icse-2025-research-track#submission-process). Please note that WSESE does not follow a double-anonymous review process.

## Important Dates (AoE, UTC-12h)

## Symposium Topics

Refereed paper submissions are solicited in all areas relating to systems research in security and privacy. This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; USENIX Security is interested in all aspects of computing systems security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to security or privacy of computing systems, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.

## New Topics: Meta-science in Security and Privacy

Meta-science, or the study of scientific research itself, aims to enhance the efficiency, quality, and outcomes of research activities in our community. Submissions in this broad topic should focus on evaluations of research practices, replicability/reproducibility, ethics, research methodologies, data transparency, and peer-review processes.

## Replication and Reproduction

Contributions to this sub-topic should primarily consist of studies that verify, refute, or refine prior technical results or widely-held beliefs. We encourage submissions that not only replicate studies but also offer meta-analyses that assess the replicability of research. Additionally, while replication studies often replicate original findings, we also value novel investigations into why certain studies fail to replicate. Papers that critically examine the conditions under which replication is feasible, or those that propose innovative methods to enhance the reliability of scientific findings, are especially welcome.

## Systematization of Knowledge

USENIX Security solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers.

## Research Ethics

Authors of all submissions must consider and discuss the ethics of their work.

## Open Science

This year, USENIX Security introduces a new open science policy, aiming to enhance the reproducibility and replicability of scientific findings: Authors are expected to openly share their research artifacts by default.

## Artifact Evaluation

Artifact evaluation will take place in two phases.

## Conference Attendance and Publishing Accepted Papers

Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented during the Symposium and published in the Symposium Proceedings. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it.

Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.

## The Character of Onward! Papers

Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

## Selection Process

Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double-blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.

Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright.

## Instructions for Authors

For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.

Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.

## Submission Site

[https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/](https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/)

## Concurrent Submissions

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.

## Policy on Double Blind Review

Onward! 2025 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review.

## Policy on Authorship Changes

Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair.

## Format

Submissions should use [ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format, sigplan sub-format](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/) and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.

## Page Limit

To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self-contained. If the paper is accepted, the final submission will be limited to 17 pages.

## Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference.

## Important Dates

AoE (UTC-12h)

*   **Submission deadline:** April 24, 2025
*   **First-round notification:** June 6, 2025
*   **Revised submission deadline:** July 17, 2025

The Nineteenth International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies (UBICOMM 2025) will be held from **September 28, 2025 - October 02, 2025 in Lisbon, Portugal.**

## Onsite and Online Options

In order to accommodate various situations, we are offering the option for either physical presence or virtual participation (pdf slides or pre-recorded videos).

## Conference Overview

The rapid advances in ubiquitous technologies make fruition of more than 35 years of research in distributed computing systems, and more than two decades of mobile computing. The ubiquity vision is becoming a reality. Hardware and software components evolved to deliver functionality under failure-prone environments with limited resources. The advent of web services and the progress on wearable devices, ambient components, user-generated content, mobile communications, and new business models generated new applications and services. The conference makes a bridge between issues with software and hardware challenges through mobile communications.

The goal of the International Conference on Mobile Ubiquitous Computing, Systems, Services and Technologies, UBICOMM 2025, is to bring together researchers from the academia and practitioners from the industry in order to address fundamentals of ubiquitous systems and the new applications related to them. The conference will provide a forum where researchers shall be able to present recent research results and new research problems and directions related to them. The conference seeks contributions presenting novel research in all aspects of ubiquitous techniques and technologies applied to advanced mobile applications.
