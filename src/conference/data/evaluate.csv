## Submission Guidelines

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished manuscripts demonstrating current research on distributed smart systems and IoT related to the aforementioned topics of interest.  Please use the US letter size (8.5 X 11 in) standard IEEE conference LaTeX format or Microsoft Word template available on: [http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html](http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).

All submissions should be written in English and have a maximum of eight (8) printed pages, including figures and references. Two (2) additional pages at 100$/page for supplementary material only (such as theorems, proofs, implementation details) are allowed. Starting 2023, DCOSS-IoT follows a double-blind review process. As a result, authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Although submission is double-blind, the existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to look for such preprints actively but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Papers that do not meet the size, formatting, and anonymization requirements will not be reviewed. We require each paper to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) and submitted through the EDAS submission system.
