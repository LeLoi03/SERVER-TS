## Submission Process and Format

The submission site is available here: [https://raid2025.hotcrp.com/](https://raid2025.hotcrp.com/).

Submissions must be a PDF file and should follow the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template ([https://template-selector.ieee.org/](https://template-selector.ieee.org/)). The submission must be no more than 12 pages long, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Note that reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material. Authors should not change the font or the margins of the IEEE format. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.

## Review Process

Reviewing will be double-blind, meaning the authors’ identities will be hidden from the reviewers. All papers will be reviewed by at least three reviewers and will receive notification according to the timeline above. No major/minor revision options are allowed. All papers must be appropriately anonymized.

## Human Subjects and Ethical Considerations

Submissions that describe experiments on human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:

*   Disclose whether the research received approval or a waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (e.g., an IRB).
*   Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect.
*   If the submission deals with vulnerabilities, the authors need to discuss in detail the steps they have already taken or plan to take to address these vulnerabilities (e.g., by disclosing vulnerabilities to the vendors).
*   If a paper raises significant ethical and legal concerns, it might be rejected based on these concerns.

## Proceedings

Papers that have been formally reviewed and accepted will be presented at RAID 2025 and published in conference proceedings by Conference Publishing Services, CPS, and will be submitted to IEEE Xplore Digital Library. By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. Note that for papers that share authors, a separate author registration is required for each paper.

## Program Committee

We are looking for volunteers, and we are accepting nominations (self-nominations are welcome as well). If interested, please fill this form: [https://forms.gle/yVia9CV9wtRxQY388](https://forms.gle/yVia9CV9wtRxQY388)."

## New from RE’25: RE Open Data Initiative

RE’25 launches the RE Open Data Initiative.  Data will be released between December 2024 and the beginning of January 2025. For more information, click [here](https://conf.researchr.org/track/RE-2025/RE-2025-re-open-data-initiative).

## Open Science Policy

RE 2025 Research Track has an open science policy with the steering principle that all research results should be accessible to the public and, if possible, empirical studies should be reproducible. Sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. However, sharing is expected to be the default, and non-sharing needs to be justified.

## AI Generated Content

Concerning AI-generated content, authors should adopt the IEEE Policy: [https://open.ieee.org/author-guidelines-for-artificial-intelligence-ai-generated-text/](https://open.ieee.org/author-guidelines-for-artificial-intelligence-ai-generated-text/)

## Formatting

ACM’s archival publication format separates content from presentation in the Digital Library to enhance accessibility and improve the flexibility and resiliency of our publications. All authors should submit manuscripts for review in a double-column format.

## Review Process

RecSys follows a mutually anonymous review process. Papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee and overseen by a Senior PC member.

## Authorship Policy & Conflict of Interests

Authors are strongly encouraged to carefully review ACM’s authorship policy before submitting their papers. All authors must be listed in the correct order in EasyChair by the submission deadline.

## Anonymity

The peer review process is mutually anonymous. This means that all submissions must not include any information that identifies the authors or their organizations.

## Pre-print Policy

Please carefully consider pre-print constraints. Any violation of this policy could cause your paper to be desk-rejected.

## Use of AI Policy

Authors must follow the ACM Policy on the use of generative AI software tools.

## Plagiarism Policy

Plagiarism is a matter that we take very seriously.

## Ethical Review for Human-Subjects Research

ACM RecSys expects all authors to comply with ethical and regulatory guidelines associated with human subjects research.

## Desk Rejection Policy

Submissions that do not meet the requirements for anonymity, length, or formatting; violate dual submission policy and/or any of ACM’s policies on use of AI or academic dishonesty—such as plagiarism, author misrepresentation, or falsification—may be rejected by the chairs without further consideration.

## Publication and Open Access

By submitting a manuscript to an ACM Publication, authors acknowledge that they are subject to all ACM Publications Policies.

The 31st IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS 2025) will be held in **Irvine, USA, from May 6-9, 2025**, as part of CPS-IoT Week.

RTAS is a top-tier conference with a focus on systems with timing requirements. RTAS’25 welcomes papers describing applications, case studies, methodologies, tools, algorithms, or operating systems, middleware, or hardware innovations that contribute to the state of the art in the design, implementation, validation, verification, and evolution of systems with timing requirements.

## Tracks

RTAS’25 consists of two tracks:

*   Track 1: Systems and Applications
*   Track 2: Applied Methodologies and Foundations

## Scope and Guidelines

To be in scope, papers must explicitly consider at least one of the following:

*   Some kind of timing requirements
*   Improvements or innovations that directly support the fundamental properties of systems with timing requirements

### Timing Requirements

The timing requirements of interest are broadly defined and include not only classical hard real-time constraints, but also soft real-time, probabilistic, quality-of-service (QoS), throughput, or latency requirements.  The authors should specifically state the types of timing-related properties addressed by the contribution(s) presented in their paper.

### Improvements or Innovations to Support the Fundamental Properties of Systems with Timing Requirements

Work that supports the design, implementation, validation, or evaluation of deterministic, predictable, dependable, efficient, or next-generation systems with timing requirements are welcome. The authors should specifically state how their work can be used or built upon to ultimately achieve systems with timing requirements beyond the state of the arts.

### Application Area

The application area can be any type of systems with timing requirements, including, but not limited to:

*   Resource-constrained embedded systems
*   Distributed cyber-physical systems (CPS)
*   Cloud/edge/fog computing systems
*   Cloud data centers
*   Internet of Things (IoT)
*   Mobile computing
*   Robotics
*   Smart grid
*   Smart cities
*   Middleware and frameworks
*   Machine learning and signal processing algorithms

RTAS welcomes both papers backed by formal proofs, as well as papers that focus exclusively on empirical validation of timing requirements, e.g., using traces or performance models inferred from data. Research results from fundamental research, (case-driven) applied research, and (pragmatic) industry practice are all in scope.

## Review Process

RTAS’25 follows a double-anonymous peer reviewing process: author identities and affiliations will not be revealed to reviewers. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a response to reviews before acceptance decisions are made, solely to provide clarifications and correct misconceptions. The response will not allow authors to introduce new material beyond the original submission or promise such material for the camera-ready version. There will be an optional artifact evaluation process for accepted papers that assesses the reproducibility of the work.
