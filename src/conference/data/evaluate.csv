## Submission Guidelines

*   Papers (up to 10 pages including references for long papers, up to 5 pages including references for short papers) should present contributions from relevant topics.
*   All papers must make clear their relation to legal information, reasoning, or processes.
*   Submissions focusing on the reproduction, validation, constructive scrutinization, and extension of previously published works, datasets, and benchmarks are strongly encouraged.
*   Papers proposing formal or computational models should provide examples and/or reproducible simulations.
*   Papers on applications should describe the motivations, techniques, implementation, and evaluation.
*   All papers should include some discussion about the relevance to legal theory, practice, use of legal information, or impact on processes.
*   It is highly recommended that code and data be published alongside the papers for all submissions to facilitate reproducibility.
*   Paper must be formatted using the ACM sigconf template (for LaTeX) or the interim template layout.docx (for Word), both at [http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
*   Submissions can be made via the ConfTool platform: [https://www.conftool.net/icail2025/](https://www.conftool.net/icail2025/)
