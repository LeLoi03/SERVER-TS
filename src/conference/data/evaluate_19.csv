USENIX ATC brings together leading systems researchers for the presentation of cutting-edge systems research and the opportunity to gain insight into a wealth of must-know topics.","# USENIX ATC '25: Call for Papers

The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference will be co-located with the 19th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI '25) and take place on **July 7–9, 2025, at the Sheraton Boston in Boston, MA, USA.**

## Overview

The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. We are interested in systems of all scales, from small embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds.

The scope of USENIX ATC covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including but not limited to:

*   Operating systems
*   Runtime systems
*   Parallel and distributed systems
*   Storage
*   Networking
*   Security and privacy
*   Virtualization
*   Software-hardware interactions
*   Performance evaluation and workload characterization
*   Reliability, availability, and scalability
*   Energy and power management
*   Bug-finding, tracing, analyzing, and troubleshooting

We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract registrations due:** Tuesday, January 7, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Submissions due:** Tuesday, January 14, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Authors' response period:** Monday, April 7–Wednesday, April 9, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Notification to authors:** Friday, April 25, 2025
*   **Final papers due:** Tuesday, June 3, 2025

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum, including journals, conferences, and workshops with proceedings. They will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity. An idea or a design that the PC deems flawed can be grounds for rejection. USENIX ATC '25 will employ double-blind reviewing. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.

Papers need to be registered and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract at the time of the abstract registration deadline will be rejected.

There will be an optional artifact evaluation process for accepted papers.

### Submission Type: Full vs. Short

USENIX ATC '25 accepts both full and short submissions. Full submissions must not exceed 12 pages, and short submissions must not exceed 6 pages. In both cases, the page limit excludes references and appendices but includes all text, figures, tables, footnotes, etc. Both types are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in scope. A short paper presents a complete idea that is properly evaluated, just like in a full-length submission. Optionally, authors can include an appendix to provide material that may be of interest to some reviewers, such as algorithm details, proofs, and code snippets, but is not central to the contributions of the paper.

### Deployed Systems Track

USENIX ATC '25 solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with real-world deployment of systems and networks. Papers for the deployed systems track need not present new ideas or results to be accepted but should convey practical insights. Note that the rules regarding submission and anonymization are different for deployed systems track papers. The final program will explicitly identify papers accepted to the deployed systems track to distinguish them from papers accepted to the regular track.

## Early Rejection Notifications

USENIX ATC '25 reviews will be conducted in multiple rounds. For papers that are rejected in an early round, early rejection notifications will be sent to the authors at least one month ahead of the date that all remaining notifications (for acceptances and additional rejections) will be sent.

## Authors' Response Period

USENIX ATC '25 will provide an opportunity for authors of papers that are not early rejected to respond to the reviews prior to the final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting.

## Confidentiality

All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the USENIX ATC '25 website. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

## On the Use of Generative AI

Authors must not submit papers containing sections generated entirely by generative AI. Authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper does not include sections completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP.

## Contact

Please direct any questions to the program co-chairs ([atc25chairs@usenix.org](mailto:atc25chairs@usenix.org)) or to the USENIX office ([submissionspolicy@usenix.org](mailto:submissionspolicy@usenix.org)).

The thirteenth IEEE Working Conference on Software Visualization (VISSOFT 2025) will be co-located with ICSME in 2025.

## Software Visualization

Software visualization is a broad research area whose general goal is to enhance and promote the theory, realization, and evaluation of approaches to visually encode and analyze software systems, including software development practices, evolution, structure, and software runtime behavior. Software visualization is inherently interdisciplinary, drawing on theories and techniques from areas such as information visualization, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, and data science, and applying these in the software engineering domain.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include but are not limited to the visualization of:

*   Software Engineering data (source code, dependencies, repositories, developer social networks, mobile app reviews, documentation, runtime logs, and DevOps data)
*   Software development activities (design, requirements engineering, software maintenance, program comprehension, software performance, software testing, and debugging)
*   Software analytical approaches based on data science concepts
*   Empirical evaluations of software visualizations, including eye-tracking studies
*   Tools, techniques, and frameworks that include visual programming languages
*   Interactive and immersive techniques and algorithms related to software development
*   Integrating tools with development environments
*   Industrial experience with using software visualization
*   Techniques used in Software Engineering Education
*   Application of trendy techniques such as Machine Learning and AI-assisted models (Large Language Models, Large Multi-Modal Models with Software)
*   Application of techniques such as Augmented and Virtual Reality, and Sonification, to software engineering activities

## Submission Types

VISSOFT features several submission tracks:

### Research Track

*   A paper submitted to the Research Track must describe an in-depth and mature research result relevant to software visualization.
*   The content of a technical paper can be a maximum of 10 pages long (including all figures, tables, and appendices). The 10-page limit does not include the bibliography (limited to two additional pages).
*   The submission of a video (up to 5 minutes) is highly encouraged.
*   Authors are encouraged to archive their artifacts in a reproduction package in an open access archive.

### NIER Track (New Ideas and Emerging Results)

*   NIER contributions have a limit of 5 pages (including bibliography).
*   NIER contributions describe work-in-progress and preliminary, exciting ideas and results.

### Tools Track

*   Tools Track papers describe the design or actual utilization of software visualization tools.
*   Short tool papers (up to 4 pages + 1 page bibliography) usually just describe the presented tool and will be evaluated mostly in terms of novelty and interest.
*   Long tool papers (up to 10 pages + 2 pages bibliography) are expected to present a user evaluation.
*   The submission of a video (up to 5 minutes in length) is mandatory.
*   Authors are encouraged to archive their artifacts in a reproduction package in an open access archive.

### Artifact Evaluation Track

We invite authors of papers accepted to VISSOFT to submit artifacts associated with those papers for evaluation. More information is available at the ICSME 2025 webpage.

### Journal-First Track

Authors of papers that meet specific criteria (accepted by a relevant journal, published between July 1, 2023, and July 11, 2025, etc.) are invited to submit a one-page presentation proposal.

### Poster Track

The poster track of VISSOFT accepts two-page documents that embody a succinct description of work that has been done.

## Scope and Topics

We solicit original, unpublished research papers on computing technologies for modeling, programming, communicating, and reasoning, which are easier to learn, use, or understand by humans than the current state-of-the-art. Papers should focus on efforts to design, formalize, implement, or evaluate those technologies and languages.  Empirical papers that validate current proposed solutions with rigorous scientific means (i.e., empirical studies, controlled experiments, rigorous case studies, etc.) are also welcome.

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   Visual languages
*   Human aspects and psychology of software development and language design
*   End-user development, adaptation and programming
*   Representations for computation
*   Model-driven development
*   Debugging, program comprehension, code review
*   Explainable ML/AI
*   Human-Centric AI-based tools
*   Low-Code/No-Code paradigm
*   Education and Computational thinking

### Special Emphasis for 2025: Human-AI Collaboration

We seek research that highlights the situations in which human-AI interactions enhance, or degrade, the human experience in computing. Papers describing positive, negative, and unclear impacts are all welcome.

## Paper Submissions

We invite two kinds of papers:

*   Full-length papers (up to 10 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements)
*   Short papers (up to 5 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements)

All accepted papers, whether full or short, should be complete, self-contained, archival contributions. Papers do not have to reach the maximum page limit, but they should be of an appropriate length for the content.

Papers could be research findings, industry experience reports, replication studies, or vision papers. Please select the appropriate page length for the content of your paper. Papers must be submitted using the IEEE two-column conference paper format. Be sure to use the current IEEE conference paper format (which was updated in 2019), and to select the “US letter” template.

## Submission Process

Papers should be submitted via the EasyChair system: [https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vlhcc2025](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vlhcc2025)

To facilitate the assigning of papers to reviewers, authors should submit paper abstracts via EasyChair at least 1 week prior to the paper submission deadline (see Important Dates below). The abstract must be no longer than 250 words.

All submissions will be reviewed by members of the Program Committee in a double-anonymous review process. Authors will then receive the reviews for their submissions and will be able to answer them in a rebuttal phase. Only after this step will the PC make a final decision about the acceptance of the submissions.

At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for VL/HCC 2025 and present the paper at the conference. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference, including IEEE Xplore Digital Library, if the paper is not presented by the author at the conference.

## Publication

The proceedings of IEEE VL/HCC are published in digital form by the IEEE Computer Science Society and archived in the IEEE Digital Library with an official ISBN number. Accepted papers will be available to conference attendees via the IEEE Open Preview program in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.

Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting can be found at the Springer website. Submission is via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=vmcai2025](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=vmcai2025). Note: submissions will open on August 26th.

All accepted papers will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The corresponding author of each paper will need to complete and sign a License-to-Publish form to be submitted together with the camera-ready version.

Submissions will undergo a single-blind review process. Submissions should not be anonymized for the purposes of review. There will be three categories of papers: regular papers, tool papers, and case studies. Papers in each category have a different page limit and will be evaluated differently.

*   **Regular papers:** clearly identify and justify an advance to the field of verification, abstract interpretation, or model checking. Where applicable, they are supported by experimental validation. Regular papers are restricted to 20 pages in LNCS format, not counting references.
*   **Tool papers:** present a new tool, a new tool component, or novel extensions to an existing tool. Tool papers are restricted to 12 pages in LNCS format, not counting references.
*   **Case studies:** are expected to describe the use of verification, model checking, and abstract interpretation techniques in new application domains or industrial settings. Case study papers are restricted to 20 pages in LNCS format, not counting references. (Shorter case study papers are also welcome.)

## Call for Artifacts

VMCAI 2025 makes available the option to submit an artifact along with a paper. Artifact submission is optional. However, we highly encourage all authors to also submit an artifact. A successfully evaluated artifact can increase your chance of being accepted since the evaluation result of your artifact is taken into account during paper reviewing.

## Submission Guidelines

All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library in the VRST collection.

### Format

Paper submissions must be anonymous for a double-blind review process. All submissions should be prepared using the Word or LaTeX templates from the official ACM Master article template packages and TAPS ([https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow)).

### Submission Lengths

*   LaTeX: 4 to 9 pages, double column, excluding references
*   Word: approx. 8,000 words including space for figures, tables, etc.

### Anonymity Guidelines

For initial Paper submissions, authors are asked to remove all author and institution information and remove any clues that would directly identify any of the authors.

### Supplementary Materials

Submissions may be (optionally) accompanied by additional materials such as images, videos, or electronic documents. These materials do not form a part of the official submission. They will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers.

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

When designing and presenting user evaluations, please consider the following: User evaluations using non-representative or homogeneous participant populations can introduce biases in the results and conclusions. We recommend that researchers strive to use samples that are representative of the population for which the technology is being designed. If representative samples are not possible to collect, we recommend that the limitations of the population studied should be discussed within the paper and care must be taken when making claims about the findings. We recommend that participant demographic information should be reported for user evaluations so that future researchers understand the results based on the population studied.

### Accessibility

We ask authors to try to be as inclusive as possible when preparing a submission. For instance, please provide alt-text for figures and tables and make supplemental videos accessible with subtitles to enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing.

### Policies

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference, and present their work in person at the conference. As the conference is in-person only, there will not be any opportunity to present remotely.
