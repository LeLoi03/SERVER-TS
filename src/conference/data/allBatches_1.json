It is being held jointly (same location and dates) with a number of other research conferences; namely, The 2025 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing (CSCE'25).  \n   \n  We anticipate having between 1,000 and 1,500 participants in the Congress. The congress includes 21 major tracks composed of: 112 technical, research, and panel sessions as well as a number of keynote lectures and tutorials; all will be held simultaneously, same location and dates: July 21-24, 2025. Last year, the Congress had attracted speakers/authors and participants affiliated with over 148 different universities (including many from the top 50 ranked institutions), major IT corporations (including: Microsoft, Google, Apple, SAP, Facebook, Oracle, Amazon, Yahoo, Samsung, IBM, Ebay, GE, Siemens, Philips, Ericsson, BAE Systems, Hitachi, NTT, Twitter, Uber Technologies, ...), major corporations (including: Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, PetroChina, GlaxoSmithKline, HSBC, Airbus, Boeing, Hyundai, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, ...), government research agencies (NSF, NIH, DoE, US Air Force, NSA National Security Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, ...), US national laboratories (including, NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration, ANL Argonne National Lab, Sandia National Lab, ORNL Oak Ridge National Lab, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Lawrence Livermore National Lab, Los Alamos National Lab, Pacific Northwest National Lab, ...), and a number of Venture Capitalists as well as distinguished speakers discussing Intellectual Property issues. Last year, 54% of attendees were from academia, 25% from industry; 20% from government and funding agencies; and 1% unknown. About half of the attendees were from outside USA; from 69 nations.  \n   \n  Cognitive computing systems use computerized models to simulate the human cognition process to find solutions in complex situations where the answers may be ambiguous and uncertain.

It is being held jointly (same location and dates) with a number of other research conferences; namely, The 2025 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing (CSCE'25).  \n   \n  We anticipate having between 1,000 and 1,500 participants in the Congress. The congress includes 21 major tracks composed of: 112 technical, research, and panel sessions as well as a number of keynote lectures and tutorials; all will be held simultaneously, same location and dates: July 21-24, 2025. Last year, the Congress had attracted speakers/authors and participants affiliated with over 148 different universities (including many from the top 50 ranked institutions), major IT corporations (including: Microsoft, Google, Apple, SAP, Facebook, Oracle, Amazon, Yahoo, Samsung, IBM, Ebay, GE, Siemens, Philips, Ericsson, BAE Systems, Hitachi, NTT, Twitter, Uber Technologies, ...), major corporations (including: Exxon Mobil, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, PetroChina, GlaxoSmithKline, HSBC, Airbus, Boeing, Hyundai, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, ...), government research agencies (NSF, NIH, DoE, US Air Force, NSA National Security Agency, Central Intelligence Agency, ...), US national laboratories (including, NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration, ANL Argonne National Lab, Sandia National Lab, ORNL Oak Ridge National Lab, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Lawrence Livermore National Lab, Los Alamos National Lab, Pacific Northwest National Lab, ...), and a number of Venture Capitalists as well as distinguished speakers discussing Intellectual Property issues.

While the organising committees of ACII 2025 and ICMI 2025 are separate, the teams work closely together and investigate registration options that will allow for different combinations of attending the two conferences for those who cannot attend both conferences in full. Further details will be provided in due time. (Sunday, 12 Oct 2025 will be a rest and recovery day for those attending both conferences.)   \n\n Copyright © 2025 ACII 2025. Powered by WordPress",

This ‘reverse’ conference schedule for  ACII 2025 will allow for maximum flexibility for attendees who also want to attend the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (  ICMI 2025 , 13-17 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling to combine two excellent conferences in one trip. While the organising committees of ACII 2025 and ICMI 2025 are separate, the teams work closely together and investigate registration options that will allow for different combinations of attending the two conferences for those who cannot attend both conferences in full. Further details will be provided in due time. (Sunday, 12 Oct 2025 will be a rest and recovery day for those attending both conferences.)   \n\n Copyright © 2025 ACII 2025. Powered by WordPress",

Accepted papers must be presented by one of the paper’s authors.    \n ACII 2025 will be held just before the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction ( ICMI 2025 , 13-17 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling the attendees to combine two excellent conferences in one trip.   \n The ACII conference series is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognise, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena. All accepted papers will be included in IEEE Xplore (subject to approval by the IEEE Computer Society) and indexed by EI. A selection of the best articles at ACII 2025 will be invited to submit extended versions to the IEEE   Transactions on Affective Computing   .   \n The theme for ACII 2025 is Socially Responsible Affective Computing  . Affective computing, with its ability to recognise and respond to human emotions, holds great potential for enhancing user experiences and fostering more natural interactions between humans and machines. It also has promising applications in fields such as mental health, where this technology can assist psychologists and other clinicians in making more accurate diagnoses by detecting mental states. However, this powerful technology also raises significant ethical concerns that must be addressed to ensure its responsible and transparent use.   \n One of the primary challenges is the potential misuse or exploitation of sensitive emotional data, including for manipulative or discriminatory purposes. Ensuring robust data privacy, clear ethical guidelines, and regulations around the use of emotional data is crucial. Additionally, the lack of transparency of many affective computing algorithms, systems build on limited data, and the potential for biases in emotion inference systems pose risks of perpetuating harmful stereotypes or inaccurate assessments based on factors such as gender, race, or cultural background. Transparency, accountability, and mitigating biases in these systems are essential to build trust with users.   \n Recognising these concerns, regulatory efforts such as the EU AI Act aim to establish legal frameworks and stringent requirements for high-risk AI applications, including those related to emotional state detection, ultimately safeguarding individual rights and upholding ethical principles in the development and deployment of affective computing technologies. A stronger focus needs to be placed on these matters by the affective computing research community.   \n The ACII 2025 (8-11 Oct 2025) and ICMI 2025 (13-17 Oct 2025) conferences will be held in back-to-back mode at the same venue in Canberra, Australia – one trip, two great conferences!   \n Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:   \n Recognition and Synthesis of Human Affect from ALL Modalities   \n Multimodal Modeling of Cognitive and Affective States \n  Contextualized Modeling of Cognitive and Affective States \n  Facial and Body Gesture Recognition, Modeling and Animation \n  Affective Speech Analysis, Recognition and Synthesis \n  Recognition and Synthesis of Auditory Affect Bursts (Laughter, Cries, etc.) \n  Motion Capture for Affect Recognition \n  Affect Recognition from Alternative Modalities (Physiology, Brain Waves, etc.) \n  Affective Text Processing and Sentiment Analysis \n  Multimodal Data Fusion for Affect Recognition \n  Synthesis of Multimodal Affective Behaviour \n  Summarisation of Affective Behaviour \n  Affective Science using Affective Computing Tools   \n Studies of affective behavior perception using computational tools \n  Studies of affective behavior production using computational tools \n  Studies of affect in medical/clinical settings using computational tools \n  Studies of affect in context using computational tools \n  Psychology & Cognition of Affect in Designing Computational Systems   \n Computational Models of Affective Processes \n  Issues in Psychology & Cognition of Affect in Affective Computing Systems \n  Cultural Differences in Affective Design and Interaction \n  Affective Interfaces   \n Interfaces for Monitoring and Improving Mental and Physical Well-Being \n  Design of Affective Loop and Affective Dialogue Systems \n  Human-Centred Human-Behaviour-Adaptive Interfaces \n  Interfaces for Attentive & Intelligent Environments \n  Mobile, Tangible and Virtual/Augmented Multimodal Proactive Interfaces \n  Distributed/Collaborative Multimodal Proactive Interfaces \n  Tools and System Design Issues for Building Affective and Proactive Interfaces \n  Evaluation of Affective, Behavioural, and Proactive Interfaces \n  Affective, Social and Inclusive Robotics and Virtual Agents   \n Artificial Agents for Supporting Mental and Physical Well-Being \n  Emotion in Robot and Virtual Agent Cognition and Action \n  Embodied Emotion \n  Biologically-Inspired Architectures for Affective and Social Robotics \n  Developmental and Evolutionary Models for Affective and Social Robotics \n  Models of Emotion for Embodied Conversational Agents \n  Personality in Embodied Conversational Agents \n  Memory, Reasoning, and Learning in Affective Conversational Agents \n  Affect and Group Emotions   \n Analyzing and modeling groups taking into account emergent states and/or emotions \n  Integration of artificial agents (robots, virtual characters) in the group life by leveraging its affective loop: interaction paradigms, strategies, modalities, adaptation \n  Collaborative affective interfaces (e.g., for inclusion, for education, for games and entertainment) \n  Open Resources for Affective Computing   \n Shared Datasets for Affective Computing \n  Benchmarks for Affective Computing \n  Open-source Software/Tools for Affective Computing \n  Fairness, Accountability, Privacy, Transparency and Ethics in Affective Computing     \n Bias, imbalance and inequalities in data and modeling approaches in the context of Affective Computing \n  Bias mitigation in the context of Affective Computing \n  Explainability and Transparency in the context of Affective Computing \n  Privacy-preserving affect sensing and modeling \n  Ethical aspects in the context of Affective Computing \n  Applications   \n Health and well-being \n  Education \n  Entertainment \n  Consumer Products \n  User Experience \n  Important Dates  \n The time zone for the deadlines below is Anywhere on Earth (AOE).   \n Main Track  \n Main track full paper submission deadline: | 9 April 2025 (Extended) \n  Rebuttal period: | 31 May – 4 June 2025 \n  Paper notification for the main track: | 19 June 2025 \n  Camera-ready paper submission deadline: | 19 July 2025 \n  Main conference: | 8 – 10 Oct 2025 \n  Workshops and tutorials, and DC: | 11 Oct 2025 \n\n Copyright © 2025 ACII 2025.

ACL 2025 has a goal of a diverse technical program—in addition to traditional research results, papers may contribute negative findings, survey an area, announce the creation of a new resource, argue a position, report novel linguistic insights derived using existing computational techniques, and reproduce, or fail to reproduce, previous results. As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be of papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and by the Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.  \n Papers submitted to ACL 2025, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics.  \n Paper Submission Information  \n Papers may be submitted to the ARR 2025 February cycle. Papers that have received reviews and a meta-review from ARR (whether from the ARR 2025 February cycle or an earlier ARR cycle) may be committed to ACL 2025 via the conference commitment site (TBA).  \n Submission Topics  \n ACL 2025 aims to have a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas (in alphabetical order):  \n Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics \n  Dialogue and Interactive Systems \n  Discourse and Pragmatics \n  Efficient/Low-Resource Methods for NLP \n  Ethics, Bias, and Fairness \n  Generation \n  Human-Centered NLP \n  Information Extraction \n  Information Retrieval and Text Mining \n  Interpretability and Analysis of Models for NLP \n  Language Modeling \n  Linguistic theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics \n  Machine Learning for NLP \n  Machine Translation \n  Multilinguality and Language Diversity \n  Multimodality and Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond \n  NLP Applications \n  Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation \n  Question Answering \n  Resources and Evaluation \n  Semantics: Lexical and Sentence-Level \n  Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining \n  Speech recognition, text-to-speech and spoken language understanding \n  Summarization \n  Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing \n  Special Theme | : Generalization of NLP Models \n  ACL 2025 Theme Track: Generalization of NLP Models  \n Following the success of the ACL 2020-2024 Theme tracks, we are happy to announce that ACL 2025 will have a new theme with the goal of reflecting and stimulating discussion about the current state of development of the field of NLP.  \n Generalization is crucial for ensuring that models behave robustly, reliably, and fairly when making predictions on data different from their training data. Achieving good generalization is critically important for models used in real-world applications, as they should emulate human-like behavior. Humans are known for their ability to generalize well, and models should aspire to this standard.  \n The theme track invites empirical and theoretical research and position and survey papers reflecting on the Generalization of NLP Models. The possible topics of discussion include (but are not limited to) the following:  \n How can we enhance the generalization of NLP models across various dimensions—compositional, structural, cross-task, cross-lingual, cross-domain, and robustness? \n  What factors affect the generalization of NLP models? \n  What are the most effective methods for evaluating the generalization capabilities of NLP models? \n  While Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly enhance the generalization of NLP models, what are the key limitations of LLMs in this regard? \n  The theme track submissions can be either long or short. We anticipate having a special session for this theme at the conference and a Thematic Paper Award in addition to other categories of awards.  \n Two-Stage Review: Submission to ARR, Commitment to ACL 2025  \n ACL 2025 will use ACL Rolling Review (ARR) as a reviewing system, but final decisions will be made by the conference. Both submissions of articles for review and commitment of reviewed articles to the conference will be performed via the Open Review platform. Specifically, authors will follow a two-step process:  \n Authors submit articles to ARR, where submissions receive reviews and meta-reviews from ARR reviewers and action editors; \n  Authors commit their reviewed articles to a publication venue (e.g., ACL 2025), where Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs make acceptance decisions from the ARR reviews and meta-reviews. \n  ACL 2025 has chosen this approach in coordination with *CL 2024 conferences, which are adopting the same procedure and a coordinated submission plan to allow maximum flexibility during their submission periods for the authors. At each cycle, after a paper has been fully reviewed, authors have the option to commit their paper to a conference or revise and resubmit for another round of reviews.  \n The reviewing process will continue to be double-blind. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers, and reviews on ARR will not be made publicly visible. However, authors will be given the option through ARR to make their anonymized submitted articles publicly visible.  \n Mandatory Reviewing Workload  \n As the pace of research in the field continues to increase, we need to strengthen the commitment to reviewing for each paper submission. During the ARR submission process, authors will be required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing in this reviewing cycle. Please see the new ARR policy regarding reviewing workload here. As this is an ARR-wide policy for all *CL conferences, questions or clarifications should be addressed to ARR directly.  \n Important Dates  \n Submission deadline (all papers are submitted to ARR) | : February 15, 2025 \n  ARR reviews & meta-reviews available to authors of the February cycle | : April 15, 2025 \n  Commitment deadline for ACL 2025 | : April 20, 2025 \n  Notification of acceptance | : May 15, 2025 \n  Withdrawal deadline | : May 30, 2025 \n  Camera-ready papers due | : May 30, 2025 \n  Tutorials | : July 27, 2025 \n  Main Conference | : July 28-30, 2025 \n  Workshops | : July 31-August 1, 2025 \n  Note: All deadlines are at 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).   \n Paper Submission Details  \n Both long and short paper submissions should follow all of the ARR submission requirements , including:  \n Long Papers | (8 pages) and | Short Papers | (4 pages) \n  Instructions for Two-Way Anonymized Review \n  Authorship \n  Citation and Comparison \n  Multiple Submission Policy | , | Resubmission Policy | , and | Withdrawal Policy \n  Ethics Policy | including the | responsible NLP research checklist \n  Limitations \n  Paper Submission and Templates \n  Optional Supplementary Materials | Final versions of accepted papers will be given one additional page of content (up to 9 pages for long papers, up to 5 pages for short papers) to address reviewers’ comments. \n  Following the ACL and ARR policies , there is no anonymity period requirement.   \n At the time of submission to ARR, authors will be asked to select a preferred venue (e.g., ACL 2025). This is used only to calculate acceptance rates. Authors who selected ACL 2025 as a preferred venue when submitting to ARR may choose not to commit to ACL 2025 after receiving their reviews, and authors who selected a preferred venue other than ACL 2025 when submitting to ARR are still welcome to commit to ACL 2025.  \n Presentation at the Conference  \n All accepted papers must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings. The conference will include both in-person and virtual presentation options. Papers without at least one presenting author registered by the early registration deadline may be subject to desk rejection. Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters as determined by the program committee. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and papers presented as posters.  \n\n Follow: \n  Twitter \n  GitHub \n  Feed \n    \n © 2025 acl.

In addition to the traditional ACM WiSec topics of physical, link, and network layer security, we welcome papers focusing on the increasingly diverse range of mobile or wireless applications such as the Internet of Things, Cyber-Physical Systems, as well as the security and privacy of mobile software platforms, usable security and privacy, biometrics, and cryptography.  \n Topics of interest for WiSec include the following, concerning systems in the second list below:  \n Confidentiality, integrity, availability \n  Authentication, identity, authorization, access control models and policies, localization, key management (agreement or distribution), \n  Privacy of systems, devices, users, their locations and other attributes \n  Exploitation of systems, including through reverse engineering, fuzzing, hardware or software vulnerabilities, protocol vulnerabilities, side channels, fault injection, resource exhaustion, jamming, or other means. \n  Abuse of and through systems, including messaging abuse (spam, robocalls, etc.), theft of service, and fraud \n  Defenses for exploitation and abuse \n  Experiences developing, testing, and deploying production-ready or large-scale secure wireless systems \n  Formal analysis, formal verification, and proof-based security approaches \n  Information theoretical approaches for security \n  Usable security and privacy, human factors \n  Application of Machine Learning, e.g., for attack detection or privacy violations \n  Economic and social impacts to security and privacy \n  Wireless and Mobile Systems of Interest include:  \n Wireless networking protocols, for example: 802.11, Bluetooth, 802.15.4-based protocols, cellular air protocols including LTE and 5G-NR, Vehicle and industrial device protocols (e.g., LoRA), wireless for critical infrastructure (e.g., ADS-B, GPS, rail, satellites), NFC and smart payment applications Cryptographic primitives and protocols for wireless and mobile systems, including: WPA2, AKA, etc. \n  Wireless physical layer technologies: transmission, reception, modulation, localization, remote sensing (e.g., radar, mmWave sensing), jammers, dynamic spectrum reuse and cognitive radio systems \n  Wireless and mobile device hardware and software, for example: embedded devices, wearables (e.g., watches), smartphones, mobile sensors, home and industrial automation devices (e.g., IoT, Smart Home, utilities, etc.), healthcare devices, vehicles (e.g., drones, automotive, avionics, satelites), and payment systems \n  Wireless and mobile adjacent topics, including voice interfaces, visible light communications, sonic, underwater communications, legacy telecommunications, … \n  The proceedings of ACM WiSec, sponsored by SIGSAC, will be published by ACM.  \n Important dates  \n Please note: WiSec will have two rounds of submissions. In previous years, WiSec has had a tradition of announcing deadline extensions. Due to the change in the submission process, there will not be time for extensions this year and all deadlines are firm.  \n First Cycle deadlines | Submission: November 21, 2024 \n  Author Notification: January 15, 2025 \n  Camera-ready: February 5, 2025 \n  Second Cycle deadlines | Submission: | Mar 12, 2025 | March 16, 2025 (AOE) \n  Author Notification: April 25, 2025 \n  Camera-ready: May 12, 2025 \n  Posters/Demo deadlines | Submission: April 28, 2025 \n  Author Notification: May 8, 2025 \n  Camera-ready: May 12, 2025 \n  Conference dates | June 30 - July 3, 2025 \n  Submission Guidelines  \n All papers for ACM WiSec 2025 must be submitted electronically through the HotCRP conference management system.  \n First Cycle: | HotCRP submission site for Cycle 1 \n  Second Cycle: | HotCRP submission site for Cycle 2 \n  Only PDF files will be accepted. Submissions must be prepared using the following ACM proceedings template and must use US Letter page size (215.9 x 279.4 mm / 8.5 x 11 inches):  \n The ACM proceedings template for LaTeX can be found at | Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) - SIG Proceedings Template | . \n  Please look at | ACM Primary Article Template | for further information on ACM proceedings templates. \n  Full, short, and SoK papers  \n Full paper submissions must be at most 10 pages in double-column ACM format (use document option “sigconf”), excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 12 pages in total. ACM WiSec also encourages the submission of short papers with a length of up to 6 pages (including bibliography and appendices), which describe mature work of a more succinct nature. All papers must be thoroughly anonymized for double-blind review.  \n Detailed submission instructions will be made available as the deadline approaches.  \n In addition to regular papers that present novel contributions in the field, we solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge on any of the above topics. Suitable papers provide an important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, present a convincing new taxonomy of such an area, and/or identify research gaps with evidence and a structured approach. Survey papers without such contributions are not suitable. SoK submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They can be up to 10 pages in the ACM conference style excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendices, and up to 15 pages overall. They will be reviewed by the program committee and held to the same standards as regular research papers, except instead of emphasizing novel research contributions the emphasis will be on value to the community. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.  \n Posters and demos  \n WiSec will solicit the submission of posters and demos. The instructions to submit posters/demos will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  \n Artifact Evaluation label  \n In the spirit of open science, WiSec encourages authors of accepted papers to make software and data artifacts publicly available to the community.  \n Such artifacts will be evaluated by the artifact evaluation committee and corresponding papers will be granted an artifact evaluation label. While artifacts are optional, their availability will be positively considered during paper evaluation. Should the authors choose to submit their artifacts for evaluation, they should indicate their decision upon paper submission and follow the artifact submission guidelines in order to submit them upon paper acceptance. The detailed guidelines will be made available on the WiSec 2025 website.  \n Double submissions  \n It is a policy of the ACM to disallow double/simultaneous submissions, where the same (or substantially similar) paper is concurrently submitted to multiple conferences/journals. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved. Technical reports and pre-prints published online are allowed.  \n Workshops and Tutorial  \n ACM WiSec will host workshops/tutorials that are co-organized with the main conference. Details will be made available on the website.  \n Research Ethics  \n The ethical conduct of research is critical to ensuring the public’s trust and support of science. All submitted papers will be reviewed for ethical concerns, and if ethical practices are not followed a paper will be rejected regardless of any other merit. Ethical concerns vary from project to project, so there is no “one size fits all” approach. Rather, researchers should consider ethical analysis to be an integral part of the research, just as evaluation and method design are. Ethics should be considered early in a project, during a project, and as the project is prepared for publication.  \n While every situation is unique, there are principles that researchers should consider and apply during their projects. The Menlo Report provides guidance and examples for network security. Principally, all research should embody the concepts of beneficence, justice, respect for persons, and respect of law and public interest. This is just as true for technical research as human subjects research. For example, if it is possible that a research method could cause harm to systems or users (e.g., testing jamming) researchers should explicitly detail the measures taken to prevent harm.  \n Research ethics is also paramount in any study that could be classified as “human subjects.” For WiSec, “human subject research” is defined as “research that involves interaction with identifiable humans or analysis of datasets containing data from one or more identifiable living humans.” Researchers are expected to follow the laws and common practices regarding human subjects review of their relevant jurisdictions and institutions. For example, researchers in the United States must undergo review by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) before beginning human subjects research. Authors doing human subjects research should mention the review standards in their jurisdictions and if they were met.  \n Computer security and privacy research often studies and even advanced tools and techniques with the capacity to harm others. In their submission, authors must convince reviewers that appropriate steps were taken to disclose newly discovered vulnerabilities to appropriate parties  \n Policy for Peer-Review Integrity  \n All SIGSAC-sponsored conferences and workshops are required to follow ACM policies against harassment activities ( https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment ) and ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ( https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) . Also, all authors, PC members, and non-PC reviewers are required to follow ACM Publications Policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc) . Particularly, we require all reviewers to uphold the integrity of the peer review process and avoid conflict of interest of any form (e.g., reviewer collusion ring). Those who violate these policies will be penalized according to ACM policies ( https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/penalties-for-publication-violations) .

Accepted papers will be published in Springer's LNAI and indexed in EI and DBLP. The ADMA is recognized as a C-level conference by CCF (China Computer Federation).  \n Research Track  \n ADMA 2025 provides an international platform for original research in data mining  , covering applications, algorithms, software, and systems. Submissions will undergo double-blind peer review and should contribute to theoretical or applied advancements in data mining.  \n Industry Track  \n This track focuses on applied research and real-world implementations of data mining solutions. Submissions should highlight practical value, industrial significance, and innovative deployments, such as best practices, novel systems, and large-scale dataset analyses in industry.  The single-blind review process allows authors to include identity and affiliation details.  \n Important Dates (AoE Time)  \n  \n Paper Submission Deadline (All Tracks) | May 8, 2025 \n Paper Notification (All Tracks) | July 27, 2025 \n Camera-Ready Submission Deadline (All Tracks) | August 10, 2025 \n Conference Dates | October 22 to 24, 2025 \n  \n Submission Guidelines  \n CMT Acknowledgment  \n The Microsoft CMT service was used for managing the peer-reviewing process for this conference. This service was provided for free by Microsoft and they bore all expenses, including costs for Azure cloud services as well as for software development and support.  \n Submission Site (Application in Progress)  \n https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ADMA2025  \n Formatting Guidelines  \n  \n The paper should be in English and contain unpublished contributions to the data mining and related fields. \n  Manuscripts must be prepared in accordance with the LNAI (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence) format. For the template and details on the LNCS style, see Springer's Author Instructions \n  The paper should NOT exceed 15 pages in LNAI format. \n  Submissions are reviewed in a double-blind  manner. For ADMA2025 the double-blind means that: \n  Author identities and affiliations are not disclosed to reviewers during the review process. \n  Authors should prepare and submit suitably blinded manuscripts that do not reveal author and affiliation information. Specific requirements to this end are detailed below. \n  Authors and reviewers alike make an honest effort to avoid accidentally de-blinding any submission. \n  The list of authors at the time of submission is final and cannot be changed. \n  \"Submitted papers\" must comply with all of the rules below. Any violation may result in an \"desk reject\"  . \n  Manuscript Preparation  \n Authors must submit PDFs without author names and affiliations. Submitted PDFs must also not contain any metadata that could reveal author identities or affiliations. \n  Authors should aim to avoid copy&pasting substantial amounts of text from their own prior publications, as such text blocks may be readily recognized by experts familiar with the state of the art and recent papers in the area. \n  Similarly, authors should not directly reuse figures from their own prior publications without attribution. Ideally, “fresh” figures should be prepared and used whenever possible. If that is not a viable option, that is, if a figure must be reused, then a citation should be included giving credit to the original paper from which the illustration has been adapted. \n  Authors must refrain from using any specific formatting tricks linguistic mannerisms, figure styles, or other stylistic idioms that could hint at or disclose the author identity or affiliation. \n  Submitted papers should not include an acknowledgements section or funding acknowledgements (even when blinded) since it can indicate the country of residence of (some of) the authors. (Such acknowledgements of course may be added to the camera-ready version.) \n  Authors who seek to refer to an online appendix or to supplemental materials (e.g., source code, videos, etc.) may still do so. However, instead of directly providing a URL or tech report number, authors should include a note that the appendices and/or supplemental materials in question are available from the track chair upon request. \n  Authors must provide all supplemental materials and/or appendices that a submission refers to in blinded form and sent them to the PC chair by email (or other approaches appointed by the PC chair) before the submission deadline. \n  The track chair will retain a copy of all submitted materials for the duration of the reviewing process. Any such provided appendices or supplemental materials are not subject to review and may be consulted by the reviewers at their own discretion. \n  It is imperative to acknowledge the contributions of AI models in the generation of textual content. Authors utilizing AI-generated text in their manuscripts are required to assume full responsibility for the accuracy, integrity, and originality of the material presented. Furthermore, any section of the paper employing AI-generated text should include clear documentation and description of the AI system utilized. This transparency ensures that readers can discern between human-authored content and text generated by AI, fostering a culture of accountability and integrity within the scholarly community. \n  Own Prior Work, Well-Known Projects, and Research Artifacts  \n  \n Authors should not upload their manuscript to preprint servers (such as arXiv) or their personal websites while the paper is under review, or otherwise publicly reveal their authorship of the manuscript under review. \n  As an exception to the previous rule, if a prior version of the manuscript has already been uploaded to a public preprint server prior to submission (e.g., if the paper is a re-submission of a paper previously rejected at another single-blind conference), then the paper may still be submitted to ADMA2025. However, such papers must be blinded when submitted to ADMA2025. \n  In exceptional circumstances that force a violation of the above two rules (e.g., a technical report or thesis must be filed in order for a student to graduate), the authors should contact the Program Chair prior to publicizing their manuscript content to avoid misunderstandings. \n  When submitting or extending a prior workshop publication, the workshop paper is treated as an online preprint for the purpose of the double-blind peer-review process. However, authors must proactively disclose the existence of a prior workshop version of a submitted paper. Such information should be emailed to the Program Chair. Failure to disclose a prior workshop publication is considered self-plagiarism. \n  After communicating with the Program Chair, submissions with conditions 2., 3., or 4. above are recommended to add a headline (or footer) on the first page with the following information: “This submission is based on Preprints, Paper Announcements, and Prior Workshop Papers. The information has been communicated with the Program Chair. The author(s) and the Program Chair request the reviewers not to actively search for the author names to ensure fairness of the double-blind review process.” Please contact the Program Chair at least 24 hours before the submission deadline if this applies to your submission. If the paper is accepted, the above text should be removed and appropriate citations if any should be added (e.g., citation for prior workshop paper, technical report or thesis and its relation to the accepted paper). \n  If your submission is an extended version of a workshop paper with DOI, you will be asked to provide a blinded version of the workshop paper as supplementary material. This will be used by the reviewers to verify that there is sufficient amount of new material in the extended version to warrant a publication at ADMA2025. \n  Contact Program Chairs  \n Yang Cao (Institute of Science Tokyo): cao@c.titech.ac.jp \n  Chuan Xiao (Osaka University): chuanx@ist.osaka-u.ac.jp \n\n Gold Sponsors  \n   \n Silver Sponsors  \n   \n Bronze Sponsors  \n\n ADMA2025 - The 21 st  International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications, Kyoto, Japan  Code of Conduct    \n\n  ",

The AIED 2025 conference, themed “AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future,” centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education.\",\n  \"Call for Papers\": \"# AIED 2025: Call for Papers\\n\\nThe 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025) will take place between **July 22-26, 2025 in Palermo, Italy**.\\n\\n## Theme\\n\\n“AI as a Catalyst for Inclusive, Personalised, and Ethical Education: Empowering Teachers and Students for an Equitable Future”\\n\\nThe AIED 2025 conference centers on the transformative potential of AI in fostering greater equity within education. By harnessing AI’s capacity to personalize learning experiences, educators can address the diverse needs of students and mitigate educational disparities, particularly among underserved and marginalized communities. This year’s theme also underscores the critical importance of ethical AI integration, ensuring that these advanced technologies are deployed responsibly to uphold principles of fairness, transparency, and privacy.\\n\\n## Tracks\\n\\nFor its main paper submissions, AIED 2025 solicits empirical and theoretical papers relating to both AI and education in the following lines of research and application, which represent our research tracks:\\n\\n*   Track 1 – AIED architectures and tools\\n*   Track 2 – Machine learning and Generative AI\\n*   Track 3 – Learning, teaching and pedagogy\\n*   Track 4 – Human-centered design and design-based research\\n*   Track 5 – Teaching AI\\n*   Track 6 – Ethics, Equity, and AIED in Society\\n*   Track 7 – Theoretical aspects of AIED and AI-based modelling for Education\\n\\n## Submission Instructions\\n\\nWe invite the following main submissions to the conference, to be submitted directly to one of the above research tracks:\\n\\n*   **Full paper submission:** Full papers should present integrative reviews or original reports of substantive new work: theoretical, empirical, and/or in the design, development and/or deployment of novel concepts, systems, and mechanisms. Full papers will be presented as long oral talks. Papers submitted as a full paper may be accepted as a short paper.\\n*   **Short paper submission:** Short papers are expected to describe novel and interesting results to the overall community at large. The goal is to give novel but not necessarily mature work a chance to be seen by other researchers and practitioners and to be discussed at the conference. Short papers will be presented as short oral talks.\\n\\nSubmissions must follow Springer policies on publication (including policies on the use of AI in the authoring process): [https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v](https://tinyurl.com/3rk3zj3v).\\n\\n## Review Process\\n\\nAll submissions will be reviewed by three members of the program committee, followed by a metareview conducted by a senior member of the program committee (all double-masked) to meet rigorous academic standards of publication. Papers will be reviewed for relevance, novelty, technical soundness, significance and clarity of presentation.\\n\\n## Anonymity\\n\\nThe review process will be double-masked, meaning that both the authors and reviewers will remain anonymous. To this end, authors should:\\n\\n*   Eliminate all information that could lead to their identification (names, contact information, affiliations, patents, names of approaches, frameworks, projects and/or systems)\\n*   Cite own prior work (if needed) in the third person\\n*   Eliminate acknowledgments and references to funding sources\\n\\n## Important Dates (full and short papers, main submission)\\n\\n*   **Submissions open:** December 20, 2024\\n*   **Abstracts due:** February 12, 2025\\n*   **Papers due:** February 19, 2025\\n*   **Notification of acceptance to authors:** April 2, 2025\\n*   **Camera-ready paper due:** May 2, 2025\"\n}",

original contributions on the development of theory, methods, systems, and applications of AI in biomedicine, including the application of AI approaches in biomedical informatics, healthcare organization, and molecular medicine.  \n\n  Important Dates   \n  \n Submission opening: October 1, 2024  \n  Abstract submission deadline: January 27, 2025  \n  Paper submission deadline: February 3, 2025  \n  Notification of acceptance: April 4, 2025  \n  Camera-ready submission deadline: April 15, 2025  \n  Main conference: June 23-26, 2025  \n\n  Scope   \n  \n Contributions to theory and methods should present or analyze novel AI theories or methodologies for solving problems in the biomedical field. They may propose new theories and methods or extensions of existing ones. In either case, the work should demonstrate its utility for solving biomedical problems and highlight its contribution to the underlying theoretical foundations. In addition, it should discuss assumptions, limitations, and novelty with respect to the state of the art.  \n Contributions addressing systems and applications should describe the development, implementation or evaluation of innovative, AI-based tools and systems in the biomedical application domain. These papers should both link the work to the underlying theory and either analyze the potential benefits for solving biomedical problems or provide empirical evidence of benefits in clinical practice.  \n The scope of the conference includes, but is not limited to, the following areas:  \n Machine learning and big data analytics \n  Natural language processing \n  Document classification and information retrieval \n  Large language models and their biomedical applications \n  AI for biomedical imaging \n  AI for signal processing and time series analysis \n  Foundational models and zero/few shots learning \n  Multimodal learning and information fusion \n  Data and knowledge integration, graph neural networks \n  Visual analytics in biomedicine \n  Bayesian networks, fuzzy logic and reasoning under uncertainty \n  Temporal and spatial representation and reasoning \n  Biomedical ontologies and terminologies \n  Knowledge-based reasoning in biomedicine \n  Clinical decision support systems \n  Healthcare processes and workflow management \n  Computerized clinical practice guidelines and protocols \n  Patient engagement support (personal healthcare record) \n  Explainable AI \n  Precision medicine \n  AI solutions for ambient assisted living, telemedicine, and e-health \n\n  Awards   \n  \n The Mario Stefanelli award  is given to the best student paper, according to the conference steering committee, based on the quality of both the paper and oral presentation at the conference.  \n The Marco Ramoni award  is given to the best regular paper, according to the conference steering committee, based on the scientific quality of the paper.  \n AIME Rising Star award  is aimed at younger colleagues running their labs with recent breakthrough papers in the area. If you would like to nominate someone for this award, please email your proposal to annette.ten.teije@vu.nl and robertmo@bgu.ac.il by March 1st. The criteria for the award and other information will be available on the AIME 2025 website .  \n\n  Student Travel Grants   \n  \n We will offer six travel grants to students who are authors of accepted papers (full or short) and who will present their work during the AIME 2025 conference. Each grant will cover travel costs up to EUR 500.00 (if these costs are less than EUR 500.00, the actual amount will be covered).  \n Preference will be given to students who are not members of the Doctoral Consortium (the latter will provide participation grants). We will also take into account the quality of the submitted work as indicated by the reviews. Applications will be accepted until April 30, 2025, decisions will be announced in early May, and grants will be awarded during the conference. Applicants should send the title of their accepted paper, formal proof of student status, and an electronic copy or scan of their tickets by email to all three addresses lucia.sacchi@unipv.it , riccardo.bellazzi@unipv.it and blaz.zupan@fri.uni-lj.si , with a CC copy to silvia.ferrari@pragmacongressi.it , with the subject line “AIME 2025 Student travel grants”.  \n\n  Submission   \n  \n Papers should be submitted to the AIME 2025 Easy Chair Website . Authors are asked first to submit an abstract (maximum 250 words), the full paper may be uploaded up to one week later (please see Important Dates above).  \n The conference features regular papers in three categories (please note if you are a student submitting a paper):  \n Full-length research papers (up to 10 pages, including references) \n  Short papers (max 5 pages, including references), describing a short research project with preliminary results or late-breaking results (work-in-progress) \n  Demo papers (max 5 pages, including references), describing a demonstration of implemented systems \n  Demos of applications are welcome, authors must submit a demo paper (see above). The demo track will provide opportunities to present software to individuals and small groups of attendees.  \n All accepted papers (full, short & demo) will be published in the conference proceedings, which will be published as part of Springer’s Lecture Notes in AI series. Papers should be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS format and one of the categories (Full paper, Short paper, Demo paper) must be selected at the time of submission. Authors should follow Springer’s guidelines for authors and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, to prepare their papers. Springer’s proceedings LaTeX templates are also available in Overleaf. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their submissions.  \n\n  Publication   \n  \n The proceedings will be published by Springer as part of Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) , a subseries of LNCS dedicated to artificial intelligence research. Please note that for a paper to be published, at least one of its authors must pay a full registration fee.  \n Proceedings from prior AIME conferences can be viewed on SpringerLink .  \n Authors of the best accepted papers will be invited to expand and refine their manuscripts for possible publication in the Elsevier journal Artificial Intelligence in Medicine .  \n\n  Co-Chairs of AIME 2025   \n  \n Blaž Zupan, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia (Program Committee Chair)  \n Riccardo Bellazzi, University of Pavia, Italy (Local Organization Chair)  \n Lucia Sacchi, University of Pavia, Italy (Local Organization Chair)  \n José M.

Separate OA options are available for an additional fee payable by the organizers. In the new model,  all ICPS papers published in the DL will automatically be made OA, and production/OA fees will no longer be charged to conference organizers.  Papers that fall into the following categories  will be published in the DL at no charge  :   \n If the corresponding author is affiliated with an institution participating in ACM’s transformative  ACM Open model  . | A list of the 700+ institutions currently participating in ACM Open is available  here  . \n  Note that, by the end of 2024, we expect roughly 50% of papers published in the DL to be covered by ACM Open agreements; by the end of 2025, we expect the proportion to rise to 60%-70%; and, in the longer term, we expect to get to roughly 80%. \n  If the country in which your institution is located is on  this list of countries  covered by ACM’s agreements with  EIFL  and  Research4Life  and/or classified by the World Bank as low-income countries. \n\n Page updated     \n   \n Google Sites   \n   \n Report abuse   \n\n  ",

The conference sessions included presentations on Ubiquitous, Parallel and Distributed Computing (including cloud, IoT, network, sensors, and blockchain technologies); Security, Privacy, and Trust; Data Science, Knowledge Engineering, and Ontologies (including Information Retrieval, Big Data, Databases, and Knowledge Systems); Artificial Intelligence & Cognitive Systems; Natural Language Processing; and Multimedia, Computer Vision, and Image Processing.   \n Dr. Griffor’s keynote on using Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) to assess autonomous system performance described current progress on developing performance metrics for these systems. Griffor plotted the evolution of system energy/processing usage as an AI-equipped system reasons, and learns, about its operating environment, and he explained how the system reduces the “informational dimension” of its operating environment, improving its overall performance. Griffor pointed to how the system’s rules emerge and make action progressively more energy/processing efficient. As action patterns emerge, these rules can be “exported” as structure in the environment, resulting in autonomous systems that can manage tradeoffs between the limited resources of time and energy to meet quality objectives.   \n Dr. Zhang’s keynote on edge AI and 6G discussed the essential roles of edge AI in 6G and beyond networks. Zhang described how edge computing has evolved to edge AI, and how edge AI is further evolving toward an AI continuum that seamlessly spans from the user to the cloud. He discussed how edge AI and the AI continuum are becoming increasingly important for future AI and 6G networks. He further discussed possible initial steps toward an AI-native 6G network architecture that will be enabled by edge AI and the AI continuum.   \n Dr. Battou’s keynote on quantum networking described current work on the Multiverse platform for quantum networks and experiments management. He explained the choice of microservices for the architecture and the Vert.x framework for its implementation. He then detailed services such as Topology, Configuration, Fault, and Security and how they are currently used in the NIST testbed and the Washington Metropolitan Quantum Network Research Consortium (DC-QNet).   \n\n Advanced communications , Quantum communications , Wireless (RF) , Information technology , Artificial intelligence , Applied AI , Machine learning , Cyber-physical systems , Internet of Things (IoT) , Networking , Mobile and wireless networking , Network management and monitoring , Network modeling and analysis , Network security and robustness , Network test and measurement , Next generation networks , Protocol design and standardization , Software defined and virtual networks , Standards and Documentary standards   \n\n Technical Contact  \n  Dr. Edward Griffor | edward.griffor@nist.gov | (202) 430-2117 \n  Tao Zhang | tao.zhang@nist.gov | (301) 975-3647 \n  Abdella Battou | abdella.battou@nist.gov | (301) 975-5247 \n\n Organizations  \n NIST Headquarters \n  Laboratory Programs \n  Communications Technology Laboratory \n  Smart Connected Systems Division \n  IoT Devices and Infrastructures Group \n  Transformational Networks and Services Group \n\n Sign up for updates from NIST  \n  Enter Email Address       \n\n Released December 1, 2024, Updated February 4, 2025   \n\n HEADQUARTERS  \n 100 Bureau Drive  \n  Gaithersburg, MD 20899  \n  301-975-2000  Webmaster | Contact Us | Our Other Offices  \n\n X.com        (link is external)     Facebook        (link is external)     LinkedIn        (link is external)     Instagram        (link is external)     YouTube        (link is external)     Giphy        (link is external)     RSS Feed  Mailing List        (link is external)       \n How are we doing?

We also invite submissions that address methodological issues and standards in the experimental evaluation of algorithms and data structures.  \n Relevant areas of applied algorithmic research include but are not limited to databases; geometry; graphs and networks, including web applications; operations research; combinatorial aspects of scientific computing; and computational problems in the natural sciences or engineering.  \n Also encouraged are submissions that address algorithms and data structures for advanced models of computing, including memory hierarchies and parallel computing, ranging from instruction parallelism over multicore computing to high-performance and cloud computing.  \n Proceedings will be posted online in January 2025. ALENEX is supported by SIAM.  \n Since researchers in all fields are approaching the problem of learning detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect that interesting synergies will develop between the co-located conferences.  \n ALENEX will be held jointly with:  \n  ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA)  \n  SIAM Symposium on Simplicity in Algorithms (SOSA)  \n Connect with Others on LinkedIn  \n\n Program Committee Co-chairs  \n Jonathan Berry  \n Sandia National Laboratories, U.S.  \n\n Kathrin Hanauer  \n University of Vienna, Austria  \n\n Program Committee  \n Anne Benoit  \n ENS Lyon - LIP, France  \n\n Christina Boucher  \n University of Florida, U.S.  \n\n Maike Buchin  \n Ruhr Universität Bochum, Germany  \n\n David Bunde  \n Knox College, U.S.  \n\n Donatella Firmani  \n Sapienza University, Italy  \n\n Kasimir Gabert  \n Sandia National Laboratories, U.S.  \n\n Mahantesh Halappanavar  \n Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, U.S.  \n\n Stephen Kobourov  \n University of Arizona, U.S.  \n\n Jakub Łącki  \n Google Research, U.S.  \n\n Johannes Langguth  \n Simula Research Laboratory, Norway  \n\n Richard Peng  \n Carnegie Mellon University, U.S.  \n\n A.

Participants who are unable to travel for various reasons (health, caring requirements, visa status, costs, etc.) are offered an online channel. With a hybrid format, we aim to increase the accessibility of participating in research communities throughout the workshop.  \n The ALTA 2024 workshop is the key local forum for socialising research results in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics (CL). It will feature presentations, posters, and demonstrations from students, industry, and academic researchers. Like previous years, we also encourage submissions and participation from industry and government researchers and developers.  \n Note that ALTA is listed in the CORE 2023 Conference Rankings as Australasian C. See details from the CORE Rankings Portal .  \n Topics Permalink    \n ALTA invites the submission of papers and presentations on all aspects of NLP and CL, including, but not limited to:  \n Commonsense Reasoning. \n  Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics. \n  Dialogue and Interactive Systems. \n  Discourse and Pragmatics. \n  Efficient Methods for NLP. \n  Ethics in NLP. \n  Information Extraction. \n  Information Retrieval and Text Mining. \n  Interpretability, Interactivity and Analysis of Models for NLP. \n  Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond. \n  Language Modeling and Analysis of Language Models. \n  Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics. \n  Machine Learning for NLP. \n  Machine Translation. \n  Multilinguality and Linguistic Diversity. \n  Natural Language Generation. \n  NLP Applications. \n  Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation. \n  Question Answering. \n  Resources and Evaluation. \n  Semantics: Lexical, Sentence level, Document Level, Textual Inference, etc. \n  Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining. \n  Speech and Multimodality. \n  Summarisation. \n  Syntax, Parsing and their Applications. \n  We particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community by considering practical applications of language technology and multidisciplinary research. We also specifically encourage submissions from the industry.  \n Format Permalink    \n We invite submissions of three different formats: (1) Original Research Papers, (2) Abstract-based Presentations, and (3) Industry Demonstrations.  \n (1) Original Research Papers Permalink    \n We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of NLP and CL.  \n Long papers should be 7-8 pages, and short papers should be 3-4 pages (see further details below). Accepted papers will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site. In addition to the page count requirements, both short and long papers may include unlimited pages of references.  \n Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly, submitted papers should not include the identity of the author(s) and the text should be suitably anonymised, e.g. using third-person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your personal website, properly anonymising public repositories, etc. Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.  \n (2) Abstract-based Presentations Permalink    \n To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialisation of international results, we invite 1-2 page presentation abstracts. The organisers may offer the opportunity to give an oral or poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site. Submissions should include the presentation title and abstract, the name of the presenter, any publications relating to the work, and any information on collaboration with the local ALTA community. Abstracts will not be published in the proceedings but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent, and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged. ALTA invites submissions of all manner of interesting research, not limited to but including:  \n established academics giving an overview of an exciting paper or paper/s published in international venues; \n  completing research students giving an overview of their thesis work; \n  early candidature research students presenting their work in progress and ideas that may not have been published. \n  Presentation abstracts should not be anonymised, any publications relating to the work should be cited in the submission, and the person who will give the presentation should be clearly stated.  \n (3) Industry Demonstrations Permalink    \n To encourage industry participation and networking opportunities, we are thrilled to announce a track for industry demonstrations, which provides an exciting opportunity for industry researchers to showcase their NLP applications. You should submit a proposal that is 1-2 pages long, containing (1) a description of the software, tools or applications that will be presented and how NLP techniques are used to address a specific problem and (2) a brief introduction of your organisation. The proposals will be reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to select demonstrations that best align with the interests of the ALTA community.  \n Multiple Submission Policy Permalink    \n Original research papers under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We require that you declare at submission that your paper has been submitted to another venue and identify the venue. Should your paper be accepted to ALTA and another venue, we will allow you to decide whether the paper should be published in the ALTA proceedings or treated as a presentation (without archival publication). In this case, you can still present a research talk at the ALTA workshop. This is to encourage more internationally leading research to be presented at the workshop.  \n Instructions for Authors Permalink    \n Paper Submission Permalink    \n Authors should submit their papers via OpenReview using the ‘‘ALTA 2024 Workshop Submission’’ button.  \n Important Notice Regarding OpenReview Profile Creation Permalink    \n We would like to notify authors about OpenReview’s profile creation policy:  \n Profiles created without an institutional email (e.g., using Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) will undergo a moderation process that may take up to two weeks for approval. \n  Profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically without any delay. \n  To avoid any delays, we strongly recommend using an institutional email when creating your OpenReview profile  . Otherwise, please be aware of the potential two-week moderation period and plan accordingly towards the paper submission deadline.  \n Thank you for your understanding.  \n Formatting Guidelines Permalink    \n Submissions must follow the two-column ACL format. We therefore strongly recommend you use LaTeX style files or the Microsoft Word template from https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files .  \n Paper Length Permalink    \n Long papers: | 7-8 pages of content. \n  Plus, unlimited pages of references and appendices. \n  Short papers: | 3-4 pages. \n  Plus, unlimited pages of references and appendices. \n  About the appendices: While the appendix length is unlimited, it is essential to notify the authors that reviewers are not required to read it.

Participants who are unable to travel for various reasons (health, caring requirements, visa status, costs, etc.) are offered an online channel. With a hybrid format, we aim to increase the accessibility of participating in research communities throughout the workshop.  \n The ALTA 2024 workshop is the key local forum for socialising research results in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics (CL). It will feature presentations, posters, and demonstrations from students, industry, and academic researchers. Like previous years, we also encourage submissions and participation from industry and government researchers and developers.  \n Note that ALTA is listed in the CORE 2023 Conference Rankings as Australasian C. See details from the CORE Rankings Portal .  \n Topics Permalink    \n ALTA invites the submission of papers and presentations on all aspects of NLP and CL, including, but not limited to:  \n Commonsense Reasoning. \n  Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics. \n  Dialogue and Interactive Systems. \n  Discourse and Pragmatics. \n  Efficient Methods for NLP. \n  Ethics in NLP. \n  Information Extraction. \n  Information Retrieval and Text Mining. \n  Interpretability, Interactivity and Analysis of Models for NLP. \n  Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond. \n  Language Modeling and Analysis of Language Models. \n  Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics. \n  Machine Learning for NLP. \n  Machine Translation. \n  Multilinguality and Linguistic Diversity. \n  Natural Language Generation. \n  NLP Applications. \n  Phonology, Morphology and Word Segmentation. \n  Question Answering. \n  Resources and Evaluation. \n  Semantics: Lexical, Sentence level, Document Level, Textual Inference, etc. \n  Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis, and Argument Mining. \n  Speech and Multimodality. \n  Summarisation. \n  Syntax, Parsing and their Applications. \n  We particularly encourage submissions that broaden the scope of our community by considering practical applications of language technology and multidisciplinary research. We also specifically encourage submissions from the industry.  \n Format Permalink    \n We invite submissions of three different formats: (1) Original Research Papers, (2) Abstract-based Presentations, and (3) Industry Demonstrations.  \n (1) Original Research Papers Permalink    \n We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of NLP and CL.  \n Long papers should be 7-8 pages, and short papers should be 3-4 pages (see further details below). Accepted papers will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site. In addition to the page count requirements, both short and long papers may include unlimited pages of references.  \n Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly, submitted papers should not include the identity of the author(s) and the text should be suitably anonymised, e.g. using third-person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your personal website, properly anonymising public repositories, etc. Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.  \n (2) Abstract-based Presentations Permalink    \n To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialisation of international results, we invite 1-2 page presentation abstracts. The organisers may offer the opportunity to give an oral or poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site. Submissions should include the presentation title and abstract, the name of the presenter, any publications relating to the work, and any information on collaboration with the local ALTA community. Abstracts will not be published in the proceedings but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent, and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Abstracts on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged. ALTA invites submissions of all manner of interesting research, not limited to but including:  \n established academics giving an overview of an exciting paper or paper/s published in international venues; \n  completing research students giving an overview of their thesis work; \n  early candidature research students presenting their work in progress and ideas that may not have been published. \n  Presentation abstracts should not be anonymised, any publications relating to the work should be cited in the submission, and the person who will give the presentation should be clearly stated.  \n (3) Industry Demonstrations Permalink    \n To encourage industry participation and networking opportunities, we are thrilled to announce a track for industry demonstrations, which provides an exciting opportunity for industry researchers to showcase their NLP applications. You should submit a proposal that is 1-2 pages long, containing (1) a description of the software, tools or applications that will be presented and how NLP techniques are used to address a specific problem and (2) a brief introduction of your organisation. The proposals will be reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to select demonstrations that best align with the interests of the ALTA community.  \n Multiple Submission Policy Permalink    \n Original research papers under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We require that you declare at submission that your paper has been submitted to another venue and identify the venue. Should your paper be accepted to ALTA and another venue, we will allow you to decide whether the paper should be published in the ALTA proceedings or treated as a presentation (without archival publication). In this case, you can still present a research talk at the ALTA workshop. This is to encourage more internationally leading research to be presented at the workshop.  \n Instructions for Authors Permalink    \n Paper Submission Permalink    \n Authors should submit their papers via OpenReview using the ‘‘ALTA 2024 Workshop Submission’’ button.  \n Important Notice Regarding OpenReview Profile Creation Permalink    \n We would like to notify authors about OpenReview’s profile creation policy:  \n Profiles created without an institutional email (e.g., using Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) will undergo a moderation process that may take up to two weeks for approval. \n  Profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically without any delay. \n  To avoid any delays, we strongly recommend using an institutional email when creating your OpenReview profile  . Otherwise, please be aware of the potential two-week moderation period and plan accordingly towards the paper submission deadline.  \n Thank you for your understanding.  \n Formatting Guidelines Permalink    \n Submissions must follow the two-column ACL format. We therefore strongly recommend you use LaTeX style files or the Microsoft Word template from https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files .  \n Paper Length Permalink    \n Long papers: | 7-8 pages of content. \n  Plus, unlimited pages of references and appendices. \n  Short papers: | 3-4 pages. \n  Plus, unlimited pages of references and appendices. \n  About the appendices: While the appendix length is unlimited, it is essential to notify the authors that reviewers are not required to read it. The main text should be self-explanatory, with the appendix used only to highlight additional details. \n  Abstracts ideally should be a few paragraphs and no more than two (2) pages. \n  Industry demonstration proposals should be 1-2 pages. \n  Anonymisation Permalink    \n Short and long papers must be anonymised. \n  Abstracts are NOT to be anonymised and must include the author’s/authors’ affiliation. \n\n Follow: \n  Twitter \n  Mastodon \n  LinkedIn \n  GitHub \n  Join the ALTA Slack \n  ALTA \n  Feed \n    \n © 2025 ALTA.
