## Paper Types

When writing or evaluating a SoCG paper, it is important to keep in mind that there are different types of contributions, each with its own strengths. To ensure that a submission is evaluated on its own merits, authors will need to identify the main strengths of their submission, as captured by four possible paper types. PC members and external reviewers will be asked to take into account these paper types together with their associated evaluation criteria when they evaluate a paper. There are no quotas for the paper types, and submissions can be labeled with more than one paper type at the time of submission:

*   **Mathematical Foundations:** A typical paper will contain theorems and proofs describing new results in discrete or combinatorial geometry, discrete differential geometry or topology, or in topological combinatorics.
*   **Algorithmic Complexity:** A typical paper will contain algorithms, data structures, theorems, proofs, or lower bound constructions describing new results on computational geometry problems.
*   **Experiments and Implementation:** A typical paper will make a clear contribution to the implementation and evaluation of geometric algorithms.
*   **Applications:** A typical paper will describe the modeling and algorithmic choices made when developing or adapting computational geometry techniques for an application area.

## Double Blind and PC Submissions

SoCG will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process, and will allow PC members (other than the PC chairs) to submit to the conference as well. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way.

## Format

Submissions must be formatted in accordance with the LIPIcs proceedings guidelines. Authors are required to use the LaTeX class file [socg-lipics-v2021.cls](https://computational-geometry.org/documents/socg-lipics-v2021.cls) (V0.9, Sep 19, 2022), with the option “anonymous”. Submissions must not exceed 500 lines, excluding front matter (title), references, and a clearly marked appendix.

## Contents of the Submission

Papers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract, which begins with the title of the paper, as well as a short abstract. This should be followed by the main body of the paper that begins with a precise statement of the problem considered, a succinct summary of the results obtained (emphasizing the significance, novelty, and potential impact of the research), and a clear comparison with related work.

## Appendix and Additional Data

All details needed to verify the results must be provided. Supporting materials, including proofs of theoretical claims and experimental details, that do not fit in the 500-line limit should be given in an appendix. If more appropriate, the full version may be given as the appendix. In both cases, however, the authors should include in the main part specific pointers to the relevant locations in the appendix.

## Previous or Simultaneous Submissions

Results previously published or accepted for publication in the proceedings of another conference cannot be submitted. Simultaneous submissions of the results to another conference with published proceedings are not allowed.

## Accepted Papers

*   **Presentation:** An author of each accepted paper is expected to attend the symposium and present the paper (approximately 20 minutes).
*   **Best paper award:** An accepted paper may be selected as the best paper.
*   **Best student paper award:** An accepted paper may be selected as the best student paper.
*   **Best student presentation award:** Based on the feedback from the audience, a presentation during the symposium by a student may be selected as the best student presentation.

## Invited papers and special issues

Authors of the best paper will be invited to submit an extended version of their paper to the Journal of the ACM, and authors of one (or more) most highly ranked papers may be invited to submit their full paper to the journal TheoretiCS. Authors of a selection of accepted papers from the symposium will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to special issues of Discrete & Computational Geometry and Journal of Computational Geometry.

SOSP 2025 will be held from October 13-16, 2025 at the Lotte Hotel World in Seoul, Republic of Korea.","# SOSP 2025: Call for Papers

The 31st ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP) will be held from **October 13-16, 2025 at the Lotte Hotel World in Seoul, Republic of Korea**.

SOSP seeks to present innovative and exciting research related to the design, implementation, analysis, evaluation, and deployment of computer systems software.

## Topics

SOSP takes a broad view of systems and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including:

*   Operating systems
*   File and storage systems
*   Distributed systems
*   Cloud computing
*   Mobile and edge systems
*   Secure and reliable systems
*   Systems aspects of big data and machine learning
*   Embedded and real-time systems
*   Virtualization
*   Networking as it relates to operating systems
*   Management and troubleshooting of complex systems

We also welcome work that explores the interaction of computer systems with related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, verification, and databases.

## Submission Criteria

Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. A good paper will:

*   Motivate a significant problem
*   Propose and implement an interesting, compelling solution
*   Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution
*   Draw appropriate conclusions
*   Clearly describe the paper's contributions
*   Articulate the advances beyond previous work
*   Be accessible to the broader systems community

We encourage submission of groundbreaking work in significant new directions, with the understanding that the evaluation criteria for papers addressing new problems may be different from those continuing a line of work in a more established area.

## Originality

Submissions should contain original, unpublished material. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism is not allowed.

## Resubmissions

Submitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted, although authors are expected to have improved the paper to address substantive issues raised in previous reviews.  Authors should provide information regarding the previous submission(s) and a summary of the subsequent revisions to the paper. This description, which will be supplied to reviewers after they’ve completed their reviews, helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit the description of changes to one page.

## Anonymity

SOSP will use double-blind reviewing. Please make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission.

## Supplementary Material

Authors may optionally include supplementary material as a separate document.  PC members are not required to read this optional supplementary material, so the submission must stand alone without it.

## Formatting

Papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format.

Submissions may have at most 12 pages of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit.

Submissions violating these rules will not be considered for publication, and there will be no extensions for fixing violations.

## Confidentiality

Reviewing will be done mostly by members of the program committee, with limited use of outside reviewers. Submissions will be treated as confidential; however, papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered for publication.

## Conflicts

To avoid conflicts of interest in the review process, when you register and submit your paper, we ask that you provide information about conflicts between any of the authors of your submission and PC members.

## Author Response Period

SOSP will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting.

## Accepted Papers

Papers selected by the program committee will receive conditional acceptance, with the final acceptance subject to revisions and approval by a program committee member acting as a shepherd.

## Submission Information

Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the [web submission form](https://sosp25.hotcrp.com/).

## Instructions for Paper Submission

All submissions must be original work. Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection.

## Anonymous Submission

Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review.

## Conflicts of Interest

During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members.

## Research Ethics Committee

IEEE S&P 2025 has a research ethics committee (REC) that will check papers flagged by reviewers as potentially including ethically fraught research.

## Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure

Where research identifies a vulnerability, we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users.

## Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research

Submissions that describe experiments that could be viewed as involving human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:

*   Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable.
*   Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect.

## Financial and Non-financial Competing Interests

In the interests of transparency, the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy requires authors and PC members to declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in relation to the work described.

## Page Limit and Formatting

Submitted papers may include up to 13 pages of text and up to 5 pages for references and appendices, totaling no more than 18 pages. Papers must be formatted for US letter (not A4) size paper. All submissions must use the IEEE “compsoc” conference proceedings template.

## Withdrawing Policy

A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper cannot be withdrawn.

## Authorship Policy

Changes to the authorship list (adding or removing authors) are not permitted after paper submission. Changes to the authors’ affiliation after paper acceptance are not permitted without PC chairs’ approval.

## Conference Submission Server

*   First deadline: [https://cycle1.sp2025.ieee-security.org/](https://cycle1.sp2025.ieee-security.org/)
*   Second deadline: [https://cycle2.sp2025.ieee-security.org/](https://cycle2.sp2025.ieee-security.org/)

## Publication and Presentation

Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication clearances. One of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference.

## Theory vs. Experiments

A submission naturally falls into one of the following three categories:

1.  Theory (main contributions are theoretical)
2.  Experiments (main contributions are experimental)
3.  Theory and Experiments (main contributions are a mix of theory and experiments)

To help assign suitable reviewers, please indicate which category the submission belongs to during the submission process.

## Double-Blind Policy

SPAA 2025 will employ a lightweight double-blind review process. That means, the submission should omit authors’ names, affiliations, and contact information. In addition, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, the reference should be made in the third person.

## Conflict of Interest Policy

To ensure a fair and high-quality reviewing process, we ask ALL authors of a submitted paper to register their conflicts with the PC members at the submission site. The following categories are considered as a conflict of interest:

1.  Academic advisor or advisee (with no time limit)
2.  Postdoctoral mentor or mentee (with no time limit)
3.  Collaborators within the past three years
4.  Members of the same institution within the past 3 years
5.  Family members or close friends
6.  Someone involved in an alleged incident of harassment
7.  Anyone whose relationship with an author would prevent the reviewer from being objective in his/her assessment"

The 27th International Symposium on Stabilization, Safety, and Security of Distributed Systems (SSS 2025) will take place from **October 9-11, 2025**, at the **Aloft Hotel Kathmandu in Kathmandu, Nepal**.

SSS is an international forum for researchers and practitioners in the design and development of distributed systems with a focus on systems that are able to provide guarantees on their structure, performance, and/or security in the face of an adverse operational environment.

## Tracks

The symposium encourages submissions of original contributions on both fundamental research and practical applications concerning topics in the symposium tracks:

*   **Track A. Stabilization and Locality in Distributed Computing**
*   **Track B. Time, Safety, and Security in Distributed Computing**
*   **Track C. Moving and Computing**

## New Conference Model

We experiment with a new conference model. There will be **THREE non-overlapping deadlines**, and thus three submission rounds. Papers that are rejected at an early round (1 or 2) may be reworked, corrected, enhanced, and resubmitted at a later round (2 or 3), if wished by the authors. In case of resubmission, reviews from the previously submitted round will be transmitted to the reviewers of the resubmission round.

## Paper Submission

Papers are to be submitted electronically through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sss2025). All submissions must conform to the formatting instructions of the Springer LNCS series. Each submission must be an original work written in English, in PDF format.

## Double-blind Review

All submissions must be anonymous. We use a somewhat relaxed implementation of double-blind peer review: you are free to disseminate your work through arXiv and other online repositories and give presentations on your work as usual. However, please make sure you do not mention your own name or affiliation in the submission, and please do not include obvious references in the text that reveal your identity.

## Submissions

There are two types of submissions: regular papers and brief announcements.

*   A regular submission must not exceed 15 pages (including the title, abstract, figures, and excluding references).
*   A brief announcement submission must not exceed 5 pages including everything.

Any submission deviating from these guidelines will be rejected without consideration of its merits.

## Publication

Regular papers and brief announcements will be included in the conference proceedings. Conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS conference series.

## Special Issue

Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of an international journal (under negotiation).

## Paper Award

Prizes will be given to the best regular paper and best student regular paper.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are 11:59 PM AoE (Anywhere on Earth).

The 57th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC 2025) will be held in **Prague, Czech Republic, from Monday, June 23 to Friday, June 27, 2025** at the **OREA Hotel Pyramida**.

Papers presenting new and original research on the theory of computation are sought. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include:

*   Algorithms and data structures
*   Computational complexity
*   Randomness in computing
*   Algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics
*   Analysis of Boolean functions
*   Approximation algorithms
*   Cryptography
*   Computational learning theory
*   Continuous and discrete optimization
*   Economics and computation
*   Parallel and distributed algorithms

Papers that extend the reach of the theory of computing, or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis, are encouraged. The program committee will make every effort to consider a broad range of areas.

## Submission Format

Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information, and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the ""full version"" of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea. Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.

Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

STOC 2025 will use double-blind reviewing, and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity, and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person.

## Submission Instructions

Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing). The [submission server](https://stoc25.hotcrp.com/) is scheduled to open on October 1, 2024.

It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline.

## Important Dates

*   **Paper submission deadline:** Monday, November 4, 2024, 7:59 pm EST. There is no separate abstract submission deadline.
*   **Notification date:** By email on or before February 1, 2025.
*   **Camera-ready versions of accepted papers:** A camera-ready copy of each accepted paper is required by March 31, 2025. The format of your paper must strictly adhere to the ACM Format, and specifically the sigconf option. (LaTeX users, please use: `\documentclass[sigconf,screen]{acmart}`).
*   **STOC talks:** Monday morning June 23 to Friday afternoon June 27, 2025.
*   **Publication date:** The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference.

## Awards

*   **Best Paper Award:** The program committee may designate up to three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best Papers. All submissions are automatically eligible.
*   **Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award:** A prize of $500 will be given to the author(s) of the best student-authored paper (or split between more than one paper if there is a tie). A paper is eligible if all of its authors are full-time students at the time of submission.

TAP 2024 was the 18th International Conference on Tests and Proofs. TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability.

## Scope

Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of dynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic techniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are complementary rather than mutually exclusive.

TAP’s scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology including foundational work, tool development, and empirical research. Topics of interest center around the combination of static techniques such as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.

## Topics of Interest

Papers were solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

*   Verification and analysis techniques combining proofs and tests
*   Static analysis of programs with the aid of dynamic techniques
*   Deductive techniques supporting the automated generation of test vectors and oracles
*   Deductive techniques supporting (novel) definitions of coverage criteria
*   Specification inference by deductive or dynamic methods
*   Testing and runtime analysis of formal specifications
*   Search-based techniques for proving and testing
*   Testing and Verification of systems based on machine learning
*   Verification of verification tools and environments

## Paper Categories

There are four submission categories:

*   **Regular papers:** They contain original research not yet communicated to other conferences or any journal. Regular papers should not exceed 15 pages.
*   **Short papers:** They are intended for communicating fresh new original research which is not yet complete or still needs some development. Short papers should not exceed 6 pages.
*   **Late-breaking abstract:** They are informal presentations of new research and/or research direction proposals. They should not exceed 3 pages.
*   **Posters:** Posters should be one page in A0 format (plus 1 page abstract).

Only accepted regular and short papers will appear in the LNCS proceedings. All paper categories will go through a review process suitable for the given category.

## Authors Guidelines

Submitted papers must describe work not previously published, and they must neither be accepted nor under review at a journal or at another conference with refereed proceedings.

## Paper Preparation

Authors are required to submit their manuscripts electronically in PDF using the LNCS style.  Papers should respect the page limits announced above; full proofs may appear in a clearly marked technical appendix which can be read by the reviewers.

The submission process is completely managed via the EasyChair website: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ucnc2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ucnc2025)

## Preparing the Final Version for the Proceedings

The final versions of accepted papers must be formatted in LaTeX using Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes style.  Please also consult the [Instructions for Authors](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/editor-guidelines-for-springer-proceedings) provided by Springer. The final version should be uploaded on the Easychair website in zipped format containing the following:

*   The final source files, including bib files, images, non-standard LaTeX packages, etc.
*   A final PDF file corresponding exactly to the final source files.
*   A license-to-publish agreement, signed by hand by the corresponding author on behalf of all of the authors of the paper.
