 The 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks 
 Naples, Italy, June 23-26, 2025 
 Welcome 
 On behalf of the Organizing Committee, we extend you a warm welcome to the 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2025), organized by Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Italy. Over the years DSN has become a forum to present the best world research in the fusion between dependability and security research, understanding the need to simultaneously fight against accidental faults, intentional cyber-attacks, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions. We are looking forward to a conference filled with ideas from industry and academia. 
 DSN 2025 will be held in Naples, Italy from 23 to 26 June 2025. Naples, an enchanting city of sea and culture. Naples was founded by Greeks in the first millennium BC and is one of the oldest continuously inhabited urban areas in the world. Naples is the capital of Campania lies in the bay of the same name next to the volcano Vesuvius and offers a spectacular view as far as the islands of Capri, Ischia, and Procida. Naples' historic city center is the largest in Europe and has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A wide range of culturally and historically significant sites are nearby, including the Palace of Caserta and the Roman ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Naples is also known for its natural beauties, such as Posillipo, Phlegraean Fields, Nisida, and Vesuvius. Neapolitan cuisine is noted for its association with pizza, which originated in the city, as well as numerous other local dishes. 
 We look forward to meeting you in Naples!!!

 DSN 2025 
 The 55th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks 
 Naples, Italy, June 23-26, 2025 
  
 DSN-2025: Research Track Call For Contributions 
 Society is increasingly dependent on the robust functioning of all types of computing systems. These systems include mobile/edge devices, networks, personal computers, and large-scale systems and critical infrastructures that provide services we use in our everyday lives for many applications and problems. Failure, incorrect operation, or compromise of computing systems and networks can have dire implications for the safety and security of human and other lives and the environment. 
  
 The Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN) is devoted to the mission of ensuring that the computing systems and networks on which society relies are robust, i.e., dependable and secure. 
  
 DSN, one of the longest-running IEEE conferences organizing its 55th edition in 2025, has pioneered the fusion between dependability and security research under a common body of knowledge, understanding the need to simultaneously fight against accidental faults, intentional (malicious) attacks, design errors, and unexpected operating conditions. Its distinctive approach to both accidental faults and malicious attacks has made DSN the most prestigious international forum for presenting research that pushes the boundaries in the robustness and resilience of a wide spectrum of computing systems and networks. 
  
 All aspects of research and practice of computer system robustness (i.e., dependability and security) are within the scope of DSN. Relevant topics include but are not limited to: 1) innovative systems, architectures, protocols, and algorithms for preventing, detecting, diagnosing, eliminating, or recovering from accidental and malicious threats as well as 2) practical experimentation with and assessment of the robustness (dependability and security) of all types of computing systems and networks. 
  
 Authors are invited to submit original papers on all topics within this broad scope. Example topical areas include but are not limited to the following: 
  
 Hardware (e.g., microprocessors, memory systems, systems on chip, I/O devices, storage systems, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), edge and mobile devices, data center infrastructure, hardware accelerators, emerging technologies, emerging paradigms like processing in memory & quantum computing) 
 Software (e.g., applications, middleware, distributed algorithms, operating systems, software security, dependable software design) 
 Networked systems and clouds (e.g., wireless networks, mobility, software-defined networking, edge computing, cloud computing/storage, networks on chip, network security) 
 Autonomous systems (e.g., self-driving vehicles, autonomous robots, assured autonomy, explainable decision-making, acceptability, privacy issues) 
 Cyber-physical systems (e.g., embedded systems, real-time control of critical systems, internet of things, smart grid, automotive, aerospace, railway, medical systems, security and safety of cyber-physical systems) 
 Distributed ledgers/Blockchain (e.g., BFT/consensus algorithms, cryptocurrencies, decentralized storage, zero-knowledge proofs) 
 AI/Machine Learning for resilient systems (e.g., robust, resilient, secure, and explainable AI/Machine Learning techniques; applications of AI/ML techniques for dependability and security, robustness issues in AI/ML systems) 
 Models and methodologies for programming, evaluating, verifying, and assessing robust (dependable and secure) systems (e.g., performance and dependability evaluation, analytical and numerical methods, simulation, experimentation, benchmarking, verification, field data analysis) 
 Emerging technologies and computing paradigms (e.g., robustness, security, dependability issues of emerging memory and storage systems, emerging computing paradigms like quantum computing, processing in memory/sensors/storage/network, 3-dimensional architectures, new hardware/software cooperative paradigms, emerging programming and system paradigms)

 Information to authors 
 Innovative papers in all areas of robust (dependable and secure) systems and networks will be considered. Papers will be assessed with criteria appropriate to each category. The conference broadly and inclusively favors innovative and insightful research that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with (or measurements of) state-of-the-art systems. Submissions will be judged on insight, originality, significance, correctness, and potential impact. 
  
 Research Papers, Practical Experience Reports, and Tool Descriptions will be refereed and included in the Proceedings of the DSN 2025, if accepted. 
  
 All contributions must be written in English. IEEE Computer Society will publish accepted contributions. 
  
 At least one author of every accepted paper is expected to register (as a regular registration) for the conference and present the work in person. 
  
 Paper Categories 
 When submitting, authors have to select one of the following categories: 
  
 Regular papers (11 pages): a full paper describing a research contribution, including experimental work focused on implementation and evaluation of existing techniques in the DSN thematic areas. Papers should clearly describe a novel scientific contribution and a significant advancement of the state of knowledge in DSN-relevant topics. The paper should address a significant problem with a compelling solution whose validity and practical applicability are clearly discussed. 
  
 Practical experience reports (7 pages): a shorter paper describing practitioner experiences or lessons learned applying tools and techniques to real-world problems and systems, or based on the empirical analysis of field data using a rigorous scientific approach. A paper in this category is expected to show new insights and experiences informing the research and practice of robust computing system design. Contributions reporting on industry practical experiences and lessons learned are highly encouraged, including studies reporting negative results or challenges about the practical applicability or scalability of research results in industry. 
  
 Tool descriptions/demonstrations (7 pages): descriptions of the architecture, implementation, and usage of substantive tools to aid the research and practice of dependability. A tool paper is expected to describe and demonstrate the value that the tool brings to the dependability community. Making the tool publicly available, whenever possible, is strongly encouraged. 
  
 The number of pages indicated above includes everything: title page, text, figures, appendices, etc. Only references are not included in the page limit. Papers that exceed the number of pages for that submission category will be rejected without review. 
  
 Independently of the paper category, we expect all papers to provide enough detail to enable the reproducibility of their experimental results and encourage authors, whenever possible, to make both the artifacts and datasets related to the paper publicly available. 

Artifacts 
 DSN supports open science, where authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their code and datasets publicly available to ensure reproducibility and replicability by other researchers. DSN 2025 will offer a separate artifact evaluation track that is open to all accepted papers from all three categories of the research track. The goals of the artifact track are to (1) increase confidence in a paper’s claims and results, and (2) facilitate future research via publicly available datasets and tools. 
  
 At the time of the submission, authors must indicate (1) whether they intend to submit an artifact for their submission, (2) the type of artifact (code, dataset, or both), (3) a DOI reserved for the artifact on an open-access repository (Zenodo or Figshare), and (4) the badge(s) they are applying for. For more information about how to reserve a DOI and about the three choices available for the badges, see the Call for Artifacts on the DSN’25 website. 
  
 Information about the artifact submission will not be shared with the PC. The artifact does not need to be submitted at the same time as the paper. The artifact can be uploaded at the reserved DOI after the paper submission deadline and can be updated until the artifact submission deadline. 
  
 The artifacts will be evaluated by a dedicated Artifacts Evaluation (AE) committee through a single-blind review process, where authors should be available to respond quickly during the artifact evaluation. All artifacts submitted will compete for a “Distinguished Artifact Award” to be decided by that committee. 
  
 Anonymization Rules 
 Authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their papers. An author should always refer to their own related work in the third person, just like they would refer to any other related work. As an author, you should not identify yourself in the paper either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or acknowledgments). 
  
 Anonymization should not be done in a way to hurt the review process. For example, omitting published references or anonymizing them for the purposes of a double-blind process can significantly hurt the review process. As such, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left un-anonymized, if the system name is important for a reviewer to be able to evaluate the work. For example, a paper on experiences with the design of .NET should not be rewritten to be about "an anonymous but widely used commercial distributed systems platform." 
  
 Additionally, please take the following steps when preparing your submission: 
  
 Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page. 
 Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources. 
 Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. Avoid names that could in any way be interpreted as being derived from the name of an author or identifying an author’s location or affiliation. 
 Use care in referring to related work, particularly your own previously published work. Do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, a good solution is to reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. 
 If you have a concurrent submission, reference it as follows: “Closely related work describes a microkernel implementation [Anonymous 2021].” with the corresponding citation: “[Anonymous 2021] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing.” This is, for example, the case for extended versions of the paper available online. 
 If you cite anonymous work, you must also send the deanonymized reference(s) to the PC chair in a separate email. 
 Authors should also avoid broadly advertising their work in a way that reaches the reviewers even if they are not searching for it (for example, presentations in small meetings or seminars are allowed). It is unacceptable to discuss the work with program committee members. Posting the work on ArXiV or a similar site is within the authors’ rights; however, the authors should use a different title than the submission and they should avoid specifying that the work is under submission to DSN. In particular, please ensure that there are not older versions of the paper on ArXiV that have the same title as the submission. 
  
 Submissions that do not conform to the above submission deadline, anonymization, and formatting guidelines (e.g., are too long, use fonts or line spacing smaller than what is indicated) or are unoriginal, previously published, or under submission to multiple venues, will be disregarded. 
  
 Formatting Rules 
 Submissions must adhere to the IEEE Computer Society camera-ready 8.5″x11″ two-column camera-ready format (using a 10-point font on 12-point single-spaced leading) as implemented by the LaTeX/Word templates available at the IEEE conference template page (last updated in 2019): 
  
 LaTex Package (ZIP) 
  
 Word Template (DOC) 
  
 Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file. All fonts must be embedded in the file. We also strongly recommend you print the file and review it for integrity (fonts, symbols, equations, etc.) before submitting it. A defective printing of your paper can undermine its chance of acceptance. Please take a note of the following: 
  
 Submissions should be anonymous. 
 The page limit includes everything except references. 
 The first page must include the title of the paper, the type of the paper (Regular / Practical Experience / Tool), and a maximum 150-word abstract. 
 Please take into account that the abstract will be used by the reviewers to bid on papers: describe the paper goals clearly, as well as the means used to achieve them. If the title and abstract are not sufficiently descriptive at the time of the abstract deadline, the submission may be rejected without review. 
 The first page is not a separate page, but is a part of the paper (and thus has technical material in it). Thus, this page counts toward the total page budget for the paper. 
 There is no page limit for references - however, authors must not put any text or figures on the pages for the references - if so, those pages will be included in the page limits above (it is acceptable for the references to start on the last page of the paper as long as it is within the page limit). 
 Pages should be numbered. 
 The use of color for figures and graphs is encouraged, but the paper should be easily readable if printed in grayscale. 
 Symbols and labels used in the graphs should be readable as printed, without requiring on-screen magnification. 
 Try to limit the file size to less than 15 MB. 
 Paper Submissions 
 Papers are submitted via the submission website: https://dsn25.hotcrp.com. 
  
 The program committee will perform a double-blind review of all submissions, with help from outside referees. Papers will be held in full confidence during the reviewing process, but papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be rejected without review. 
  
 Authors must anonymize their submissions (see Anonymization Rules). Submissions violating the formatting and anonymization rules will be rejected without review. There will be no extensions for reformatting. 
  
 Awards 
 DSN gives three Best Paper Awards and one of them, based on the quality of the oral presentation, will also receive a Distinguished Best Paper Award. All of them will be presented in a special Best Paper Session at the conference. 
  
 The selection of the candidate papers for the awards is carried out as a three-step process. First, the Program Committee picks 6-7 of the accepted papers based on the review and revision process & committee discussion. Second, the Steering Committee (in consultation with the Program Chairs) chooses among these papers the 3 Best Papers that are to be presented in the Best Paper Session at the conference (all these papers receive the Best Paper Award). Third, and finally, the audience at the conference votes among these Best Papers to select the one that should receive the Distinguished Best Paper Award. Attendees are strongly encouraged to read the Best Papers as well as carefully listen to their presentations, and make their Distinguished Best Paper Award choice based on all information they have about the finalized Best Papers and their presentations at the conference. 
  
 DSN also attributes a group of awards based on nominations. These awards are the William C. Carter Ph.D. Dissertation Award in Dependability, the Rising Star in Dependability Award, the Test-of-Time Award, and the Jean-Claude Laprie Award. Please check the relevant page on the DSN website for additional details. 
  
 As noted above, there will also be a Distinguished Artifact Award. 
  
 Review Process and Author Response 
 This year, as initiated in DSN 2023, in addition to the rebuttal process, DSN is following a Paper Revision Process. For papers that are not early rejects, the authors will be invited to submit a revised paper (as well as a rebuttal) after receiving their reviews. The major goal of the revision process is twofold: 
  
 1. to strengthen the papers by making sure reviewer comments are properly addressed in a revised version; and 
 2. to enable the reviewers to see how their comments are addressed in a revised version (which is especially useful in cases where rebuttal may not have the same effect). 
 Through this process, we give the authors the ability to submit both a revised paper (based on the received reviews) and a rebuttal. These two serve different purposes. In particular, the rebuttal remains useful for at least three purposes that cannot be easily accomplished with a revised paper: 
  
 1. to clarify misunderstandings (and point out any other issues) in the reviews; 
 2. to describe a plan for revisions the author would like to make but need more time for than the revision timeframe allows; and 
 3. to provide a summary of changes that helps the authors to describe how they addressed the reviewer comments in the revised paper. 
 The authors of all papers that are invited for revision will be allowed one extra page to properly address reviewer comments. In other words, the revised (and, if accepted, the final) versions of papers will be allowed 12 pages for regular papers and 8 pages for practical experience reports or tool descriptions/demonstrations. The authors will be asked to mark and describe all the changes they made to the submission during the revision process. More information will be provided to authors of papers who are asked to provide a revision as to how to prepare, format, and submit the revised version of the submission. Note that submitting a revised paper does not guarantee acceptance of the paper to the conference and all revised papers will be reviewed and discussed by the Program Committee. 
  
 To limit the load on the reviewers, the rebuttal will be strictly limited to 750 words. Any attempt to provide extra information, for example by including images in the rebuttal, will cause the rebuttal material to be discarded. 
  
 DSN will continue to employ the Early Rejection Notification Policy. Papers that are rejected in the first reviewing round will receive their rejection notification and reviews by January 27, 2025. As such, the authors may get started earlier on improving their manuscript for a future submission, if they wish to do so. 
  
 All accepted papers will be subject to the revision and approval of a PC member acting as a shepherd. 
  
 Open Science Policy 
 After papers are accepted, the authors are encouraged to make all research results accessible to the public and ensure, if possible, that empirical studies are reproducible. In particular, DSN actively supports the adoption of open source and open data principles and encourages all authors to make their prototypes available to the research community and disclose collected data to increase reproducibility and replicability. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. Accepted papers can participate in the artifact evaluation process described above. 
  
 Ethical considerations 
 Submissions describing experiments with data derived from human subjects or presenting results that might have ethical considerations should discuss how ethical and potential legal concerns were addressed and disclose if an ethics review was conducted (e.g. by the author’s institutional ethics review boards if applicable). Also, if the paper reports a potentially high-impact vulnerability, the authors should discuss the steps they have taken or plan to address these vulnerabilities (e.g., by contacting the vendors/manufacturers). The same applies if the submission deals with personal identifiable information or other kinds of sensitive data (e.g., by following applicable privacy protection regulations and rules). The PC’s review process may examine the ethical soundness of the paper just as it examines the technical soundness. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if insufficient evidence was presented that significant ethical or relevant legal concerns were appropriately addressed. 
  
 Contact the program co-chairs dsn25chairs@gmail.com if you have any questions. 
  
 Conflicts of Interest 
 Authors and PC members are asked to declare potential conflicts during the paper submission and reviewing process. In particular, a conflict of interest must be declared under any of the following conditions: (1) anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission, (2) anyone the author has collaborated or published within the last two years, (3) anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author, or (4) is a relative or close personal friend of the authors. For other forms of conflict and related questions, authors must explain the perceived conflict to the PC chairs. 
  
 Program committee members who have conflicts of interest with a paper, including program co-chairs, will be excluded from any discussion concerning the paper. 
  
 Submission policy for Program chairs and Organizing committee members 
 To avoid potential bias, the DSN Program Committee Co-Chairs are not allowed to (co-)author any submission to the conference. There are no such restrictions for the PC members and other organizing committee members including the General chairs since double-blind anonymization rules and conflict of interest declaration and resolution procedures are enforced. We should emphasize that the DSN General chairs are not involved in any of the processes related to the technical program including the selection of the PC chairs and PC committee and the submission, reviewing, and acceptance of papers.
