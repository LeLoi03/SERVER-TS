 Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) 
 The Dynamic Languages Symposium (DLS) is a forum for discussion of dynamic languages, their implementation and application. While mature dynamic languages including Smalltalk, Lisp, Scheme, Self, Prolog, and APL continue to grow and inspire new converts, a new generation of dynamic scripting languages such as JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Tcl Lua, and Clojure are successful in a wide range of applications. DLS provides a place for researchers and practitioners to come together and share their knowledge, experience, and ideas for future research and development. 
 On Hiatus 
 In 2023, we held a symposium focusing on the Future of Dynamic Languages. Since then, DLS is on a hiatus. 
 For research on dynamic languages, their implementation, tooling, educational approaches analyses, empirical studies, and other research, please consider submitting for instance to theSIGPLAN conferences. 
 Perhaps of most relevance for your work might be the following venues with a large overlap in community: 
 ‹Programming› 
 Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR) 
 For questions or suggestions, please contact theSteering Committee Chair.

 Title: SqueakJS: A Modern and Practical Smalltalk that Runs in Any Browser 
 Conference: DLS 2014 
 Paper: | https://doi.org/10.1145/2661088.2661100 
 Citation: This paper reports on SqueakJS, a fully compatible Squeak/Smalltalk implemented in pure JavaScript. In 2014, it demonstrated that with thoughtful implementation techniques, browsers and their JavaScript VMs can enable applications as dynamic and interactive as Smalltalk environments. Furthermore, the paper details how powerful programming language features such as object enumeration, application snapshotting, custom graphics interfaces as well as basic file abstractions can be realized inside the browser environment. Today, SqueakJS continues to be used in education, for web applications and as environments to preserve important parts of Smalltalk’s history, and with it, computing history. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2023 for 2013 | Recipients: Esteban Allende, Johan Fabry, Éric Tanter 
 Title: Cast Insertion Strategies for Gradually-Typed Objects 
 Conference: DLS 2013 
 Paper: | https://doi.org/10.1145/2508168.2508171 
 Citation: This paper explored the costs, both at micro and macro scale of various strategies for protecting gradual types in a gradually-typed programming language, examining how different strategies affected untyped typed, or both components of code. It is a seminal contribution to understanding the performance of gradual typing, which since then has been an area of important research. The strategies used in gradually-typed languages today can trace their lineage back to the strategies described and proposed in this paper. In particular, the proposed hybrid approach has been adapted time and time again by many systems, giving this work a lasting impact beyond its original scope. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2022 for 2012 | Recipients: Thomas Würthinger, Andreas Wöß, Lukas Stadler, Gilles Duboscq, Doug Simon, and Christian Wimmer 
 Title: Self-optimizing AST interpreters 
 Conference: DLS 2012 
 Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2384577.2384587 
 Citation: Over the past decade, the authors and their collaborators have taken the ideas from this paper and turned it into the Truffle and GraalVM system which has revolutionized how we implement languages on the JVM. Today, the GraalVM is a major product and Truffle is a language implementation technology producing high-performance implementations of everything from Ruby to C all built upon the ideas of AST rewriting in the interpreter. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2021 for 2011 | Recipients: Maxime Chevalier-Boisvert, Erick Lavoie, Marc Feeley, Bruno Dufour 
 Title: Bootstrapping a Self-Hosted Research Virtual Machine for JavaScript: An Experience Report 
 Conference: DLS 2011 
 Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2047849.2047858 
 Citation: The 2011 DLS paper “Bootstrapping a Self-Hosted Research Virtual Machine for JavaScript: An Experience Report” is a great overview and source of ideas for virtual machine development. It represents a comprehensive guide to design choices to make in the space and for that it is still notable today. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2020 for 2010 | Recipients: Tom Van Cutsem and Mark S. Miller 
 Title: Design Principles for Robust Object-oriented Intercession APIs 
 Conference: DLS 2010 
 Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1869631.1869638 
 Citation: The 2010 DLS paper “Proxies: Design Principles for Robust Object-oriented Intercession APIs” is a prime example of the object-capability model. In short order, it managed to bridge the gap from research to become an integral part of an important language today. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2019 for 2009 | Recipients: Alexander Yermolovich, Christian Wimmer, and Michael Franz 
 Title: Optimization of Dynamic Languages Using Hierarchical Layering of Virtual Machines 
 Conference: DLS 2009 
 Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1408688 
 Citation: This 2009 DLS paper is an important early paper in the area of meta virtual machines. It showed a simple and effective approach to VM construction that was simultaneously explored by multiple research groups at the time and which has since found further applications. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2018 for 2008 | Recipients: Jeremy G. Siek and Manish Vachharajani 
 Title: Gradual Typing With Unification-based Inference 
 Conference: DLS 2008 
 Paper: | https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1408681.1408688 
 Citation: The 2008 DLS paper “Gradual Typing With Unification-based Inference” showed that one can increase the static guarantees made in a program through an ingenious combination of gradual typing and unification-base type inference. The ideas underlying this paper have found their way into the design of many modern programming languages, and have had a strong impact on the research community. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2017 for 2007 | Recipients: Stijn Mostinckx, Tom Van Cutsem, Stijn Timbermont, and Éric Tanter 
 Title: Mirages–Behavioral Intercession in a Mirror-based Architecture 
 Conference: DLS 2007 
 Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1297095 
 Citation: The 2007 DLS paper “Mirages: Behavioral Intercession in a Mirror-based Architecture” combined the ideas of explicit mirrors for reflective introspection and modification with implicit mirrors for behavioral intercession. The work in this paper influenced and inspired the design of proxies in the JavaScript language, where it now has applications in areas such as security, testing, and virtualization of the DOM. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2016 for 2006 | Recipients: Armin Rigo and Samuele Pedroni 
 Title: PyPy’s Approach to Virtual Machine Construction 
 Conference: DLS 2006 
 Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1176753 
 Citation: The 2006 DLS paper “PyPy’s Approach to Virtual Machine Construction” introduced the PyPy Python interpreter and the RPython framework. Both are still highly relevant in various areas to this day and will continue to be influential for many years, thus demonstrating highly impressive long-term vision and impact. The paper laid the theoretical and practical foundations of constructing a virtual machine from a high-level description and was consequently built upon by numerous follow-up publications. The software, which continues to be developed by a large and active open source community proved extensively usable in multiple academic and industrial contexts. 
 Most Notable Paper Award 2015 for 2005 | Recipients: Pascal Costanza and Robert Hirschfeld 
 Title: Language Constructs for Context-oriented Programming–An Overview of ContextL 
 Conference: DLS 2005 
 Paper: | http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1146842 
 Citation: The 2005 DLS paper “Language Constructs for Context-oriented Programming: An Overview of ContextL” introduced a framework that enables programmers to modify the behavior of a program based on the context in which it is used, without requiring changes to the original program. This paper triggered a cascade of research on Context-oriented Programming and spawned a community with its own international workshop series, which is still going strong today.

 href="#submission-details" - Submission Details
Submissions must neither be previously published nor under review at other events. DLS 2022 uses a lightweight double-blind, two-phase reviewing process. 
 Papers are assumed to be in one of the following categories: 
 Research Papers: describe work that advances the current state of the art 
 Experience Papers: describe insights gained from substantive practical applications that should be of a broad interest 
 Dynamic Pearls: describe a known idea in an appealing way to remind the community and capture a reader’s interest 
 The program committee will evaluate each paper based on its relevance, significance, clarity, and originality. The paper category needs to be indicated during submission, and papers are judged accordingly. 
 Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format. Submissions must be in the ACM SIGPLAN conference acmart format, 10 point font, and should not exceed 12 pages. Please see full details in the Instructions for Authors. 
 DLS 2022 will run a two-phase reviewing process to help authors make their final papers the best that they can be. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library and will be freely available for one month, starting two weeks before the event.

 Instructions for Authors 
 Submitted papers need to conform to the formatting instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review at the discretion of the Program Chair. 
 DLS 2022 uses a lightweight double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations in their paper submissions. 
 href="#submission-site" - Submission Site
Please take a moment to read the instructions below before using the submission site. After acceptance, the camera-ready versions will be collected by Conference Publishing Consulting. 
 href="#concurrent-submissions" - Concurrent Submissions
Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described bySIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware ofACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. 
 Format 
 Submissions should use thehref="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/" - ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart format
,sigplansub-format, 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format. If you use LaTeX or Word, please use the providedhref="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/" - ACM SIGPLAN acmart templates
. Author–year and numeric citation styles are both acceptable. 
 Note that by default the SIGPLAN Conference Format templates produce papers in 9 point font. If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to set the10ptoption in the\documentclasscommand:\documentclass[10pt,sigplan]{acmart}. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. 
 For reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission with the LaTeX\settopmatter{printfolios=true}command. 
 Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible. 
 Page Limit 
 To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, papers are limited to 12 pages and 10pt including bibliographic references and appendices. For the second phase, the page limit is 14 pages including bibliographic references. 
 Second-Phase Revisions 
 DLS 2022 uses a two-phase review system to provide authors with extra support and an opportunity to revise submissions. The extent of revisions is limited by the available time of about 4 weeks, so the program committee will use the two-phase process only for mandatory revisions that can be completed in that time. 
 To facilitate reviewing, we ask that the revisions be accompanied with: 
 Highlighted changes, either done manually or with a tool such as | latexdiff 
 A brief, high-level description of changes, and how they address the concerns raised in the reviews 
 For the second phase, the pagelimit is 14 pages, including bibliographic references. 
 Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning) 
 AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.
