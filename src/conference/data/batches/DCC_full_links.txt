 About 
 TheData Compression Conference (DCC)is an international forum for current work on data compression and related applications. The conference addresses: 
 Compression of specific types of data (text, images, video, etc.) 
 Compression in networking, communications, and storage 
 Applications to bioinformatics 
 Applications to mobile computing 
 Applications to information retrieval 
 Computational issues for compression related applications 
 Inpainting-based compression, perceptual coding 
 Compressed data structures 
 Quantization theory and vector quantization (VQ) 
 Joint source-channel coding 
 Compression-related standards 
 Both theoretical and experimental work are of interest.href="https://datacompressionconference.org/call-for-papers/" - More >
