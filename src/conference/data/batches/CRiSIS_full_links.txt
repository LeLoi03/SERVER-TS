 The 19th International Conference on Risks and Security of Internet and Systems (CRiSIS) in 2024continues its tradition of addressing critical security challenges in Internet-connected applications, networks, and systems. The indispensability of the Internet for information exchange among diverse user groups and organizations has led to heightened risks around security and privacy. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the sophistication of online attacks, the proliferation of cybercrime, and the readily available tools for attackers, who are increasingly motivated and skilled. 
 The advent of complex technologies, including pervasive computing, mobile, and wireless devices and networks, introduces new security challenges, necessitating the deployment of advanced security mechanisms and techniques. These advancements are crucial for protecting critical sectors such as energy, transportation, health, defense, banking, critical infrastructures, embedded systems and networks, avionics systems, and more, ensuring an acceptable level of security assurance. 
 CRiSIS 2024serves as an essential platform for stakeholders in computer and network security from the industrial, academic, and governmental sectors to convene, share insights, and showcase the latest developments in combating Internet-related security threats, vulnerabilities, and the necessary countermeasures to address them.

 Call For Papers 
 The 19th International Conference on Risks and Security of Internet and Systems (CRiSIS) in 2024 continues its tradition of addressing critical security challenges in Internet-connected applications, networks, and systems. The indispensability of the Internet for information exchange among diverse user groups and organizations has led to heightened risks around security and privacy. This vulnerability is exacerbated by the sophistication of online attacks, the proliferation of cybercrime, and the readily available tools for attackers, who are increasingly motivated and skilled. 
  
 The advent of complex technologies, including pervasive computing, mobile, and wireless devices and networks, introduces new security challenges, necessitating the deployment of advanced security mechanisms and techniques. These advancements are crucial for protecting critical sectors such as energy, transportation, health, defense, banking, critical infrastructures, embedded systems and networks, avionics systems, and more, ensuring an acceptable level of security assurance. 
  
 CRiSIS 2024 serves as an essential platform for stakeholders in computer and network security from the industrial, academic, and governmental sectors to convene, share insights, and showcase the latest developments in combating Internet-related security threats, vulnerabilities, and the necessary countermeasures to address them.

 The 15th International Conference on Risks and Security of Internet and Systems 
 November 4, 2020-November 6, 2020 
 «SeCoIIA Kickoff Meeting 
 H2020 SeCoIIA – Webinar SeCoIIA Results» 
 The International Conference on Risks and Security of Internet and Systems 2020 will be the 15th in a series dedicated to security issues in Internet-related applications, networks and systems. Internet has become essential for the exchange of information between user groups and organizations from different backgrounds and with different needs and objectives. These users are exposed to increasing risks regarding security and privacy, due to the development of more and more sophisticated online attacks, the growth of Cyber Crime, etc. Attackers nowadays do not lack motivation and they are more and more experienced. To make matters worse, for performing attacks have become easily accessible. Moreover, the increasing complexity as well as the immaturity of new technologies such as pervasive, mobile and wireless devices and networks, raise new security challenges. 
 In this context, new security mechanisms and techniques should be deployed to achieve an assurance level acceptable for critical domains such as energy, transportation, health, defense, banking, critical infrastructures, embedded systems and networks, avionics systems, etc. The CRiSIS conference offers a remarkable forum for computer and network security actors from industry, academia and government to meet, exchange ideas and present recent advances on Internet-related security threats and vulnerabilities, and on the solutions that are needed to counter them.
