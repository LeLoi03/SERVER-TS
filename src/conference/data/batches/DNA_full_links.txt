 DNA 30 
 Johns Hopkins University 
 September 16-20, 2024 
 The Meeting 
 Research in DNA computing and molecular programming draws together mathematics, computer science, physics, chemistry, biology, and nanotechnology to address the analysis, design, and synthesis of information-based molecular systems. This annual meeting is the premier forum where scientists with diverse backgrounds come together with the common purpose of applying principles and tools of computer science, physics, chemistry and mathematics to advance molecular-scale engineering and biology. The 30th International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming (DNA30), organized under the auspices of the International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation and Engineering (ISNSCE), will focus on the most important recent experimental and theoretical results. 
 Poster Instruction 
 For authors interested in presenting their work only in the poster session, including research or projects of interest to the conference community. The abstract submission will be submitted electronically via EasyChair following the instructions and link at the conference web page. All poster submissions should be in PDF format and conform to the following guidelines: 
 The total length of the abstract should not exceed 1 page (11 point type, single spaced, 1 inch margins). 
 The one-page abstract should describe the primary results and their importance. 
 At the discretion of the PC, a small number of high-quality posters may be selected for short (10 minute) presentations at the conference. For consideration, optional supporting documentation is strongly encouraged to be submitted in addition to the one-page abstract.

 About ISNSCE 
 Purpose 
 International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation and Engineering (ISNSCE) is a scientific organization founded in 2004. Its purpose is to promote the study of the control of the arrangement of the atoms in matter, examine the principles that lead to such control, to develop tools and methods to increase such control, and to investigate the use of these principles for molecular computation, and for engineering on the finest possible scales. 
 ISNSCE Conferences 
 ISNSCE sponsors two annual conferences: Foundations of Nanoscience (FNANO) and DNA Computing and Molecular Programming (DNA)
