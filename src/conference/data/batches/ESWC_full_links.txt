We are pleased to announce thatLeonid Libkinis going to be one of our keynotes! 
 Here some words about what he‚Äôs going to talk about at ESWC 2025: 
 Title‚ÄúLanguages for property graphs: progress overview and future directions‚Äù 
 Abstract: Labeled property graphs are one of the two main models of graph data, together with RDF. In the past decade and a half they have seen an enormous progress in terms of product development, investment, and academic research. Most recently this culminated in two new international standards produced by the SQL Standard committee: SQL/PGQ specifies querying property graphs in SQL, and GQL is a standalone graph query language. In this talk I will give an overview of what has been achieved, and also present recent research results from the academic world. It has so far mainly followed developments in industry, deciphering standards and producing their abstractions; but now, equipped with those abstractions, we have been able to analyse new languages and find their deficiencies. I shall present some of them, and outline a roadmap of what can be done to rectify them and enhance those standards. I shall also make connections with the closely related RDF world and discuss how the two can be brought closer together. 
 Bio: Leonid Libkin is a professor of computer science at the University of Edinburgh and query language researcher at RelationalAI; he is also holding part-time industrial chair position at Universit√© Paris-Cit√©. He was previously scientific advisor to Neo4j, professor at the University of Toronto, at √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, and member of research staff at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill. He received his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1994. His main research interests are in the areas of data management and logic in computer science. He has written five books and over 250 technical papers. His awards include a Marie Curie Chair Award, a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award, eight Best Paper Awards, and a test of time award. He has chaired program committees of major database and logic conferences (PODS, LICS, ICDT), and served as chair of the Federated Logic Conference and general chair of PODS. He is an ACM fellow, a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and a member of Academia Europaea.

 Here some words about what she‚Äôs going to talk about at ESWC 2025: 
 Title‚ÄúResponsible AI Engineering‚Äù 
 Abstract: AI is an important technology for leveraging new and promising business opportunities in the industrial domain. However, the usage of AI technology also introduces a wide range of new risks and threats across various dimensions such as cybersecurity, reliability, robustness, safety, transparency, and human oversight ‚Äì all of which need to be carefully addressed. 
 In addition, organizations are confronted with an increasing amount of digital and AI-based legislation in the international environment. This leads to a fragmented landscape of legal and risk-related requirements, often inconsistent, overlapping, and duplicated. This results in high uncertainty and bureaucratic burden during the development and deployment of AI products. 
 To address these challenges, a systematic and efficient approach is required to handle the complex legal requirements as well as the emerging wide range of risk sources, in order to boost AI innovation in a responsible manner. Responsible AI engineering describes such a systematic approach, enabling the efficient and innovative development of AI products while ensuring compliance with the complex and fragmented legal landscape. 
 In this presentation, I will introduce the Siemens Generative Risk Management Process as an example of a responsible AI engineering approach that is currently being rolled out at Siemens. This demonstrates how organizations can drive AI innovation forward in a compliant and risk-aware manner. 
 Bio: Sonja Zillner is the Principal for Industrial Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence at Siemens Foundational Technology. She is Head of the Core Company Technology Module ‚ÄúTrustworthy AI‚Äù at Siemens AG as well as leading the design, development, and implementation of the Generative AI Risk Management Process for Siemens industrial products. She earned her doctoral degree in 2005 from the Technical University of Vienna, and has held an honorary professorship at the Technical University of Munich since 2021.

 Use of LLM generated text 
 For ESWC 2025, we adhere to the principles and guidelines stated in thehref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship" - ACM Policy on Authorship
specifically about ‚ÄúCriteria for Authorship‚Äù regarding the use of Generative AI technologies for authoring papers: ‚ÄúGenerative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain ¬≠about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work. (‚Ä¶) Basic word processing systems that recommend and insert replacement text, perform spelling or grammar checks and corrections, or systems that do language translations are to be considered exceptions to this disclosure requirement and are generally permitted and need not be disclosed in the Work. As the line between Generative AI tools and basic word processing systems like MS-Word or Grammarly becomes blurred, this Policy will be updated.‚Äù 
 In case of any questions regarding this policy, please contact the organizing committee.
