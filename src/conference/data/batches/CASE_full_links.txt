 About CASE 2025  
 The IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE) is the flagship automation conference of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) and constitutes the primary forum for cross-industry and multidisciplinary research in automation. Its goal is to provide broad coverage and dissemination of foundational research in automation among researchers and practitioners.  
 CASE 2025 will be held on August 17 – August 21, 2025, in Los Angeles, California, USA. The pre-conference workshops will be held on August 17, 2025.  
 The conference will focus on Secured and Trustworthy Automation  : Automation systems such as collaborative robotics, self-operating systems and vehicles, smart manufacturing, healthcare, farming, transportation & logistics, and smart cities, increasingly rely on secured and trustworthy automation. Research is needed to overcome vulnerability and bias due to imperfect system design, data collection, machine learning, or control.  
 The conference will cover a wide range of topics on Systems, Automation, Autonomous Systems, Discrete Event Systems, Smart Cities, Robotics, Building Automation, Automation in Meso, Micro and Nano-scale, Big Data, Machine Learning, Information and Communication Technologies, etc.  
 CASE 2025 invites special session and workshop/tutorial proposals, regular papers, industry papers and presentation-only papers related to the conference topics.  
 We look forward to seeing you in Los Angeles, California, USA   !    
 Conference venue: Millennium Biltmore Downtown Los Angeles, California, USA  

 The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society is committed to advancing diversity in Robotics and Automation, and to promoting an inclusive and equitable culture that welcomes, engages, and rewards all who contribute to the field, without regard to ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, age, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.
