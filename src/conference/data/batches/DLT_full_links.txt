 Overview 
 The 29th International Conference on Developments in Language Theory (DLT 2025) is an event organized to bring together members of the academic, research, and industrial community who have an interest in formal languages, automata theory, and related areas. 
 The venue of the conference is the University of Seoul, South Korea. The conference dates are August 19-22, 2025. 
 List of Topics 
 The series of International Conference on Developments in Language Theory provides a forum for presenting current developments in formal languages and automata. Its scope is very general and includes, among others, the following topics and areas: 
 grammars, acceptors, and transducers for words, trees, and graphs 
 algebraic theories of automata 
 algorithmic, combinatorial, and algebraic properties of words and languages 
 relations between formal languages and artificial neural networks 
 variable length codes 
 symbolic dynamics 
 cellular automata 
 groups and semigroups generated by automata 
 polyominoes and multidimensional patterns 
 decidability questions 
 image manipulation and compression 
 efficient text algorithms 
 relationships to cryptography, concurrency, complexity theory, and logic 
 bio-inspired computing 
 quantum computing 
 Submission Guidelines 
 Authors are invited to submit papers presenting original and unpublished research. The proceedings will be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) Series. Simultaneous submission to journals or other conferences with published proceedings is not allowed. Submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages excluding bibliography and must follow the LNCS-style LaTeX2e (available athref="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html" - http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html
). 
 In order to facilitate the review process, all proofs omitted due to page limitations can be given in an appendix or made accessible through a reliable link to a freely available electronic preprint. Please note that the paper should be self-contained; reviewers are not required to read any additional pages, thus consulting the appendix is up to the reviewer. Papers should be submitted electronically in PDF through the EasyChair system:href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=dlt2025" - https://easychair.org/conference?conf=dlt2025
History 
 The first Developments in Language Theory (DLT) conference was organized by G. Rozenberg and A. Salomaa in Turku, Finland in 1993. Since 1993, the DLT conferences were held in every odd year. Since 2001, a DLT conference takes place in Europe in every odd year and outside Europe in every even year. The last 10 editions of the conference took place in:
