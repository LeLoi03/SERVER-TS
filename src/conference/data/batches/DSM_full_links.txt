 18th edition of the international workshop on Models and Evolutionhref="https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2024" - Co-located with Models'24
WorkshopMotivations 
 Model artifacts are subject to constant evolution throughout the lifecycle of sys- tems. The evolutionary pressure emerges from various technical and business factors throughout the overall software/system engineering endeavor. Pertinent examples of such factors include changing requirements, changing environment and changing user base, all of which give rise to unique evolutionary challenges in various system artifacts from architecture to implementation, and even in infor- mal artifacts, such as documentation. These challenges, if left unmanaged, may lead to deteriorating quality attributes, and in severe cases inconsistent artifacts or even incorrect artifacts, preventing the system from operating as intended. Therefore, proper support for efficient and effective evolution is required. The Models and Evolution workshop promotes novel theories, techniques, and tools to support evolution. To this end, the workshop brings together researchers and practitioners to discuss the latest developments on the topic.

 KeynoteAbstract: Co-evolution in Industry and Research: Is it Convergent? 
 The oldest continuously used and evolved domain-specific modelling language among MetaEdit+ customers is currently in its 30th year. In all that time, none of its many hundreds of users has ever had to manually edit a model file to solve a co-evolution issue. What is the reason, and is it possible to make a research career based on it? We will look at the evolutionary pressures that drive modeling language, modeling tool, and language workbench evolution. How do they differ between academia and industry, and are those differences necessary or useful? And finally, why is no co-evolution often the best form of evolution? Our hunt for answers will take us from Beijing to San Diego, from the Arctic Circle to Cape Town, before landing fully carbon-compensated back in Linz. 
 Steven Kelly Biography 
 Dr. Steven Kelly is the CTO of MetaCase and co-founder of the DSM Forum. He has over thirty years of experience of consulting and building tools for Domain-Specific Modeling. Steven is the architect and lead developer of MetaEdit+, MetaCase’s domain-specific modeling tool. He is co-author of a book on Domain-Specific Modeling and has published over 70 articles in various software development journals and conferences. Steven has a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Jyväskylä and a Master’s degree from Cambridge. Outside of IT he has been a field linguist for a year and a footballer for far too many years.

 Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM) languages provide a viable and time-tested solution for continuing to raise the level of abstraction, and thus productivity, beyond coding, making systems and software development faster and easier. 
 In DSM, the models are constructed using concepts that represent things in the application domain, not concepts of a given programming language. The modeling language follows the domain abstractions and semantics, allowing developers to perceive them-selves as working directly with domain concepts. Together with frameworks and platforms, DSM can automate a large portion of software production.

 Call for Papers and Demonstrations 
 The goals of the workshop are to collect and exchange experiences related to building and using DSMs; continue building and extending the DSM community; and address in focus groups the issues raised in the presented papers and at previoushref="http://www.dsmforum.org/DSMworkshops.html" - workshops
. 
 The 17th workshop on DSM welcomes submissions that address Domain-Specific Modeling on practical or theoretical levels. They can be research papers, experience reports, position papers or demonstration papers. Some of the issues that we would like to see addressed in this workshop are: 
 Industry/academic experience reports describing success/failure in implementing and using DSM languages/tools 
 Approaches to identify constructs for DSM languages 
 Novel features in language workbenches / tools to support DSM 
 Approaches to implement metamodel-based modeling languages 
 Metamodeling frameworks and languages 
 Modularization technologies for DSM languages and models 
 Novel approaches for code generation from domain-specific models 
 Issues of support/maintenance for systems built with DSM 
 Evolution of languages along with their domain 
 Organizational and process issues in DSM adoption and use
