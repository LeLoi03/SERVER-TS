 Message from the President 
 In April 2025, we started a free, non-commercial membership program to maintain ongoing contact with CoRL authors, reviewers, sponsors, and attendees. We're using a commercial software package (JoinIt.com) but there is no cost to members and we will not share your information with companies or sponsors. We will use this sparingly to send announcements about CoRL news, deadlines, and occasional notes from CoRL organizers. 
 If you submitted a paper to CoRL and/or attended a CoRL conference in the past 3 years, please visit this websitehref="https://app.joinit.com/o/corl-foundation/" - https://app.joinit.com/o/corl-foundation/
and clickMember Loginto add / update your membership info using your email address. If you are new to CoRL or your email is not yet in our system, clickJoin. 
 Of course you can also opt-out or update your CoRL membership info at any time. Please let me know if you have any questions.
