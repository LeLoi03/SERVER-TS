 EICS 2025 
 The 17th ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computing Systems 
 23-27 June 2025, Trier, Germany 
 Welcome toEICS 2025 
 EICS 2025is the seventeenth international ACM SIGCHI conference devoted to engineering interactive computing systems and their user interfaces addressing one or more software quality factors, such as usability user experience, reliability, security, etc. 
 Work presented at EICS covers all stages of the engineering life-cycle of interactive systems - inception, requirements, design, specification, coding data analytics, validation and verification, deployment and maintenance. EICS has the longest tradition of bringing together researchers who contribute to better ways of creating interactive computing systems stemming from the conference on command languages in the seventies. The conference is best known for rigorously contributing and disseminating research results that hold the midst in between user interface design software engineering and computational interaction. 
 EICS focuses on models, languages, notations, methods, techniques and tools that support designing, developing, validating and verifying interactive systems. The conference brings together people who study or practice the engineering of interactive systems, drawing from design, HCI, software engineering requirements engineering, software development, modeling, and programming. Submissions advance the state of the art of the engineering of interactive systems. 
 The conference proceedings are published by the ACM and appear in the ACM Digital Library. The full paper are published in the journal PACM EICS series. Further information athref="https://eics.acm.org/pacm/" - https://eics.acm.org/pacm/
