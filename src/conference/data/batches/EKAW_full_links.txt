About 
 EKAW (European Knowledge Acquisition Workshop) started in 1987 as the European analogue to the KAW (Knowledge Acquisition Workshop) series of workshops in North America and the PKAW series in the Asian-Pacific area. Together, KAW, EKAW and PKAW defined the key venues for research in Knowledge-Based Systems in the 80s and 90s, in particular for those researchers who were especially interested in the issues associated with the computational representation of knowledge and human expert behavior. 
 While EKAW started as a workshop, as a result of its success and its emergence as the premier forum for research in Knowledge-Based Systems in Europe, it eventually became a conference in 2000, with the formal title of “International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management”, while still maintaining the original EKAW acronym and brand. This change took place at the same time as the KAW series of workshops concluded in North America and gave birth to the International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP), whose first edition was held in 2001 in Banff, Canada. 
 Today, EKAW and K-CAP define the two main fora for research in Knowledge-Based Systems and are held on alternate years. A key aspect of the EKAW/K-CAP community is that, while it is in no way homogenous with respect to paradigms and approaches, as pointed out in [Motta, 2013], “it is also possible to identify “a common mode of thought and a set of shared assumptions”. These can be reconducted to i) a ‘holistic’ approach to knowledge engineering, not merely viewed as yet another computing field, but rather as an activity informed as much by technology as the cognitive and social sciences; and ii) an emphasis on “the pursuit of reusable patterns in problem solving and in domain descriptions” [Musen, 2013]. Hence we can characterize the ultimate goal of research in this area as that of providing “rigorous epistemological and engineering foundations to the area, at a level rather more conceptual than the one normally adopted in knowledge representation research” [Motta, 2013]. 
 Over 30 years after its first edition, EKAW is still going from strength to strength. This demonstrates the vitality and robust state of health of this area of research and also confirms that, while the landscape has changed so much in the past 30 years, the key issues to do with effective knowledge engineering and management are still as relevant today as they were 30 years ago.

 Registration to IC3K allows free access to the ICINCO, WEBIST, IN4PL, IJCCI and CoopIS conferences (as a non-speaker). 
  
 The purpose of the IC3K is to bring together researchers, engineers and practitioners on the areas of Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management. IC3K is composed of three co-located conferences, each specialized in at least one of the aforementioned main knowledge areas. 

Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).

 Conference Proceedings 
 You can access the Proceedings by accessing the following link from this page:Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management 
 The Conference 
 EKAW (pronounced /ˈiːkoʊ/) conference serves as a premier gathering for scholars, researchers and practitioners in the fields of knowledge engineering and knowledge management. The24th International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (EKAW-24)will take place in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (in-person conference). The conference will be held at the Amsterdam Science Park campus from November 26th to November 28th 2024. EKAW is renowned for its high-quality research presentations, stimulating discussions, and opportunities for networking making it an essential event for anyone interested in advancing knowledge engineering and knowledge management practices. 
 EKAW-24's Special Theme:Knowledge in the Age of Language ModelsEKAW publishes original, high-quality papers related to eliciting, acquiring, modelling, and managing knowledge. Topics of EKAW24 include, but are not limited to, semantic web, knowledge management knowledge discovery, information integration, natural language processing, intelligent systems e-business, e-health, humanities, cultural heritage. In addition this year's conference invites research articles focusing on algorithms, tools, methodologies and applications that leverage the interplay between knowledge and Language Models. The contributions should deepen our understanding of how Language Models contribute to the dynamic landscape of knowledge acquisition and engineering and vice versa.
