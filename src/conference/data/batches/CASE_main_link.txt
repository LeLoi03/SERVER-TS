 About CASE 2025  
 The IEEE International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE) is the flagship automation conference of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (RAS) and constitutes the primary forum for cross-industry and multidisciplinary research in automation. Its goal is to provide broad coverage and dissemination of foundational research in automation among researchers and practitioners.  
 CASE 2025 will be held on August 17 – August 21, 2025, in Los Angeles, California, USA. The pre-conference workshops will be held on August 17, 2025.  
 The conference will focus on Secured and Trustworthy Automation  : Automation systems such as collaborative robotics, self-operating systems and vehicles, smart manufacturing, healthcare, farming, transportation & logistics, and smart cities, increasingly rely on secured and trustworthy automation. Research is needed to overcome vulnerability and bias due to imperfect system design, data collection, machine learning, or control.  
 The conference will cover a wide range of topics on Systems, Automation, Autonomous Systems, Discrete Event Systems, Smart Cities, Robotics, Building Automation, Automation in Meso, Micro and Nano-scale, Big Data, Machine Learning, Information and Communication Technologies, etc.  
 CASE 2025 invites special session and workshop/tutorial proposals, regular papers, industry papers and presentation-only papers related to the conference topics.  
 We look forward to seeing you in Los Angeles, California, USA   !    
 Conference venue: Millennium Biltmore Downtown Los Angeles, California, USA  

 The IEEE Robotics and Automation Society is committed to advancing diversity in Robotics and Automation, and to promoting an inclusive and equitable culture that welcomes, engages, and rewards all who contribute to the field, without regard to ethnicity, religion, gender, disability, age, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.

 Interested in Participating as a Reviewer or Editor? More info is available here .  
 Papers submitted to the IEEE CASE follow a single-blinded review system. Thus, the identities of the authors are known to the reviewers, but the identities of the reviewers are not disclosed to the authors. Authors do not need to anonymize the names of the authors when submitting their papers.   
  
 CC BY license  
 Authors who require a cc by license (such as researchers funded by UKRI)  : If you require a CC BY license for your paper, please follow the guidelines described under option 2 on the following website: https://open.ieee.org/ieee-compliance-with-ukri/  
  
 Guidelines for Language, Margins, Formats & Templates   
 All papers submitted to CASE 2025 must be written in English and formatted in the standard IEEE 2-column format. Authors should prepare their papers based on the LaTex template or Microsoft Word template. Only PDF files will be accepted. Please download the templates from here:  
    LATEX TEMPLATE      
    MS WORD TEMPLATE      

 Further information of how to use the templates are available on the Papercept submission portal for LaTex or Microsoft Word .  
 Note:  Authors are responsible for submitting their paper in the required format. Please do not modify the official templates!  All papers that are accepted will be published as submitted by the Author. The Conference is not responsible for editing or correcting errors in the paper.  
  
 Plagiarism  
 All submissions will be tested for similarity and overlap with prior published material using the iThenticate tool. In case of possible violations of the IEEE ethics rules in publishing, the case will be investigated.  
  
 Generative AI language tools (e.g., ChatGPT) for publishing and reviews in IEEE CASE conferences  
 Notes for authors:   
 Please note that manuscripts generated by generative AI language tools such as ChatGPT are prohibited. If such AI tools generate a small portion of the manuscript, a full reference must be provided. Nevertheless, if generative AI language tools generate inappropriate language, plagiarized content, errors, mistakes, incorrect references, or misleading content, and these contents are included in the manuscript, the responsibility rests entirely on you and the co-author(s).  
 Generative AI language tools cannot be listed as an author.  
 Generative AI language tools may be used for light-editing of the author’s original text, such as for spelling and grammar corrections. Authors need to acknowledge such editorial use in the acknowledgement section.  
 Notes for reviewers:   
 IEEE has the responsibility to safeguard all the content of any paper submitted to its conferences, e.g. CASE. CASE has the responsibility for safeguarding the integrity of the paper review process. Therefore, any reviewer uploading any content from a paper submitted to a CASE conference to a generative AI language tool is strictly forbidden.  
 Use of a generative AI language tool for editing your review outcome is also strictly forbidden.
