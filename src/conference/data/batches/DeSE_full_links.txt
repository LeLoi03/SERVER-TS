 Dese Conference 2025 
 AI and Industry 4.0 for a Sustainable World 
 10th – 12th of November 2025Bucharest, Romania 
 The18th InternationalConference on the Developments in eSystems Engineering (DeSE2025) will continue the success of the previous DeSE conferences, that was established by back in year 2008. 
 About DeSE2025 
 DeSE isan international core ranked non-profit conferencethat disseminates the latest knowledge in eSystem Developments including; Artificial Intelligence (AI), Intelligent Systems Applications, Evolutionary Computations, Fuzzy Systems, Neural Networks, Bioinformatics and Bioengineering, robotics, Smart Applications, Sensors and other related subjects that support Industry 4.0. and related to AI, Emergent Technologies, Cognitive and Development Systems, Intelligent Computation and Machine Learning. 
 We are very proud that back in 2009, the father ofFuzzy Logic(Professor Lotfi A. Zadeh),was the keynote speaker of DeSE2009 conference. 
 The technical sponsorship is with proceedings that have been published annually by IEEE explore since the start of DeSE back in 2008. DeSE2025 organising committee have been involved in minimum 10 years organisation experience.
