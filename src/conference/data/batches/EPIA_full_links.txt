 **************************************CALL FOR THEMATIC TRACKS 
 The worldwide AI research community is invited to submit thematic trackproposals for EPIA 2024. Thematic tracks are intended to provide anenvironment that fosters an active exchange of ideas between researcherswithin specific sub-areas of AI, including theoretical/foundational,integrative, application-oriented, and newly emerging areas.Each track is coordinated by an Organizing Committee composed ofresearchers from at least two different countries. Track organizersshould also create a highly international Program Committee for thetrack, with recognized researchers within the corresponding scientificareas.The selection of proposed thematic tracks will be made by the ProgramChairs and Steering Committee of EPIA 2024. We aim to build a strong,well-balanced conference program. If there are significant thematic gapsin the program after the track proposal submission closes, the chairsmay actively solicit additional proposals. Likewise, significant overlapbetween tracks will be addressed by suggesting merging tracks.Papers accepted in thematic tracks will be published by Springer, in avolume of the Lecture Notes on Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series.Submitted papers should be prepared according to the correspondingformat, with a maximum of 12 pages including references.Presentation slots will be accommodated in the conference program forevery accepted paper, in thematic sessions that may run in parallel. 
 **************************************RESPONSIBILITIES 
 The Organizing Committee of each track will be responsible for:- Creating an international Program Committee (PC) for the track; 
 - Publicizing the track by all adequate means; 
 - Coordinating a double-blind review process for papers submitted to thetrack, ensuring each paper is reviewed by at least three PC members; 
 - Assisting the Program Chairs of the conference in the paper selectionprocess; 
 - Ensuring the delivery of camera-ready versions of papers accepted forthe track in accordance with the guidelines and deadlines defined by theconference organizers; 
 -Coordinating the track session chairing assignments. 
 The organizers of EPIA 2024 will ensure: 
 - A web-based tool to support the scientific organization process (papersubmission, reviewing, selection, etc.); 
 - The coordination and final deliberation on paper acceptance decisions; 
 - The publication of thematic track papers in the conference proceedings; 
 - A meeting place and time for holding the track sessions, includingcommon equipment (e.g. computer and beamer).
