 Present CFP : 2025 
 The 27th International Workshop on Design, Optimization, Languages and Analytical Processing of Big Data (DOLAP 2025), the premier workshop in this area, will take place co-located with EDBT 2025 in Barcelona (Spain) on March 25th 2025. 
  
 Submissions are now open at https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DOLAP2025 
 Official website: https://dolapworkshop.github.io/dolap-2025/ 

Abstract submission: December 13, 2024 
 Paper submission: December 20, 2024 
 Authors notification: January 31, 2025 
 Camera-ready: February 16, 2025 
 Workshop date: March 25, 2025 

DOLAP accepts short and long paper submissions! 
 Following the success of last year, this year we will invite extended abstracts for an interactive panel session on Federated and Distributed Data Spaces. 
  
 As our consolidated tradition, the best papers presented at DOLAP will be invited to a special issue of Information Systems. 
  
 Long papers include novel and mature research, industrial, or survey work. Long papers of good quality but not mature enough might be accepted to the workshop as short papers. 
 Short papers include (ongoing) novel research works with preliminary results and vision/position papers outlining research issues for future work. 
  
 Extended abstract will be invited to present in the interactive panel session, and include initial controversial ideas and visions, reports on early (or negative) results, or reflections on existing and future challenges on the theme of the interactive session. For instance: 
  
 How are Data Spaces transforming traditional data management and analytics paradigms? 

How can we ensure data sovereignty and trust within Data Spaces while promoting data sharing and collaboration? 

How can we address the scalability and performance issues in querying and analyzing data across distributed Data Spaces? 
  
 What are the implications of data analytics on Data Spaces for data privacy, security, and compliance with regulations like GDPR? 
  
 What new opportunities and challenges do Data Spaces present for machine learning and AI applications? 
 The panel session will feature short presentations followed by extensive and interactive discussions on the presented topics. We encourage the authors to propose topics and perspectives that will engage the audience and ignite debate among the participants. Ultimately, the goal is to tap into one of the original functions of workshops as a forum for discussion, where researchers come together to brainstorm and contribute to paving the way for future research directions. 

The page limit is 8 pages for full papers, 4 pages for short papers, and 2 pages for extended abstracts (in CEUR format, double-column, excluding references). Each submission will be reviewed by 3 members of the program committee, the review process is single-blind, and thus authors must include their names and affiliations in submissions. 
 Extended abstracts are short papers with an abstract, a main body, and references but have only 2 standard pages of content references included. 
  
 Research topics include, but are not limited to: 
  
 Design and Language 
 - Data management fundamentals: architectures, design, ETL/ELT, reverse ETL, modeling, data integration, database design for big data, query processing, maintenance, evolution, security, personalization, and privacy in decision support systems. 
 - Data Variety: unstructured data (e.g., text), semi-structured data (e.g., XML, JSON), multimedia, spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal data, stream and sensor data, semantic web, data lakes, data spaces, data quality, graph data, multistore and polystore solutions, multi-model data warehouse 
 - Explainable, trustworthy, and interpretable analytics: bias in big data and how to mitigate it; data quality and data cleaning; FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability and Reusability) in OLAP 
  
 Optimization 
 - Coping with Volume: physical organization, performance optimization and tuning, scalability, MapReduce and Spark for data analytics, performance optimization of ETL/ELT. 
 - Coping with Velocity: Deployment on parallel machine, database clusters, cloud infrastructures and serverless architectures, active/real-time analytics, real-time queries. 
  
 Analytical Processing and Applications 
 - Analytics and Value: OLAP, data exploration through visualization, recommendation, reformulation, approximate query-answering, personalization, result presentation, data storytelling, graph analytics, process mining, advanced visualization for business contexts. 
 - Analytics and Veracity: heterogeneous data integration for analytics, quality aspects of data analysis, exploration outcome and end-user experience, fairness of data analysis, analytics and data driven decision making for the data enthusiasts. 
 - Integration of analytics with machine learning, data mining, information retrieval, search engines, data science, predictive and prescriptive analytics. 
 - Big Data applications: smart city, smart health, smart energy, smart grid, smart agriculture.

Previous editionsDOLAP: the International Workshop on Design, Optimization, Languages and Analytical Processing of Big Data 
 DOLAP is established as one of the reference places for researchersto publish their work in the broad area of data decision support systems. The DOLAP workshop maintains a high quality of accepted papers, as attested by its ranking as “very good event” in the last edition of theGII-GRIN-SCIE Conference Ranking. Every year, the best papers published at DOLAP are invited to submit extended version to a special issue on a highly reputed international journal (likeInformation SystemsorData & Knowledge Engineering). Moreover, the high-quality program of DOLAP includesinvited keynotesfrom reputed speakers, abest paperaward since 2020, and usesopen proceedingssince 2017. Atest-of-time awardwas given in 2023 to celebrate the 25th edition of DOLAP. 
 Research focus 
 Research in data warehousing and OLAP has produced important technologies for the design, management, and use of information systems for decision support. Nowadays, due to the advent of Big Data, Decision Support Systems (DSS) include a wider range of systems, in which novel solutions combine advanced data management and data analytics, (semi-)automating the data lifecycle (from ingestion to visualization). Yet, modern data analytics systems acknowledge the relevance of managing data in an efficient way (by means of data modeling and optimized data processing) to serve innovative data analysis bringing added value to organizations. 
 Data platforms of the future will consequently be significantly different than what the current state-of-the-practice supports. The trend is to move from current systems that are “data presenting” to more dynamic systems that allow the semi-automation of the decision making process (including both data management and data analysis tasks). This means that systems partially guide their users towards data discovery, management and system-aided decision making via intelligent techniques (beyond OLAP and exploiting artificial intelligence) and visualization. In the backstage, the advent of the big data era requires that new methods, models, techniques and architectures are developed to cope with the increasing demand in capacity, data type diversity, schema and data variability and responsiveness. And of course, this does not necessarily mean to re-invent the wheel, but rather, complementing the wealth of research in data management and anlytics with other approaches. 
 We envision DOLAP as a forum to discuss, foster and nurture novel ideasaround these new landscapes of decision support systems and data platoforms in the era of big data in order to produce new exciting results, within a strong, vibrant community around these areas. 
 The new logo 
 After 25 years of workshops, we have revamped theoriginal logoto represent the main themes that are driving the scope of DOLAP. While the cube is an obvious reference to the multidimensional data, here is the breakdown of the symbols on its sides. 
 OLAP 
 The star and snowflake schemas laid the foundation to multidimensional data modeling and implementation of data warehouses, i.e., the building block of any business intelligence and OLAP application, identifying the roots of DOLAP's scope 
 Big Data 
 The big data revolution imposed disruptive changes at the levels of the 4 Vs (volume, velocity, variety, veracity), pushing researchers and practitioners into rethinking practices of data (and metadata) managament and analytical processing 
 ML & AI 
 If machine learning techniques have always been paired with OLAP analyses to support the decision-making process, the ground-breaking advancements in the field of artificial intelligence are further pushing the boundaries of what analytical applications can achieve 
 Data-driven decision-making is a research topic in continuous evolution, always encountering new challenges and opening to tremendous opportunities, inspiring research work that takes data analysis to an ever-higher level. The DOLAP workshop is the perfect venue for researchers to share their latest work in this area and join a strong and proactive data-enthusiast community.
