 3rd International Workshop on Agile Methods for Information Systems Engineering (Agil-ISE) 
 Date: 03 June 
 The practice of Information Systems Engineering (ISE) has evolved substantially because of the adoption of agile methods. These agile methods for ISE focus on continuous and iterative improvement of usable/deployable releases, often driven by the actual user/customer experience with the information system. An iteration within this development process includes requirements analysis, system design, implementation, and testing; and user/customer acceptance, with the aim of continuous enhancement of the delivered features. 
 This workshop focuses on agile practices, such as behaviour-driven development, test-driven development, rapid prototyping, agile product management, agile governance, agile process customization/tailoring, and artefacts, such as user stories, features, scenarios, product/sprint backlogs, Kanban boards, that are used in ISE. The theme we wish to discuss at the workshop is: How can artefacts and practices be improved or innovated to make them more effective in supporting the agility of ISE processes? We intend to discuss this question primarily, but not exclusively, from the perspective of novel digital technologies and data-driven approaches (e.g., LLM, AI, NLP, ML, etc.), focusing on the application of state-of-the-art research approaches.

 International Workshop on Blockchain for Information Systems (BC4IS24) and Blockchain for Trusted Data Sharing (B4TDS) 
 Blockchain technology enables mutually distrusting parties to share data and business logic in a trusted way, without requiring trusted third parties. It provides a form of shared database and execution environment with additional trust guarantees compared to more traditional solutions. Among others, blockchain and smart contracts can help provide and decentrally manage trusted evidence of information stored and exchanged. The relatively new nature of blockchain technology and its distinctive characteristics such as decentralization and immutability raise new challenges from an information systems perspective. Important challenges revolve around the requirements of engineering, development, integration, use, governance, and evolution for and of such systems. Specific challenges arise also from the data perspective of blockchain-based information systems. Among others, there is a need for innovative solutions and research around the storage, organization, retrieval, and sharing of data in a decentralized and trusted way. This would be a step towards strengthening the decentralized access to data for businesses, organizations, or participants in worldwide distributed networks.

 2nd International Workshop on Hybrid Artificial Intelligence and Enterprise Modelling for Intelligent Information Systems (HybridAIMS) 
 Date: 03 June 
 The international workshop HybridAIMS intends to deal with the convergence of Hybrid Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Enterprise Modelling. On the one hand, Hybrid AI is the research direction that focuses on the combination of two prominent fields: sub-symbolic AI (e.g., machine learning like neural networks, Large Language Models, generative AI) and symbolic AI (e.g., knowledge representation and reasoning, knowledge-based systems, knowledge graphs, case-based reasoning). Enterprise Modelling (EM), on the other hand, is an established approach for the conceptual representation, design, implementation, and analysis of information systems, and it fosters the business and IT alignment. This is of relevance for applying AI approaches in various application domains.

 2nd Workshop on Knowledge Graphs for Semantics-driven Systems Engineering 
 Date: 03-04 June 
 The goal of this workshop is to stimulate research and experience reports on how Knowledge Graphs can add context and flexibility to information systems, compensating for the semantic loss of system design methods or for the logical flaws of large language models, ultimately enabling semantic enrichment and reasoning capabilities in information systems operation or engineering processes. 
 Knowledge Graphs have been primarily investigated as engineered artifacts by themselves – from their underlying formalisms (e.g. description logics), enabling technologies (e.g. RDF, LPG) to their knowledge management capabilities. With this workshop we aim to shift focus from what Knowledge Graphs are, or how they can be built, towards how they can be relevant to Information Systems engineering. We also aim to investigate their place in the Conceptual Modeling paradigm – specifically how Knowledge Graphs enable new flavors of model-driven engineering or low-code engineering -, as well as their interplay with Large Language Models or Machine Learning for systems engineering purposes. 
 Various stages of research progress can be reported in the workshop contributions – from position and vision papers to experience reports and full research papers.

 16th International Workshop on Enterprise & Organizational Modeling and Simulation (EOMAS 2024) 
 Date: 03-04 June 
 The workshop focuses on the role and application of modelling and simulation in information systems and enterprise systems engineering from an organizational perspective. It will cover research programs and industry developments and be relevant for junior researchers and seasoned professionals. Additionally, it will be helpful for enterprise modelling and simulation teachers, as it is a widely offered discipline in computing majors.

Workshop on Digital Transformation with Business Process Mining (DigPro2024) 
 Date: 04 June 
 The one day workshop DigPro24 (Digital Transformation with Business Process Mining) is aimed at providing a platform for the introduction to Process Mining as keystone in Digital transformation with Process Modeling, Process Analytics, Process Discovery and Conformance techniques with Process enhancement capabilities. The workshop is proposed to incorporate both hands-on workshop sessions and research paper presentations to provide new insights and data driven approach so as to be useful to Software Engineers, System Managers, IT professionals and consultants as well alongwith students, research scholars and faculty members in the broad field of Information Systems Engineering”

 Business process management (BPM), business process reengineering (BPR), and business process innovation (BPI) have been the primary strategies adopted by several organizations to manage their business successfully along with IT. In the last few years, the concept of BPM, BPR, and BPI has been a hot topic among the IS community, which is evident in the degree of literatures devoted to it. Due to the dynamic nature of this research area, this paper aims to add knowledge to the existing ones by answering (1) what is the current level of development on BPM, BPR, and BPI within AIS basket of top journals and Science Direct database? and (2) what are the potential future research directions on BPM, BPR, and BPI?. A total of 55 articles from the AIS basket of top journals and 61 articles from the Science Direct database are analyzed based on the year of publications, AIS geographical regions, approaches adopted by the author/s, components of BPM areas and industrial application covered, and potential future research directions are discussed.
