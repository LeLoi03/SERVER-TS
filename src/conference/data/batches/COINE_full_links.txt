 Workshop: May 20th, 2025 
 Objectives 
 Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms and ethics are five key governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. The goal of the COINE workshop is to bring together researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, and agents aware of norms, policies, and ethics. 
 The growing pervasiveness of “open systems” raises a range of challenges and opportunities for developing technologies in the area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS). In open MAS, artificial and human autonomous agents, their modes of interaction and the pursued goal of the system may change over time. Additionally, the agents’ autonomy, which can be influenced and amplified by coordination techniques, can work against the system’s effectiveness. The view of coordination and control has to be expanded to consider not only an agent-centric perspective but societal and organization-centric views as well.Moreover, in the case of open multi-agent systems, the autonomy of the agents can work against the effectiveness of the society. There is therefore a need for tools and techniques for articulating interactions in order to make MAS more effective in attaining collective goals, aligning agent behaviors with shared human values, and more trustworthy, predictable and understandable for humans. 
 This workshop is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at various conferences including AAMAS (17 times), IJCAI (twice), AAAI in 2008 and ECAI in 2006 and 2016 (seeWorkshop Series Website), and produced 17 volumes of post-proceedings in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. In 2020, ethics was added to the name and acronym (now COINE), and also the notion of governance of MAS was added to the full workshop title as this is the common objective uniting the various threads of research (coordination, organizations, etc.) undertaken. The workshop in the new format has been held five times (2020–2024). 
 This edition of the COINE workshop will be hosted byhref="https://aamas2025.org/" - AAMAS 2025
and will complement the main conference program by allowing a more relaxed and in-depth discussion of MAS from a social perspective. Previous editions of COINE have proven to foster collaboration among researchers in the relevant topics.

 This COINE edition will be hosted byAAMAS 2024 (The 23rd International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems), which will take place in Auckland, New Zealand on May 6-10, 2024. This workshop is one of the 11 areas of interest for AAMAS. It complements the AAMAS main program by allowing a more relaxed and focused discussion of MAS from a social perspective. Previous editions of COINE have proven to foster collaboration among researchers in the relevant topics.

 COINE 2024 Workshop: May 7 2024 
 Objectives 
 Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms and ethics are five key governance elements for the regulation of open MAS. The goal of the workshop is to bring together researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, norm/policy-aware and ethical agents. 
 The pervasiveness of “open systems” raises a range of challenges and opportunities for developing technologies in the area of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems (MAS). In open MAS, artificial and human autonomous agents, their modes of interaction and the pursued goal of the system may change over time. Additionally, the autonomy of the agents, which can be influenced and amplified by coordination techniques, can work against the effectiveness of the system. The success of these systems relies on effective governance to maintain an equilibrium between the autonomy of the (artificial and human) agents and the predictability of the system. Hence, there is a need for methods, techniques, mechanisms and tools that are able to balance the equilibrium between these two forces to make the system mode effective in attaining its purposeful goals. 
 The COINE workshop (seeCOIN Series Website) is an evolution of the COIN (Coordination, Organizations, Institutions and Norms in Agent Systems) workshop series that ran at various conferences and produced 16 volumes of post-proceedings in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (seeCOIN Series Proceedings).
