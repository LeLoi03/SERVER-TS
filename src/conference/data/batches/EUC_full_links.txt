 Present CFP : 2024 
 Embedded and ubiquitous computing represent a paradigm designed to deliver continuous computing and communication services to end users universally and perpetually. These systems are currently permeating every aspect of our daily lives, poised to revolutionize our existence in a way much more profound than even the introduction of electric motors or personal computers. The inception of this technology stems from the intersection of research and technological advancements across a spectrum of disciplines, encompassing embedded systems, pervasive computing, communication technologies, wireless networks, mobile computing, distributed computing, and agent technologies. Embedded and pervasive computing have evolved into pivotal technologies shaping the trajectory of future research and development efforts in various academic and industrial sectors. 
  
 Among a series of highly successful International Conferences on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC), the EUC 2024 conference is the 22nd edition of a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to address the profound challenges that arise and to present and discuss their new ideas, research results, applications, and experiences on all aspects of embedded and ubiquitous computing. IEEE EUC 2024 is sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, and IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC). 
  
 The 2024 Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC 2024) will offer a prominent and cutting-edge platform for researchers, engineers, and practitioners to showcase state-of-the-art advancements and innovations in theoretical foundations, systems, infrastructure, tools, testbeds, and applications within the field of EUC. Additionally, the conference aims to identify emerging research topics and delineate the future trajectory of the discipline. 
  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to EUC 2024. Accepted papers will be submitted for possible inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore's scope and quality requirements. The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.

 Introduction 
 Embedded and ubiquitous computing represent a paradigm designed to deliver continuous computing and communication services to end users universally and perpetually. These systems are currently permeating every aspect of our daily lives, poised to revolutionize our existence in a way much more profound than even the introduction of electric motors or personal computers. The inception of this technology stems from the intersection of research and technological advancements across a spectrum of disciplines, encompassing embedded systems, pervasive computing, communication technologies, wireless networks, mobile computing, distributed computing, and agent technologies. Embedded and pervasive computing have evolved into pivotal technologies shaping the trajectory of future research and development efforts in various academic and industrial sectors. 
  
 Among a series of highly successful International Conferences on Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC), the EUC 2024 conference is the 22nd edition of a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to address the profound challenges that arise and to present and discuss their new ideas, research results, applications, and experiences on all aspects of embedded and ubiquitous computing. IEEE EUC 2024 is sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, and IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC). 
  
 The 2024 Embedded and Ubiquitous Computing (EUC 2024) will offer a prominent and cutting-edge platform for researchers, engineers, and practitioners to showcase state-of-the-art advancements and innovations in theoretical foundations, systems, infrastructure, tools, testbeds, and applications within the field of EUC. Additionally, the conference aims to identify emerging research topics and delineate the future trajectory of the discipline. 
  
 Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to EUC 2024. Accepted papers will be submitted for possible inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.
