 INTRODUCTION 
 In Bologna you will find themost ancient University of the world, founded in 1088, and nowadays ranked amongst the most important and influencing European academic institutions. 
 In this charming medieval city you will also find athriving scientific environment, where research on AI is conducted side by side to public bodies (CINECA Consortium hosts the largest Italian computing center for Big Data; the EU chose the data center of the European Center for Weather Forecast), and to the private initiative (the region has the largest number of startup companies per inhabitant in Italy). 
 Many researchers are already exploiting AI to solve a plethora of sustainability-related issues. 
 We strongly believe that AI will be the key to also understand the sustainability theme in a holistic manner, helping us to reach some awareness over the complexities of our planet, our ecosystems, and our societies. 
 The conference will be supported by theEuropean Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI)and theItalian Association for Artificial Intelligence (AIxIA). 
 We are eager to meet you in Bologna, to know your ideas and views over AI, to share knowledge and to enjoy together some unforgettable moments.

Since 1974, ECAI has been the premier venue for presenting AI research in Europe, and this annual conference has becometheplace for researchers and practitioners of AI to discuss the latest trends and challenges in all subfields of AI, and to demonstrate innovative applications and uses of advanced AI technology. ECAI 2023 received 1896 submissions – a record number – of which 1691 were retained for review, ultimately resulting in an acceptance rate of 23%. The 390 papers included here, cover topics including machine learning, natural language processing, multi agent systems, and vision and knowledge representation and reasoning. PAIS 2023 received 17 submissions, of which 10 were accepted after a rigorous review process. Those 10 papers cover topics ranging from fostering better working environments, behavior modeling and citizen science to large language models and neuro-symbolic applications, and are also included here. 
 Presenting a comprehensive overview of current research and developments in AI, the book will be of interest to all those working in the field.
