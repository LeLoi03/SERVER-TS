 TheInternational Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling(ICAPS) is the premier forum for exchanging news and research results on the theory and applications of intelligent and automated planning and scheduling technology. 
 Planning and Scheduling are optimisation problems which require finding a set of actions to complete a task, to achieve a goal, or to optimise one or more objectives. Effective solutions to planning and scheduling problems are critical for a variety of important application areas, including Industry 4.0, aerospace systems, supply chain management, software engineering, robotics, education, digital entertainment and more. 
 ICAPS 2025is the 35th edition of the ICAPS conference series and will take place in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia in November 2025. The conference will be co-located with the following events: 
 href="https://kr.org//KR2025/" - KR-2025 | : The 22nd International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. 
 href="https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2025" - CPAIOR-2025 | : The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research. 
 Planning and Optimisation Summer School 2025 | , the details of which will be announced here at a future date.
