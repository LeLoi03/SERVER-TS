 Duisburg at theRhineis the westernmost city in the Ruhr region, part of the Rhein-Ruhr metropole, thelargest contiguous conurbation in Germanyand the fifth largest in Europe (Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region). 
 In Germany, Duisburg stands for coal and steel (until the middle of the last century), but for the last 30 years it has been undergoing structural change towards new industrial fields (continuing high tech steel manufacturing) and regional and national tasks. The Port of Duisburg is thelargest inland port in the worldand one of the most central logistical hubs in Europe. 
 The entire region with the central cities of Duisburg, Essen, Bochum and Dortmund as well as 54 smaller local cities was chosen as one of theEuropean Capitals of Culture in 2010, highlighting in particular thecoexistenceofindustry,cultureand itscenturies-old social diversity. 
 The University of Duisburg-Essen is conveniently situated near several renowned destinations, including theUNESCO World Heritage sitesinCologneandAachen(cathedrals),Essen (Zeche Zollverein), and theRoman limes wallinXanten.

 How to Submit 
 We invite two types of submissions, regular papers and poster presentations, which will undergo a competitive review process. All papers must present original and unpublished work that is not currently under review elsewhere. Each paper will be reviewed by at least three independent referees. Papers will be evaluated according to their significance, originality, technical content, style, clarity, and relevance to the conference. 
 Quantitative and/or qualitative methods and results are welcome, as well as hypotheses-driven or more open-ended exploratory work. Submissions must clearly outline the methodology (manipulations, measurements, environment and context, etc.) and technologies used, for both replicability and enabling in-depth review. In addition, research providing novel system designs, algorithms, interface technologies, and computational methods supporting elements of situation management are encouraged. Submitted papers should address issues related to the general domain of situation management. 
 Regular Papers (5-8 pages): describe new results that advance the state-of-the-art. Each accepted paper will be allocated approximately 25 minutes for the oral presentation during the conference. 
 Poster Presentations (3-5 pages): describe work in progress. Each accepted poster will be presented in a 5 min. talk in the poster session, and will be included in the final conference proceedings submitted to the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. 
 At least one author of an accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference, unless the TPC grants permission for a substitute presenter arranged in advance of the event who is qualified both to present and answer questions. All paper submissions will be handled electronically in EDAS. Authors should prepare a Portable Document Format (PDF) version of their paper using thestylesheet templates provided by IEEE. 
 Papers must have been presented on-site at the conference in Duisburg to be included in thefinal conference proceedings submitted to the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library. 
 Call for special session proposals 
 The CogSIMA 2025 Organizing Committee is welcoming proposals for Special Sessions on complex heterogeneous dynamical systems - of interacting humans, machines, and computer agents - whose collective behavior depends on their cognitive capabilities to comprehend, explain, predict, and act upon the surrounding operational situations. 
 The purpose of special sessions is to stimulate a focused discussion on new or innovative topics. Of particular interest are proposals that address “breaking news” research or topics different from traditional situation understanding and management related topics. Organizers of accepted special sessions will be asked to chair the session and will be consulted when finalizing the list of papers in the session. 
 Proposal Requirements 
 Each special session proposal should include an overview of the topic that identifies its relevance and introduces the papers to be presented. This description will be made available in the proceedings. Each proposal should also include a list of committed papers. 
 The following information must be included in a special session proposal: 
 Title of the proposed special session 
 Names and affiliations of the organizers | including brief bio and contact information 
 Session abstract (less than 250 words) | including the significance of the topic and the rationale for the proposed session 
 List of committed papers | including a tentative title, author list, and a short abstract for each paper. At least 5 papers are expected. 
 Evaluation Criteria 
 Special session proposals will be evaluated based on the importance of the topic, relevance to the cognitive and computational aspects of situation management, number of potential papers (assessed from the list of committed papers), and the qualification of the organizers. Once the proposal has been approved, it will be included among the sessions available for authors to submit their papers to. All papers submitted to a special session will be reviewed through the same review process as the regular papers of the conference to ensure that contributions are of high quality. If a special session has more papers accepted than the schedule can accommodate, some papers might be moved to other relevant sessions.
