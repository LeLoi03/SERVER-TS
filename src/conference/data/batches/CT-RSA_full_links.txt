CT-RSA 2025 
 The Cryptographers' Track at RSA Conference 
 San Francisco, California, USA • April 28–May 1, 2025 
 href="/" - Call for Papers
href="/submission.html" - Paper Submission
ProgramAttendingRSA Conferenceis the premiere trade show for the security industry, hosting over 40,000 attendees each year from industry, government, and academia. TheCryptographers' Track (CT-RSA)is RSAC's venue for scientific papers on cryptography. It presents a unique opportunity for researchers to share their work with a broader audience than at a typical academic conference. 
 Important Dates 
 Paper submission: | October 15, 2024 | October 30, 2024 
 Notification of decision: January 10, 2025 
 Camera-ready versions due: January 20, 2025 
 Author presentations due: April 03, 2025 
 Conference: April 28–May 1, 2025 
 Call for Papers 
 Original papers on all technical aspects of cryptology are solicited for submission. Papers of interest to the wider audience of security professionals at RSA Conference are especially encouraged. Topics include but are not limited to: 
 Blockchains and distributed ledger security 
 Code based cryptography 
 Cryptanalysis 
 Cryptographic standards 
 Design and security analysis of cryptographic primitives and protocols 
 Differential privacy 
 Formal verification of cryptographic security properties 
 Hardware & software implementations 
 Indistinguishable obfuscation 
 Information-theoretic cryptography 
 Multi-party computation and zero-knowledge 
 Novel applications of cryptography 
 Physically unclonable functions 
 Post-quantum cryptography 
 Privacy 
 Public-key cryptography algorithms and protocols 
 Public-key encryption and advanced encryption schemes 
 Side-channel attacks and defenses 
 Symmetric-key cryptography 
 Theory of leakage resistance 
 Time-released cryptography and PoW 
 White-box cryptography 
 We also welcomesystematization of knowledge (SoK)papers. These papers will not be judged on novel research contributions, but on their value to the research community. SoK papers should provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area; support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence; or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate for acceptance. 
 For submissions including practical evaluations, it is encouraged (but not required) to make implementations available to facilitate replicability and reproducibility. 
 Accepted papers (including SoK papers) will appear in the CT-RSA proceedings, published by Springer in its LNCS series. 
 CT-RSA is scheduled to be an in-person event. One of the things that makes CT-RSA special is the interaction between academia and industry. For that reason, it isstronglypreferred that authors of accepted papers present their work in-person. Exceptions will be made only in the case of serious extenuating circumstances, such as COVID restrictions, visa delays, and other emergencies.The presenter of each paper will be given a free Full Pass to RSA Conference.Program Committee
