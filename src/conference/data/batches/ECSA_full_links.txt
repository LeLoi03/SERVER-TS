 19th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA 2025) 
  
 September 15-19, 2025, 5* St. Raphael Resort and Marina, Limassol, Cyprus 
  
 https://conf.researchr.org/home/ecsa-2025 
  
 (*** Proceedings to be published by Springer in LNCS ***) 

The European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA) is the premier European software 
 architecture conference, providing researchers, practitioners, and educators with a platform to 
 present and discuss the most recent, innovative, and significant findings and experiences in the 
 field of software architecture research and practice. The 19th European Conference on Software 
 Architecture (ECSA 2025) will be held from September 15 to 19, 2025. ECSA 2025 is planned as 
 an in-person conference taking place in the beautiful city of Limassol (Cyprus). 

SCOPE 
  
 The theme for ECSA 2025 is “impactful software architecture”. The software architecture 
 discipline has had a critical role in shaping robust, scalable, and maintainable systems. We are 
 interested in learning about software architecture principles and practices, emergence trends 
 and case studies highlighting strategic architectural choices that can lead to enhanced 
 performance, improved collaboration, and long-term sustainability. The overarching question is 
 how these architectural principles and practices, both well-established and emerging, are 
 making an impact in real-world systems, and how that impact is being felt across various 
 domains, from enterprise systems to more novel areas like, e.g., AI-driven or autonomous 
 applications? 
  
 The Program Committee of the 19th European Conference on Software Architecture seeks 
 submissions of original and unpublished high-quality papers describing fundamental and 
 applied research; new methods, approaches, and processes; novel applications; education and 
 training in software architecture; and experience reports on all topics related to software 
 architecture. 
  
 We particularly encourage papers that demonstrate that diversity in gender, culture, religion, 
 country, etc. are key factors for success and innovation in software architecture. 
  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
  
 • Foundational principles of software architecture 
 • Relationship of requirements engineering and software architecture 
 • Quality attributes and software architectures 
 • Architecture practices for secure, explainable, and trustworthy software 
 • Architecture design and analysis 
 • Architecture description languages and meta-models 
 • Architecture verification and validation 
 • Management of architectural knowledge, decisions, and rationale 
 • Architecture patterns, styles, and tactics; reference architectures 
 • Architecture viewpoints and views 
 • Architecture conformance 
 • Software architecture virtualization and visualization 
 • Architecture-centric process models and frameworks 
 • Software architecture and agile, incremental, iterative, and continuous development 
 • Component-based models and deployment; middleware 
 • Software architecture and system architecture 
 • Software tools and environments for architecture-centric software engineering 
 • Ethics, cultural, economic, business, social, human, and managerial aspects of software 
 architecture 
 • Architecture and technical debt 
 • Architecting for sustainable and environment friendly systems 
 • Applying AI and LLMs in software architecture and architecting for AI and LLM intensive 
 systems 
 • Software architecture education 
 • Cross-disciplinary approaches to software architecture 
 • Architectures for reconfigurable and self-adaptive systems 
 • Architectural concerns of autonomic systems 
 • Software architecture applied to new and emerging areas, such as the cloud/edge, big data, 
 blockchain, cyber-physical systems, IoT, autonomous systems, systems-of-systems, energy- 
 aware software, quantum computing, AI-enabled systems 
 • Empirical studies, systematic literature reviews, and mapping studies in software architecture 
 • Diversity, equity, and inclusion in activities related to software architecture 

PAPER SUBMISSIONS 
  
 ECSA 2025 seeks four types of papers for the research track: 
 • Research papers (max. 16 pages in LNCS style) which describe novel contributions to software 
 architecture research (submissions should cover work that has a sound scientific/technological 
 basis and has been validated) 
 • Education and training papers (max. 16 pages in LNCS style) that address methodologies, 
 experiences and best practices for teaching and training software architecture 
 • Experience reports (max. 16 pages in LNCS style) that cover innovative implementations, 
 novel applications, insightful performance results and experience in applying software 
 architecture research advances to practical situations and systems 
 • Short papers (max. 8 pages in LNCS style) that present novel and preliminary work-in- 
 progress or challenges in a topic of software architecture research, education, and training. 
 Submissions must have a sound basis, but not necessarily be validated in full. 
  
 All submitted papers will undergo a rigorous double-blind peer review process. Papers will be 
 selected based on originality, quality, soundness, and relevance. All contributions must be 
 original, not published, accepted, or submitted for publication elsewhere. Contravention of this 
 concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of ethics, and appropriate action 
 will be taken in all such cases. Plagiarism checking will be conducted and any paper reporting 
 more than a 20% match with published work will be desk-rejected. 
  
 To note is that research papers, education and training papers, and experience reports that are 
 rejected in their categories may be re-evaluated as short papers only if the committee decides 
 on rejection of the full paper on the basis that it presents preliminary work. 
  
 The research track of ECSA 2025 supports an Open Science policy. We encourage all 
 contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data/artifacts to increase 
 reproducibility. Note that sharing research artifacts is not mandatory for submission or 
 acceptance. Upon submission to the research track, authors are required: 
  
 • To make their artifacts available to the program committee (via a link to an anonymous 
 repository) and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or 
 • To include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and 
 • To indicate why they do not intend to make their data or study materials publicly available 
 upon acceptance, if that is the case 
  
 While sharing research artifacts is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, authors are 
 required to include a Data Availability statement after the Conclusions section in a section 
 named "Data Availability". This statement should explain whether or not data and/or artifacts 
 are available or how they could be accessed (or not). Upon acceptance, papers with Open 
 Science artifacts (e.g., data, tools, etc.) will be invited to upload their artifacts into the ECSA 
 Zenodo community (https://zenodo.org/communities/ecsa) to make them accessible and 
 visible to the ECSA community. Sharing artifacts via the ECSA Zenodo community is required for 
 authors to be eligible for the best Open Artifact award. 
  
 All contributions must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS style 
 http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0. Page limits include 
 figures and references. 
  
 Contributions need to be submitted in PDF format via EasyChair to the ECSA 2025 Research 
 Track: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecsa2025. Please select the “Research Track” 
 in EasyChair for your submission and click "Continue". 
  
 The proceedings will be published by Springer as part of the LNCS series. We also plan to 
 organize a Journal Special Issue on the theme of ECSA 2025 and to invite authors of selected 
 papers to submit an extended version of their research.
