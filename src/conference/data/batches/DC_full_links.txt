Webinars 
 href="https://www.dublincore.org/webinars/2025/metadata-chinese-students-archives/" - Chinese Students in Archives: Radical Empathy & Metadata

This webinar explores the representation of early Chinese international students at the University of Illinois, focusing on archival materials and metadata. Using the principle of radical empathy, the study identifies key issues— inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and inappropriateness—affecting discoverability and engagement. Introducing the “Three-I Framework,” the session highlights systemic factors shaping archival records and advocates for holistic, empathetic strategies beyond metadata enhancement to address subtle marginalization and improve access to these historical narratives.
