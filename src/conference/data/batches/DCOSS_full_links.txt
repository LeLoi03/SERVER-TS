 DCOSS-IoT 2025 
 Tuscany (Lucca), Italy, June 9-11, 2025 
 The 21st Annual International Conference on Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things (DCOSS-IoT 2025) will take place in Tuscany (Lucca), Italy. The conference intended since its creation to cover several aspects of distributed computing in smartsystems such as high level abstractions and models, systematic design methodologies, signal and information processing, algorithms, analysis and applications. Starting from the 2023 event, DCOSS is broadening its scope beyond sensor networks to smart systems in general as well as the Internet of Things (IoT). The updated name is “Distributed Computing in Smart Systems and the Internet of Things” (DCOSS-IoT).
