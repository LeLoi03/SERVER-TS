 The International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP) is the premier annual conference on all aspects of computing with constraints, including theory, algorithms, models, solvers, and a diverse range of applications in machine learning/artificial intelligence, planning, and scheduling, to name a few. This is the 31st version of thehref="https://www.a4cp.org/events/cp-conference-series" - CP series
organized by thehref="https://www.a4cp.org/" - Association for Constraint Programming
. 
 The CP 2025 program will include presentations of high quality scientific papers on constraints technology. It will be located in Glasgow, Scotland at theUniversity of Glasgow. 
 This year, CP will be co-located with thehref="http://satisfiability.org/SAT25/" - 28th International
                                    Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT 2025)
, thehref="https://socs25.search-conference.org/" - 18th International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS 2025),
and thehref="https://smt-workshop.cs.uiowa.edu/2025/" - 23rd International Workshop on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT 2025)
. Additionally, thehref="https://sat-smt-ar-school.gitlab.io/www/2025/" - SAT/SMT/AR Summer School
will be held in St Andrews during the week before the conference.
