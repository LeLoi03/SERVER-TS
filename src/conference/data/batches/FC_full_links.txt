 Financial Cryptography and Data Security is a major international forum for research, advanced development, education, exploration, and debate regarding information assurance, with a specific focus on commercial contexts. The conference covers all aspects of securing transactions and systems. Original works focusing on both fundamental and applied real-world deployments on all aspects surrounding commerce security are solicited. Submissions need not be exclusively concerned with cryptography. Systems security and interdisciplinary works are particularly encouraged. 
 The goal of the conference is to bring security and cryptography researchers and practitioners together with economists, bankers implementers and policy-makers. Intimate and colourful by tradition the FC program features invited talks, academic presentations technical demonstrations and panel discussions. In addition, severalworkshopswill be held in conjunction with the FC conference.

 Number | Paper submission deadline 
 0, 1 | 8 October (original deadline) 
 2, 3, 4 | 9 October 
 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | 10 October 
 A, B, C, D, E, F | 11 October 
 The random number in slot 10100000 is0x8fbc79eb733d3fef8d218a0924bda4a0ff676317790dc58c278a462f7d9c03aed1618be49df1fd77e44f0c8ef260e0ea14c7bda670d0262cc473a6a87b67eb21dcef93e75dd29d98f1c3872432e9de58e2b20f602795baa551c082cea435d52eand the FC25 submission deadline is thus11 October 2024.

 short papers (8 pages + references; no appendices), and 
 systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers (20 pages + references and appendices) 
 Workshop proposals | (2 pages)

.href="https://crypto.unibe.ch/fc25/" - 
href="https://crypto.unibe.ch/fc25/" - Click here to submit a paper
Workshop and tutorial proposals should be sent by email tohref="mailto:fc25workshops@ifca.ai" - fc25workshops@ifca.ai
,and should not be anonymized. For more details, see the corresponding sections below. 
 General Information 
 For each accepted paperthe conference requires at least one registration at the general or academic rate, and paper authors must sign thehref="http://ifca.ai/documents/copyright.html" - IFCA copyright
form
when submitting the final version. Alternatively, individual papers can be published as fully open access—the publisher charges authors a fee for this. 
 Format 
 Papers must be formatted in standard LNCS format (templates) and submitted as PDF files. Submissions in other formats will be rejected. All papers must be submitted electronically according to the instructions and forms found here and at the submission site. 
 Anonymous Submission 
 Regular and short research paper submissions as well as SoKs must be anonymized with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. Failure to properly anonymize submitted papers is grounds for a desk rejection without review. It is acceptable (but by no means required) for submitted papers to be published online in non-anonymous form (e.g., on authors' websites or archives like the Cryptology ePrint Archive or arXiv.org). Program committee members will be instructed not to actively seek to de-anonymize papers. 
 Original Submissions 
 Authors may submit only work that does not substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has been accepted for publication to any other peer-reviewed conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal. We consider double submission serious research fraud and will treat it as such. Note that it is acceptable for papers to appear in non-peer-reviewed formats (for example, as technical reports or in online archives such as ePrint). In case of doubt contact the program chairs for any clarifications. 
 Ethics and Etiquette 
 Authors are required to read and followthis informationon ethics and etiquette. 
 Conflict of Interest 
 Authors must report in the submission site any conflicts with program committee members. A conflict exists if an author has the same affiliation as a committee member, has ever acted as their PhD supervisor or been supervised by them, has a close personal relationship with them, or if they have been co-authors on a paper within the past two years. PC chairs are not allowed to submit papers where they appear as (co-)authors. 
 PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the "conflict chair". 
 Evaluation Criteria 
 Regular Research Papers 
 Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to rigorous peer review. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Submissions are limited to 15 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices so the full papers should be intelligible without them. 
 Short Papers 
 Short papers are also subject to peer review; however, the intention is to encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel applications, and corporate/industrial experiences. Short papers will be evaluated with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking participants' interest and future research avenues. Short paper submissions are limited to 8 pages in standard LNCS format, excluding references. The title for short papers must begin with the text "Short Paper:". Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. The authors of some submissions not accepted as regular research papers may be offered the option of acceptance as a short paper. 
 Systematization of Knowledge Papers 
 We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. To be suitable for publication, SoK articles must provide an added value beyond a literature review, such as novel insights, identification of research gaps, or challenges to commonly held assumptions. SoK paper submissions are limited to 20 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible without them. The paper title for systematization of knowledge papers must begin with the text "SoK:". 
 Workshop Proposals 
 Proposals for workshops to be held in connection with the conference are solicited. A workshop can be a full day or half day in length. 
 Workshop proposals should include: 
 Title 
 (Draft) Call for papers 
 Brief summary and justification, including how it would fit into the greater FC scope 
 (Tentative) Program Committee and its chair(s) 
 One-paragraph biographies for key organizers, the expected (or previous, if the workshop has been held in previous years) number of submissions, participants and acceptance rates 
 Workshop proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent tohref="mailto:fc25workshops@ifca.ai" - fc25workshops@ifca.ai
. Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots. 
 Tutorials 
 Proposals for tutorials to be given in connection with the conference are solicited. A tutorial can be a full day or half day in length. 
 Tutorial proposals should include: 
 Title 
 Description 
 Name(s) of presenter(s) 
 Brief biographies for all presenters 
 Information about previous tutorials given by the presenter(s) 
 Tutorial proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent tohref="mailto:fc25workshops@ifca.ai" - fc25workshops@ifca.ai
(the same address as for workshop proposals). Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots. 
 Rump Session 
 The conference will also include the popular "rump session" held on one of the evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the conference. Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the conference). This submission should consist of a talk title, the name of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract. Submissions may be sent via e-mail or submitted in person in the morning on the day of the session.
