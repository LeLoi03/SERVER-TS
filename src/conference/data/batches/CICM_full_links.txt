 The 18th Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM 2025) 
 Objectives 
 Digital and computational solutions are the prevalent means for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of mathematical information. Separate communities have developed to investigate and build computer based systems for automated deduction, computer algebra, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user interfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their integration can lead to synergies offering significant added value. The Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM) offers a venue for discussing and developing solutions to the great challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas. 
 The conference addresses research from these areas, and it usually adds workshops and a doctoral programme.

 TheConference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM)is an organization and a conference dedicated to promoting the advancement of machine-supported reasoning, computation, and knowledge management in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. CICM is the result of convergence of various research communities that organize a joint annual conference in which they are represented as conference tracks: Calculemus, Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML), and Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM). This is the CICM home page. 
 Next Meeting: 
 href="2025" - CICM-18 | will be held in Brasília, Brazil, Oct 6-11 2025, co-chaired by Valeria de Paiva and Peter Koepke, and organized by Mauricio Ayala-Rincón.
