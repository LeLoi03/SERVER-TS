 Educational Data Mining 2025 
 Welcome to the Educational Data Mining Conference 2025 
 July 20-23, Palermo, Italy 
 In an era dominated by artificial intelligence, where machines can surpass human performance in numerous cognitive tasks, it’s imperative that our educational systems evolve. As AI reshapes the workforce, traditional incentives that motivate learning are rapidly changing. This shift presents a unique opportunity—and necessity—for the educational data mining (EDM) community to redefine learning objectives and outcomes. We are poised to lead the transformation in education by leveraging our dual expertise in AI and educational science, ensuring that future generations benefit from these advances. 
 Topic of Interests 
 Developing new techniques for mining educational data 
 Domain Knowledge Modeling 
 Educational Recommenders, Instructional Sequencing, and Personalized Learning 
 Equity, Privacy, Transparency, and Fairness 
 Human Factors, Transparency, and Explainability 
 Learner Cognitive and Behavior Modeling and its association with performance 
 Learner Knowledge and Performance Modeling 
 Comparing Human and Artificial Intelligence 
 Learning Analytics 
 Social and Collaborative Learning 
 Reproducibility 
 We are thrilled to welcome you to the beautiful city of Palermo, where we will explore how artificial intelligence is reshaping learning and teaching in profound ways. 
 This year, we are excited to feature two parallel conferences:href="https://educationaldatamining.org/edm2025/parallel-events/" - the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) and Learning at Scale (L@S)
. Running concurrently, these events provide a unique opportunity for attendees to engage with cutting-edge research and discussions in both AI in education and large-scale learning systems. This joint gathering aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and offer a comprehensive platform for shaping the future of education, empowering both learners and educators. 
 Join us in Palermo to be part of this dynamic exchange of ideas with a global community of innovators and educators as we collectively redefine the educational paradigms of tomorrow. 
 We look forward to inspiring discussions and groundbreaking insights at EDM 2025!
