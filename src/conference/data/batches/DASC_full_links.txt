 As computer and communication systems, as well as other systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and Autonomous Robotic Systems, become increasingly large and complex, their Dependability and Security play critical roles in supporting next-generation science, engineering, and commercial applications. It remains a challenge to design, analyze, evaluate, and improve the dependability and security of a large-scale computing environment. Trusted and autonomic computing/autonomous systems need synergistic research efforts covering many disciplines, from natural sciences to social sciences. It requires scientific and technological advances in a variety of fields, as well as new software, architectures, communication, and data platform technology that support the integration of the constituent technologies.

 Call For Papers 
 The 21st IEEE International Conference on Dependable, Autonomic & Secure Computing (DASC 2023) 
  
 Joint conference IEEE DASC/PICom/CBDCom/CyberSciTech 2023 
 14-17 Nov 2023 || Abu Dhabi, UAE 
 Hybrid Conference 
 ******************************************************************************************************************** 

As computer and communication systems, as well as other systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and Autonomous Robotic Systems, become increasingly large and complex, their Dependability and Security play a critical role in supporting next-generation science, engineering, and commercial applications. It remains a challenge to design, analyze, evaluate, and improve the dependability and security of a trusted computing environment. Trusted computing targets computing systems as well as services that are dependable, secure, protectable, predictable, traceable, controllable, autonomous, and sustainable. 
 At the same time, the increasing scale and complexity of systems call for the autonomic computing paradigm, which meets the requirements of self-management, and autonomous systems. Trusted and autonomic computing/autonomous systems need synergistic research efforts covering many disciplines, ranging from natural sciences to social sciences. It requires scientific and technological advances in a wide variety of fields, as well as new software, architectures, and communication technology that support the integration of constituent technologies. 
 IEEE DASC 2023 will be held during November 13-17, 2023, in Abu Dhabi, UAE. It aims to bring together computer scientists, industrial engineers, and researchers to discuss and exchange theoretical and implementation results, novel designs, work-in-progress, experience, case studies, and trend-setting ideas in the areas of dependability, security, trust, and/or autonomic computing, and autonomous systems.
