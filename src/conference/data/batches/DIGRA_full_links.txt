 Past Conferences 
 About Our Conferences 
 Our conferences gather several hundred people to share, talk, and debate about games and play – just like any scientists do at their conferences but possibly with a little bit more of fun. Our very first conference ‘Level Up’ was organised over 20 years ago at Utrecht University in the Netherlands by Joost Raessens, Marinka Copier, Jeffrey Goldstein, and Frans Mäyrä. Our future, meanwhile, is up to you! Around once a year, you can find a new call for conference hosts in ourhref="https://digra.org/latest-news/" - news section
. We are always on the lookout for research groups to bid us their location!

 June 30th – July 4th
