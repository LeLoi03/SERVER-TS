 The 20th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS'2024) 
 6-9 December, 2024, Xiamen, China 
 CIS'2024 was held successfully 
 Previous slideNext slideInternational Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS) is a major annual international conference to bring together researchers engineers, developers and practitioners from academia and industry working in all areas of two crucial fields in information processing: computational intelligence (CI) and information security (IS), to share the experience exchange and cross-fertilize ideas. In particular, the series of CIS conference provides an ideal platform to explore the potential applications of CI models algorithms and technologies to IS. 
 The Twentieth conference CIS’2024 serves as a forum for the dissemination of the state-of-the-art research, development, and implementations of systems, technologies and applications in these two broad fields. CIS’2024 will be held at Xiamen on 6-9 December 2024. 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit high-quality manuscripts written in English. The submission of a paper implies that the paper is original and has not been submitted to elsewhere for possible publication. All submissions will be blindly reviewed by experts in the field based on originality, significance, quality and clarity. Authors must not reveal any author information in the submitted paper(s), otherwise the paper(s) will be rejected immediately without going through the reviewing process. Authors should use the Latex style files or MS-Word templates to format their papers. 
 We shall further announce additional journals to publish a special issue for CIS’2024 in the near future.
