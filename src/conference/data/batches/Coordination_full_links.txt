COORDINATION 2025 - 27th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages 
 COORDINATION 2025 is one of the three conferences ofhref="." - DisCoTec 2025
. 
 Scope 
 Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today‚Äôs software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development. Building on the success of the previous editions, this conference provides a well-established forum for the growing community of researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation techniques for coordination. 
 Main topics 
 Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) coordination related aspects of: 
 Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: component composition, concurrency, distribution, mobility; dynamic, spatial and probabilistic aspects of coordination; logic, types, semantics. 
 Coordination of multi-agent and collective systems: models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour. 
 Coordination and modern distributed computing: web services, microservices, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing, reversible computing. 
 Session-based programming: models, languages, behavioural types, and tools. 
 Models, languages, verification techniques and tools for interacting smart contracts and (blockchain-based) decentralised applications. 
 Languages, methodologies and tools for secure coordination. 
 Cybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to cybersecurity. 
 Nature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination. 
 Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties, including performance and security aspects. 
 Dynamic software architectures: distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, parallel, high-performance and cloud computing. 
 Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application domains, like IoT, fog- and edge-computing. 
 Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the development and verification of coordinated applications, including DevOps approaches. 
 Coordination in business process management: coordination models for business process management, process mining techniques and tools for coordination models. 
 Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and coordination models, industry-driven efforts in coordination and case studies. 
 Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination. 
 Submissions 
 Submission categories: 
 Regular papers(12-18 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission. Companion artefacts to regular submissions will be reviewed by the Artefact Evaluation Committee, but the acceptance of the paper is decoupled from the acceptance of the artefact (does not depend on it). The acceptance of the artefact, however, is conditional to the acceptance of the paper. 
 Survey papers(16-25 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing important results and success stories related to the topics of COORDINATION. 
 Tool papers(4-15 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. Tool papers should provide a clear account of the tool‚Äôs functionality, discuss the tool‚Äôs practical capabilities possibly with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle, and,when applicable, report on realistic case studies (possibly providing a rigorous experimental evaluation). Tool papers may also provide an account of the theoretical foundations, including relevant citations, and present design and implementation concerns, possibly including software architecture and core data structures. Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly describe the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool, possibly providing data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. In addition, the tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation. Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted. The artefact will be evaluated by a dedicated committee. Papers may contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes length. 
 Artefact Submission Instructions üì£ 
 We invite you to also submit an associated artefact for evaluation (AE). Artefacts such as ancillary data, tools, and software will be assessed for availability, functionality, and reusability badges. 
 Instructions on how to upload artefacts can be foundhref="/2025/COORDINATION_Artefact_Evaluation_Guidelines.pdf" - here
. 
 As advertised in the call for papers, artefact submissions are mandatory for tool papers and optional for regular papers. Tool papers must submit an artefact that, at least, satisfies the requirements for theFunctionalbadge. Papers not meeting this clause are rejected. Moreover, the acceptance of artefacts is conditional on the tool paper being accepted. 
 A selection of artefacts may be invited for submission to a special issue of Science of Computer Programming (SCP). For reference, see the selected artefacts published in theSCP special issue from DisCoTec 2023.

 COORDINATION 2024 
 26th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages 
  
 Dates: June 18-20, 2024 
 Location: University of Groningen, The Netherlands 
 Website: https://www.discotec.org/2024/coordination 
  
 Paper submission deadline: February 09, 2024 
 Submission Link: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coordination2024 

Scope 
 ======== 
 Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, 
 distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable, and heterogeneous components. New 
 models, architectures, languages, and verification techniques are necessary to 
 cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today's software development. 
 Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in that they 
 provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, 
 therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing 
 software development. Building on the success of the previous editions, this 
 conference provides a well-established forum for the growing community of 
 researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation 
 techniques for coordination. 
  
 Main Topics 
 ============== 
 Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not 
 limited to) coordination-related aspects of: 
  
 - Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: 
 component composition, concurrency, distribution, mobility; dynamic, spatial 
 and probabilistic aspects of coordination; logic, types, semantics. 
 - Coordination of multi-agent and collective systems: 
 models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, 
 distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour. 
 - Coordination and modern distributed computing: 
 web services, microservices, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, 
 context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing, reversible 
 computing. 
 - Session-based programming: 
 models, languages, behavioural types, and tools. 
 - Models, languages, verification techniques, and tools for 
 interacting smart contracts and (blockchain-based) decentralised 
 applications. 
 - Languages, methodologies, and tools for secure coordination. 
 - Cybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to 
 cybersecurity. 
 - Nature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination. 
 - Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: 
 patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional 
 properties, including performance and security aspects. 
 - Dynamic software architectures: 
 distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, 
 parallel, high-performance and cloud computing. 
 - Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application 
 domains, like IoT, fog-, and edge-computing. 
 - Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments 
 for the development and verification of coordinated applications, including 
 DevOps approaches. 
 - Coordination in business process management: 
 coordination models for business process management, process mining 
 techniques and tools for coordination models. 
 - Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: 
 programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and 
 coordination models, industry-driven efforts in coordination and case 
 studies. 
 - Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination. 
  
 Invited Speaker 
 ================== 
 Marieke Huisman, University of Twente, The Netherlands 
  
 Important dates 
 ================== 
 - Abstract submission: February 02, 2024 
 - Paper submission: February 09, 2024 
 - Paper notification: March 29, 2024 
 - Camera-ready: April 24, 2024 
  
 Dates are Anywhere on Earth (AoE). 
  
 Submission 
 ============= 
 We invite you to submit: 
  
 - Regular papers (7-15 pages, not counting references): 
 describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. In 
 a clear case of need, as an exception, authors may ask for permission via 
 email to the PC co-chairs to exceed the paper's max length by at most 10%, 
 under the condition that last-minute shortening would really damage the 
 clarity of the paper or result in non-submission. The authors must make a 
 draft of the paper available to the PC co-chairs via EasyChair. 
  
 - Short papers (4-6 pages, not counting references): 
 describing research in progress or opinion papers on the past of 
 COORDINATION research, on the current state of the art, or on prospects for 
 the years to come. 
  
 - Survey papers (16-25 pages, not counting references): 
 describing important results and success stories related to the topics of 
 COORDINATION. 
  
 - Tool papers (4-15 pages, not counting references): 
 describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of 
 COORDINATION. Tool papers should provide a clear account of the tool's 
 functionality, discuss the tool's practical capabilities possibly with 
 reference to the type and size of problems it can handle, and, when 
 applicable, report on realistic case studies (possibly providing a rigorous 
 experimental evaluation). Tool papers may also provide an account of the 
 theoretical foundations, including relevant citations, and present design 
 and implementation concerns, possibly including software architecture and 
 core data structures. Papers that present extensions to existing tools 
 should clearly describe the improvements or extensions with respect to 
 previously published versions of the tool, possibly providing data on 
 enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. Papers may contain a 
 link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes 
 length. 
  
 Artefacts 
 ============ 
 Following ACM's definition [1], an artefact is "a digital object that was either 
 created by the authors to be used as part of the study or generated by the 
 experiment itself. For example, artifacts can be software systems, scripts used 
 to run experiments, input datasets, raw data collected in the experiment, or 
 scripts used to analyze results". 
  
 To improve and reward reproducibility and to give more visibility and credit to 
 the effort of tool developers in the COORDINATION community, authors of 
 submitted papers are invited to submit publicly available artefacts (using 
 permanent repositories such as Software Heritage, Zenodo, etc.), which will be 
 associated with their paper for evaluation. Based on the result of the artefact 
 evaluation, one or more badges may be applied to a paper. Specifically, 
 COORDINATION uses the EAPLS badging scheme [2], which in its own turn is based 
 on and consistent with the ACM initiative. 
  
 Artefact submission is mandatory for tool papers and the result of the artefact 
 evaluation will be considered in the tool paper's acceptance decision. Instead, 
 artefact submission is optional for all the other paper categories and the 
 result of the artefact evaluation will not affect the paper's acceptance 
 decision but may affect the best paper selection. 
  
 Dates (AoE): 
 - Artefact submission: February 29, 2024 
 - Kick-the-tires phase: 
 - Problem reports from reviewers: 8 March, 2024 
 - Authors' response to reviewers: 15 March, 2024 
 - Artefact notification: March 29, 2024

 Proceedings 
 ============== 
 The conference proceedings, consisting of accepted submissions from any paper 
 category, will be published by Springer in LNCS-IFIP volumes. 
  
 Special issues 
 ================= 
 After the conference, accepted papers (except for tool papers) selected from 
 COORDINATION and FORTE programmes will be invited to a special issue of the 
 Logical Methods in Computer Science journal. The paper submission deadline is 
 planned for October/November 2024, while the notifications for the first round 
 of reviews around February 2025. Selected accepted tool papers, instead, will be 
 invited to a special issue of a reputable journal with a track dedicated to 
 software, like the Journal of Science of Computer Programming's Software Track.
