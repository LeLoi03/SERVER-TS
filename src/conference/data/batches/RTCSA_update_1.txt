 How to Submit 
 All papers must be submitted in PDF format through the web-based submission systemhref="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ease2025" - EasyChair for EASE 2025
. Submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, including all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Up to two additional pages containing ONLY references are permitted. 
 All submissions should use the officialACM Primary Article Template. Deviating from the ACM formatting instructions may lead to a desk rejection. LaTeX users should use the following options: 
 \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} \acmConference[EASE 2025]{The 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering}{17–20 June, 2025}{Istanbul, Türkiye}Authors must comply with the SIGSOFT Open Science PolicySIGSOFT Open Science Policies. 
 EASE 2025 will employ a double-anonymous review process. Do not include author names or affiliations in submissions. All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person. Any online supplements, replication packages, etc., referred to in the work should also be anonymized. Advice for sharing supplements anonymously can be foundhere. 
 By submitting to EASE, authors agree to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and FalsificationACM Policy on Plagiarism, etc.. If the research involves human participants/subjects, the authors must adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjectshref="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects" - ACM Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects
. 
 Review Criteria 
 The reviewers will be encouraged to do a standards-based review. To see the criteria for standards-based reviews, please use this tool:href="https://acmsigsoft.github.io/EmpiricalStandards/form_generator/Checklist.html?role=author" - Empirical Standards Checklist
. 
 The reviews will evaluate submissions additionally against the following criteria: 
 Soundness: | The extent to which the paper’s contributions and innovations address its research questions and are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods 
 Significance: | The extent to which the paper’s contributions can impact the field of software engineering and under which assumptions (if any) 
 Novelty: | The extent to which the contributions are sufficiently original with respect to the state-of-the-art 
 Verifiability and Transparency: | The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to understand how an innovation works, how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, and how the paper supports independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions. 
 Presentation: | The extent to which the paper’s quality of writing meets the high standards of EASE, including clear descriptions, adequate use of the English language, absence of significant ambiguity, clearly readable figures and tables, and adherence to the formatting instructions provided above.
