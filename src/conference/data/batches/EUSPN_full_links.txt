The 15th International Conference on Emerging Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks (EUSPN-2024) is a leading international conference for researchers and industry practitioners to share their new ideas, original research results and practical development experiences from all Ubiquitous Systems and Pervasive Networks related areas. The EUSPN-2024 will be held in Leuven, Belgium on October 28-30, 2024. The EUSPN-2024 will be held in conjunction withthe 14th International Conference on Current and Future Trends of Information and Communication Technologies in Healthcare (ICTH-2024). 
 Leuvenis the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in Belgium. It is located about 25 kilometres (16 miles) east of Brussels. It is the 10th largest municipality in Belgium and the fourth in Flanders. Leuven is home to the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, the largest and oldest university of the Low Countries and the oldest Catholic university still in existence. The related university hospital of UZ Leuven, is one of the largest hospitals of Europe. The city is also known for being the headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer and one of the five largest consumer-goods companies in the world. 
 Leuven's Town Hall is one of the best-known Gothic town halls worldwide and Leuven's pride and joy. It took three architects and thirty years to build it. Leuven's 'Hall of Fame' features 236 statues, which were only added to the façade after 1850. There are 220 men and 16 women in total. On the bottom floor are famous Leuven scientists, artists and historical figures, dressed in Burgundian garb. The first floor is reserved for the patron saints of the various parishes of Leuven. Above them the façade is adorned by the counts and dukes of Brabant while the towers primarily feature biblical figures. 
 All EUSPN 2024 accepted papers will be published by Elsevier Science in the open-access Procedia Computer Science series on-line. Procedia Computer Science is hosted by Elsevier on www.Elsevier.com and on Elsevier content platform ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), and will be freely available worldwide.

 EUSPN 2024 will be held in conjunction with the 11th International Conference on Current and Future Trends of Information and Communication Technologies in Healthcare (ICTH: http://cs-conferences.acadiau.ca/icth-24/). Papers on either completed or ongoing research are invited in the following and related tracks: http://cs-conferences.acadiau.ca/euspn-24/call-for-papers.html 
  
 Venue 
 EUSPN 2024 will be held in the city of Leuven. Leuven is the capital of the province of Flemish Brabant in Belgium. It is located about 25 kilometres (16 miles) east of Brussels. It is the 10th largest municipality in Belgium and the fourth in Flanders. Leuven is home to the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, the largest and oldest university of the Low Countries and the oldest Catholic university still in existence. The related university hospital of UZ Leuven, is one of the largest hospitals of Europe. The city is also known for being the headquarters of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer and one of the five largest consumer-goods companies in the world. 
  
 The conference venue will be at Park Inn (by Radisson) Hotel (Leuven), which is located right in the heart of the Leuven city. The hotel is 
 less than 2 mins walk from the Leuven train station. All you have to do is to get off the train (or the taxi or the bus) and take the elevator to the bridge connecting the hotel with the rest of the city. Leuven city is directly connected with the Brussels International airport with a 13 min connection via train, 45 mins via bus or a 20 min by taxi (or Uber).
