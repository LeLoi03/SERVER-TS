 EMMSAD'2014 
 EMMSAD 2014 was co-located with the CAiSE 2014 conference held from 16-20 June 2014 in Thessaloniki, Greece. 
 The field of information systems analysis and design includes numerous information modeling methods and notations (e.g., ER, ORM, UML, Archimate, EPC, DEMO, DFDs, BPMN) that are typically evolving. Even with some attempts toward standardization (e.g., UML for object-oriented design), new modeling methods are constantly being introduced, many of which differ only marginally from existing approaches. These ongoing changes significantly impact the way information systems are being analyzed and designed in practice. EMMSAD focuses on exploring, evaluating, and enhancing current information modeling methods and methodologies. Though the need for such studies is well recognized, there is a paucity of such research in the literature. 
 The objective of the conference is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners interested in modeling methods in systems analysis and design to meet and exchange research ideas and results. It also gives the participants an opportunity to present their research papers and experience reports, and to take part in open discussions. 
 EMMSAD 2014 was the 19th in a series of events, previously held in Valencia, Heraklion, Barcelona, Pisa, Heidelberg, Stockholm, Interlaken, Toronto, Velden, Riga, Porto, Luxembourg, Trondheim, Montpellier, Amsterdam, Hammamet, London and Gdansk. This year we had 27 papers submitted with authors from 24 countries and five continents. After an extensive review process by a distinguished international Program Committee, with each paper receiving at least three reviews, we accepted 9 full papers and 3 short papers that appear in these proceedings. Congratulations to the successful authors! 
 Acknowledgements 
 Apart from the contribution by paper authors, the quality of EMMSAD 2014 depended in no small way on the generous contribution of time and effort by the Program Committee and the additional reviewers. Their work is greatly appreciated. We also express our sincere thanks to the CAiSE Organizing Committee.

 Abstract 
 Sustainability should become a key concern in the next generation of engineered systems. While this expectation is relatively straightforward, the question of how to get there is less obvious. The multi-dimensional and intricate nature of sustainability poses challenges in designing sustainable systems and analyzing sustainability properties. Finding trade-offs between economic, environmental, societal, and technological aspects of sustainability is a wicked problem and calls for advanced modeling and simulation methods. In this paper, we report on a panel discussion held at the 28th Working Conference on Exploring Modeling Methods for Systems Analysis and Development (EMMSAD) with four esteemed experts representing four complementary and often conflicting perspectives on the role of modeling for sustainability – stakeholders, digitalization, degrowth and IT, and ethics. We report the key arguments of the panelists, discuss the roles of modeling in the analysis and design of sustainable systems, and, finally, elaborate on the conflicts among the perspectives, their effects, and potential resolutions.
