 CASES  
 International Conference on Compilers, Architectures, and Synthesis for Embedded Systems  

 CASES: International Conference on Compilers, Architectures, and Synthesis for Embedded Systems  
 CASES is a premier forum where researchers, developers and practitioners exchange information on the latest advances in compilers and architectures for high-performance, low-power embedded systems. The conference has a long tradition of showcasing leading edge research in embedded processor, memory, interconnect, storage architectures and related compiler techniques targeting performance, power, predictability, security, reliability issues for both traditional and emerging application domains. In addition, we invite innovative papers that address design, synthesis, and optimization challenges in heterogeneous and accelerator-rich architectures.
