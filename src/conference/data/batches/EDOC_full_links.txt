International EDOC conference series 
 EnterpriseDesign,Operations andComputing 
 The EDOC conference series brings together leading computer science researchers IT decision makers, enterprise architects solution designers and practitioners to discuss enterprise computing challenges, models and solutions from the perspectives of academia, industry and government. The conference emphasizes a holistic view of enterprise applications engineering and management, fostering integrated approaches that can address and relate processes, people and technology. 
 Remembering Prof. Maria-Eugenia Iacob 
 The EDOC Steering Committee is deeply saddened by the news of the passing of Prof. Maria-Eugenia Iacob, an esteemed member of the EDOC community and full professor at the High-tech Business and Entrepreneurship Department at the University of Twente, The Netherlands. 
 Maria was well-known for her contributions to Enterprise Architecture. She co-authored the influential “Enterprise Architecture at Work” book, as well as many scientific publications pushing forward the field of Enterprise Computing. 
 She was a prolific author at EDOC, with about 30 contributions over the years. Among the many papers she published in EDOC, a key one in 2003 described the early results of the impactful ArchiMate project, while she was working at the Telematica Instituut (Telematics Institute). She started working at the University of Twente in 2006, to have more time for research, but also to educate and inspire students on the topics of Enterprise Architecture and Enterprise Systems Engineering. Her EDOC papers on these topics were often co-authored with her students. Many of her students became regular EDOC contributors after their graduation. Maria also served as EDOC workshops chair, and co-organized workshops at EDOC, e.g. the 3M4SE Workshop on Models and Model-driven Methods for Service Engineering. Her impact on the EDOC community is cherished and will be remembered. 
 We extend our condolences to her family, friends, and all those touched by her dedication and passion.

 Call For Papers 
 EDOC 2025 – 29th International Conference on Enterprise Design, Operations, and Computing 
 Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal 
 9-12 September 2025 
  
 The EDOC conference series brings together leading computer science researchers, IT decision makers, enterprise architects, solution designers and practitioners to discuss enterprise computing challenges, models and solutions from the perspectives of academia, industry and government. 
  
 The conference emphasizes a holistic view of enterprise applications engineering and management, fostering integrated approaches that can address and relate processes, people and technology. 
  
 The conference welcomes high-quality scientific submissions as well as experience papers from industry. EDOC is offering two submission rounds: 
 - First Round: Papers submitted by the first deadline may be accepted or rejected directly in a first review round. Alternatively, authors may be invited to submit a revised version of the paper to a second round for re-examination (with feedback similar to journal submissions). 
 - Second Round: Papers submitted by the second deadline are reviewed in the traditional way in one review round. 
  
 EDOC 2025 is co-located with the CBI 2025 - 27th International Conference on Business Informatics, following the great success of their collocation in 2024 in Vienna, Austria.

 Abstract 
 This short paper positions my doctoral research within the field of information systems, and, more specifically, to the EDOC community in preparation for the doctoral symposium. The research topic of my doctoral research is the design and implementation of Intelligence Amplification (IA) applications. Although extensively researched, there is no consensus in literature regarding the definition of IA, design knowledge is scattered across disciplines, and no routine design exists for IA applications. Therefore, the main aim of my doctoral research is two-fold to (1) establish a knowledge base for IA, as a foundation to (2) develop a design and action theory for IA. The knowledge base will be developed using established design science research methodologies and frameworks. Design knowledge regarding IA will be identified, analysed, and synthesized based on a systematic literature review using the PRISMA 2020 statement. The knowledge base will serve as a foundation for the design and action theory for IA. Action design research will be utilized to iteratively develop and evaluate an IA design method and practical design tools to help professionals and practitioners design and implement IA applications in the context of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0.
