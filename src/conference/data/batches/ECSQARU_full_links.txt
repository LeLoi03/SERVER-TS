 Present CFP : 2025 
 The biennial ECSQARU conferences (www.ecsqaru.org/) constitute a major forum for advances in the theory and practice of reasoning under uncertainty, with a focus on bringing symbolic and quantitative aspects together. Contributions come from researchers interested in advancing the scientific knowledge and from practitioners using uncertainty techniques in real-world applications. The scope of the ECSQARU conferences encompasses fundamental issues, representation, inference, learning, and decision making in qualitative and numeric uncertainty paradigms. 
  
 Previous ECSQARU events have been held in Arras (2023), Prague (2021), Belgrade (2019), Lugano (2017), Compiegne (2015), Utrecht (2013), Belfast (2011), Verona (2009), Hammamet (2007), Barcelona (2005), Aalborg (2003), Toulouse (2001), London (1999), Bonn (1997), Fribourg (1995), Granada (1993), and Marseille (1991). 
  
 ECSQARU 2025 will welcome papers on the theory and practice of reasoning under uncertainty. This includes the following topics, but is not limited to: 
  
 Algorithms for uncertain inference) 
 Applications of uncertain systems 
 Argumentation 
 Acting under uncertainty 
 Belief functions 
 Belief change and belief merging 
 Classification and clustering 
 Decision theory and decision graphs 
 Default reasoning and non-monotonicity 
 Description logics with uncertainty 
 Foundations of reasoning under uncertainty 
 Fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic 
 Game theory 
 Hybrid reasoning 
 Imprecise probabilities 
 Inconsistency handling 
 Information fusion 
 Learning for uncertainty formalisms 
 Logics for reasoning under uncertainty 
 Markov decision processes 
 Planning under uncertainty 
 Possibility theory and possibilistic logic 
 Preferences 
 Probabilistic graphical models 
 Probabilistic logics 
 Qualitative uncertainty models 
 Rough sets 
 Uncertainty and data 
  
 Submitted papers must be original and not under review in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. They will be evaluated by peer reviews based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. The reviewing process is single blind. 
  
 Authors of accepted papers are expected to attend the conference to present their work, at least one author of each paper must register for the conference. 
  
 Submitted papers must be at most 12 pages (excluding references) in the Springer LNCS/LNAI format: 
 https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines 
  
 Paper submission, in PDF format, will be managed through OpenReview at 
 https://openreview.net/group?id=ECSQARU.org/2025/Conference 
  
 and will be opened on January 1, 2025. It is mendatory to register an abstract beforehand. The abstract submission deadline is May 8, 2025; and the submission deadline for papers is May 15, 2025. 
  
 Accepted papers will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series, which is a LNCS subseries.
