 About 
 The 22nd European Conference on Multi-Agent Systems (EUMAS 2025) will be organized on September 3-5, 2025 by theFaculty of Automatic Control and ComputersatNational University of Science and Technology POLITEHNICA Bucharest, Romania. 
 EUMAS 2025 is anEURAMASdesignated event which follows the tradition ofprevious editions, and aims to encourage and support activity in the research and development of multi-agent systems, in academic and industrial effort. 
 The conference aspires to be the primary European forum for researchers interested inthe theory and practice of autonomous agents and multi-agent systems. EUMAS enables researchers to meet, present challenges, preliminary and mature research results in an open environment. 
 EUMAS 2025 features formal proceedings published as part of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series of Springer.
