EUROPEAN SOCIETY FOR FUZZY LOGIC AND TECHNOLOGY 
 href="https://www.facebook.com/EUSFLAT/" - Facebook 
 EUSFLATis a non-profit European society devoted to promote and disseminate the methods, techniques and developments of Fuzzy Logic and related technologies. Founded in 1999, EUSFLAT encourages the scientific communication and collaboration among its members, organizing, promoting and sponsoring conferences workshops and seminars. Indeed, the biannual EUSFLAT conferences bring together researchers in Fuzzy Logic and related technologies from all over the world. The society advises associates and companies on subjects regarding Fuzzy Logic and it is a member of the International Fuzzy Systems Association (IFSA) representing the European researchers at the IFSA council. 

OFFICIAL DECLARATION FROM EUSFLAT 
  
 We express our solidarity with people of Ukraine and all other people suffering from war, violence, and oppression. In the words of Martin Luther King Jr., "let peace and justice roll down like a mighty stream."
