Call For Papers 
 This one-day workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in optimizing database performance on modern computing infrastructure by designing new data management techniques and tools. 
 Topics of Interest 
 The continued evolution of computing hardware and infrastructure imposes new challenges and bottlenecks to program performance. As a result, traditional database architectures that focus solely on I/O optimization increasingly fail to utilize hardware resources efficiently. Multi-core CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, new memory and storage technologies (such as flash and non-volatile memory), and low-power hardware imposes a significant challenge to optimizing database performance. Consequently, exploiting the characteristics of modern hardware has become an essential topic of database systems research. 
 The goal is to make database systems adapt automatically to sophisticated hardware characteristics, thus maximizing performance transparently for applications. To achieve this goal, the data management community needs interdisciplinary collaboration with researchers from computer architecture, compilers, operating systems, and storage. This involves rethinking traditional data structures, query processing algorithms, and database software architectures to adapt to the advances in the underlying hardware infrastructure. 
 We seek submissions bridging database systems to computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems. We also invite submissions to our call for papers on hardware/software co-design for modern data-intensive workloads, including but not limited to machine learning training and inference, graph analytics, and similar tasks. As these workloads continue to grow in scale and complexity, innovative co-design approaches that tightly integrate hardware architectures and software systems are crucial to achieving breakthroughs in performance, energy efficiency, and scalability. In particular, submissions covering topics from the following non-exclusive list are encouraged: 
 database algorithms and data structures on modern hardware 
 cost models and query optimization for novel hierarchical memory systems 
 hardware systems for query processing 
 data management using co-processors 
 novel application of new storage technologies to data management 
 query processing using computing power in storage systems 
 database architectures for low-power computing and embedded devices 
 database architectures on multi-threaded and chip multiprocessors 
 performance analysis of database workloads on modern hardware 
 compiler and operating systems advances to improve database performance 
 new benchmarks for micro-architectural evaluation of database workloads 
 taking advantage of modern network capabilities for data processing 
 hardware/software co-design for modern data-intensive workloads (e.g., machine learning, graph analytics) 
 Submission Tracks 
 We invite submissions to two tracks: 
 Full papers: A full paper must be no longer than six pages, excluding the bibliography. There is no limit on the length of the bibliography. Full papers describe a complete work in data management for new hardware. Accepted papers will be given 10 pages (plus a bibliography) for the camera-ready version and a long presentation slot during the workshop. 
 Short Papers: Short papers must not exceed two pages, excluding the bibliography. Short papers describe very early-stage works or summaries of mature systems. Short papers will be included in the proceedings, given 4 pages (plus a bibliography) for the camera-ready version, and may be given a short presentation slot during the workshop. 
 All accepted papers (full and short) will also be presented as posters during a workshop poster session 
 Best of DaMoN 2025 
 This year all accepted DaMoN papers will be considered for abest paper award. 
 We intend to invite extended versions of a selection of DaMoN'25 papers for submission to the VLDB Journal. Extended papers that are accepted to the VLDB Journal will appear in a special section (“Best of DaMoN 2025”) within one of the regular VLDBJ issues. 
 Important Dates

 Notification of acceptance: April 28th, 2025 
 Camera-ready copies: TBD 
 Workshop: June 23rd, 2025

 Present CFP : 2024 
 The focus of this workshop is to strengthen the communication between the database community and broader computer systems communities, specifically the computer architecture, compiler, operating systems, and storage communities. As all of these fields evolve independently, database software has proven to under-utilize the underlying hardware technology. 
  
 In the last two decades, DaMoN has established itself as the primary venue for researchers to exchange information, learn from each other, and improve the interaction between the database software and the underlying hardware and devices, as well as discovering and understanding hardware trends and building strong data management systems for the future. 
  
 This workshop aims at researchers from both data management, computer architecture, and storage systems who are interested in optimizing database performance on modern computing infrastructure by designing new data management techniques and tools. 
  
 Submission site is now open: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DaMoN2024

 Topics of Interest 
 The continued evolution of computing hardware and infrastructure imposes new challenges and bottlenecks to program performance. As a result, traditional database architectures that focus solely on I/O optimization increasingly fail to utilize hardware resources efficiently. Multi-core CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, new memory and storage technologies (such as flash and non-volatile memory), and low-power hardware imposes a great challenge to optimizing database performance. Consequently, exploiting the characteristics of modern hardware has become an important topic of database systems research. 
  
 The goal is to make database systems adapt automatically to the sophisticated hardware characteristics, thus maximizing performance transparently to applications. To achieve this goal, the data management community needs interdisciplinary collaboration with computer architecture, compiler, operating systems and storage researchers. This involves rethinking traditional data structures, query processing algorithms, and database software architectures to adapt to the advances in the underlying hardware infrastructure. 
  
 We seek submissions bridging the area of database systems to computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems. In particular, submissions covering topics from the following non-exclusive list are encouraged: 
  
 database algorithms and data structures on modern hardware 
  
 cost models and query optimization for novel hierarchical memory systems

 We invite submissions to two tracks: 
  
 1) Full Papers: A full paper must be no longer than 6 pages excluding the bibliography. There is no limit on the length of the bibliography. Full papers describe a complete work in the area of data management for new hardware. Accepted papers will be given 10 pages (plus bibliography) for the camera-ready version and a long presentation slot during the workshop.
