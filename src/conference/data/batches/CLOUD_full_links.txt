 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CLOUD COMPUTING 
 CLOUD 2025 
 IEEE CLOUD is the flagship conference focusing on innovative cloud computing across all “Everything as a Service” (XaaS) paradigms. This includes modeling, designing, developing, publishing, monitoring, managing, operating, delivering, and scaling XaaS offerings from the cloud to the edge. The conference is a prime international forum for researchers, academics, businesses, industry, and standard bodies to exchange the latest advances in the state of the art and practice of cloud computing, identify emerging research topics, and define the future of cloud computing. 
 CLOUD 2025 is part of IEEE World Congress on SERVICES 2025, solely sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society under the auspice of the Technical Community on Services Computing (TCSVC). The scope of SERVICES 2025 covers all aspects of services computing and applications, current or emerging. Centered around services computing, SERVICES 2025 covers various systems and networking research pertaining to cloud, edge and Internet-of Things (IoT), as well as technologies for intelligent computing, learning, Big Data and blockchain applications, addressing critical issues such as knowledge network, high performance, security, privacy, dependability, trustworthiness, and cost-effectiveness. In addition to co-located theme-topic conferences, the Congress will also include symposia and workshops supporting deep-dive discussions on emerging important topics, and complement the SERVICES 2025 program with industry and application presentations and panels. Authors are invited to prepare early and submit original papers to any of these conferences at www.easychair.org. All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. Accepted and presented papers will appear in the conference proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. SERVICES 2025 is the only premier professional event for the services computing field offered by IEEE.

 Call for Papers 
 Introduction 
 New and FINAL paper submission deadline: April 29, 2025 
 IEEE JCC is the 16th international conference on innovative cloud computing technologies, with a particular focus on Joint-Cloud computing paradigms and emerging LLMs and generative models. The technologies include modeling, designing, implementing, operating and delivering dependable and scalable cloud services across collaborative cloud and edge computing environments. 
 Specifically, businesses usually adopt a multi-hybrid cloud strategy to achieve optimized portfolios of cloud services provided by different vendors and avoid single-vendor lock-in. Meanwhile, this strategy brings technical challenges and complexities to building, managing and operating multi-hybrid clouds. JointCloud is used to refer to but not limited to Hybrid-Cloud, Inter-Cloud, Multi-Cloud, Cloud Federation, Cross-Cloud and Cloud Service Broker (CSB), computing network convergence, big data systems, information-centric networking, and blockchain. 
 The main objective of the conference is to setup a prime international forum for researchers, practitioners and businesses to exchange the state-of-the-art advances in cloud techniques and best practices, and to identify emerging topics for defining the future of intelligent computing at scale.

 The 2025 IEEE World Congress on SERVICES (SERVICES 2025)is solely sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society under the auspice of the Technical Community on Services Computing (TCSVC). With six theme conferences, the scope of SERVICES 2025 covers all aspects of services computing and applications, current or emerging. 
 Centered around services computing, SERVICES 2025 covers various systems and networking research pertaining to cloud, edge and Internet-of Things (IoT), as well as technologies for intelligent computing, learning, Big Data and blockchain applications, addressing critical issues such as knowledge network, high performance, security, privacy, dependability, trustworthiness, and cost-effectiveness. 
 In addition to co-located theme-topic conferences, the Congress will also include symposia and workshops supporting deep-dive discussions on emerging important topics, and complement the SERVICES 2025 program with industry and application presentations and panels. 
 Authors are invited to prepare early and submit original papers to any of these conferences at www.easychair.org. All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. Accepted and presented papers will appear in the conference proceedings published by the IEEE Computer Society Press. 
 SERVICES 2025 is the only premier professional event for the services computing field offered by IEEE.
