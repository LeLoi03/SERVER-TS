 Fitness landscape analysis and manipulation in Biomedical disciplines 
  
 Aim 
 Many complex computational tasks in the bio-medical disciplines (e.g., Bioinformatics, Bioengineering, Systems Biology, Synthetic Biology, and Computational Biology) can be reformulated in terms of optimization problems, that is, the identification of the global minima (or maxima) of a given function (or multiple functions) inside a multi-dimensional search space. In global optimization techniques, which denote the algorithms leveraged to solve such problems, the data structures used to represent thecandidate solutionscan sometimes bedirectly decodedandinterpreted. Consequently, the best-fitting individuals immediately provide an explicit andhuman-readabledescription of the optimal solution. The researchers, who mainly focused on the creation of novel strategies, often aim to propose solutions able to balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the optimization algorithms. 
 Although this well-established research line is very prolific—paving the way for the design of efficient algorithms, even for large-scale problems—there is another promising direction that should be investigated, consisting in theanalysis and modification of the fitness landscape, that is the hyper-surface induced by the evaluation of the objective function for each point of the search space. Indeed, the analysis of the fitness landscape might help in the choice of the optimization algorithm to use and the choice of the space transformations to use, such as dilate, shrink, stretch, collapse, smooth, or remap the fitness landscape, leading to alternative or simplified formulations of the original optimization problem. 
 In discrete domains, a similar approach can be performed by embedding implicitor explicit assumptionsinto the structure of the candidate solutions. In such a way, the genetic operators can explore the feasible search space in a “smarter” way, reducing the overall computational effort. Examples of this technique include generative representations, techniques based on grammar, single parent techniques where example genes are incorporated, and other structured representations that starkly limit the portion of the search domain examined. 
 This special session aims to gather the researchers investigating new directions and ideas in the field ofcandidate solution representations, its dual notion offitness landscape manipulationandits analysisto tackle complex tasks, especially problems related to Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. 
 Scope 
 This Special Session welcomes any paper considering allnon-conventional candidate solution representations, including the dual perspective offitness landscape manipulation, andits analysis. 
 Examples include but are not limited to: 
 Non-conventional representations of candidate solutions 
 Dilation functions and other functions that reshape the fitness landscape 
 Generative automata 
 Alternative semantics for candidate solutions 
 Fitness landscape modification, simplification, and restriction 
 Novel closed variation/evolutionary operators 
 Implicit/relative representations 
 Generative or developmental representations 
 Self-adaptive representations 
 Parameterized manifolds of representations 
 State-conditioned representations 
 Procedural representations 
 Surrogate models 
 Highly interpretable representations

 SUBMISSION OF PAPERS 
 ----------------------------- 
 Regular papers 
 Prospective authors are invited to submit papers of no more than six-eight (6-8) pages in IEEE conference format including results, figures, and references. Papers must be in pdf form and written in English.Detailed instructions and templates for preparing your manuscripts can be found on the IEEE website. Each paper will be peer-reviewed. Submission implies the willingness of at least one author to register and present the paper at the conference. Each registration covers a maximum of two papers. Extra papers submitted by one registered author beyond the maximum of two papers per registration will incur a charge of US$150 per paper. Papers that are more than 8 pages in length will incur an extra length page charge of US$100/page. Papers longer than 10 pages in length will not be accepted. 
 Short papers (will be included on the conference website but not in IEEExplore) 
 Short papers may present preliminary findings from work in progress, and industry perspectives on issues relevant to CIBCB 2025. Short papers are expected to discuss a clear and focused central idea, incorporate discussion of relevant research or context, and provide references, as necessary. Short papers must adhere to theIEEE conference templateand have a length of no more than two (2) pages. Papers must be in PDF and written in English. Short papers will be desk reviewed by the CIBCB 2025 organisational committee. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper at the conference. Short papers will be presented either as a poster. 
 PUBLICATION 
 ----------------------------- 
 PDF versions of accepted papers will be distributed at the conference. At least one author of an accepted paper is required to register and present the paper at the conference. 
 IMPORTANT: An accepted paper will be published in the proceedings on IEEE Xplore only if the final camera-ready version is accompanied by the payment of at least one full registration for one of the authors. 
 Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to a special issue of an international scientific journal.
