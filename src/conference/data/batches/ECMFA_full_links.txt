 About 
 href="#Call-for-Papers" - Call for Papers 
 The 21st European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) will be held in Koblenz, Germany, (June 10-11, 2025) as part of STAF 2025 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). 
 Aims and scope 
 The European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) is the premier European forum dedicated to advancing the state of knowledge and fostering the application of all aspects of MBE and related approaches. 
 Its focus is on engaging the key figures of research and industry in a dialog that will result in stronger and more effective practical application of MBE, hence producing more reliable software based on state-of-the-art research results. 
 In the technical track, we invite high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results related to MBE. 
 href="#submissions-for-round-2" - Submissions for Round #2
The EasyChair instance reopened on January 17 and now accepts new submissions for round #2 
 Call for Papers 
 We are soliciting papers presenting original research on all aspects of model-based engineering. Two types of submissions are possible: 
 Foundation Papers | , dealing with modeling foundations, such as metamodeling, model transformations, model validation, verification and testing, model engineering methods and tools, and related aspects. 
 Application Papers | , dealing with the application of modeling techniques, including experience reports on the use of MBE methods and tools, industrial case studies, or successful applications of MBE practices in industry or in public administration, with significant modeling lessons learned. All applications must have been done in real contexts and at least one of the authors of the paper must be from the company or administration where the application took place. 
 href="#submission-process" - Submission process
Submissions must conform to the JOT LaTeX template (https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip) and must not exceed 14 pages (including figures, references, and appendices). Secondary studies may use 2 additional pages for references only. Failure to conform to these guidelines may result in disqualification of the paper. No simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed; any concurrent submission will be deemed as a serious breach of scientific ethics, resulting in the immediate rejection of the paper and appropriate action will be taken. 
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. 
 All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through Easychair (link to be published). 
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
 Foundations of MBE | , including model transformations, domain-specific languages, verification and validation approaches, etc. 
 Novel paradigms | , formalisms, applications, approaches, frameworks, or processes for model-based engineering such as low-code/no-code development, digital twins, etc. 
 Interplay between MBE with and for | AI-based systems. 
 Application of MBE methods | , tools, and techniques to specific domains, e.g., automotive, aerospace, cyber-physical systems, robotics, Artificial Intelligence or IoT. 
 Successful use of MBE | in connection with other disciplines and approaches, such as Artificial Intelligence, DevOps, Open Source, or Safety Assurance. 
 Educational aspects of MBE. 
 Tools | and | initiatives | for the successful | adoption of MBE in industry. 
 Review criteria and process 
 The program committee will assess all papers for novelty, significance, technical quality, rigour, and suitability for the conference. 
 Contributions can be submitted to any of the two submission periods. In both rounds, each submitted paper can be recommended by the Program Committee to be accepted-as-is, accepted with minor revisions, undergo major revisions, or rejected. 
 Papers accepted at any of the two rounds with major or minor revisions will be given a specified period of time to perform the revisions and re-submit. The same reviewers will assess how well the authors have addressed the revision requests and whether the final paper maintains or improves the level of contribution of the original submission. Revisions that significantly lessen the contribution of the work or fail to address the reviewers’ original concerns adequately will result in the paper’s rejection. Papers not accepted but with a sufficient level of quality may be encouraged to be re-submitted next year, or alternatively as regular JOT articles, hence continuing their review process through the normal journal channels. 
 Papers will be published in the JOT journal as soon as they are accepted and one of their authors registers at the conference. 
 Artifacts 
 Artifacts are recommended but not required, for the initial submission. Depending on the papers, reviewers may take the existence of artifacts as a positive signal about the work. Also, depending on the papers, artifacts may be required as a condition for publication. 
 Publication 
 All accepted papers will be published as platinum open-access journal publications in JOT. At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.

 Website: https://conf.researchr.org/home/staf-2025/ecmfa-2025 
 Easychair: https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=staf2025 

We are soliciting papers presenting original research on all aspects of model-based engineering. 
  
 Two types of submissions are possible: 
  
 - Foundation Papers dealing with modelling foundations, such as metamodelling, model transformations, model validation, verification and testing, model engineering methods and tools, and related aspects. 
 - Application Papers dealing with the application of modelling techniques, including experience reports on the use of MBE methods and tools, industrial case studies, or successful applications of MBE practices in the industry or in public administration, with significant modelling lessons learned. All applications must have been done in real contexts and at least one of the paper's authors must be from the company or administration where the application took place. 
  
 ### 
 # Submission process 
 ### 
  
 Submissions must conform to the JOT LaTeX template (https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip) and must not exceed 14 pages (including figures, references, and appendices). Failure to conform to these guidelines may result in disqualification of the paper. No simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed; any concurrent submission will be deemed as a serious breach of scientific ethics, resulting in the immediate rejection of the paper and appropriate action will be taken. 
  
 All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. 
  
 All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through Easychair: 
 --)) https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=staf2025 ((-- 
  
 Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 
  
 - Foundations of MBE, including model transformations, domain-specific languages, verification and validation approaches, etc. 
 Novel paradigms, formalisms, applications, approaches, frameworks, or processes for model-based engineering such as low-code/no-code development, digital twins, etc. 
 - Interplay between MBE with and for AI-based systems. 
 - Application of MBE methods, tools, and techniques to specific domains, e.g., automotive, aerospace, cyber-physical systems, robotics, Artificial Intelligence or IoT. 
 - Successful use of MBE in connection with other disciplines and approaches, such as Artificial Intelligence, DevOps, Open Source, or Safety Assurance. 
 - Educational aspects of MBE. 
 - Tools and initiatives for the successful adoption of MBE in industry.

 ### 
 # Review criteria and process 
 ### 
  
 The program committee will assess all papers for novelty, significance, technical quality, rigour, and suitability for the conference. 
  
 Contributions can be submitted to any of the two submission periods. In both rounds, each submitted paper can be recommended by the Program Committee to be accepted-as-is, accepted with minor revisions, undergo major revisions, or rejected. 
  
 Papers accepted at any of the two rounds with major or minor revisions will be given a specified period of time to perform the revisions and re-submit. The same reviewers will assess how well the authors have addressed the revision requests and whether the final paper maintains or improves the level of contribution of the original submission. Revisions that significantly lessen the contribution of the work or fail to address the reviewers’ original concerns adequately will result in the paper’s rejection. Papers not accepted but with a sufficient level of quality may be encouraged to be re-submitted next year, or alternatively as regular JOT articles, hence continuing their review process through the normal journal channels. 
  
 Papers will be published in the JOT journal as soon as they are accepted and one of their authors registers at the conference. 
  
 ### 
 # Artifacts 
 ### 
  
 Artifacts are recommended but not required, for the initial submission. Depending on the papers, reviewers may take the existence of artifacts as a positive signal about the work. Also, depending on the papers, artifacts may be required as a condition for publication. 
  
 ### 
 # Publication 
 ### 
  
 All accepted papers will be published as platinum open-access journal publications in JOT. At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.

 href="#Call-for-Papers" - Call for Papers 
 The 21st European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) will be held in Koblenz, Germany, (June 10-11, 2025) as part of STAF 2025 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations). 
 Aims and scope 
 The European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) is the premier European forum dedicated to advancing the state of knowledge and fostering the application of all aspects of MBE and related approaches. 
 Its focus is on engaging the key figures of research and industry in a dialog that will result in stronger and more effective practical application of MBE, hence producing more reliable software based on state-of-the-art research results. 
 In the technical track, we invite high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results related to MBE. 
 href="#submissions-for-round-2" - Submissions for Round #2
The EasyChair instance reopened on January 17 and now accepts new submissions for round #2

 Review criteria and process 
 The program committee will assess all papers for novelty, significance, technical quality, rigour, and suitability for the conference. 
 Contributions can be submitted to any of the two submission periods. In both rounds, each submitted paper can be recommended by the Program Committee to be accepted-as-is, accepted with minor revisions, undergo major revisions, or rejected. 
 Papers accepted at any of the two rounds with major or minor revisions will be given a specified period of time to perform the revisions and re-submit. The same reviewers will assess how well the authors have addressed the revision requests and whether the final paper maintains or improves the level of contribution of the original submission.

 Publication 
 All accepted papers will be published as platinum open-access journal publications in JOT. At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.
