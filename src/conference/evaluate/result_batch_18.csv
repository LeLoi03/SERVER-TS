The 29th World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics (WMSCI 2025) will be held in **Orlando, Florida, USA, from September 9 - 12, 2025**.

WMSCI 2025 is an international forum for scientists and engineers, researchers and consultants, theoreticians and practitioners in the fields of Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics, and will feature disciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary discussions.

## Purpose

The purpose of WMSCI 2025 is to promote discussions and interactions between researchers and practitioners focused on disciplinary, interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary issues, ideas, concepts, theories, methodologies and applications. We are particularly interested in fostering the exchange of concepts, prototypes, research ideas, and other results which could contribute to the academic arena and also benefit business, and the industrial community.

## Ways of Participation

The conference accepts submissions for both face-to-face and virtual participation. Both kinds of submissions will have the same reviewing process and the accepted papers will be included in the same proceedings.

### Submission Options

There are three submission options for face-to-face participation, and three corresponding options for virtual participation:

*   **FA:** A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for face-to-face participation.
*   **FB:** An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for face-to-face participation.
*   **FC:** An Abstract written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication (300-600 words), for face-to-face participation.
*   **VA:** A Draft Paper (2000-5000 words), for virtual participation.
*   **VB:** An Extended Abstract (600-2000 words), for virtual participation.

#### Submission Details:

**FA & VA: Full Draft papers (2000-5000 words):** Authors should suggest at least two scholars (and up to three), researchers and/or professionals for the open, non-blind review of his/her paper. Each paper will also be sent to at least 3 reviewers for its double-blind review as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviews: Non-blind and double-blind ones.

**FB & VB: Extended abstracts (600-2000 words, not a full paper):** Authors submitting Extended Abstracts should suggest at least one scholar (and up to 3), researcher, or professional for the open, non-blind review of his/her abstract. Each extended abstract will also be sent to at least three reviewers for its double-blind reviewing as well. The submission should contain a scholar [or a professional] exposition of ideas, techniques, and results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work.

**FC: Abstracts, written for Inter-Disciplinary Communication (300-600 words):** Authors submitting Abstracts may suggest up to 3 scholars, researchers, or professionals for open, non-blind reviewing of their respective abstract. Each abstract will also be sent to at least three reviewers for its double-blind reviewing as well. Acceptance decisions will be based on both kinds of reviewing: non-blind and double-blind.

## Reviewing Process

All Submitted papers/abstracts will go through three reviewing processes: (1) double-blind (at least three reviewers), (2) non-blind, and (3) participative peer reviews. Final acceptance depends of the three kinds of reviews but a paper should be recommended by non-blind reviewers AND blind reviewers in order to be accepted for presentation at the conference and to be included in the respective conference proceedings.

Authors of accepted papers who registered in the conference can have access to the evaluations and possible feedback provided by the reviewers who recommended the acceptance of their papers/abstracts, so they can accordingly improve the final version of their papers. Non-registered authors will not have access to the reviews of their respective submissions.

*   **Final Manuscript Due:** 15 September 2025

## Publication

Accepted papers will be presented at WISE 2025 and included in the conference proceedings, which is published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Authors elected best papers from the conference will be invited to submit an expanded version for publication in World Wide Web Journal, Springer, or Data Science and Engineering, Springer.

## Policies

*   **Dual Submission:** It is not appropriate to submit papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Such submissions violate our dual submission policy, and the organizers have the right to reject such submissions, or to remove them from the proceedings.
*   **Changes of Title / Abstract / Authorship:** Authors should include a full title for their paper, as well as a complete abstract by the abstract submission deadline. Submission titles should not be modified after the abstract submission deadline, and abstracts should not be modified by more than 50% after the abstract submission deadline. Submissions violating these rules may be deleted after the paper submission deadline without reviewing. The author list at the submission deadline will be considered final, and no changes in authorship will be permitted for accepted papers.
*   **Double-Blind Review:** All submitted papers must be anonymous. WISE 2025 is following the double-blind peer review principle. That is, the authors do not know who reviews their paper and the PC members do not know who the authors of a given paper. Thus, the submitted document should not include the author information and should not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent.
*   **Reviewing Criteria:** Accepted papers must contain significant novel results. Results can be either theoretical or empirical. Results will be judged on the degree to which they have been objectively established and/or their potential for scientific and technological impact. Reproducibility of results and easy availability of code will be taken into account in the decision-making process."

Papers may also present a vision on a given topic that addresses long-term challenges and opportunities that are thoroughly justified or related to prior literature.

We welcome submissions addressing topics across the full spectrum of Agile software development, broadly on Agile, and on issues of concern to researchers or practitioners (or both).

*   **Submit here:** [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=xp2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=xp2025)

## Formatting

All submissions must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS/LNBIP conference proceedings template (for LaTeX and Word), available [here](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

## Review Criteria

The XP 2025 main conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP) as Open Access.

Submissions will be screened on rigor and relevance and then evaluated by at least three program committee members based on soundness, significance, novelty, verifiability, and presentation quality.

XP 2025 adopts a Single-Blind Review process: authors are aware of the reviewers’ identities, while reviewers know the authors. This means that you don’t need to anonymize the authors and affiliations in the paper.
