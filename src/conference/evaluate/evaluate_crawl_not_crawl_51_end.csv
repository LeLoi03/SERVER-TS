**Dates:** March 1 – March 5, 2025

**Submission URL:** [https://ppopp25.hotcrp.com](https://ppopp25.hotcrp.com)

PPoPP is the premier forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including theoretical foundations, techniques, languages, compilers, runtime systems, tools, and practical experience. In the context of the symposium, ""parallel programming"" encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multi-threaded, heterogeneous, clustered, and distributed systems, grids, accelerators such as ASICs, GPUs, FPGAs, data centers, clouds, large scale machines, and quantum computers). PPoPP is interested in all aspects related to improving the productivity of parallel programming on modern architectures. PPoPP is also interested in work that addresses new parallel workloads and issues that arise out of large-scale scientific or enterprise workloads.

## Scope

Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

*   Languages, compilers, and runtime systems for parallel programs
*   Concurrent data structures
*   Development, analysis, or management tools
*   Fault tolerance for parallel systems
*   Formal analysis and verification
*   High-performance libraries
*   Middleware for parallel systems
*   Machine learning for parallel systems
*   Parallel algorithms
*   Parallel applications including scientific computing (e.g., simulation and modeling) and enterprise workloads (e.g., web, search, analytics, cloud, and machine learning)
*   Parallel frameworks
*   Parallel programming for deep memory hierarchies including nonvolatile memory
*   Parallel programming theory and models
*   Performance analysis, debugging and optimization
*   Productivity tools for parallel systems
*   Software engineering for parallel programs
*   Synchronization and concurrency control

Papers should report on original research relevant to parallel programming and should contain enough background materials to make them accessible to the entire parallel programming research community. Papers describing experience should indicate how they illustrate general principles or lead to new insights; papers about parallel programming foundations should indicate how they relate to practice. PPoPP submissions will be evaluated based on their technical merit and accessibility. Submissions should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, compare to the existing body of work on the topic, and explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions and results towards addressing the problem. Submissions should strive to be accessible both to a broad audience and to experts in the area.

## Paper Submission

Conference submission site: [https://ppopp25.hotcrp.com](https://ppopp25.hotcrp.com)

All submissions must be made electronically through the conference website and include an abstract (100–400 words), author contact information, the full list of authors and their affiliations. Full paper submissions must be in PDF format printable on both A4 and US letter-size paper.

All papers must be prepared in ACM Conference Format using the 2-column acmart format: use the SIGPLAN proceedings template `acmart-sigplanproc-template.tex` for Latex, and `interim-layout.docx` for Word. You may also want to consult the official ACM information on the Master Article Template and related tools. Important note: The Word template (`interim-layout.docx`) on the ACM website uses 9pt font; you need to increase it to 10pt.

Papers should contain a maximum of 10 pages of text (in a typeface no smaller than 10pt) or figures, NOT INCLUDING references. There is no page limit for references, and they must include the name of all authors (not {et al.}). Appendices are not allowed, but the authors may submit supplementary material, such as proofs or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.

Submission is double-blind and authors will need to identify any potential conflicts of interest with PC and Extended Review Committee members, as defined here: [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/) (ACM SIGPLAN policy).

PPoPP 2025 will employ a double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this process, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email.

To facilitate fair and unbiased reviews for all submissions, PPoPP 2025 may utilize the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) to assign papers to reviewers. From the authors’ perspective, this decision means that the submissions may be uploaded to the TPMS.

Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. Papers that exceed the length requirement, which deviate from the expected format, or that are submitted late will be rejected.

All submissions that are not accepted for regular presentations will be automatically considered for posters. Two-page summaries of accepted posters will be included in the conference proceedings.

To allow reproducibility, we encourage authors of accepted papers to submit their papers for Artifact Evaluation (AE). The AE process begins after the acceptance notification and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact evaluation is voluntary and will not affect paper acceptance but will be taken into consideration when selecting papers for awards. Papers that go through the AE process successfully will receive at least one ACM reproducibility badge, printed on the papers themselves. More information will be posted on the AE website.

Deadlines expire at midnight anywhere on earth.

## Publication Date

The titles of all accepted papers are typically announced shortly after the author notification date (late November 2024). Note, however, that this is not the official publication date. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. ACM will make the proceedings available via the Digital Library, up to 2 weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

The 46th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium will be held in Boston, MA, USA, from **December 2–5, 2025**.

## Scope of the Conference

The IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the field of real-time systems, showcasing innovations covering all aspects of real-time systems, including theory, design, analysis, implementation, verification, evaluation, and experience.

RTSS is an expansive and inclusive event, with RTSS’25 continuing the tradition of embracing new and emerging areas of real-time systems research.

## Tracks

RTSS’25 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems theory and practice. Manuscripts may be submitted to either:

*   **Track 1:** Real-Time Systems and Foundations
*   **Track 2:** Design and Applications (which covers Cyber-Physical Systems, HW-SW integration and system-level design, and Internet of Things (IoT))

## Timing Requirements

To be in scope, ALL submissions must explicitly address some form of real-time requirements / constraints.

Common examples of real-time requirements include (but are not limited to) deadlines, response-time bounds, thresholds on acceptable tail latencies as commonly found in service level agreements (SLAs), as well as statistical and stochastic notions of timeliness.

Other forms of real-time requirements may be considered in scope if the submission provides a compelling justification that the problem requires some nontrivial resource allocation, programming, scheduling, or design approach to satisfy timing-predictability requirements.

## Surveys and User Studies

Empirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field is also welcome. This type of research uses surveys, questionnaires, interviews, use-cases, or other empirical techniques to obtain information about the past / current / future state of play in the research, design, development, verification, validation, and deployment of real-time systems.

(Note that literature surveys that solely classify, review, and summarize existing research papers are not considered empirical research and are not in scope of the conference.)

## Proceedings and Awards

All accepted papers will appear in the main program and proceedings (provided they are presented at the conference).

A selection of papers will receive recognition as outstanding papers and will be highlighted as such in the proceedings. Best paper and best student paper awards will be presented at the conference, along with an award for the best presentation. (Note that submissions are eligible for the best student paper award provided that the first author is a student as of the submission deadline.)

## Track 1: Real-Time Systems and Foundations

Track 1 focuses on the practical and theoretical foundations that enable predictable timing in computing systems.

This includes core real-time operating systems components (e.g., kernels, hypervisors, middleware, and runtime environments), schedulability analysis and scheduling algorithms, theoretical foundations of real-time systems, and verification methods. Topics of interest also cover timing analysis—such as worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis and measurement-based timing analysis (MBTA)—along with research on real-time and time-sensitive networking. Contributions are encouraged in areas such as timing-predictable hardware architectures addressing general principles (domain- and application-specific solutions are better suited for Track 2); modeling and analysis of stochastic real-time systems; and rigorous statistical and empirical approaches to timing predictability. The track also welcomes research on fault tolerance and security in relation to timing guarantees, including real-time systems under adversarial conditions (e.g., timing-based side-channel attacks) and secure communication in time-sensitive networks. Submissions exploring cross-layer timing predictability across hardware, operating systems, and applications are particularly encouraged, as are those on compiler techniques, system synthesis, model-driven engineering, and applied formal methods—including model checking and proof-based verification. Experimental system designs, case studies, and experience reports that provide practical insights into fundamental time-predictable system principles are also welcome.

### Artificial Intelligence for Real-Time Systems Foundations

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and real-time systems are increasingly intertwined, creating opportunities and challenges at their intersection. RTSS invites contributions on AI for real-time systems, including the use of machine learning and other AI techniques to advance real-time scheduling, timing analysis, resource management, and system optimization under timing constraints.

Please note that Track 1 focuses on the use of AI technologies to solve problems in practical and theoretical foundations that enable predictable timing in computing systems—AI for real-time systems. The converse, the design of real-time systems for AI, is covered by Track 2.

## Track 2: Design and Applications

Track 2 focuses on real-time systems in a broader systems context, particularly emphasizing novel research on designs, implementations, and applications where real-time requirements are an integral part of a larger system or objective. While Track 1 covers theoretical and practical foundations as well as infrastructure technologies, Track 2 explores how these tools and techniques are adapted, extended, and applied to meet the requirements of specific application domains. Areas of interest include (but are not limited to) the following.

### Cyber-Physical Systems

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) span a wide range of domains, including safety-critical, autonomous, and robotic systems. These applications—such as those in transportation, healthcare, and industrial control—interact closely with the physical world, and thus inherently involve real-time requirements. RTSS welcomes papers that explore enabling technologies and application-specific solutions that push the boundaries of CPS design, analysis, and implementation. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) theoretical foundations of CPS, design methodologies, simulation and emulation techniques, tool chains, CPS architectures, secure CPS and CPS for security, performance analysis and robustness, safety and certification, and hardware/software co-design—all with a focus on implementing real-time principles in practical CPS applications.

### Real-Time System Design for Artificial Intelligence

This area explores the practical implementation and integration of AI components—such as perception, planning, and decision-making—in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. While Track 1 focuses on how AI can enhance real-time theory foundations, Track 2 welcomes how to design real-time systems to successfully deploy AI under real-time constraints. Topics of interest span (but are not limited to) system design, frameworks, resource management, hardware acceleration, and case studies demonstrating real-time AI in practical safety-critical applications. In addition, there is much interest in work on AI safety in CPS, including verification and validation of learning-enabled components, runtime monitoring, safe exploration, explainability, and robustness under uncertainty.

### HW-SW Integration and System-Level Design

This area focuses on design methodologies and tools for hardware/software integration and co-design in modern embedded systems targeting specific real-time applications. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: architecture description languages and associated tools, hardware architectures, design space exploration, synthesis, and optimization techniques. Particular emphasis is placed on System-on-Chip (SoC) design for real-time workloads, including the use of special-purpose functional units, custom memory hierarchies, multi-core architectures, and communication infrastructure. Contributions addressing FPGA-based simulation and prototyping, software simulation and compilation for emerging architectures, as well as analysis of power, thermal behavior, timing, and predictability, are especially welcome. Emerging trends such as RISC-V–based platforms, AI/ML hardware accelerators, and chiplet-based design approaches are also of strong interest.

### Internet of Things (IoT)

The IoT domain presents unique challenges, including extreme resource constraints (in terms of energy, storage, and computation), unprecedented scalability demands, and highly dynamic and uncertain operating environments. RTSS welcomes submissions that address these challenges through solid theoretical foundations, innovative system designs, and rigorous empirical or experimental evaluations. Of particular interest are approaches that enable real-time capabilities in IoT applications, including distributed sensing and control, reliable communication, and low-latency processing in resource-constrained environments. Contributions that explore the role of edge computing, fog computing, and AI-at-the-edge—as means to bring intelligence and responsiveness closer to the data source—are especially encouraged. Application domains of interest include smart cities, industrial IoT, smart healthcare, and other mission-critical deployments operating under real-time constraints. Emerging areas such as 5G/6G for real-time and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and in-network computing and offloading under timing constraints are of strong interest.",thiếu Author Response Period
