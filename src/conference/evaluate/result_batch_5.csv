EACL 2024 was held in Malta on March 17th-22nd, 2024, with online attendance possible.

## Submission

Papers must be submitted via ARR at this link:

[https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2023/October](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2023/October)

If you have already submitted to one of the earlier ARR deadlines, those submissions are also eligible.

For paper commitment, we accept commitments from papers submitted and reviewed via ARR in the October 2023 cycle or earlier. If you opt to commit the papers to EACL 2024, please submit via the [link](https://openreview.net/group?id=eacl.org/EACL/2024/Conference).

## Important Dates

For paper submission EACL 2024 used the [ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp). ARR works on a two-monthly review cycle, beginning on the 15th of every other month. 

The “paper submission deadline” shown below is the latest date that new papers can be submitted to ARR and be reviewed in time to be considered by EACL 2024; however, papers submitted in previous ARR rounds could also be considered. The “paper commitment deadline” is the date by which authors must choose, based on the reviews so far, whether to “commit” their ARR papers to be considered by EACL 2024.

*   Anonymity period begins	**Friday	15 September 2023**
*   Paper submission deadline (via ARR)	**Sunday	15 October 2023**

## Presentation Mode

Long and short papers were presented orally or as posters.

## Presentation Requirements

All accepted papers had to be presented at the conference—either online or in-person—in order to appear in the proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper had to register for EACL 2024 by the early registration deadline.

## Paper Submission and Anonymity

Submitted papers had to be prepared for two-way anonymized review.

## Policies on Authorship, Citation and Ethics

EACL 2024 followed the ARR policies on authorship, citation and comparison and ethics - please see the [ARR CfP](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp).

## Multiple Submission Policy

EACL 2024 followed the ARR policy on multiple submission: we did not consider any paper that was under review in a journal or another conference at the time of submission, and submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere during the review period. See the [ARR CfP](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) for more detail.

## Mandatory Discussion of Limitations

All papers had to have a clear discussion of limitations, in a dedicated section titled “Limitations”. This section appeared at the end of the paper, after the discussion/conclusions section and before the references, and did not count towards the page limit. Papers without a limitations section were automatically rejected without review.

The 21st European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (ECMFA) will be held in **Koblenz, Germany**, as part of STAF 2025, from **June 10-11, 2025**.

ECMFA is the premier European forum dedicated to advancing the state of knowledge and fostering the application of all aspects of MBE and related approaches.

## Submission Types

We are soliciting papers presenting original research on all aspects of model-based engineering. Two types of submissions are possible:

*   **Foundation Papers:** Dealing with modeling foundations, such as metamodeling, model transformations, model validation, verification and testing, model engineering methods and tools, and related aspects.
*   **Application Papers:** Dealing with the application of modeling techniques, including experience reports on the use of MBE methods and tools, industrial case studies, or successful applications of MBE practices in industry or in public administration, with significant modeling lessons learned. All applications must have been done in real contexts and at least one of the authors of the paper must be from the company or administration where the application took place.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Submissions must conform to the JOT LaTeX template ([https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip](https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip)) and must not exceed 14 pages (including figures, references, and appendices). Secondary studies may use 2 additional pages for references only.
*   No simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed.
*   All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.
*   All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through Easychair (link to be published).

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   Foundations of MBE, including model transformations, domain-specific languages, verification and validation approaches, etc.
*   Novel paradigms, formalisms, applications, approaches, frameworks, or processes for model-based engineering such as low-code/no-code development, digital twins, etc.
*   Interplay between MBE with and for AI-based systems.
*   Application of MBE methods, tools, and techniques to specific domains, e.g., automotive, aerospace, cyber-physical systems, robotics, Artificial Intelligence or IoT.
*   Successful use of MBE in connection with other disciplines and approaches, such as Artificial Intelligence, DevOps, Open Source, or Safety Assurance.
*   Educational aspects of MBE.
*   Tools and initiatives for the successful adoption of MBE in industry.

## Review Criteria and Process

The program committee will assess all papers for novelty, significance, technical quality, rigour, and suitability for the conference.

Contributions can be submitted to any of the two submission periods. In both rounds, each submitted paper can be recommended by the Program Committee to be accepted-as-is, accepted with minor revisions, undergo major revisions, or rejected.

Papers accepted at any of the two rounds with major or minor revisions will be given a specified period of time to perform the revisions and re-submit. The same reviewers will assess how well the authors have addressed the revision requests and whether the final paper maintains or improves the level of contribution of the original submission. Revisions that significantly lessen the contribution of the work or fail to address the reviewers’ original concerns adequately will result in the paper’s rejection.

Papers will be published in the JOT journal as soon as they are accepted and one of their authors registers at the conference.

## Artifacts

Artifacts are recommended but not required, for the initial submission. Depending on the papers, reviewers may take the existence of artifacts as a positive signal about the work. Also, depending on the papers, artifacts may be required as a condition for publication.

## Publication

All accepted papers will be published as platinum open-access journal publications in JOT. At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper being withdrawn from the proceedings.

It has tracks for technical papers and workshops.","# ECOOP 2026: Call for Papers

ECOOP is a conference about programming originally focused on object orientation but now includes all practical and theoretical investigations of programming languages, systems, and environments. ECOOP solicits innovative solutions to real problems as well as evaluations of existing solutions.

Authors are asked to pick one of the following categories:

*   **Research:** The most traditional category for papers that advance the state of the art.
*   **Replication:** An empirical evaluation that reconstructs a published experiment in a different context to validate the results of that earlier work.
*   **Experience:** Applications of known PL techniques in practice as well as tools. Industry papers will be reviewed by practitioners. We welcome negative results that may provide inspiration for future research.
*   **Pearls/Brave New Ideas:** Articles that either explain a known idea in an elegant way or unconventional papers introducing ideas that may take some time to substantiate. These papers may be short.

## Submission Guidelines

Submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and the ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Particularly, submissions must not have been published, or have major overlap with previous work. Authors should bring simultaneously submitted related papers to the attention of all relevant program chairs.

Proceedings are published in open access by Dagstuhl LIPIcs in the [Dagstuhl LIPIcs LaTeX-style template](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author).

ECOOP uses double-anonymous reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Papers must omit author names and institutions, and use the third person when referencing the authors’ own work. See the Double-Anonymous FAQ.

There is no page limit on submissions, but authors must understand that reviewers have a fixed time budget for each paper, so the length of the feedback is likely to be unaffected by length. The camera-ready version must be (at most) 25 pages in LIPIcs format (not including references).

Authors will be given a four-day period to read and respond to the reviews of their papers before the program committee meeting.

ECOOP will continue to have two deadlines for submissions. Papers submitted in each round can be (a) accepted, (b) rejected, or (c) asked for revisions. Rejected papers that are submitted to the immediate next round can be desk-rejected if they do not sufficiently differ from the previous submission. Revisions can be submitted at any later round. Papers retain their reviewers during revision.

To support replication of experiments, authors of accepted research papers may submit artifacts to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. Artifacts will be submitted after paper acceptance. AEC members will serve on the extended review committee.

## Journal First and Journal After

ECOOP has Journal First/After arrangements with ACM’s Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS), Elsevier’s Science of Computer Programming (SCP) and AITO’s Journal of Object Technology (JOT).

Only new research papers are eligible to be Journal First (JF). JF papers will have an extended abstract in the ECOOP proceedings. The deadline is the same as Round 1 of submissions and the notification is aligned with Round 2 notification. [TOPLAS JF papers should be submitted according to this announcement](https://2026.ecoop.org). [SCP JF papers should follow this call for papers](https://2026.ecoop.org). JF papers are presented at the conference and eligible for awards.

Journal After (JA) papers are papers for which the authors request to be considered for post conference journal publication. Once accepted by the ECOOP PC, these papers will be forwarded to the journal editors. JA papers will have an extended abstract (up to 12 pages) in the conference proceedings.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are AoE (UTC-12h).

*   **Round 1 Submissions:** Thu 27 Nov 2025
*   **Round 1 Author response deadline:** Mon 12 - Fri 16 Jan 2026
*   **Round 1 Notification:** Thu 29 Jan 2026

## Double-Anonymous FAQ

#### Authors: Double-Blinding Submissions

**Q: What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?**

Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity undiscoverable but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without having to know who you are. Omit authors’ names from your title page, and when you cite your own work, refer to it in the third person.

**Q: Should I change the name of my system?**

No.

**Q: My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?**

Cite the code in your paper, but remove the URL and, instead say “link to repository removed for double blind review”.

**Q: I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper, should I anonymize reference to that work?**

No. But we recommend that you change the title to distinguish the papers.

**Q: Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv? send it to colleagues? give a talk about it? on social media?**

Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that is likely to reach your reviewers.

Things you may do:

*   Put your submission on your home page.
*   Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees.
*   Present your work at professional meetings, workshops, job interviews, etc.
*   Post on arXiv or a similar site.

#### Reviewers: Double-blind

**Q: What should I do if I if I learn the authors’ identity?**

If at any point you feel that the authors’ actions are largely aimed at ensuring that potential reviewers know their identity, you should contact the Program Chair. Otherwise you should not treat double-blind reviewing differently from regular blind reviewing.

**Q: The authors provided a URL to supplemental material, what should I do?**

Contact the chairs, who will download the material on your behalf.

**Q: Can I seek an outside review?**

If you think an outside reviewer would provide a valuable perspective, contact the chairs.

## 37th Euromicro Conference on Real-Time Systems (ECRTS’25)

**July 8–11, 2025 | Brussels, Belgium | [ecrts.org](http://ecrts.org)**

**Submission deadline: February 28, 2025 (23:59 AoE)**

**Submission website:** [https://ecrts25.hotcrp.com/](https://ecrts25.hotcrp.com/)

ECRTS is the premier European venue in the area of real-time systems and, alongside RTSS and RTAS, ranks as one of the top three international conferences on this topic. ECRTS has a rich history, with the first edition held in 1989 and this year’s edition being the 37th run of this annual event. As in previous editions, ECRTS attracts researchers from both academia and industry whose work tackles foundational and practical challenges at the intersection of real-time scheduling, time-critical systems, real-time operating systems, hardware/software co-design, security in time-sensitive systems, real-time networking, AI and machine learning methods for real-time systems, and more.

ECRTS 2025 will be held as a physical conference on July 8-11, 2025 in Brussels, Belgium.

## Scope and topics of interest

Papers on all aspects of timing requirements in computer systems are welcome. Systems of interest include not only hard real-time systems but also time-sensitive systems in general (e.g., systems with soft requirements expressed in terms of tail latency, latency SLAs, QoS expectations, etc.). Typical applications are found not only in classical embedded and cyber-physical systems, but also increasingly in cloud or edge computing contexts and often stem from domains such as automotive, avionics, telecommunications, healthcare, robotics, and space systems, among others.

To be in scope, papers must address some form of timing requirement, broadly construed. Prospective first-time authors are encouraged to familiarize themselves with works accepted in past editions of the conference, which are publicly available at [drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS)

ECRTS welcomes theoretical and practical contributions (including tools, benchmarks, and case studies) to the state of the art in the design, implementation, verification, and validation of time-sensitive systems. We particularly encourage papers on industrial case studies (such as the examples at [ecrts.org/industrial-challenge](http://ecrts.org/industrial-challenge)) and the application of real-time technology to real systems. We welcome practical contributions even without novel theoretical insights or formal proofs, provided they are of interest to the research community and/or industry. Whenever relevant, we encourage authors to present experimental results (preferably based on real data, but synthetic test cases are acceptable when adequately motivated).

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   all elements of time-sensitive **SOFTWARE SYSTEMS**, including operating systems, hypervisors, middlewares and frameworks, programming languages and compilers, runtime environments, networks and communication protocols, etc.;
*   **COMPUTER HARDWARE** design and hardware/software integration for embedded systems, including time-predictable hardware architecture, GPU and accelerators, FPGA prototyping, SoC design, novel memory architectures, hardware/software co-design, etc.;
*   **REAL-TIME NETWORKS**: including wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks, Time-Sensitive Networks (TSN), industrial IoT, Software Defined Network (SDN), 5G, end-to-end latency analysis, etc.;
*   **REAL-TIME APPLICATIONS**, including modeling, design, simulation, testing, debugging, and evaluation in domains such as automotive, avionics, control systems, industrial automation, robotics, space, railways telecommunications, multimedia, etc.;
*   foundational **SCHEDULING** and **PREDICTABILITY** questions, including schedulability analysis, algorithm design, synchronization protocols, computational complexity, temporal isolation, probabilistic guarantees, multi-core scheduling, resource co-scheduling, etc.;
*   static and dynamic techniques for **RESOURCE DEMAND ESTIMATION**, including stochastic and classic worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis, analyses to bound memory and bandwidth needs, and methods for determining the energy, power, or thermal footprint of real-time applications, etc.;
*   **MACHINE LEARNING** techniques in safety-critical systems, including explainable AI, the application of machine learning to the design and optimization of real-time systems, methods for real-time AI computing, etc.;
*   **FORMAL METHODS** for the verification and validation of real-time systems, including model checking, computer-assisted proofs, and runtime monitoring systems, etc.;
*   **SECURITY** aspects of real-time systems, including techniques to strengthen security guarantees, concerns that affect the operation of safety-critical systems, privacy-enhancing techniques, methodologies to protect the temporal envelope of critical software against malicious threats, etc.;
*   the interplay of timing predictability and other **NON-FUNCTIONAL QUALITIES** such as reliability, quality of control, energy/power consumption, environmental impact, testability, scalability, etc.

The above list of topics is intended only as a coarse summary of recent proceedings and should not be understood as an exclusive list of interests. On the contrary, papers breaking new ground, departing from established subfields, or challenging the status quo are most welcome and highly encouraged.

## Open access

The ECRTS organizers and community strongly believe that a conference best serves the research community and the public when results are accessible to the largest audience without restrictions. In line with this belief, all accepted papers will be published again this year as open-access proceedings in collaboration with LIPIcs (Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics). Once published, the proceedings of ECRTS 2025 will be publicly accessible at [drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/conference/ECRTS) where the previous proceedings since 2017 are available.

## Paper submission

Submitted manuscripts are limited to **20 pages of technical content, excluding the bibliography.** Every accepted paper must be presented by one of the authors at the conference.

ECRTS papers follow the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics paper template. You can download the [LIPIcs template](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author) and see the typesetting instructions here.

To submit a paper to ECRTS, please carefully review and follow the [submission instructions and guidelines](https://www.ecrts.org/submission-instructions/).

## Double-blind peer reviewing

In the interest of maximizing fairness and the meritocratic nature of the evaluation process, ECRTS will follow a double-blind peer reviewing process. Authors will submit blinded manuscripts (that do not reveal author identity or affiliation), and reviewers will not be made aware of author identities.

See the [double-blind submission policy](https://www.ecrts.org/double-blind-submission/) for more details.

## Shadow peer review process

For the first time this year, ECRTS will offer the authors a Shadow Technical Program Committee (TPC) option. The Shadow TPC is designed to train future reviewers by providing them with hands-on experience in the paper review process. Authors who choose to participate (on an opt-in basis) will have their submissions reviewed by both the regular TPC and the Shadow TPC, although the reviews from the Shadow TPC will not impact the final decision on the paper.

Learn more about the [Shadow TPC evaluation process](https://www.ecrts.org/shadow-tpc-evaluation-process/).

## Artifact evaluation

To improve the results’ reproducibility and encourage reuse, authors of accepted papers with a computational component will be invited to submit their code and/or their data to an optional [artifact evaluation process](https://www.ecrts.org/artifact-evaluation/).

The 19th European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA 2025) will be held from **September 15 to 19, 2025** in **Limassol, Cyprus**.

ECSA 2025 is planned as an in-person conference.

## Scope

The theme for ECSA 2025 is “**impactful software architecture**”. The software architecture discipline has had a critical role in shaping robust, scalable, and maintainable systems. We are interested in learning about software architecture principles and practices, emergence trends and case studies highlighting strategic architectural choices that can lead to enhanced performance, improved collaboration, and long-term sustainability. The overarching question is how these architectural principles and practices, both well-established and emerging, are making an impact in real-world systems, and how that impact is being felt across various domains, from enterprise systems to more novel areas like, e.g., AI-driven or autonomous applications?

The Program Committee of 19th European Conference on Software Architecture seeks submissions of original and unpublished high-quality papers describing fundamental and applied research; new methods, approaches, and processes; novel applications; education and training in software architecture; and experience reports on all topics related to software architecture.

We particularly encourage papers that demonstrate that diversity in gender, culture, religion, country, etc. are key factors for success and innovation in software architecture.

All submitted papers will undergo a rigorous double-blind peer review process. Papers will be selected based on originality, quality, soundness, and relevance. All contributions must be original, not published, accepted, or submitted for publication elsewhere. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. Plagiarism checking will be conducted and any paper reporting more than a 20% match with published work will be desk-rejected.

The research track of ECSA 2025 supports an Open Science policy. We encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data/artifacts to increase reproducibility.

All contributions must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS style [http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0). Page limits include figures and references.

Contributions need to be submitted in PDF format via EasyChair to the ECSA 2025 Research Track: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecsa2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecsa2025)

The proceedings will be published by Springer as part of the LNCS series. Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their research to a special issue of the Journal of Systems and Software.

The Educational Data Mining (EDM) 2025 conference will be held in **Palermo, Italy from July 20-23, 2025.**

## Theme

**New Goals, New Measurements, New Incentives to Learn:**
In a world where AI can excel and outperform humans in many cognitive tasks, educational systems need to reconsider their goals from the ground up. As AI is expected to reshape the labor market, the social mechanisms that have shaped students’ incentives to learn may diminish or, at the very least, change. This presents an opportunity, and perhaps even a necessity, for communities like EDM to help learners of all ages find their own voices and take greater responsibility for their learning journey. Reshaping goals and priorities would also require developing new ways to measure learning gains and processes to include more complex constructs, like critical thinking, creativity, and ability to evaluate and incorporate new information. The educational data mining community, with its expertise in both AI and education, and its commitment to harnessing AI for the benefit of future generations, is in an ideal position to lead the way in this brave new world.

*   Simulations for virtual environments (physics-based animation, collision detection, acoustics)
*   Mesh processing, level-of-detail, and geometric methods
*   Visual computing (image- and video-based rendering, image processing and exploitation, segmentation)
*   Scheduling, memory management, and data coherence
*   Parallelization approaches and algorithms, such as MapReduce
*   Database-related methods, algorithms or approaches, and query-based visualization
*   Advanced hardware for data handling or visualization
*   Large and high-resolution displays, virtual environments
*   Scientific, engineering, and industrial applications
*   Data analytics on large scientific data sets

In general, appropriate topics for the symposium fall into one of four categories:

1.  parallel graphics,
2.  rendering of very large data sets,
3.  parallel visualization and analytics, and
4.  processing of large data sets for visualization or analytics.

## Submission Guidelines for Full Papers and Review Process

*   The proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS series, authors must submit manuscripts using the LNCS style (see style files and details).
*   Springer has provided a LaTeX template in Overleaf for your convenience.
*   The page limit for submitted papers (as well as for final, camera-ready papers) is 16 pages (excluding references).
*   ER 2025 follows a double-blind review process. Authors are therefore asked to remove all identifying information from the manuscript and use repository anonymization services like [https://anonymous.4open.science](https://anonymous.4open.science) to anonymize potential source code repositories and online supplementary material.
*   Manuscripts not submitted in the LNCS style or exceeding the page limit will be desk rejected.
*   Likewise, submissions that do not primarily focus on aspects of conceptual modeling shall be rejected without undergoing formal reviewing.
*   Papers submitted must not be under evaluation for or have already been published in, or accepted for publication, in a journal or another conference.

The 33rd European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning (ESANN) will be organized in hybrid mode, from **Wednesday 23 to Friday 25 April 2025**, both in-person and online participation will be possible.

Since its first edition in 1993, the European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks has become a key event for researchers focusing on the theoretical and fundamental aspects of artificial neural networks, computational intelligence, machine learning, and related domains.

## Scope and Topics

ESANN covers a broad spectrum of topics, including mathematical foundations, algorithms, tools, and diverse applications within artificial neural networks, machine learning, statistical information processing, and computational intelligence. Papers will be presented orally (single track) and in poster sessions; all posters will be complemented by a short oral presentation during a plenary session. The selection of papers will differentiate between oral and posters presentations according to the topics, and not to the level of quality.

The following is a non-exhaustive list of topics covered:

*   Neural networks
*   Deep learning
*   Kernel machines
*   Signal processing and modeling
*   Transfer learning
*   Graphical models, EM and Bayesian learning
*   Classification and clustering

## Special Sessions

Special sessions will be organized by renowned scientists in their respective fields. Submissions to regular and special sessions follow identical format, instructions, deadlines and procedures.

See the [special sessions](https://www.esann.org/special-sessions) page for details about the special sessions organized during ESANN 2025.

## Talks and Posters

Accepted papers are presented either as talks or posters. Authors may indicate their preference at submission; however as ESANN is a single-track conference, the number of slots for talks is limited. All poster presentations are coupled to a one-minute spotlight oral presentation during a plenary session; poster presentations increase the interaction with participants.

There is no difference in scientific quality between talks and posters. The reviewing and selection processes are identical. In addition all full papers are published in the same way in the proceedings, regardless of the mode of presentation.

## Paper Submission And Evaluation

We welcome paper submissions at both submission rounds. Submissions of each round will be reviewed by the PC and external reviewers for their technical soundness and originality.

Round 1 submissions will receive one of three outcomes: Accept, Reject, Revise. In the latter case, the PC will provide a concrete list of revision requests to be completed by the Round 2 submission deadline. Such revised submissions will be reviewed by the same set of reviewers and will either be accepted or rejected. Rejected Round 1 submissions may NOT be resubmitted to Round 2.

Papers submitted directly to Round 2 will either be accepted or rejected.

## Artifact Evaluation

ESOP 2026 will have a post-paper-acceptance voluntary artifact evaluation. Authors will be encouraged to submit artifacts for evaluation after paper notification. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.

Detailed information will be announced later.

## Journal-First Submissions

We welcome research papers submitted via a Journal-First channel at TOPLAS.

*   Authors submit their papers directly to TOPLAS before the Round 1 submission deadline, and in their cover letter indicate that they want their paper to be considered as an ESOP Journal-First paper.
*   Reviewing is handled exclusively by TOPLAS.
*   (Optionally, but highly recommended:) Authors notify the ESOP PC chair of their TOPLAS submission, so that the PC chair can follow up with the TOPLAS editor-in-chief about the status of these submissions.
*   If a TOPLAS Journal-First paper is accepted before the end of the Round 2 rebuttal period date, and the ESOP PC agrees, it may be presented at ETAPS.

## Journal-After Submissions

Revised and expanded versions of accepted ESOP research papers are eligible for the ESOP Journal-After TOPLAS channel. A call will open in January after the ESOP notification. More details will be provided at a later moment."

## Conflict of Interest (CoI)

The program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and PC members to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest. Authors will be asked during the submission process to indicate any PC members with whom they share CoIs as well as the types of CoIs. Authors also need to notify the PC Chairs of any other reason or circumstance that creates a risk that professional judgement may be unduly influenced. The chairs reserve the right to request further explanation and can remove non-mandatory conflicts at their discretion."
