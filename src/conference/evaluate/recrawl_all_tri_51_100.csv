MEMOCODE: ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Formal Methods and Models for System Design

Over the last decade, the boundaries between computer system components, such as hardware, software, firmware, middleware, and applications, have blurred. This evolution in system design and development practices led in 2014 to a change in the title and scope of the MEMOCODE conference from its original focus on hardware/software co-design to its new focus on formal methods and models for developing computer systems and their components. MEMOCODE’s objective is to emphasize the importance of models and methodologies in correct system design and development, and to bring together researchers and industry practitioners interested in all aspects of computer system development, to exchange ideas, research results and lessons learned.

ESWEEK 2025 will take place as an in-person event from **September 28th to October 3rd, 2025 in Taipei, Taiwan**. MEMOCODE is one of the symposia held as part of ESWEEK.

For the first time, ICFP will be co-located with SPLASH, forming the joint ICFP/SPLASH 2025 conference, offering a comprehensive forum for research and development in functional programming.","# ICFP 2025: Call for Papers

The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) 2025 invites submissions on the design, implementations, principles, and uses of functional programming. This year, ICFP is co-located with SPLASH as part of the joint **ICFP/SPLASH 2025 conference**, taking place in **Singapore** from **October 12 to October 18, 2025**.

PACMPL (ICFP) seeks original papers on the art and science of functional programming, covering the entire spectrum of work from practice to theory.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

*   **Language Design:** concurrency, parallelism, distribution, modularity, components, meta-programming, macros, pattern matching, type systems (type inference, dependent types, effect types, gradual types, refinement types, session types), interoperability, domain-specific languages, imperative programming, object-oriented programming, logic programming, probabilistic programming, reactive programming, generic programming, bidirectional programming.
*   **Implementation:** abstract machines, virtual machines, interpretation, compilation, optimization, garbage collection, runtime systems, multi-threading, parallel hardware exploitation, foreign function interfaces.
*   **Software-Development Techniques:** algorithms, data structures, design patterns, specification, verification, validation, proof assistants, debugging, testing, tracing, profiling, build systems, program synthesis.
*   **Foundations:** formal semantics, lambda calculus, program equivalence, rewriting, type theory, logic, category theory, computational effects, continuations, control, state, names, binding, program verification.
*   **Analysis and Transformation:** control flow, data flow, abstract interpretation, partial evaluation, program calculation.
*   **Applications:** symbolic computing, formal-methods tools, artificial intelligence, systems programming, distributed systems, web programming, hardware design, databases, scientific and numerical computing, graphical user interfaces, graphics, multimedia, GPU programming, scripting, system administration, security.
*   **Education:** teaching introductory programming, mathematical proof, algebra.

## Submission Types

In addition to research papers, ICFP 2025 also welcomes:

*   **Functional Pearls:** Elegant essays on functional programming, which may include new perspectives on old ideas, instructive examples, nifty data structures, interesting applications, or classroom uses. These are valued and judged rigorously, focusing on conciseness, instructiveness, and entertainment.
*   **Experience Reports:** Descriptions of practical experiences using functional programming in industry, tool development, or education. These papers need not report original research but should illuminate aspects of functional programming use, providing evidence for a clear thesis.

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Review Process:** ICFP 2025 will employ a **full double-blind reviewing process**. Authors must omit their names and institutions from submissions, and refer to their own work in the third person.
*   **Formatting:** Submissions must be in **PDF format**, printable in black and white on US Letter paper, and adhere to the **“ACM Small” template** (available in LaTeX and Word).
    *   Full papers and Functional Pearls: up to **25 pages** (bibliography and optional appendix excluded).
    *   Experience Reports: up to **12 pages** (bibliography excluded).
*   **Submission System:** Submissions are accepted via href=""https://icfp25.hotcrp.com/"" - https://icfp25.hotcrp.com/ .

The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming systems, languages, and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.

OOPSLA 2025 will have **two rounds of reviewing**. New papers may be submitted to either round. Papers accepted in either round will be published in the 2025 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to present at the SPLASH conference in 2025.

## What’s New

*   **Reserve Reviewer Policy**
*   **Data-Availability Statement**

## Contact

You can reach the two Review Committee Chairs (Shriram and Sukyoung) through this email: [oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com). Please allow 1–2 working days for a response, and longer right around deadlines. In your email, please mention the number of the paper you are writing about (if you have one) to facilitate tracking.

## Review Process

PACMPL(OOPSLA) employs two rounds of reviewing. Each paper will typically receive three or more reviews, and authors will have an opportunity to respond to these reviews before decisions are finalized.

At the end of each round, each paper will receive one of the five following decisions:

*   **Accept:** Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).
*   **Reject:** Your paper will not appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). A resubmission in less than a year from the original submission is not guaranteed a review if judged substantially similar.
*   **Conditional Accept:** Specific required revisions are needed.
*   **Minor Revision:** Several concerns need to be addressed, potentially requiring specific revisions and broader comments.
*   **Major Revision:** Significant concerns requiring substantial revisions and broader comments, potentially taking longer to execute.

If you receive a Conditional Accept, Minor Revision, or Major Revision decision:

*   There is no restriction on when you can submit your revision.
*   You must submit a clear explanation of how your revision addresses comments, and, if possible, a diff of the PDFs.
*   Submissions will be reviewed by the same reviewers to the extent possible.
*   Unless explicitly withdrawn, your paper is considered under review, and submitting it elsewhere would violate policy.
*   Maintain submission anonymity. If violation is necessary to respond to reviews, discuss with the Chairs first.
*   Conditionally Accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts for evaluation. Acceptance of artifacts has no impact on paper acceptance.
*   Only **Accepted** and **Conditionally Accepted** papers can submit artifacts for evaluation, as revisions often affect artifacts.

## Reserve Reviewer Policy

To uphold high review standards and manage review loads, for each paper, at least one **senior author** must register as a reserve reviewer on [TPMS](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/TPMS/), unless exempt.

**Instructions:** Log into TPMS with your HotCRP email. Upload or provide URLs for 5-10 of your previous papers to inform reviewer matching, prioritizing depth, breadth, and rare expertise.

**Definition of Senior Author:** Completed their PhD five or more years ago.

**Exemptions:** A paper is exempt if:

*   It has no senior authors.
*   At least one senior author is already in the RC for this conference.
*   Every senior author satisfies one or more of these criteria:
    *   Is new to SIGPLAN (never published in it before).
    *   Is chairing a SIGPLAN conference with 150+ submissions last year, this year, or next year.
    *   Has other exceptional circumstances preventing reviewing, cleared with RC Chairs at least three days before submission.

One person may serve as a reserve reviewer for multiple papers; enter their information identically for each.

## Submission Guidelines

### Template

Use SPLASH’s PACMPL templates and instructions available on the [SIGPLAN author information page](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/). Papers should begin with:

```
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review]{acmart}
```

### Page Limit

*   **Initial submissions** must be at most **23 pages** using the template. This limit excludes required statements, references, or supplementary material. Papers must be self-contained; reviewers are not obliged to read supplementary material.
*   **Revisions** (including papers from 2024, and final camera-ready papers) can go up to a maximum of **25 pages**. There will be no option to purchase additional pages.

### Anonymity

PACMPL uses **double-blind reviewing**, meaning authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Your papers must:

*   Omit author names and institutions.
*   Use the third person when referencing your own work (e.g., ""We extend Smith’s [2004] work on statically typed toads."" instead of ""We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004]"").
*   Anonymize supplementary material.
*   Suppress acknowledgments entirely until camera-ready.
*   Avoid linking to webpages in your anonymized paper.
*   Disguise or remove document properties (e.g., author name) from PDF files.

> Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.

> If your system is not new and likely known, refer to it as if created by a third party.

> If your submission is based on code in a public repository, cite the code but replace the URL with ""link removed for double-blind review"". For reviewer access during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.

> If submitting an extension of a workshop paper, anonymize references to that work and change the paper title to break a direct link.

### Novelty

Papers must describe unpublished work not currently submitted for publication elsewhere, as per [SIGPLAN’s Re-Publication Policy](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/). Submitters should also be aware of [ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-detection-policy) and comply with [ACM’s Policies for Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship).

### Data-Availability Statement

Add a section titled **""Data-Availability Statement""** just before references in the initial submission. This will not count towards the page limit but should be limited to at most a few paragraphs (usually one suffices).

In this statement, indicate whether an artifact exists, its nature and limitations, and whether it will be submitted for Artifact Evaluation. This section can include links to preliminary versions of (anonymized) artifacts, datasets, etc., that reviewers *may* find useful (but are not obligated to follow).

> It is understood that some papers have no artifacts; in such cases, explain why. The absence of such an explanation can be cause for rejection.

> Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact after promising one will be asked to explain the omission.

Artifact Evaluation submission will closely follow paper notification, so review the [Artifact Call](https://2025.splashcon.org/track/splash-2025-oopsla-artifacts) as soon as you submit your paper.

### Procedure

Submit your paper using [HotCRP](https://oopsla2425.hotcrp.com/).

## Publication

PAPMPL is a **Gold Open Access journal**, meaning all papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge (**USD 400**), but payment is not required.

The official publication date is when the journal is available in the ACM Digital Library. Round 1 accepted papers (OOPSLA1) will be published no earlier than **April 1, 2025**, and Round 2 accepted papers (OOPSLA2) no earlier than **October 1, 2025**. This date affects patent filings related to published work.

## ACM Policies

By submitting, you acknowledge that you and your co-authors are subject to all [ACM Publications Policies](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies), including ACM’s new [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects). Alleged violations may lead to paper retraction and other penalties.

Ensure you and your co-authors obtain an [ORCID iD](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs) to complete the publishing process, aiding author discoverability and attribution.

The [updated ACM Authorship Policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) addresses the use of generative AI, clarifies authorship criteria and responsibilities, and defines prohibited behaviors like gift, ghost, or purchased authorship.

## FAQ

### What are reviewers looking for?

Reviewers consider the following criteria:

*   **Novelty:** Presents new ideas and results, properly contextualized within existing research.
*   **Importance:** Contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field, including work that diverges from dominant trajectories.
*   **Evidence:** Provides sufficient support for claims (e.g., proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, user studies, case studies, anecdotes).
*   **Clarity:** Contributions, methodology, and results are presented clearly.

### How are papers from previous years handled?

For resubmissions from previous OOPSLA years, the same timeline applies. The organizers attempt to assign the same reviewers and strongly discourage reviewers from issuing another ""major revision"" decision.

### Are artifacts required?

No. It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. However, if the paper's content and claims suggest an artifact should exist, authors must explain why one will not be provided. Lack of such an explanation can lead to rejection.

### Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?

Yes. Artifacts may be rejected for reasons unrelated to research results (e.g., packaging issues).

### Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv, send it to colleagues, give a talk about it, mention it on social media, …?

The goal is to balance scientific communication with preventing potential reviewers from learning author identities. You may discuss work under submission, but avoid broadly advertising it through media likely to reach your reviewers. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs for guidance.

**Things you may do:**

*   Put your submission on your home page, arXiv, or other pre-publication sites.
*   Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict.
*   Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc.
*   Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on a pre-publication site, or previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing.

**Things you should not do:**

*   Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be.
*   Publicize your work on social media in an identifiable way with broad settings (e.g., describing the work or giving its title). A general post about paper submission is acceptable.

> Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves unless they feel you have deliberately advertised your authorship information to them.
