*   To include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and
*   To indicate why they do not intend to make their data or study materials publicly available upon acceptance, if that is the case.

## Data Availability Statement

While sharing research artifacts is not mandatory for submission or acceptance, authors are required to include a **Data Availability statement** after the Conclusions section in a section named ""Data Availability"". This statement should explain whether or not data and/or artifacts are available or how they could be accessed (or not).

All contributions must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS style [http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0). Page limits include figures and references.

## Junior PC

MSR 2026 will integrate the junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!

The primary audience for the Junior PC is early-career researchers (PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners) who are keen to get more involved in the academic peer-review process but have not yet served on a technical research track program committee at big international SE conferences (e.g., ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, MSR, ICSME, SANER).

All submissions to the MSR research track will be reviewed jointly by both regular and junior PC members, as part of the same process. We expect that each paper will receive three reviews from PC members. The final decisions will be made by consensus among all reviewers.

## Submission Process

All submissions must be in PDF format and conform to the official ACM Primary Article Template, which can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template page. LaTeX users should use the `sigconf` option, as well as the `review` (to produce line numbers) and `anonymous` (omitting author names) options.

Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the [submission site](https://msr2026.hotcrp.com).

All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:

*   All submissions must not exceed **10 pages for the main text**, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. **Two more pages containing only references are permitted.**
*   Submissions must strictly conform to the ACM conference proceedings formatting instructions.
*   Papers submitted to MSR 2026 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2026.
*   If the research involves human participants/subjects, the authors must adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.
*   Authors will be asked to fill out a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing the camera-ready version of their papers.

## Open Science Policy

The MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. We expect all contributing authors to disclose:

*   The source code of relevant software.
*   The data used in the paper.
*   Instructions for other researchers describing how to reproduce or replicate the results.

It covers topics from languages and compilers to virtual machines and tools.","# MPLR 2025: Call for Papers

The 22nd International Conference on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) will be held as part of ICFP/SPLASH 2025 in Singapore.

MPLR is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems in use, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (desktop, mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).

## Topics

The areas of interest include but are not limited to:

### Languages and Compilers

*   Managed languages (e.g., Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C#, F#, Clojure, Groovy, Kotlin, R, Smalltalk, Racket, Rust, Go, Lua, MATLAB, Raku, Pony, …)
*   Domain-specific languages
*   Language design
*   Compilers and interpreters
*   Type systems and program logics
*   Language interoperability
*   Parallelism, distribution, and concurrency

### Virtual Machines

*   Portable intermediate representations (e.g., JVM, WebAssembly, RPython, …)
*   Managed runtime systems (e.g., GraalVM, Android Runtime (ART), V8, JavaScriptCore, .NET, …)
*   VM design and optimization
*   VMs for mobile and embedded devices
*   VMs for real-time applications
*   Memory management and garbage collection
*   Hardware/software co-design
*   Persistence

### Techniques, Tools, and Applications

*   Static and dynamic program analysis
*   Testing and debugging
*   Refactoring
*   Program understanding
*   Program synthesis
*   Security and privacy
*   Performance analysis and monitoring
*   Compiler and program verification and model checking

If you are unsure whether a particular topic falls within the scope of MPLR ’25 or if you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact the Program Chair Tomoharu Ugawa at ugawa ci i u-tokyo ac jp.

## Submission Categories

MPLR accepts three types of submissions:

*   **Regular research papers:** describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms. Research papers will be evaluated based on their relevance, novelty, technical rigor, and contribution to the state-of-the-art. (Format: up to 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix)
*   **Work-in-progress research papers:** describing hot topics or promising new ideas, with perhaps less maturity than full papers. Work-in-progress papers will be evaluated with an emphasis on novelty and the potential of the new ideas instead of technical rigor and experimental results. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix)
*   **Industry and tool papers:** presenting technical challenges and solutions for managed language platforms in the context of deployed applications and systems. Industry and tool papers will be evaluated on their relevance, usefulness, and results. Suitability for demonstration and availability will also be considered for tool papers. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix; up to 12 pages allowed if justified by the content)

Accepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library, except if the authors prefer not to be included.

MPLR 2025 submissions must conform to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions and to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy. See [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication)

MPLR 2025 will not hold its own poster session. Please consider submitting to the SPLASH poster track.

## Author Instructions

Submissions need to use the ACM SIGPLAN format with the sigplan style.

If you are using LaTeX, submissions need to use the acmart document class with the sigplan option (not the sigconf option). In the acmart-primary.zip file that downloads from the LaTeX (Version 1.90) link on the [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) page, look for `samples/sample-sigplan.tex` as a guide. If you use Overleaf, be sure to change the documentclass option `manuscript` to `sigplan`. For ease of reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission using the LaTeX command `\settopmatter{printfolios=true}`. Please use the standard setting, e.g., the default font size for the SIGPLAN style is 10 point and the format uses two columns for the test.

All submissions need to be in PDF format. MPLR now uses double-blind reviewing. Authors should not show their names on a submission and should refer to their own work in third person. We further recommend that they avoid publicizing the work, at least under the same or similar title, while it is under review.

Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.

**Submission Site:** [https://mplr25.hotcrp.com](https://mplr25.hotcrp.com)

*   **Paper Author Notification:** July 28, 2025
*   **Camera Ready for Papers:** August 25, 2025
*   **Conference Date:** October 14, 2025

All deadlines are 23:59 AoE (UTC-12h).

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.
