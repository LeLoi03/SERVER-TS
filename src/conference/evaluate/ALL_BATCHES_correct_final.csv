## 11th International Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science (CALCO 2025)

**Dates:** June 16-18, 2025
**Location:** University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK
**Co-located with:** MFPS XLI

CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science. It is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques).

## Invited Speakers

*   Ugo dal Lago (University of Bologna) (joint special session on Quantitative Semantics)
*   Gordon Plotkin (University of Edinburgh) (joint keynote speaker)
*   Elena di Lavore (University of Oxford)
*   Alexander Kurz (Chapman University)

## Scope

Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer science. From data types to development techniques and specification formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from the large body of research proposed and implemented since the pioneering works of the 1960s. CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in both foundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science, traditional as well as emerging ones. CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS and WADT. This edition is planned as a physical, in-person event. It is expected that at least one author of each accepted paper will attend and give the presentation in person; exceptions can be made in case of unexpected travel/visa problems.

## Submission Categories

CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four categories of submissions:

1.  **Regular papers:** These papers should report on theoretical foundations, novel methods and techniques for software development, or experiences with technology transfer to industry.
2.  **(Co)Algebraic Pearls papers:** These papers present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way, illustrating an idea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing an application. Pearls are typically short and concise.
3.  **Early ideas abstracts:** These submissions lead to presentations of work in progress, or proposals for original venues of research.
4.  **Tool presentation papers:** These papers report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools.

The **37th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE'25)** will be held in **Vienna, Austria**, from **June 16-20, 2025**.

## Theme: Bridging Silos

Engineering real-world information systems requires a coherent design encompassing human, organizational, economic, societal, and technological aspects. Information systems are applied in diverse contexts such as business process management, geographical information systems, and digital twins. The discipline continually evolves with trends in data science, machine learning, process mining, blockchain, mobile computing, sustainability, new regulations, cyber warfare, and military conflicts, all influencing its development. Each application context and emerging trend can lead to specializations within information systems engineering, necessitating various research traditions and needs. While beneficial, these specializations risk creating silos. Thus, the CAiSE conference, the premier event for this discipline, aims to prevent such fragmentation.

Therefore, the theme for this year’s CAiSE conference is **""Bridging Silos.""** We encourage submissions that consider information systems engineering as a cohesive design involving multiple aspects. Submissions focused on specific specializations should explicitly position their results within the broader context to engage researchers across different areas and avoid silo formation.

The Computer Algebra in Scientific Computing (CASC) 2025 conference will take place from **November 24 – 28, 2025**, in **Dubai, The United Arab Emirates**.

## Conference Information

The tools of Scientific Computing play an important role in the natural sciences and engineering. Computer Algebra Systems and the underlying algorithms for Symbolic Computation play an increasingly important role within Scientific Computation. The CASC workshop series has been running for over two decades to explore the interaction of these topics, their implementation, and their application.

## Scope

The topics addressed in the workshop cover:

1.  **The theory of symbolic computation and its implementation in computer algebra systems.**
    This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   new methods on exact computation;
    *   symbolic algorithms and their complexity;
    *   automated reasoning in algebra and geometry;
    *   parallel symbolic / symbolic-numeric computation;
    *   symbolic / symbolic-numeric methods for differential, differential-algebraic and difference equations;
    *   symbolic / symbolic-numeric methods for polynomial equations and inequalities;
    *   the embedding of computer algebra technology within different software and hardware environments;

2.  **All other areas of scientific computing in regards to their benefit from or use of computer algebra methods and software.**
    This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   the use of computer algebra in approximate computation;
    *   computer algebra methods in big data analytics;
    *   computer algebra methods for simulation and modeling;

3.  **Applications of the above throughout the natural sciences and engineering.**

We welcome papers on both fundamental research and implementation issues. We also accept survey papers but these MUST BE CLEARLY LABELLED as such in the title.

## Conference Participation Options

We encourage wide participation at the workshop. In light of this, and that the conference scope spans computer science and mathematics (with their different publication traditions), we offer a variety of participation options:

1.  **Participation with an accompanying paper in LNCS:**
    CASC has a long running relationship with the Springer book series Lecture Notes in Computer Science to publish conference proceedings. Work submitted here should contain an original research result. Submissions should be prepared in the LNCS style and not exceed **20 pages**. Survey papers may have up to **25 pages**.
    [List of CASC proceedings published by Springer](https://link.springer.com/conference/casc)

2.  **Participation with abstract only:**
    Participants may opt to submit an extended abstract instead. These should have at least **2 and at most 4 pages** in the LNCS style. They must contain the main results of the talk (without proofs). They will be lightly reviewed and distributed locally at the conference. We see three main audiences for this option:
    *   Those who wish to talk on previously published work (in which case that work should be clearly cited in the abstract).
    *   Those whose work is not yet ready for publication, but wish to receive feedback.
    *   Those who plan to submit a journal paper on the work shortly.

## Accompanying Topical Collection of Mathematics in Computer Science

CASC has formed a relationship with the Springer Birkhäuser journal Mathematics in Computer Science (MCS) for an ongoing series of topical collections on topics presented at CASC workshops. Work submitted here must be of journal quality and will be reviewed to the usual standards of MCS. Submission will be opened after the conference for authors of extended abstracts presented at that years conference. There is no a priori page limit, but the length must be justified by the contents of the paper. At notification authors may be asked to revise their paper for a secondary deadline.

## Submission Link

All submissions should be done via EasyChair:

**SUBMIT:** [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=casc2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=casc2025)

In the EasyChair title field please prefix the paper title in the EasyChair metadata with either **LNCS** or **EA** to indicate which of the participation options is being used.

ITCS seeks to promote research with innovative or bold agendas, which could be conceptual, technical, or methodological, and whose message will advance and inspire the greater theory community. The program committee welcomes papers introducing a new concept, model or understanding; opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas; introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies, or new applications of known techniques; putting forth a bold, even if preliminary, vision or line of attack; or unearthing novel or surprising connections between different topics.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract submission deadline:** September 3, 2024
*   **Submission deadline:** September 5, 2024
*   **Notification to authors:** November 2, 2024
*   **Conference dates:** January 7-January 10, 2025

## Submission Instructions

Authors should register and submit their paper via the [hotcrp submission site](https://itcs2025.hotcrp.com/) by the strict deadlines.

*   The font size should be at least 11 point and the paper should be single column.
*   Beyond these, there are no specific formatting requirements.
*   Authors are required to submit a COI (Conflict of Interest) declaration upon submission.

## Review Process

The conference will employ a **lightweight double-blind reviewing process**.

*   Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.
*   This process is intended to help PC members and external reviewers come to a judgment without unconscious bias.
*   Important references should not be omitted or anonymized.
*   Authors are encouraged to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would, including posting papers to arXiv/ECCC/IACR.

## Paper Content & Style

*   Authors should strive to make their paper accessible not only to experts in their subarea, but also to the theory community at large.
*   The submission should include clear proofs of all central claims.
*   It is strongly recommended that the paper contain, within the first 10 pages, a concise and clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its significance, innovations, and place within (or outside) of our field's scope and literature.
*   The committee will put a premium on writing that conveys clearly, in as simple and straightforward a manner as possible, what the paper accomplishes.

## PC Member Submissions

Submissions authored by program committee members (with the exception of the PC chair) are allowed. Utmost care will be taken to avoid COIs with PC submissions, ensuring that such submissions receive no unfair advantage, and that the reviews and discussion remain confidential from the authors.

## Confidentiality

All submissions will be treated as confidential and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. The program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.

## Prior, Simultaneous, and Subsequent Submissions

*   Results published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS.
*   Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed.
*   Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences.

## Online Posting

Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the arXiv, the ECCC, or the Cryptology ePrint archive. It is generally expected that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers, with proofs, available before the conference begins.

## Conference Presentation

*   All talks are expected to be in person.
*   Talks in the conference will not be recorded. Instead, authors of each paper will be asked to upload a 20-25 minute talk, which will be posted online.

## Graduating Bits

Participants nearing graduation (on either side) will be given an opportunity to present (in 2-3 minutes) their results, research, plans, personality, and so on during the ""Graduating bits"" session. Details on how to participate will be provided closer to the conference date.

## Awards

The committee may award a ""best student paper"" award.

## Code of Conduct

ITCS is committed to an inclusive conference experience, respectful of all participants, and free from any discrimination or harassment. All ITCS attendees are expected to behave accordingly. If you experience or witness discrimination, harassment, or other unethical behavior at the conference, we encourage you to seek advice by contacting SafeToC advocates (http://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/).

## Proceedings

The accepted papers will be published by LIPIcs in the electronic proceedings of the conference. Authors of accepted papers can ask the PC chair to have only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the PDF of the full paper on an online archive.",

## Paper Categories and Submission

We welcome **regular papers** and **short papers**.

### Submission Process

Submission for both categories is **lightweight double-blind**. This means that:

1.  Author names and institutions must be omitted using the `anonymous` option of the document class.
2.  References to authors’ own related work should be in the third person.
3.  The identity of authors will be revealed to reviewers once they have submitted a first draft of their review.

*Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing it more difficult. Important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. Authors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as usual.* 

### Regular Papers

*   Must be no more than **16 pages** in length excluding bibliographic references.
*   Must not include an appendix.
*   Must be in LIPIcs format.

### Short Papers

*   Can be used to describe interesting work that is still ongoing and not fully mature.
*   Accepted short papers will be published in the main proceedings and will be presented as short talks.
*   Must be no more than **6 pages** in length excluding bibliographic references and may consist of an extended abstract.
*   Must have the phrase ""Short paper"" as a subtitle.
*   Must not include an appendix.
*   Must be in LIPIcs format.

## Formatting and Submission Platform

Both categories of papers must be prepared in LaTeX using the [lipics-v2021 style](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author) (v2021.1.3) and must be submitted electronically as pdf files through [HotCRP](https://itp25.hotcrp.com).

## Supplementary Material

All submissions are expected to be accompanied by supplementary material containing verifiable evidence of a suitable implementation, such as the source files of a formalization for the proof assistant used.

*   **Anonymous supplementary material** is made available to the reviewers before they submit their first-draft reviews.
*   **Non-anonymous supplementary material** is made available to the reviewers after they have submitted their first-draft reviews and have learned the identity of the authors.

We strongly encourage anonymous supplementary material whenever possible.

## Publication

The conference proceedings will be published in Dagstuhl Publishing's Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series in **Gold Open Access** under the CC-BY-4.0 license.

## Registration and Participation

*   Remote attendance of the conference will be possible for a low or no fee.
*   For all accepted papers, at least one author must pay a **full registration fee**.
*   For presenters, physical participation is strongly encouraged.
*   Remote talks are only possible if agreed with the organizers by the registration deadline, but still one author must pay the full registration fee.

Programming languages, compilers, and tools are crucial interfaces between embedded systems and emerging real-world applications, including deep neural networks, large language models, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare. These applications present challenges that often conflict with conventional design requirements and increase the complexity of embedded system designs. They also leverage new hardware paradigms like multicores (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs) and distributed systems. Consequently, programming languages, compilers, and tools are increasingly vital for addressing productivity, validation, verification, maintainability, safety, and reliability, while meeting performance goals and resource constraints.

The 26th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, Tools and Theory of Embedded Systems (LCTES 2025) invites original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that address these challenges. Both research papers on innovative techniques and experience papers on real-world system experimentation are welcome.

The event offers both in-person and virtual participation options.","# Call for Papers and Demos: Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025

We are pleased to announce the 21st edition of the “Robotics: Science and Systems” (RSS) conference, to be held at the **University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA, from June 21 - 25, 2025**.

RSS is a **single-track conference** that connects researchers working on all aspects of robotics, including scientific foundations, mechanisms, algorithms, applications, and analysis of robotic systems. The single-track format allows attendees to learn about state-of-the-art research across all robotics domains. The conference will feature oral and poster presentations of accepted papers, demonstrations, invited talks, and panels.

## Announcement 1: LA Wildfire Support

In response to recent wildfires in Los Angeles, adjustments have been made to the RSS 2025 submission timeline. The abstract/title submission (January 17) and initial paper submission (January 24) deadlines remain unchanged. However, authors can update the PDF of their paper until **January 31, 2025**, which is also the supplementary material deadline. For more details, read the [full announcement](/updates/la-wildfires/).

## Announcement 2: Double Submissions

Submitting an abstract (by January 17) or a semi-complete paper (by January 24) that is currently under submission to another conference (e.g., ICRA, ICLR, CVPR) is considered a double submission and is forbidden by RSS rules. However, if a paper contains substantial innovation compared to the paper under review (qualifying it as a different and novel paper), it may be submitted to RSS.

## Submission Types

*   **Paper Contributions:** We invite submissions of high-quality research papers that introduce new ideas and stimulate future trends in robotics.
*   **Demo Contributions:** Submissions for demos are possible and will include a Demo Track during the main conference. These single-blind submissions can range from early research demos to mature production-ready systems. Open-source and open-access systems or interactive systems accessible to the community are especially encouraged. Demos can relate to hardware or software contributions, their integration, critical system components, and useful tools for the community.

The 31st IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS) is a top-tier conference with a focus on systems with timing requirements. RTAS’25 welcomes papers describing applications, case studies, methodologies, tools, algorithms, operating systems, middleware, or hardware innovations that contribute to the state of the art in the design, implementation, validation, verification, and evolution of systems with timing requirements.

RTAS’25 will be part of the [CPS-IoT Week](https://cps-iot-week2025.ics.uci.edu/) in **Irvine, USA, May 6-9, 2025**.

## Tracks

RTAS’25 consists of two tracks:

*   **Track 1: Systems and Applications**
*   **Track 2: Applied Methodologies and Foundations**

## Scope and Guidelines

To be in scope, papers must explicitly consider at least one of the following:

*   Some kind of timing requirements;
*   Improvements or innovations that directly support the fundamental properties of systems with timing requirements.

### Timing Requirements

The timing requirements of interest are broadly defined and include not only classical hard real-time constraints, but also soft real-time, probabilistic, quality-of-service (QoS), throughput or latency requirements. The authors should specifically state the types of timing-related properties addressed by the contribution(s) presented in their paper.

### Improvements or Innovations to Support Fundamental Properties

Work that supports the design, implementation, validation, or evaluation of deterministic, predictable, dependable, efficient, or next-generation systems with timing requirements are welcome. The authors should specifically state how their work can be used or built upon to ultimately achieve systems with timing requirements beyond the state of the arts.

Application areas can include, but are not limited to: resource-constrained embedded systems, distributed cyber-physical systems (CPS), cloud/edge/fog computing systems, cloud data centers, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile computing, robotics, smart grid, and smart cities, as well as middleware and frameworks, machine learning and signal processing algorithms.

## Peer Review Process

RTAS’25 follows a **double-anonymous peer reviewing process**: author identities and affiliations will not be revealed to reviewers. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a response to reviews before acceptance decisions are made, solely to provide clarifications and correct misconceptions. The response will not allow authors to introduce new material beyond the original submission or promise such material for the camera-ready version.

There will be an **optional artifact evaluation process** for accepted papers that assesses the reproducibility of the work.

## Submission Portal

[Submission Portal](https://rtas25.hotcrp.com/)

## Track 1: Systems and Applications

This track focuses on research of an empirical nature pertaining to (system- or component-) level analysis, optimization, and verification, as well as applications, runtime software, and hardware architectures for systems with timing requirements. Topics relevant to this track include, but are not limited to:

*   Applications with timing requirements
*   Real-time and embedded operating systems
*   Hypervisors and runtime frameworks
*   Hardware architectures, memory hierarchies, FPGAs, GPUs and accelerators
*   Networks with timing requirements
*   CPS/IoT infrastructure
*   Microservice technologies, cloud and edge computing
*   Real-time artificial intelligence and machine learning
*   Application profiling, WCET analysis, compilers, tools, benchmarks and case studies

Papers discussing design and implementation experiences on real industrial systems are especially encouraged. Papers submitted to this track should focus on specific systems and implementations. Authors must include a section with experimental results performed on a real implementation or demonstrate applicability to an industrial case study or working system. The experiment or case study discussions must highlight the key lessons learned. Simulation-based results are acceptable for architectural simulation, or other cases where authors clearly motivate why it is not feasible to develop and evaluate a real system.

Empirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field is also welcome in this track.

## Track 2: Applied Methodologies and Foundations

This track focuses on fundamental models and analysis techniques/methods applicable to systems with timing requirements to solve problems. The track welcomes knowledge-based models, models built from data, as well as a combination, and different types of analysis methods, including analytical, statistical, or probabilistic methods. Topics relevant to this track include, but are not limited to:

*   Modelling languages, modelling methods, model learning, model validation and calibration
*   Scheduling and resource allocation
*   System-level optimization and co-design techniques
*   Design space exploration
*   Verification and validation methodologies

Papers must describe the main context or use case for the proposed methods giving clear motivating examples based on real systems. The system models and any assumptions used in the derivation of the methods must be applicable to real systems and reflect actual needs. Papers must include a section on experimental results, preferably including a case study based on information from a real system. The use of synthetic workloads and models is acceptable if appropriately motivated and used to provide a systematic evaluation.

They provide an additional level of rigor and effectiveness compared to conventional testing and are generally more practical than exhaustive formal verification.

Runtime verification can be used prior to deployment for testing, verification, and debugging purposes, and after deployment for ensuring reliability, safety, and security, and for providing fault containment and recovery as well as online system repair.

## Topics of Interest

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:

*   Specification languages for monitoring
*   Monitor construction techniques
*   Program instrumentation
*   Logging, recording, and replay
*   Combination of static and dynamic analysis
*   Specification mining and machine learning over runtime traces
*   Monitoring techniques for concurrent and distributed systems
*   Runtime checking of privacy and security policies
*   Metrics and statistical information gathering
*   Program/system execution visualization
*   Fault localization, containment, resilience, recovery, and repair
*   Monitoring systems with learning-enabled components
*   Dynamic type checking
*   Runtime verification for autonomy and runtime assurance
*   Runtime verification for assurance cases
*   Out-of-distribution and anomaly detection in ML-based systems
*   Safe reinforcement learning

    *   Cryptographic implementation analysis
    *   New cryptographic protocols with real-world applications
*   Blockchains and distributed ledger security
*   Meta-science in Security and Privacy
    *   Meta-science, or the study of scientific research itself, aims to enhance the efficiency, quality, and outcomes of research activities in our community. Submissions in this broad topic should focus on evaluations of research practices, replicability/reproducibility, ethics, research methodologies, data transparency, and peer-review processes.
    *   Contributions should extend beyond analysis, aiming to influence future research practices.
    *   **Replication and Reproduction:** Contributions to this sub-topic should primarily consist of studies that verify, refute, or refine prior technical results or widely-held beliefs. We encourage submissions that not only replicate studies but also offer meta-analyses that assess the replicability of research. Additionally, while replication studies often replicate original findings, we also value novel investigations into why certain studies fail to replicate. Papers that critically examine the conditions under which replication is feasible, or those that propose innovative methods to enhance the reliability of scientific findings, are especially welcome.
*   Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)
    *   SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research; they include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.
    *   SoK submissions should be prefixed with ""SoK:"".

## Research Ethics

Authors of all submissions must consider and discuss the ethics of their work. Papers must include a discussion of ethics and an argument for how their full research and publication process was ethical. Failure to do so may result in rejection.

## Open Science

Authors are expected to openly share their research artifacts by default. If artifacts cannot be shared, a detailed justification must be provided. Adherence to the open science policy needs to be explicitly discussed in the paper.

## Artifact Evaluation

Artifact evaluation will take place in two phases: availability after paper acceptance and before final papers are due; functionality and reproducibility after final papers are due. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to register their artifacts.

See the [Call for Artifacts](/conference/usenixsecurity25/call-for-artifacts) for more information.

## New Approach to Presentation of Papers

Accepted papers will be presented in various formats, including longer talks (tentatively 15 minutes), shorter presentations (tentatively 30 seconds to 1 minute), posters, and optional pre-recorded video presentations.

## Submission Policies and Instructions

See the [USENIX Security '25 Submission Policies and Instructions](/conference/usenixsecurity25/submission-policies-and-instructions) page for details.

Hunt Jr. Library at North Carolina State University.","# Call for Research Papers

We solicit original, unpublished research papers on computing technologies for modeling, programming, communicating, and reasoning, which are easier to learn, use or understand by humans than the current state-of-the-art. Papers should focus on efforts to design, formalize, implement, or evaluate those technologies and languages. This includes technologies intended for general audiences (e.g., professional or novice programmers, or the public) or domain-specific audiences (e.g., people working in business administration, production environments, healthcare, urban design or scientific domains). Empirical papers that validate current proposed solutions with rigorous scientific means (i.e., empirical studies, controlled experiments, rigorous case studies, etc.) are also welcome.

## Scope and Topics

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   **Visual languages:** Novel visual languages, Design, evaluation, and theory of visual languages and applications, Development of systems for manipulating and interacting with diagrammatic representations
*   **Human aspects and psychology of software development and language design**, such as supporting inclusion and diversity in programming
*   **End-user development, adaptation and programming**, Creation and evaluation of technologies and infrastructures for end-user development
*   **Representations:** Novel representations and user interfaces for expressing computation, Software, algorithm and data visualization
*   **Modeling:** Model-driven development, Domain-specific languages, including modeling languages, Visual modeling of human behavior and socio-technical systems
*   **Thinking more deeply about code:** Debugging, program comprehension, code review, Explainable ML/AI
*   **Future of work with AI:** Human-Centric AI-based tools, modeling end-user interactions with AI powered tools
*   **Low-Code/No-Code paradigm:** Approaches for creation and deployment of fully functional applications using visual abstractions and interfaces
*   **Education and Computational thinking:** using visual languages in education, teaching human-centric principals, educator and student perspectives

If you are not sure if your paper is a good fit for VL/HCC, feel free to email the PC Co-chairs (see “Contact” below). We welcome those new to the VL/HCC community to submit!

## Special Emphasis for 2025: Human-AI Collaboration

We seek research that highlights the situations in which human-AI interactions enhance, or degrade, the human experience in computing. Papers describing positive, negative and unclear impacts are all welcome.

## Paper Submissions

We invite two kinds of papers:

*   **Full-length papers:** up to 10 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements
*   **Short papers:** up to 5 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements

All accepted papers, whether full or short, should be complete, self-contained, archival contributions. Contributions from full papers are more extensive than those from short papers. Papers do not have to reach the maximum page limit, but they should be of an appropriate length for the content. Note that some full paper submissions may be accepted as short papers if reviewers deem contributions to be comparable in size to a short paper.

Papers could be research findings, industry experience reports, replication studies, or vision papers. Please select the appropriate page length for the content of your paper.

Papers must be submitted using the IEEE two-column conference paper format. Be sure to use the current IEEE conference paper format (which was updated in 2019), and to select the “US letter” template.

Papers should be submitted via the EasyChair system: [https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vlhcc2025](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vlhcc2025).

To facilitate the assigning of papers to reviewers, authors should submit paper abstracts via EasyChair at least 1 week prior to the paper submission deadline (see Important Dates below). The abstract must be no longer than 250 words.

All submissions will be reviewed by members of the Program Committee in a double-anonymous review process. Authors will then receive the reviews for their submissions and will be able to answer them in a rebuttal phase. Only after this step will the PC make a final decision about the acceptance of the submissions. Submissions and reviews for the technical program are managed with EasyChair. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for VL/HCC 2025 and present the paper at the conference. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference, including IEEE Xplore Digital Library, if the paper is not presented by the author at the conference.

The proceedings of IEEE VL/HCC are published in digital form by the IEEE Computer Science Society and archived in the IEEE Digital Library with an official ISBN number. Accepted papers will be available to conference attendees via the IEEE Open Preview program in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library).

## Double-Anonymous Reviewing

We follow a double-anonymous reviewing process. Both authors and reviewers are expected to make every effort to honor the double-anonymous reviewing process. In case of questions, please contact the Program Chairs. Authors should ensure that the submission can be evaluated without it being obvious who wrote the paper. This means leaving author names off the paper and using terms like “previous research” rather than “our previous research” when describing background. However, do not hide previous work – papers must still reference all relevant research using full (non-anonymized) citations, including the author’s own prior work, so that reviewers can evaluate novelty. Please reference your own prior work in the third-person just like you would do for any other related work (e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and instead write something like “As described by [10], …”). It is also important that authors specify all conflicts of interest with potential reviewers during the submission phase. Reviewers should not undertake any investigation that might lead to the revealing of authors’ identity. If identities are inadvertently revealed, please contact the Program Chairs. The Program Chairs will check all submissions for obvious signs of lack of anonymity and may ask authors to make changes and resubmit the paper within three days of the submission deadline. Only changes to resolve anonymity issues will be permitted.

## Evaluation and Justification

Papers are expected to support their claims with appropriate evidence. For example, a paper that claims to improve programmer productivity is expected to demonstrate improved productivity; a paper that claims to be easier to use should demonstrate increased ease of use.

However, not all claims necessarily need to be supported with empirical evidence or studies with people. For example, a paper that claims to make something feasible that was clearly infeasible might substantiate its claim through the existence of a functioning prototype.

Moreover, there are many alternatives to empirical evidence that may be appropriate for justifying claims, including analytical methods, formal arguments or case studies. Given this criterion, we encourage potential authors to think carefully about what claims their submission makes and what evidence would adequately support these claims.

Replication papers will be evaluated on their own merit in terms of methods used, findings discussed and comparison to original studies in terms of different context or use of different methods.

Vision papers should make a case for future needs and research directions in VL and/or HCC community interest areas within a timeline of the next 5 to 10 years.

Industrial experience reports with VL and/or HCC topics should describe context, lessons learned (positive or negative), and recommendations for research and practice as appropriate.

We expect short papers to have less comprehensive evaluation than full-length papers, and may have less technical detail, but sufficient to make the case for the contribution. New ideas and early research results would be expected to use a short paper format.

## Adhering to IEEE Guidelines

Please be sure that your submission follows the [IEEE requirements](https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/author-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-policies/)

Especially around Human Subject approvals and use of Generative AI:

### Research on Human and Animal Subjects

Authors of articles reporting on research involving human subjects or animals, including but extending beyond medical research, shall include a statement in the article that the research was performed under the oversight of an institutional review board or equivalent local/regional body, including the official name of the IRB/ethics committee, or include an explanation as to why such a review was not conducted. For research involving human subjects, authors shall also report that consent from the human subjects in the research was obtained or explain why consent was not obtained.

### Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text

The use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in a paper (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE publication. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the paper that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content. The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. In this case, disclosure as noted above is recommended.

## Submission Guidelines & Policies

All paper submissions must adhere to several important aspects:

### Final Submission Mindset

Submitting papers for review that are not yet complete and polished abuses the review process and is disrespectful to the Program Committee and the Computer Architecture community. All authors must affirm that their submission is, to the best of their abilities, complete, polished, and ready for comprehensive review. Furthermore, if all reviewers of a submission find that the submission is lacking in this regard, detailed reviewer feedback will be withheld from the authors. In other words, there is a cost to submitting unfinished work – it may “poison” future reviews without the authors gaining any feedback.

### Reviewer Continuity Initiative

HPCA 2026 is considering an initiative to maintain reviewer continuity for submitted papers that were rejected from MICRO 2025 on an opt-in basis. The goal for this initiative is to improve the fairness of the overall review process in Computer Architecture. It is in the best interest of authors and the community to have papers undergo a consistent revision process. However, please do not feel pressured to participate in this initiative, reviewers will not be made aware of your choice implicitly or explicitly.

If all authors of a submission opt in to the “reviewer continuity initiative”, reviewers who had previously reviewed a version of the submission for MICRO 2025 may be explicitly assigned to review the submission (PC members also must opt in to this initiative). If the authors do not opt in for “reviewer continuity”, reviewers of previous submissions may still be assigned to review the submitted version of the paper based on reviewer expertise, reviewer load balance, and other similar agnostic criteria.

### Revision Letters

If a submission has been previously reviewed and rejected from another venue or conference and is now being submitted to HPCA 2026, the authors must provide a letter explaining how the paper has been revised for this current submission, regardless of whether the authors opt to participate in “reviewer continuity” or not. Authors may choose to only permit the PC Chairs to have access and knowledge of this letter. Authors who opt in for reviewer continuity implicitly make their revision letter available to reviewers who reviewed a prior version for MICRO 2025. Note that it is not a requirement that papers be revised before being submitted to HPCA, but we expect a revision letter nonetheless.

### Abstract Registration and Final Submission

Authors must register an abstract one week before the paper submission deadline. The purpose is to ensure that authors are fully aware of all submission requirements, topic selection, conflict of interest registration, etc. All information regarding the submission may be edited up to final submission time but may not change once the review process has started. In particular, authorship at submission time must match that of the final publication, if accepted.

### Formatting and Submission Instructions

Detailed formatting and submission instructions will be made available on the submission site ([http://hpca2026.hotcrp.com](http://hpca2026.hotcrp.com)) at a later date.",
