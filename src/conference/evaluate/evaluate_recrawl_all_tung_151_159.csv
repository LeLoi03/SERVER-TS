We invite the submission of manuscripts presenting original research results to the IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS) 2025, which will be held from **July 2-4, 2025, in Gold Coast, Australia**.

Quality of Service (QoS) has long been a central focus for communications and networking researchers worldwide. Emerging domains such as the Internet of Things, data centers, virtualization, cloud and fog computing, green computing, and artificial intelligence are driving a new wave of research into service guarantees related to QoS, Quality of Experience (QoE), Quality of Protection (QoP), Software Quality, Data Quality, and, more broadly, Quality of Information Technology.

IWQoS 2025 aims to continue its tradition as a premier symposium and an international platform for the presentation and discussion of cutting-edge research in the field. The scope of IWQoS encompasses both the latest theoretical advancements and experimental research papers.

The Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR) is a biannual multi-disciplinary single-track meeting of international researchers presenting the latest advances on algorithmic problems in robotics. In 2024, WAFR celebrates 30 years, with special events planned for this milestone.

WAFR focuses on the design and analysis of robot algorithms from both theoretical and practical angles. These algorithms process inputs from noisy sensors, build geometric and physical models of the world, plan high- and low-level actions at different time horizons, and execute these actions on actuators with limited precision. The design and analysis of robot algorithms raise a unique combination of questions from many fields.

## Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools

### For Authors:

*   Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of a paper submitted to WAFR.
*   The use of content generated by AI in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section.
*   The AI system used must be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content should be specified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the manner in which the AI system was used to generate the content.
*   The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. Even so, in this case, disclosure is still recommended as the lines between these uses can be difficult to distinguish.

### For Reviewers:

*   Information or content contained in or about a manuscript under review shall not be processed through an AI system. Doing so is considered a breach of confidentiality and as such is not permitted.
