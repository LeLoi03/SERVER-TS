ACNS gives the best workshop paper award, with **500 EUR** prize sponsored by Springer.

## Best Student Paper Award

ACNS gives the best student paper award, with **1500 EUR** prize sponsored by Springer, to encourage promising students to publish their best results at this venue. Any paper with a student as an author is eligible for this award.

## Instructions for Authors

Submissions must be done via the HotCRP website. The link will be announced shortly before the paper deadline.

ACNS 2026 will be an in-person conference. Since remote presentations or videos will not be accepted, authors submitting a paper must ensure that one of the authors can present the paper at the conference in person.

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published (other than preprint) or accepted for publication or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings.

## Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)

ACNS 2026 solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable to help our community to clarify and put into context complex research problems.

We encourage the authors to distinguish SoK submissions by adding the ""**SoK:**"" prefix to the title.

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. Each submission must begin with a title, short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non- specialist reader.

All submissions must be submitted in PDF format, following the unmodified LNCS format (accessible on the Springer LCNS author guidelines webpage) and typeset using the corresponding LaTeX class file. They must fit within a page limit of 20 pages, including title and abstract, figures, etc., but excluding references. 

To accommodate for changes requested in reviews, the page limit for the camera-ready proceedings versions is 30 pages, including references and appendices.

ACNS 2026 has two submission deadlines (in September and January) that authors may choose to submit their papers to. Papers rejected after the September round cannot be resubmitted at the January round.

We will publish our proceedings with Springer as a volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.

## Conflicts of Interest

The program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and program committee members to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest.

We regard the following relationships as conflicts of interest:

*   Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author at the time of submission (including secondary affiliations and consulting work)
*   Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past
*   Anyone the author has collaborated or published within the prior two years
*   Anyone who is serving as the sponsor or administrator of a grant that funds your research
*   Close personal or family ties

## Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure

Where research identifies a vulnerability, we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. 

It is the committee's sense that a disclosure window of 45 days to 90 days ahead of publication is consistent with authors' ethical obligations."

## Review Process

AJCAI 2025 uses a single-stage review process (no rebuttal phase). Authors will receive final decisions without the opportunity to respond to reviewer comments during the review process.

The deadline for submitting supplementary materials is the same as the deadline for full paper submissions. We recommend using the same template as the paper for supplementary materials. There is no page limit for supplementary materials.

Each accepted paper requires at least one Full Registration. If you have more than one accepted paper, you have to register for each paper individually.

Submissions will be through the OpenReview system at the following URL: [https://openreview.net/group?id=AJCAI/2025](https://openreview.net/group?id=AJCAI/2025)

All accepted papers submitted to the Conference will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference and to present the paper.

## Format

We invite submissions of three different formats:

1.  **Original Research Papers**
    *   We invite the submission of papers on original and unpublished research on all aspects of NLP and CL.
    *   Long papers should be 7-8 pages, and short papers should be 3-4 pages (see further details below). Accepted papers will either be delivered as an oral presentation or as a poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site.
    *   In addition to the page count requirements, both short and long papers may include unlimited pages of references.
    *   Note that the review process is double-blind, and accordingly, submitted papers should not include the identity of the author(s) and the text should be suitably anonymised, e.g. using third-person wording for self-citations, not providing URLs to your personal website, properly anonymising public repositories, etc. Original research papers will be included in the workshop proceedings, which will be published online in the ACL anthology and the ALTA website. Long papers will be distinguished from short papers in the proceedings.
2.  **Non-archival submissions**
    *   To encourage broader participation and facilitate local socialisation of international results (such as papers published elsewhere), we invite non-archival submissions. The organisers may offer the opportunity to give an oral or poster presentation. We only accept poster presentations for participants who are presenting on-site. Submissions should include the presentation title and abstract, the name of the presenter, any publications relating to the work, and any information on collaboration with the local ALTA community. There is no page limit on non-archival submissions as such.
    *   Non-archival submissions will not be published in the proceedings but simply reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to ensure that they are on topic, coherent, and likely to be of interest to the ALTA community. Submissions on work in progress and work published or submitted elsewhere are encouraged. ALTA invites submissions of all manner of interesting research, not limited to but including:
        *   Papers accepted or published at *CL or similar venues by researchers in the ALTA region
        *   Established academics giving an overview of an exciting paper or paper/s published in international venues
        *   Completing research students giving an overview of their thesis work
        *   Early candidature research students presenting their work in progress and ideas that may not have been published
    *   Presentation abstracts should not be anonymised, any publications relating to the work should be cited in the submission, and the person who will give the presentation should be clearly stated.
3.  **Industry Demonstrations**
    *   To encourage industry participation and networking opportunities, we are thrilled to announce a track for industry demonstrations, which provides an exciting opportunity for industry researchers to showcase their NLP applications. You should submit a proposal that is 1-2 pages long, containing (1) a description of the software, tools or applications that will be presented and how NLP techniques are used to address a specific problem and (2) a brief introduction of your organisation. We particularly encourage startups using NLP models to submit a proposal. The proposals will be reviewed by the ALTA executive committee to select demonstrations that best align with the interests of the ALTA community.

## Multiple Submission

Original research papers under review for other publication venues or that you intend to submit elsewhere may be submitted in parallel to ALTA. We require that you declare at submission that your paper has been submitted to another venue and identify the venue. Should your paper be accepted to ALTA and another venue, we will allow you to decide whether the paper should be published in the ALTA proceedings or treated as a presentation (without archival publication). In this case, you can still present a research talk at the ALTA workshop. This is to encourage more internationally leading research to be presented at the workshop.

## Instructions for Authors

### Paper Submission

Authors should submit their papers via OpenReview using the ‘‘ALTA 2025 Workshop Submission’’ button. Note, this will become available closer to the submission deadline.

### Important Notice Regarding OpenReview Profile Creation

We would like to notify authors about OpenReview’s profile creation policy:

*   Profiles created without an institutional email (e.g., using Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) will undergo a moderation process that may take up to two weeks for approval. Profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically without any delay.
*   To avoid any delays, we strongly recommend using an institutional email when creating your OpenReview profile. Otherwise, please be aware of the potential two-week moderation period and plan accordingly towards the paper submission deadline.

Thank you for your understanding.

## Formatting Guidelines

Submissions must follow the two-column ACL format. We therefore strongly recommend you use LaTeX style files or the Microsoft Word template from [https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files).

### Paper Length

*   Long papers: 7-8 pages of content. Plus, unlimited pages of references and appendices.
*   Short papers: 3-4 pages. Plus, unlimited pages of references and appendices.

About the appendices: While the appendix length is unlimited, it is essential to notify the authors that reviewers are not required to read it. The main text should be self-explanatory, with the appendix used only to highlight additional details.

Abstracts ideally should be a few paragraphs.

Industry demonstration proposals should be 1-2 pages.

### Anonymisation

Short and long papers must be anonymised. Abstracts are NOT to be anonymised and must include the author’s/authors’ affiliation."

### Call for Art Pieces

**DEADLINE: 31 July 2025**

ALIFE 2025 invites artists, designers, and makers from all backgrounds to contribute to the Community Artworks & Demos showcase, which sits at the creative forefront of artificial life. We welcome submissions that critically and creatively engage with core concepts of life-like systems, such as emergence, autonomy, synthetic systems, embodiment, and other life-like behaviors. This year’s theme is “Ciphers of Life,” encouraging all participants to explore the many ways that life encodes information, creates internal languages, and interacts in encrypted ways with its environment.

Reflecting the interdisciplinary spirit of ALIFE 2025, which explores artificial life through artistic, computational, biological, and theoretical lenses, this open call encourages a diverse range of formats: from interactive digital installations and software-driven art to sculptural bio-inspired works and conceptual pieces. Performances and other media are also welcome!

Accepted submissions will be on display throughout October 7-10 in the main venue hall. They will be accessible to the public, offering a broader audience for artists and creators to share their creations. Finally, all pieces will be featured in a printed magazine for visitors to keep.
