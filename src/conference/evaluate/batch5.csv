## Types of Submissions Solicited

We invite **full papers** for submission that present novel and mature research results. Full papers are limited to **20 pages** in Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and appendices.

> Papers that do not follow these formatting guidelines may be rejected without review.

While we do not accept short papers, we encourage authors to submit a poster instead, presenting original, still ongoing work that has not yet reached the maturity required for a full paper. For more information, please refer to the Call for Posters section below.

## Submission Guidelines

DIMVA 2025 will adopt a **double-blind reviewing process**. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations must be excluded from the paper. Furthermore, authors should avoid obvious self-references, and should cite their own previous work in third person, whenever necessary. Papers that are not properly anonymized risk being rejected without review.

Submissions must be original work and may not be under submission to another venue at the time of review. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to physically present the submitted work at the conference, for the paper to be included in the proceedings.

Authors are encouraged to submit code appropriately anonymized, using, e.g., [https://anonymous.4open.science/](https://anonymous.4open.science/).

### Ethical Considerations

Submissions that report experiments with data gathered from human subjects should disclose whether the research received approval from an institutional ethics review board (IRB), if applicable, and what measures were adopted to minimize risks to privacy.

Submissions that describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties (e.g., in case of probing of network devices), and how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software or system vendors or owners before publication.

*   Computer Vision
*   Constraints and Satisfiability
*   Data Mining
*   Fairness, Ethics, and Trust
*   Game Theory and Economic Paradigms
*   Humans and AI

*   Early registration deadline: TBC
*   Camera-ready deadline: **Tuesday, 26 August 2025**

All deadlines are at the end of the day specified, anywhere on Earth (UTC-12).

Author requests to formally withdraw a paper from review might take up to one week to process and might not be honoured at all if received after 25 June 2025.

## Ethics Statement

Research reported at ECAI should avoid harm, be honest and trustworthy, fair and non-discriminatory, and respect privacy and intellectual property. Where relevant, authors can include in the main body of their paper, or on the reference page, a short ethics statement that addresses ethical issues regarding the research being reported and the broader ethical impact of the work.

Reviewers will be asked to flag possible violations of relevant ethical principles. Such flagged submissions will be reviewed by a senior member of the programme committee.

Authors may be required to revise their paper to include a discussion of possible ethical concerns and their mitigation.

## Submission Instructions

Papers must be written in English, be prepared for double-blind review using the ECAI LaTeX template, and not exceed 7 pages (plus at most 1 extra page for references).

*   **ECAI LaTeX Template:** [Download Link](https://ecai2025.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ecai-template.zip)
    *   *Update on April 1, 2025: The README file in the LaTex package has been updated to include the current contact details in case there are issues. All other files (in particular, the ecai.cls file) remain the same.*
*   Excessive use of typesetting tricks to make things fit is not permitted. Please do not modify the style files or layout parameters.
*   Registering an abstract of your paper (of around 100-300 words in plain text) is required in advance of the paper submission deadline and you will be asked to provide additional information (such as keywords) at that time. Please do not leave things to the very last moment; you can resubmit any number of times until the submission deadline.
*   The submission website is: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecai20250](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecai20250).

### Supplementary Material

You have the option to accompany your submission with supplementary material, such as a technical appendix or code and data (up to 50MB). Reviewers will consult supplementary material at their own discretion, and you should not assume that they necessarily will. Make sure that any supplementary material you submit really is supplementary in nature: any information that is essential for understanding or evaluating your paper must be included in the paper itself. You of course must ensure that your supplementary material does not compromise the anonymity of your submission.

We will not publish your supplementary material. Nevertheless, if your paper gets accepted, then the readers of your published paper should have access to the same information as the reviewers of your submission. So you should make your (suitably revised) supplementary material openly available in archival form at the time of publication of your paper, and you should include a reference to the supplementary material in the camera-ready copy of your paper. For code or data you may wish to use a service such as Zenodo. For a technical appendix you may wish to use an archival preprint server such as arXiv.

### Resubmission from Other Conferences

If an earlier version of your paper was rejected from another conference with archival proceedings and double-blind reviewing during the 12 months preceding the submission deadline (such as ECAI-2024, AAAI-2025, or IJCAI-2025), you can supplement your submission with a document detailing how you have taken the reviews received into account to improve your paper.

This document must be a single PDF consisting of the following three parts:

1.  A cover letter, of at most one page, in which you summarise your response to the reviews received and how you have changed your paper since then.
2.  All reviews, including the metareview (if any), in anonymised form (but otherwise unedited). A screenshot from the submission system will usually work best.
3.  An unedited copy of the earlier submission.

This is entirely voluntary. Do it if you feel it would help reviewers to better appreciate your work. You can include documentation for at most one conference. The document you provide will be shared with your reviewers at the start of the reviewing process.

## Policies

ECAI subscribes to the [European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://allea.org/code-of-conduct/). By submitting to ECAI you confirm that you are aware of and accept the following specific policies:

*   **Originality:** Submissions must not have substantial overlap in either contribution or text with work previously accepted for publication as a full paper in another archival forum. Papers at workshops without archival proceedings and preprints are fine.
*   **Concurrent submission:** The work you submit must not be under review elsewhere at any time between submission and notification.
*   **Anonymity:** Reviewing for ECAI is double-blind, meaning that reviewers should not be aware of the identity of the authors of the papers they review. As an author you must make a reasonable effort to ensure that this is possible. Specifically, use the â€œdoubleblindâ€ option of the LaTeX template and do not include any acknowledgements in your submission. Cite your own prior work where appropriate, but do so in the third rather than the first person (that is, write, for instance, â€œTuring et al. [42] have shown â€¦â€ rather than â€œWe have shown â€¦ [42]â€).
*   **Links:** Papers must not include pointers to supplementary material on the web, not even when that supplementary material has been fully anonymised, as we would be unable to ensure that it remains unaltered throughout the reviewing period.
*   **Social media:** Actively promoting a paper on social media channels while it is undergoing double-blind review is discouraged.
*   **Reproducibility:** Reviewers will be instructed to pay close attention to reproducibility of results where appropriate and you should submit relevant code and data as supplementary material whenever feasible.
*   **Information sharing:** Submissions will be treated confidentially. However, papers, author information, and reviews may be shared with the organisers of other AI conferences to identify duplicate submissions and to limit duplicate reviewing efforts.
*   **Abstracts:** Abstracts are central for the assignment of reviewers. Therefore, they must not be altered in any significant way after the abstract submission deadline. In particular, submitting â€œplaceholder abstractsâ€ is not admissible.
*   **Authorship:** All individuals, and only those, who have made significant contributions to a paper should be listed as authors in the submission system. We will not permit adding or removing authors to a paper after the submission deadline. Please also ensure that the order of authors is correct at submission time.
*   **Submission limit:** No individual may be listed as an author for more than 8 separate submissions to ECAI.

The event focuses on advancing computational methods for biological problems, bringing together experts from various scientific disciplines to foster dialogue and collaboration.","# ISMB/ECCB 2025: Call for Papers

We invite abstract submissions for research in bioinformatics and computational biology, covering both ongoing work (previously Late-Breaking Research) and published research from the past 18 months (previously Highlights Track). Accepted abstracts can be considered for oral and/or poster presentations.

## Submission Process

*   **Track Selection:** Submit your abstract to the Community of Special Interest (COSI) or Open Session Track that best fits your research area. You can also identify two alternative tracks during submission.
*   **Content:** Abstracts should convey a scientific result and not be an advertisement for commercial software. If your topic falls outside the listed COSIs, you can select ""General Computational Biology"".
*   **Submission Site:** All abstracts must be submitted via the conference submission site by the abstract deadlines (which are not specified in the provided text, with a note to check a non-existent table or key dates page).

## Abstract Requirements

*   **Abstract Summary:** A brief and concise summary of the background/motivation, method, results, and conclusion/significance (maximum 250 words).
*   **Long Abstract (for Talks):** If submitting for a talk, an optional PDF of up to two (2) pages can be uploaded to provide additional details, figures, and graphics.
*   **Format:** Abstracts must not contain personal information (title, position, affiliation); these details are collected via the EasyChair submission system.

## Presentation Policies

*   **Presenting Author:** All submissions must select a presenting author, who must also be a corresponding author. Presenters of accepted abstracts are required to attend the conference (either in-person or virtually) and must register and pay the conference fees.
*   **Multiple Presentations:** The same research cannot be presented as an oral presentation more than once. Research can be presented as both a talk and a poster if submitted as two separate submissions with two different presenters. A presenting author may present NO MORE THAN ONE talk or poster on the same topic.
*   **Remote Presentation Options:** ISCB strongly prefers in-person presentations. Remote presentation options are available for reasons such as maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. Request for a waiver must be made by **May 15, 2024** (if granted, virtual presenters must provide a pre-recorded talk).

The Eurographics Symposium on Parallel Graphics and Visualization (EGPGV) aims to foster the exchange of experiences and knowledge on leveraging and defining new trends in parallel graphics and visualization. This area is important due to the widespread availability of multi-core CPUs, GPUs, and cluster systems. Computationally demanding and data-intensive applications in graphics and visualization are strongly affected by this trend and require novel, efficient parallel solutions.

EGPGV 2025 will take place on **June 2, 2025**, and will be co-located with EuroVis 2025, held **June 2 to June 6, 2025**, in **Luxembourg City, Luxembourg**.

The proceedings of EGPGV will be published in the Eurographics Proceedings Series and the Eurographics Digital Library.

EGPGV seeks papers on graphics and visualization that involve parallel computing and/or focus on very large data sets. Papers on techniques, data structures, algorithms, systems, and applications are welcomed. Parallel computing includes high-performance computing and cloud environments, (multi-)GPU computing and heterogeneous, hybrid architectures, and shared and/or distributed memory architectures. Further, papers focused on processing very large data sets (either for visualization or graphics) are welcomed, even if they do not have a particular focus on parallelism.

*   Computationally and data-intensive rendering
*   Scientific visualization (e.g., volume, flow, and tensor visualization)
*   Machine learning as applied to parallel graphics, visualization, and/or large data analytics
*   Information visualization and visual analytics
*   In situ analytics and in situ visualization
*   Out-of-core processing of large data sets for visualization or graphics
*   Simulations for virtual environments (physics-based animation, collision detection, acoustics)
*   Mesh processing, level-of-detail, and geometric methods
*   Visual computing (image- and video-based rendering, image processing and exploitation, segmentation)
*   Scheduling, memory management, and data coherence
*   Parallelization approaches and algorithms, such as MapReduce
*   Database-related methods, algorithms or approaches, and query-based visualization
*   Advanced hardware for data handling or visualization
*   Large and high-resolution displays, virtual environments

The theme for ECSA 2025 is â€œimpactful software architectureâ€. We are interested in learning about software architecture principles and practices, emerging trends, and case studies highlighting strategic architectural choices that can lead to enhanced performance, improved collaboration, and long-term sustainability. The overarching question is how these architectural principles and practices, both well-established and emerging, are making an impact in real-world systems, and how that impact is being felt across various domains.

The Program Committee of ECSA 2025 seeks submissions of original and unpublished high-quality papers describing fundamental and applied research; new methods, approaches, and processes; novel applications; education and training in software architecture; and experience reports on all topics related to software architecture. We particularly encourage papers that demonstrate diversity in gender, culture, religion, country, etc., as key factors for success and innovation.

*   Foundational principles of software architecture
*   Relationship of requirements engineering and software architecture
*   Quality attributes and software architectures
*   Architecture practices for secure, explainable, and trustworthy software
*   Architecture design and analysis
*   Architecture description languages and meta-models
*   Architecture verification and validation
*   Management of architectural knowledge, decisions, and rationale
*   Architecture patterns, styles, and tactics; reference architectures
*   Architecture viewpoints and views
*   Architecture conformance
*   Software architecture virtualization and visualization
*   Architecture-centric process models and frameworks
*   Software architecture and agile, incremental, iterative, and continuous development
*   Component-based models and deployment; middleware
