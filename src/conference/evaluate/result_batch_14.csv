OzCHI 2025 invites original contributions on all topics related to human-computer interaction (HCI), interaction design, and interactive technologies. Submissions are welcomed from design, engineering, social science, creative industries and other related disciplines. This call for papers includes Long Papers and Late-Breaking Work submissions.

## Long Papers

Long Papers should present original research and mature work in HCI and interaction design. These papers may describe investigations of user needs or contexts of use, lab-based evaluations or field deployments of prototypes, or other design-led or empirical investigations examining the relationship between people and technology.

Authors are encouraged to submit a paper of length proportional to its contribution. The average length of OzCHI Long Papers is approximately 7,000–8,000 words, excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Submissions of 12,000 words or more will be considered excessively long and could be desk rejected. Accepted Long Papers will be presented in person at the conference and included in the ACM Digital Library's conference proceedings. At least one author must register with OzCHI and present the paper in person. Remote and pre-recorded presentations will not be offered as part of OzCHI 2025.

## Late-Breaking Work

Late-Breaking Work (LBW) submissions present emerging ideas that would benefit from discussion with members of the HCI community. These submissions may include initial findings from new research, experiences of reflective practitioners, and first drafts of novel concepts and approaches.

Contributions should be up to 5,000 words excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Accepted LBW will be presented as a poster during the conference and included in the conference proceedings at the ACM Digital Library. At least one author must register with OzCHI and present the poster in person.

## Important Dates

Dates are given in Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone. The deadline for submission is 11:59 PM AoE on the specified date.

**Step 1: Download the ACM Master Template**

*   LaTeX users: download the template [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
*   Word users: download the template [here](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx).

Please ensure that you use the correct template. Submissions must be anonymised and formatted in a single-column layout for the reviewing phase. Using different templates or formats may result in desk rejection.

**Step 2: Write your paper**

*   Clearly explain the research question addressed, research methods and tasks, findings or results, and contributions of the work.
*   Papers should also provide sufficient background and related work to situate and contextualise the work of the author(s) work within a greater body of research.
*   Your paper should consist of original work not previously published or concurrently under consideration for any other conference, workshop, journal, or other publication with an ISBN, ISSN, or DOI number.
*   Authors should ensure their work and writing are as inclusive as possible; where this is not possible, they should be acknowledged.
*   Be anonymised for peer review. Authors must remove author and institutional identities throughout the paper, including from the title and header. Citations to your own relevant work should not be anonymous.
*   Authors should acknowledge the use of generative AI in the creation of their content, including specifying the AI tools used and the extent of their contribution to the research, writing, or design process.

**Step 3: Complete submission**

*   Make your submission via the Precision Conference system (PCS) [here](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions?focus=ozchi25).
*   Authors must submit the pdf of their paper before the submission deadline. No extensions will be granted. Any submissions showing ‘incomplete’ after the deadline will be deleted.

## Selection Process

An international panel will double-anonymously review Long Papers and LBW. Based on the full text of the submission, the panel will evaluate them for significance, originality, and clarity of writing.

Long Papers should:

*   Have clear significance in terms of contribution to HCI.
*   Offer a high level of technical quality in terms of related work, data, methods and analysis.
*   Demonstrate clarity of writing at a level ready for publication in the ACM digital library.

LBW submissions should:

*   Address a question of significance to the OzCHI community and stimulate interesting, novel conversations around the issue.
*   Demonstrate sufficient technical quality in the framing of the problem, related work or methods.
*   Demonstrate clarity of writing at a level ready for publication in the ACM digital library.

## Awards

Awards are presented to the highest quality Long Papers and reviews:

The 27th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (**PADL**) is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, databases and constraint programming, and theorem proving.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   Innovative applications of declarative languages
*   Declarative domain-specific languages and applications
*   Practical applications of theoretical results
*   New language developments and their impact on applications
*   Declarative languages and software engineering
*   Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications
*   Practical experiences and industrial applications
*   Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom
*   Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages

PADL 2025 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches related to applications, design, and implementation of declarative languages going beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example, advanced database languages and contract languages, as well as verification and theorem-proving methods that rely on declarative languages.

## Student Grants

PADL 2025 encourages students to participate in the symposium by providing some student grants to partially cover the registration and travel costs. The selection process will give preference to students who present their paper in the symposium. Students from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply. You can apply by filling out the following form before **December 25**: [https://forms.gle/Xr4HfxgNRxUAy7jv9](https://forms.gle/Xr4HfxgNRxUAy7jv9)

## Submissions

PADL 2025 welcomes regular papers (max. **15 pages**, excluding references) and short papers (max. **8 pages**, excluding references) that describe original and previously unpublished research results on:

*   Complex and/or real-world applications in industry or in other areas of research, that rely on an innovative use of declarative languages,
*   Tools and/or systems developed for such applications, and/or to improve practical aspects of declarative languages,
*   Technical results related to the practical aspects of declarative languages.

Application and systems descriptions, engineering solutions, and real-world experiences (both positive and negative) are in particular solicited. Regular and short papers will be published in the formal proceedings.

PADL 2025 also welcomes extended abstracts (max. **3 pages**) on the topics above, that describe new ideas, a new perspective on already published work, or work-in-progress that is not yet ready for a full publication. Extended abstracts will be posted on the symposium website but will not be published in the formal proceedings.

All page limits exclude references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style, see [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)

The review process of PADL 2025 is double-anonymous. In your submission, please, omit your names and institutions; refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others; do not include acknowledgments that might identify you.

Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version - for example, details of proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. Reviewers are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers must be understandable without them.

Page numbers (and, if possible, line numbers) should appear on the manuscript to help the reviewers in writing their reports. So, for LaTeX, we recommend that authors use:

```latex
\pagestyle{plain}
\usepackage{lineno}
\linenumbers
```

The conference proceedings of PADL 2025 will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published Workshop proceedings may be submitted but the authors should notify the program chairs where it has previously appeared. Previous PADL proceedings can be found on SpringerLink.

Papers should be submitted electronically via [EquinOCS](https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/padl2025) (registration is required if you do not have an account).

## Distinguished Papers

The authors of a small number of distinguished papers will be invited to submit a longer version for journal publication after the symposium. For papers related to logic programming, that will be in the journal Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP), and for papers related to functional programming, in Journal of Functional Programming (JFP). The extended journal submissions should be substantially (roughly 30%) extended.

PLDI is the premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research.","# PLDI 2025: Call for Papers

PACMPL Issue PLDI 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages research, broadly construed, including design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance. Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue PLDI 2025 will be invited – but not required – to present their work in the PLDI conference in **June 2025**, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN.

## Scope

PLDI is a premier forum for programming language research, broadly construed. Outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing is welcome. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all in scope for PLDI.

## Evaluation Criteria and Process

Reviewers will evaluate submissions for accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. Submissions should be organized to communicate clearly to a broad programming-language audience as well as experts on the paper’s topics. Papers should identify what has been accomplished and how it relates to previous work. Authors of empirical papers are encouraged to consider the seven categories of the SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines when preparing submissions.

The selection of papers will be made in two rounds of reviewing. In the first round, reviewers will assess the papers according to the quality criteria listed above. Authors will be given several days to compose a written response to the reviews received in the first round – e.g., to correct errors and clarify technical concerns. At the end of the first round, the Review Committee will conditionally accept a subset of the submissions and all other submissions will be rejected. In the second round, authors of conditionally-accepted papers will be given an opportunity to improve specific aspects of the research and the paper, as identified by the reviewers. Authors will have sufficient time to perform the required revisions and re-submit the paper. The same reviewers as in the first round will then assess how the revision requests have been acted upon by the authors. Revisions that fail to adequately address the reviewers’ original concerns will result in rejection.

The Review Committee will make final decisions regarding (conditional) acceptance and rejection, although reviews for a given paper will typically be performed by a subset of the committee. During the review period, authors must not contact Review Committee members – all questions must be addressed to the Associate Editor (who is doing the job that we would have called “Program Chair” before PLDI joined PACMPL). Contacting Review Committee members about submitted paper(s) is an ethical violation and may be grounds for summary rejection.

Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced, with extremely rare extenuating circumstances considered at the discretion of the Associate Editor.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

Author names and affiliations must be omitted from submissions. If a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. These are firm submission requirements. The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing.

The FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs. If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, or any cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ, please contact the Associate Editor. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Associate Editor than to risk summary rejection.

## Submission Site Information

The submission site will be at [https://pldi25.hotcrp.com/](https://pldi2025.hotcrp.com).

Authors can submit multiple times prior to the (firm!) deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no deadline for submitting abstracts. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Associate Editor (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).

The submission deadline is **11:59PM on Thursday November 14, 2024 anywhere on earth**: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth)

## Declaring Conflicts

When submitting a paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).

Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to subvert the normal peer-review process by excluding potential reviewers. Listing spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about whether or not a given relationship constitutes a conflict, please consult the Associate Editor.

## Formatting Requirements

Each paper should have no more than **20 pages of text, excluding bibliography**, using the ACM Proceedings format. This format is chosen for compatibility with PACMPL. It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent PLDI page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the [SIGPLAN author information page](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/). Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage use of the review and screen options as well, e.g.:

```latex
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous,nonacm]{acmart}
```

Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers may use either the author-year or numeric format for citations. Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Please take care to ensure that figures and tables are legible, even when the paper is printed in gray-scale. Papers that exceed the length requirement, deviate from the expected format, or are submitted late will be rejected.

## Supplementary Material

Authors are welcome to provide supplementary material if that material supports the claims in the paper. Such material may include proofs, experimental results, and/or data sets. This material should be uploaded at the same time as the submission. Reviewers are not required to examine the supplementary material but may refer to it if they would like to find further evidence supporting the claims in the paper.

Supplemental material cannot be included in the main submission text. All appendices must be submitted as supplemental material, not as part of the main submission PDF.

## Plagiarism and Concurrent Work

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere, as described by the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar venues of publication are disallowed. Prior work must, as always, be cited and referred to in the third person even if it is the authors’ own work, so as to preserve author anonymity. If you have further questions, please contact the Associate Editor.

## Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. At artifact submission time, authors will be asked to provide an artifact availability statement that details the expected behavior of the artifact, and how it pertains to the results of the paper. Artifact submission is voluntary but encouraged and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.

Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a badge printed on the papers themselves, and include the artifact availability statement (which will not count agains the page limit). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their artifacts publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.

## Open Access and Copyright

As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support liberal open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license, which grants readers (re-)use rights.

Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide an ORCID for each co-author and choose one of the following publication rights:

*   Author licenses the work with a Creative Commons license, retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice).
*   Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license.
*   Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license.
*   Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.

These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.

## Publication Date

All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library or the first day of the conference, which ever is sooner. Note that the date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## Presentations

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work at PLDI. Authors who need financial assistance for travel to the conferences should apply for a grant from the SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (PAC) program. We welcome all authors, regardless of nationality. If authors are not able to obtain visas to travel to the conference despite making reasonable effort, we will make arrangements to facilitate remote participation or presentation by another attendee on behalf of the authors.

## Distinguished Paper Awards

Up to 10% of the accepted papers may be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee believes should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The set of distinguished papers will be chosen through a rigorous review process of the final papers, carried out by a subset of the Review Committee.

## Acknowledgments

This call-for-papers is an adaptation and evolution of content from previous SIGPLAN conferences. We are grateful to prior organizers for their work, which is reused here.

## Code of Conduct

PLDI follows the ACM Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities. Please familiarize yourself with the policy and guide for reporting unacceptable behavior.

## Important Dates

Here are the key dates for PLDI 2025:

## Imagination Run Wild Submissions

We welcome proposals for hour-long presentations that will get all of us thinking as well as 5-minute lightning talks that explore partially formed ideas. Longer sessions may include workshops/focus groups that bring together people interested in exploring a topic. Free format groups may include open spaces or fishbowls. Half-baked ideas could be discussed in a planned or pop-up birds-of-feather.

Let your imagination run wild and propose something! The conference organizers are open to receiving a variety of session types and activities. If you wish to propose an activity that does not fit into any of the formats mentioned in this call, contact Kiyoka Hayashi, the “Imagination Run Wild” program chair [plopirw@hillside.net](mailto:plopirw@hillside.net) to discuss it.

Reports from any of these sessions may be included in the conference proceedings (subject to review).

## Paper Submissions

We welcome papers describing patterns and pattern languages, experience reports, essays, empirical evaluations, reflections, etc. After the initial screening by the program committee, you will get the opportunity to improve your paper under the guidance of a dedicated shepherd. If your paper is accepted at the conference, it will be discussed in a writers’ workshop session with other authors and participants. Based on what you learn at writers’ workshops, you will make final improvements to your paper after the conference and submit it for the proceedings.

To enable the paper content to benefit from the shepherding process and the writers’ workshop discussions, please be mindful of the number of pages in your submission. You want to create a paper that allows your shepherd and the writers’ workshop attendees to digest the material and provide meaningful feedback.

If you have any questions about paper submissions, contact Branislava Vranic, the papers program chair [ploppapers@hillside.net](mailto:ploppapers@hillside.net).

The Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management, traditional or nontraditional ([https://databasetheory.org/PODS](https://databasetheory.org/PODS)).

The 2026 conference will be held Bengaluru, India, on May 31 - June 05, 2026.

## Mission

The PODS community aims to provide a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques, and solutions for data management challenges. It develops new ways of advancing data management to reflect the rich landscape of data requirements in applications nowadays. The goal is to develop solutions that ensure high levels of efficiency, scalability, usability, expressiveness, robustness, security, clarity, and privacy.

## Scope

PODS seeks scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application and system building in the context of data management. Articles might be based on theoretical results, new concepts and frameworks, experimental work, or a rigorous analysis of important industry artifacts. PODS pays special attention to those papers that help in the urgent process of integrating data management techniques within broader computer science.

## Topics of Interest

Topics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to:

*   Database processing: Query evaluation, query optimization, schema management, distributed data processing, approximate data processing
*   Database design: Data models, query languages, schemas, constraints

## Submission Format

LaTeX users must format their submission using the standard ACM ""acmsmall"" proceedings stylesheet: [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)

They must use the following class declaration:

`\documentclass[acmsmall,review,anonymous]{acmart}`

A submission can be up to **15 pages**, not including references, plus unlimited space for references. Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, of unlimited length, that should be incorporated at submission time; online appendices are not allowed. However, an appendix will be read at the discretion of the program committee.

Papers that are longer than 15 pages or do not cohere with the required format style risk rejection without consideration of their merits. The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere, including the formal proceedings of other symposia or workshops.

Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms and accepted papers will be published in a PODS 2026 issue of the PACMMOD () journal. Authors of papers published in the PACMMOD issues of PODS 2026 will be invited to present their work at the SIGMOD/PODS conference. PODS will apply a double-blind reviewing process.

## Double-Anonymous Reviewing

PODS 2026 will use a lightweight double-anonymous reviewing process. This means that submissions must adhere to the following:

*   Author names and institutions must be omitted.
*   References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person.
*   Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed.

However, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.

Papers should report on original research relevant to parallel programming and should contain enough background materials to make them accessible to the entire parallel programming research community. Papers describing experience should indicate how they illustrate general principles or lead to new insights; papers about parallel programming foundations should indicate how they relate to practice. PPoPP submissions will be evaluated based on their technical merit and accessibility. Submissions should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, compare to the existing body of work on the topic, and explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions and results towards addressing the problem. Submissions should strive to be accessible both to a broad audience and to experts in the area.

## Paper Submission

*   Conference submission site: [https://ppopp26.hotcrp.com](https://ppopp26.hotcrp.com)
*   All submissions must be made electronically through the conference website and include an abstract (100–400 words), author contact information, the full list of authors and their affiliations. Full paper submissions must be in PDF format printable on both A4 and US letter-size paper.
*   All papers must be prepared in two-column ACM Conference Format, specifically the acmart document class (available here: [https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/)) with the sigplan option and 10-point font size. We recommend preparing your submission in Latex starting with the following template: [https://ppopp26.sigplan.org/getImage/orig/ppopp-acmart-sigplanproc-template.tex](https://ppopp26.sigplan.org/getImage/orig/ppopp-acmart-sigplanproc-template.tex) . This template ensures that there are no line numbers and headers in the margins to avoid triggering HotCRP’s format checker. Refrain from squeezing additional space by tweaking the template above, e.g., by manipulating vertical space, reducing margins, line spacing, heading space, column separation, etc. Ensure that caption fonts are at least 9 pt and all fonts in figures and tables are at least 8 pt. Program chairs will inspect submissions using format checking tools and reserve the right to reject submissions that violate the formatting rules. If you would like to use Word or other Latex template, please ensure that your submission follows all the formatting guidelines. You may want to consult the official ACM information on the Master Article Template and related tools.
*   Papers should contain a maximum of 10 pages of text and figures, but NOT INCLUDING references. There is no page limit for references, and they must include the names of all authors (not et al.) and spell out the publication year and venue (and not simply point to the doi link). Appendices are not allowed, but the authors may submit supplementary material, such as proofs or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.
*   Submission is double-blind, and authors will need to identify any potential conflicts of interest with PC and Extended Review Committee members, as defined here: [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/) (ACM SIGPLAN policy).
*   To facilitate fair and unbiased reviews for all submissions, PPoPP 2026 may utilize the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) to assign papers to reviewers. From the authors’ perspective, this decision means that the submissions may be uploaded to TPMS.
*   Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. Papers that exceed the length requirement, which deviate from the expected format, or that are submitted late will be rejected.
*   All submissions that are not accepted for regular presentations will be automatically considered for posters. Two-page summaries of accepted posters will be included in the conference proceedings.
*   To allow reproducibility, we encourage authors of accepted papers to submit their papers for Artifact Evaluation (AE). The AE process begins after the acceptance notification and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact evaluation is voluntary and will not affect paper acceptance but will be taken into consideration when selecting papers for awards. Papers that go through the AE process successfully will receive at least one ACM reproducibility badge, printed on the published version.
*   Deadlines expire at midnight anywhere on Earth.

## Important Dates:

*   **Full paper submission:** Monday, September 1st, 2025
*   **Author response period:** October 27 - 29, 2025 (Mon - Wed)
*   **Author notification:** Monday, November 10th, 2025
*   **Artifact submission to AE committee:** Monday, November 17th, 2025
*   **Artifact notification by AE committee:** Monday, January 5th, 2026
*   **Final paper due:** Friday, January 9, 2026 (TBC)

### Instructions to authors

Accepted papers are planned to be published in Springer’s LNCS series. 

Submissions must not exceed **30 pages**, excluding appendices and references, and must be in a single column format in 10pt fonts using the default llncs class without adjustments. Additional material (datasets, code, long machine proofs, etc.) can be submitted as separate file. Reviewers are not required to read appendices and additional material, and submissions are expected to be intelligible and complete without them.

If the submission is accepted, the length of the final version is at most **35 pages** including references and appendices, in the llncs class format. The additional material will not be part of the conference proceedings. 

Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published in a journal or a conference/workshop with proceedings, or has submitted/is planning to submit before the author notification deadline to a journal or other conferences/ workshops that have proceedings.

The review process is single-blinded. The submission should begin with a title, the authors' names and affiliations, a short abstract, and a list of key words. Its introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Submissions ignoring these guidelines may be rejected without further consideration.

All papers must be submitted with a meaningful abstract by the initial submission deadline. This is a firm deadline. Papers not registered by this deadline will not be considered. Authors may update or withdraw their submission at any time between the initial and final submission deadline.

Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
