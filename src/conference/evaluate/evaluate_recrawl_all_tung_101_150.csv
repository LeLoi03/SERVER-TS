Sponsored by **USENIX**, the Advanced Computing Systems Association.

The **2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference** will be co-located with the 19th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI '25) and take place on **July 7–9, 2025**, at the **Sheraton Boston in Boston, MA, USA**.

## Overview

USENIX ATC '25 seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. We are interested in systems of all scales, from small embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds. The scope of USENIX ATC covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including but not limited to: operating systems; runtime systems; parallel and distributed systems; storage; networking; security and privacy; virtualization; software-hardware interactions; performance evaluation and workload characterization; reliability, availability, and scalability; energy and power management; and bug-finding, tracing, analyzing, and troubleshooting.

We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches.

## Submission Requirements

*   Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum, including journals, conferences, and workshops with proceedings.
*   Papers will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity.
*   **USENIX ATC '25 will employ double-blind reviewing.** Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   Papers need to be registered and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract at the time of the abstract registration deadline will be rejected.
*   There will be an optional artifact evaluation process for accepted papers.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract registrations due:** Tuesday, January 7, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Submissions due:** Tuesday, January 14, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Authors' response period:** Monday, April 7–Wednesday, April 9, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Notification to authors:** Friday, April 25, 2025
*   **Final papers due:** Tuesday, June 3, 2025

## Submission Type: Full vs. Short

USENIX ATC '25 accepts both **full and short submissions**.

*   **Full submissions:** must not exceed **12 pages**, excluding references and appendices.
*   **Short submissions:** must not exceed **6 pages**, excluding references and appendices.

In both cases, the page limit excludes references and appendices but includes all text, figures, tables, footnotes, etc. Both types are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in scope. A short paper presents a complete idea that is properly evaluated, just like in a full-length submission.

Optionally, authors can include an appendix to provide material that may be of interest to some reviewers, such as algorithm details, proofs, and code snippets, but is not central to the contributions of the paper.

## Deployed Systems Track

USENIX ATC '25 solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with **real-world deployment of systems and networks**. Papers for the deployed systems track need not present new ideas or results to be accepted but should convey practical insights. Note that the rules regarding submission and anonymization are different for deployed systems track papers.

## Generative AI Policy

Authors must not submit papers containing sections generated entirely by generative AI. Authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper does not include sections completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP.

It will be held on February 24, 2025, in San Diego, California, co-located with the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium (NDSS) 2025. The call for papers is currently closed.","# Call for Papers: Symposium on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) 2025

The call for papers is now closed.

The Symposium on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) invites submissions on all aspects of human factors and usability in the context of security and privacy. USEC '25 aims to bring together researchers already engaged in this interdisciplinary effort with other researchers in relevant areas. We encourage economics, HCI, AI, theoretical computer science, cryptography, psychology, and business studies researchers and practitioners to submit original research in this area. We particularly encourage collaborative research from authors in multiple fields.

To honor significant contributions that have had a lasting impact on the field, USEC ’25 will also feature a Test of Time Award. This award will celebrate research demonstrating enduring relevance and influence in usable security and privacy over the past 14 years of USEC. We will invite nominations for this award from the Organizing Committee, Program Committee, and authors submitting their works to USEC ’25. This recognition will honor research that continues to shape and inspire current and future investigations in the discipline.

## Submission Guidelines for Papers

*   All submissions must be original work; authors must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors.
*   All papers should be written in English.
*   We will review longer papers on mature/completed work in a research track, as well as shorter papers on work in progress, or work that has yet to begin, in a vision track. We aim to provide a venue for researchers at all stages of their careers and at all stages of their projects.
*   The text must be in Times font, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line spacing. Use the [templates for NDSS Symposium and co-located events](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2025/submissions/templates/).

### Research Track

The research track is intended to report on mature work that has been completed. The goal of the USEC’s research track is to disseminate results of interest to the broader usable security and privacy community. Papers must not be more than **12 pages** in length using the two-column submission format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. Try to scale the length of the paper according to the contributions you describe therein.

Authors have the option to attach to their paper‘s supplementary appendices with study materials (e.g., survey instruments, interview guides, etc.) that would not otherwise take up valuable space within the body of the paper. Reviewers are not required to read appendices, so your paper should be self-contained without them.

### Meta-Science Track

The Meta-Science Track is intended to report on mature work and seeks to disseminate results that contribute to the broader understanding and improvement of research practices, including the replicability of studies and the systematization of existing knowledge. Submissions in this track may include comprehensive evaluations of research methodologies, studies that replicate and verify prior findings, meta-analyses that synthesize existing literature, and SoK papers that systematically organize and analyze research in a specific domain. Papers must not exceed **12 pages** in length using the two-column submission format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. Authors are encouraged to scale the length of their paper according to the contributions they describe therein. Additionally, authors have the option to attach supplementary appendices with materials such as study protocols, datasets, or detailed methodological descriptions that would not otherwise take up valuable space within the body of the paper. However, reviewers are not required to read these appendices, so the main paper should be self-contained without them.

### Vision Track

The vision track is intended to report on work in progress or concrete ideas for work that has yet to begin. The focus of the vision track is to spark discussion with the goal of providing the authors helpful feedback, pointers to potentially related investigations, and new ideas to explore. Suitable submissions to the vision track include traditional work-in-progress pieces such as preliminary results of pre-studies but also research proposals and position papers outlining future research. Papers must be up to **5 pages** in length using the two-column format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices.

## Submission Portal

[https://usec25.hotcrp.com/](https://usec25.hotcrp.com/)

## Reviewing

Reviewing will be **double-blind**. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper. Authors’ prior work should be preferably referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded. Submissions that violate these requirements will be rejected without review. The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.

## Areas of Interest

Topics include, but are not limited to:

*   Innovative security or privacy functionality and design
*   New applications of existing models or technology
*   Usability evaluations of new or existing security or privacy features and lessons learned
*   Security testing of new or existing usability features
*   Psychological, sociological, and economic aspects of security and privacy
*   Research and design methodologies for human-centric security and privacy research
*   Reports of replicating previously published studies and experiments
*   Reports of failed usable privacy/security studies or experiments, with the focus on the lessons learned from such experience
*   Systematization of Knowledge
*   Inclusive security and privacy
*   Ethics in human-centric security and privacy research
*   Workforce, labels, cyber-physical systems
*   Usability in smart manufacturing

All submissions must clearly relate to the human aspects of security or privacy. Papers on security or privacy that do not address usability or human factors will not be considered. Likewise, papers on usability or human factors that do not address security or privacy will not be considered. The determination of whether a paper is within scope will be solely at the discretion of the program committee chairs.

For accepted papers, at least one author must attend USEC 2025 and present their paper.

## Important Dates

*   **Submission Deadline:** 25 November 2024, 11:59 pm, Anywhere-on-earth (AOE)
*   **Reviews Due:** 16 December 2024
*   **Discussion Period:** 16-19 December 2024
*   **Notification of Acceptance:** 20 December 2024
*   **Camera Ready Deadline:** 28 January 2025
*   **Workshop Date:** 24 February 2025

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors and Program Committee members are required to indicate any conflict of interest and its nature. Advisors and those that they are advising, as well as authors and PC members with an institutional relationship are considered to share a conflict of interest. Professional collaborations (irrespective of whether they resulted in publication or funding) that occurred in the past 2 years and close personal relationships equally constitute a conflict of interest. PC members, including chairs, that have a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper.",thiếu Discussion Period

*   Omit your names and institutions.
*   Refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others.
*   Omit the acknowledgments.

Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). Authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. For more details, see the FAQ: [https://2025.splashcon.org/track/OOPSLA#faq](https://2025.splashcon.org/track/OOPSLA#faq).

## Overview

The annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) is a systems-oriented conference, complementary in its mission to the mainstream database conferences like SIGMOD and VLDB, emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR gathers researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss the latest innovative and visionary ideas in the field.

We invite contributions on novel approaches to data management systems, architecture, and usage including cloud based systems for data processing as well as related system issues such as data storage, networking, hardware acceleration, custom processors, memory hierarchies, processor interconnects, etc. in the context of data processing. We also encourage new approaches to data management and system building based on or in support of ML/AI technologies. CIDR encourages contributions about innovative and risky data management system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insights, resourceful experimental studies, and provocative position statements. CIDR especially values innovation, experience-based insight, and vision.

## Contribution Types

CIDR 2026 invites two kinds of contributions:

*   **Papers** (at most 6 pages). We invite both regular research papers and more visionary papers that promote interesting ideas and ongoing work.
*   **Demos** (a video or a description of the demo in at most 6 pages).

To encourage authors to submit only their best work, each person can be an author or co-author of at most one submission of any kind. Authors who feel their work is best captured through a demo should submit a demo proposal. Demos and papers will be interweaved in a single-tracked program.

## Review Process

The review process will have two cycles under the single submission deadline.

### Review Cycle I (Submission to Initial Notification)

Submissions will be assigned to two members of the ISMAR 2025 International Program Committee (IPC). Submissions that violate the submission guidelines will be desk rejected. Those not desk rejected will receive at least three full reviews.

Based on the reviews and initial discussions, the Program Chairs will make one of the following initial recommendations:

*   **Revise and Resubmit:** These submissions will go through the second review cycle. Note that this does not guarantee acceptance.
*   **Reject:** Authors of rejected submissions will be able to resubmit to the poster track.

### Review Cycle II (Revision with Rebuttal to Final Decision)

Authors will have time to revise their submissions and write a rebuttal. The revised submission and rebuttal will be reviewed by the original reviewers. Based on these reviews, a final recommendation (journal, conference, poster, or rejection) will be made by the committee. Minor revisions may be required before final acceptance of camera-ready versions.

### Abstract Submission

*   All full papers **must** submit an abstract and basic details about the paper a week before the paper submission deadline. Papers that did not submit the abstract on time will not be accepted.
*   The abstract, title, and author information submitted at the abstract deadline must be complete. Submissions with placeholder or incomplete information will be deleted.

### Format and Submission

*   **Length:** Full papers are up to **eight (8) camera-ready pages**, including figures, but **excluding references**. Submissions longer than eight pages of content (excluding references) will be desk-rejected.
*   **Review Model:** HRI has a rigorous, **two-stage review model** with expert program committee discussion.
*   **Format:** All papers must be submitted in **PDF format** and conform to IEEE Proceedings specifications.
*   **Templates:** Templates are available via [IEEE Proceedings specifications](https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2026/full-papers/) and [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-conference-proceedings-template/yrsqvztpwvwx).

### Tracks

Authors must choose a track (and optionally a second choice) during abstract submission. The Program Committee may suggest a track change.

1.  **Theory and Methods:** Focuses on conceptual foundations, new ways of thinking about HRI, and advancing research methodologies. Contributions may include meta-analyses, theoretical arguments, new interpretations of results, or novel evaluation methodologies. Theory papers are not expected to have user studies. Methods for generating design belong in the Design track; methods for measuring or studying HRI belong in Theory and Methods.
2.  **Design:** Focuses on design-centric research, including novel design approaches, robot morphologies, behavior paradigms, interaction techniques, and contexts. This track welcomes papers on design solutions with rigorous detail, design-driven methodologies, and the design process itself. Evaluations are typically end-user evaluations or critical reflections on the design process.
3.  **Technical:** Primary contribution is a novel algorithm, mathematical model, tool, hardware element, or human-robot interface, with sufficient detail for reproducibility. Rigor, robustness, and appropriate evaluations (which may include user studies if appropriate, but not required) are expected. Papers may include proofs of correctness, demonstrations, simulations, or technical performance evaluations. A ""pathway to deployment"" description is required if no physical robot demonstration is included.
4.  **Systems:** Focuses on contributions that synthesize underlying techniques and/or technologies to achieve system-level HRI behavior. The contribution is best observed through the performance of an integrated system. This can involve novel system design or integration of novel techniques/components. Authors should emphasize novelty, significance, and wider systems knowledge applicable to future HRI problems.
5.  **User Studies:** Welcomes submissions providing new knowledge about human-robot interactions based on studies involving people (laboratory or field studies, ethnographic work, replication studies, industry case studies). Studies may involve autonomous robots, Wizard of Oz methods, or no physical robot. The primary knowledge contribution is expected to be from the study itself.

#### Subthemes (for User Studies Track)

*   **Interpersonal Constructs:** Emotional, social, behavioral, and interpersonal aspects of HRI.
*   **Special Populations:** Robots supporting learning, therapy, care, or personal growth across the lifespan.
*   **Teams, Collaboration & Communication:** Task-based interaction and teamwork with robots.
*   **None:** If no subtheme is appropriate.

## ACM Open Access Publishing Model

*   Starting January 1, 2026, all ACM publications will be 100% Open Access.
*   Authors can publish via the **ACM Open institutional model** (supported by over 1,800 institutions, meaning most papers won't require APCs) or by paying **Article Processing Charges (APCs)**.
*   **Temporary Subsidy for 2026:** To ease the transition, ACM offers a subsidized APC: **$250 for ACM/SIG members** and **$350 for non-members**.
*   Authors are encouraged to advocate for their institutions to join ACM Open.

## ACM Publication Policies

Authors must adhere to all ACM Publications Policies, including the **new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects** and the **ACM Policy on Authorship**.

## Accessibility

Accessibility requirements will be provided soon.

*   See [anonymization guidelines](https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2025/anonymization/) (coming soon).

## Supplementary Materials

Authors may upload up to three supplemental files (videos, appendices, artifacts). These materials must also be properly anonymized.

*   **Video Guidelines:** 1-minute video (up to 100 MB), MPG, MPEG, or MP4 formats. Videos may be used for Demo Fast Track consideration.
*   **Artifact Guidelines:** Encourages novel artifacts (software, hardware, data sets, etc.) for reproducibility. Include a detailed description, novelty information, anonymized link, and a clearance file.
*   **Appendix Guidelines:** For supplementary materials that would interrupt the text flow. Cannot be used to circumvent page limits. Appended material must not contain new experimental analysis or results.

## Studies with Human Participants

*   Submissions involving human participants must clearly outline their methodology (participant demographics, data collection/analysis, study environment, robot/wizard description if applicable).
*   **Ethical Approval Statement:** A statement of IRB/ethics committee approval is required. If no approval was obtained, an explanation of compliance with ethical principles must be provided. Consent from legal carers/parents is required for child users, along with oral assent from minors.

## Policy on Use of ChatGPT or Similar Models

*   Text, images, or material generated from foundation models (LLMs, VLMs) must be **clearly marked** if used for purposes beyond editing author's text.
*   AI systems do not satisfy authorship criteria and cannot be used as citable sources.
*   Authors are responsible for content, plagiarism, and veracity.

## Interdisciplinary Research Assessment

The interdisciplinary nature of a paper will be a significant factor in acceptance. Authors will be asked to identify and justify the core disciplines their paper contributes to. Papers with a single specified discipline are less likely to be accepted.

## Resubmissions

Authors resubmitting work must describe changes in a separate note. Papers rejected from ASPLOS cycles cannot be resubmitted to the immediately subsequent two cycles.

## Limit on Submissions

Authors are limited to 5 submissions per submission cycle.

## Major Revisions

Some submissions may receive a ""Major Revision"" decision, allowing authors to resubmit after addressing specific reviewer feedback. Revised submissions can have up to 13 pages.

## Anonymization

ASPLOS employs a double-blind review process. Authors must anonymize their submissions by avoiding self-identification or institutional affiliation in submitted documents, including metadata. References to one's own work should be anonymized.

## Supplemental Material and Appendixes

Supplemental material and appendixes may be submitted with no page limit, but reviewers are not required to read them.

## Declaring Conflicts of Interest

Authors must register all conflicts (people and institutions) in their HotCRP submission page. Failure to declare conflicts may lead to summary rejection.

## Originality and Concurrent Submissions

Manuscripts must be original and not under review elsewhere. Posting on public repositories like arxiv.org is not considered prior publication. Violation of these conditions will lead to rejection.

## Ethical Obligations

Authors must not break anonymity, contact reviewers inappropriately, or advertise their work during specific periods. Adherence to ACM ethics policies is required.

## Formatting and Editing

*   **File format:** PDF with numbered pages.
*   **Page limit:** 11 pages (excluding references and appendices).
*   **Paper size:** US Letter (8.5in x 11in).
*   **Margins:** 1 inch top/bottom, 0.75 inch left/right.
*   **Body:** 2-column, single-spaced, 10pt font.
*   **Template:** Use the ACM SIGPLAN acmart Latex class (`sigplan` option, `nonacm` option).
*   **Figures/Tables:** Fonts within figures and tables should be legible (preferably >= 9pt).
*   **References:** List full author names, include clickable links (preferably DOIs), and ensure hyperlinked citations.

Submissions violating formatting restrictions may be rejected without review.

## Author Response Period

Authors will have an opportunity to respond to reviews. Rebuttals should focus on correcting factual errors and addressing reviewer questions. They can optionally include new experiments if relevant.

## Accepted Papers

Accepted papers are allowed extra pages for the camera-ready version. At least one author is expected to attend and present the work. ORCID IDs are required for all authors.

## Artifact Evaluation

Artifact evaluation will continue for ASPLOS 2026.

## Poster and Lightning Sessions

Details on poster and lightning sessions will be available later.

## Wild and Crazy Ideas Session

A WACI session is tentatively planned.

## Best Paper Award

A selection of papers will receive a Best Paper Award.

## Program and Registration

Complete program and registration information will be available on the conference website.

## Confidentiality

All submissions will be treated as confidential.
