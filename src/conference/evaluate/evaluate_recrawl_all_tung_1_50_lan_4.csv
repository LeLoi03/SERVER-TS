The 47th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval will be held **in-person** from **July 14th to 18th, 2024** in **Washington D.C., USA**.

SIGIR is the major international forum for presenting new research results and demonstrating new systems and techniques in Information Retrieval (IR).

## Important Dates for Full Papers

Time zone: Anywhere on Earth (AoE)

*   **Full paper abstracts due:** January 18, 2024
*   **Full papers due:** January 25, 2024
*   **Full paper notifications:** March 25, 2024

Full paper authors are required to submit an abstract by midnight January 18, 2024 AoE. Paper submission (deadline: midnight January 25, 2024 AoE) is not possible without a submitted abstract.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Full research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including the other tracks of SIGIR 2024).
*   Submissions must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 9 pages (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any content except references) in length, with unrestricted space for references, in the current ACM two-column conference format.
*   Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf templates are available from the [ACM Website](https://www.acm.org/) (use “sigconf” proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word).
*   ACM’s CCS concepts and keywords are required for review.
*   For LaTeX, the following should be used:
    `\documentclass[sigconf,natbib=true,anonymous=true]{acmart}`
*   Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir24](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir24)
*   At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, and the author(s) or their delegate(s) must present the work at the conference in person.
*   See this [brief checklist to strengthen an IR paper](https://sigir.org/sigir2022/checklist-to-strengthen-an-ir-paper/) for authors and reviewers.

## Anonymity and Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy

The full paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information; citations or discussion of your own prior work should be written up in third person form. It is acceptable to refer to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if reviewers can not infer that the authors are currently affiliated with these organizations. You can submit to SIGIR 2024 papers that you have posted to pre-print/archival platforms (e.g. arXiv), or plan to post in the future, after submission. However, your paper must conform to the [SIGIR 2024 Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy](policy_arxiv.html). Breaking anonymity or pre-print/ArXiv policy puts the submission at risk of being desk rejected.

## Authorship Policy

Authors should carefully go through [ACM’s authorship policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) before submitting a paper. Please ensure that all authors are clearly identified in EasyChair before the submission deadline. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at abstract submission time. No changes to authorship will be permitted for the camera-ready submission under any circumstance or after the abstract submission deadline. So please, make sure you have them listed correctly at submission time.

## Desk Rejection Policy

Submissions that violate the anonymity, pre-print policy, length, or formatting requirements, or are determined to violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, author misrepresentation, falsification, etc., are subject to desk rejection by the chairs. Any of the following may result in desk rejection:

*   Figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgements, or any other content after page 9 of the submission.
*   Formatting not in line with the guidelines provided above.
*   Authors or authors’ institutional affiliations clearly named or easily discoverable.
*   Links to source code repositories that reveal author identities, or extended versions of the current paper. It is recommended to hold these for the final published version and [submit source code for artifact review](https://sigir.org/general-information/acm-sigir-artifact-badging/).
*   Change of authors after the abstract submission deadline.
*   Content that has been determined to have been copied from other sources.
*   Any form of academic fraud or dishonesty.
*   Lack of topical fit for SIGIR.

## Relevant Areas

Relevant areas include:

*   Search and Ranking
*   System, Efficiency and Scalability

ACM CCS 2025 will be held in Taipei, Taiwan from October 13-17, 2025, seeking novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy.","# ACM CCS 2025: Call for Papers

The 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice. ACM CCS 2025 will be held in **Taipei, Taiwan from October 13-17, 2025**.

## Review Cycles and Decisions

CCS has two review cycles in 2025. For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:

*   **Accept:** Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference.
*   **Minor revision:** Papers in this category are considered promising but need some minor additional work. Authors will be given the opportunity to resubmit such papers, with appropriate revisions. The revised paper will then be re-evaluated, and either accepted or rejected.
*   **Reject:** Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Papers rejected from the first review cycle may not be submitted again (even in revised form) to the second review cycle.

Authors of each accepted paper must ensure that at least one author registers for the conference, and that their paper is presented in-person at the conference if at all possible.

## Paper Submission Information

All submissions must be received by **11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12)** on the day of the corresponding deadline. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings. All submissions should be properly anonymized.

Papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review. Authors may submit up to a maximum of 7 papers for Cycle B.

Submitted papers may be rejected for being out of scope, at the discretion of the PC chairs. No modifications to the author list on a paper may be made after submission.

## Mandatory Reviewing

Authors submitting 3 papers or more may be required to submit reviews for other papers at CCS 2025. Authors failing to provide the requested information may see their paper desk-rejected.

Reviews that do not meet the standard, such as exceptionally short reviews, reviews generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), reviews not relevant to the paper or that miss a substantial portion of the paper will be flagged and may be grounds for desk rejection of the reviewer’s papers at the discretion of the PC chairs.

## Withdrawing Policy

A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper can not be withdrawn.

## Paper Format

Submissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format using `sigconf` 2-column format, no more than 12 pages long, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.

## Providing Artifacts at Submission Time

Submissions whose claimed contributions rely on artifacts are expected to make these accessible to the reviewers, unless there are good reasons not to. An anonymous link to a resource on the web is acceptable, provided the contents in the resource are also anonymized.

## Optional Artifact Evaluation

All authors of accepted papers are encouraged to submit artifacts for AE. Each artifact submitted will be reviewed by the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC); a special call for artifacts will follow.

## Conference Tracks

At the time of submission, authors must select one track, which should be the most relevant to the topic of the paper.

This is the list of tracks and their Track Chairs:

*   **Software Security:** Alexandra Dmitrienko (Würzburg University), Yinqian Zhang (Southern University of Science and Technology)
*   **Web Security:** Yinzhi Cao (Johns Hopkins University)
*   **Network Security:** Kun Sun (George Mason University)

## Paper Types

Papers submitted to CGO can be standard research papers, tools papers or practical experience papers. All must be written in the IEEE conference format (use the conference mode), and may have up to 10 pages, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 10 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. In other words, papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. 

Please be mindful of the [IEEE publishing policies](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/author-center/publishing-policies) when preparing and submitting your article.

### Tool Papers

Tool papers must give a clear account of a new tool’s functionality. They must describe the problem that the tool helps to solve, how the tool works and provide an evaluation of the tool. There does not have to be novel research in the way the tool works, but it does have to solve a novel problem or in a novel (and better) way compared to existing tools. A good tools paper will:

*   Frame the problem that the tool solves, showing that it is an important subject
*   Describe how the tool works to solve the problem
*   Evaluate the ability of the tool to solve the problem
*   Possibly provide case studies of using the tool, showing what improvements can be made now the problem has been ameliorated.

Tools paper authors should prepend their paper title with ‘Tool:’ to provide clarity that this is a tools paper during the review process (this can be removed for the final camera-ready paper).

The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper. Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.

### Practical Experience Papers

Practical experience papers should summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies. They must make it clear where the novelty in the work comes from, which could be from applying known techniques to a new system (with novel features), from finding new ways to implement existing analyses or transformations in a unique way, or from applying established schemes to draw new conclusions about them.

Practical experience paper authors should prepend their paper title with ‘Practical:’ to provide clarity that this is a practical experience paper during the review process (this can be removed for the final camera-ready paper).

Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.

## Submission Information

*   **Submission Site:** Papers can be submitted at [https://cgo26-first-round.hotcrp.com/](https://cgo26-first-round.hotcrp.com/).

## Submission Guidelines

Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements before it is submitted:

*   The paper must be original material that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal. Note that you may submit material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted proceedings.
*   Your submission is limited to ten (10) letter-size (8.5″x11″), single-spaced, double-column pages, using 10pt or larger font, not including references. There is no page limit for references. We strongly encourage the use of the IEEE Conference Template. Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be outright rejected at the discretion of the program chairs. (Please make sure your paper prints satisfactorily on letter-size (8.5″x11″) paper: this is especially important for submissions from countries where A4 paper is standard.)
*   Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 10 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.
*   Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review. Blind reviewing of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by outside referees. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper. Use care in naming your files. Source file names, e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily accessible comments. In addition, do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, if you are extending your own work, you need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if you were extending someone else’s research. We realize in doing this that for some papers it will still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the submission will not be penalized as long as a concerted effort was made to reference and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you were extending someone else’s research. 
*   Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in the paper.
*   Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass. Typically the default font sizes on the graph axes in a program like Microsoft Excel are too small.
*   Please number the pages.
*   To ease reviewing, please add line numbers to your submission. In LaTeX you can use the lineno package, with the ‘switch’ option.
*   The paper must be written in English.
*   The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it. We strongly suggest that you use only the four widely-used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. Please make sure that the output has been formatted for printing on LETTER size paper. If generating the paper using “dvips”, use the option “-P cmz -t letter”, and if that is not supported, use “-t letter”.
*   The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within one week of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings.

## Conflicts of Interest

Please read these guidelines on conflicts of interest carefully before submission.

Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected.

Please declare a conflict of interest with the following people for any author of your paper:

*   Your Ph.D. advisor(s), post-doctoral advisor(s), Ph.D. students, and post-doctoral advisees, forever.
*   Family relations by blood or marriage, or their equivalent, forever (if they might be potential reviewers).
*   People with whom you have collaborated in the last FIVE years
*   Other relationships, such as close personal friendship, that you think might tend to affect your judgment or be seen as doing so by a reasonable person familiar with the relationship.

If in doubt, please contact the PC Chairs for advice on whether a conflict exists or not.

ICCC welcomes papers on different aspects of Computational Creativity (CC), on systems that exhibit varying degrees of creative autonomy, on systems that act as creative partners for human creators, on frameworks that offer greater clarity or computational felicity for thinking about machine (and human) creativity, on methodologies for building or evaluating CC systems, on approaches to teaching CC in schools and universities or to promoting societal uptake of CC as a field and as a technology, and so on.

## Themes and Topics

Original research contributions are solicited in all areas related to Computational Creativity research and practice, including, but not limited to:

*   **Applications of Computational Creativity:** Computational applications of creativity in areas such as music, language, games, visual arts, design, architecture, entertainment, education, mathematical invention, scientific discovery, programming.
*   **Human-Machine Co-Creativity:** Systems, studies, frameworks, or methodologies related to co-creativity between humans and AI, with emphasis on systems in which the machine acts as a creative partner.
*   **Computational Creativity Evaluation:** Metrics, frameworks, formalisms, and methodologies for the evaluation of creativity in computational systems.
*   **Social Models:** Computational models of social aspects of creativity, including social creativity, the diffusion of ideas, collaboration, team dynamics, and creativity in social settings.
*   **Computational Paradigms:** Computational approaches for modeling cognitive aspects of creativity.
*   **Interdisciplinary Perspectives:** Perspectives on computational creativity which draw from philosophical and/or sociological studies in the context of creative AI systems.
*   **Data and Creativity:** Data science approaches to computational creativity.
*   **Societal Impact:** Ethical considerations in the design, deployment, or testing of creative AI systems, as well as studies that explore the societal impact of computational creativity and generative AI.
*   **Psychological Factors:** Computational models of psychological factors that enhance creativity.
*   **Provocations:** Raising new issues that bring the foundations of the discipline into question or throw new light on seemingly settled debates.

> A note on generative AI models: While the study of generative AI models is both welcomed and encouraged, such models and their application must be properly situated in the CC literature and evaluated according to acceptable practices in the field. Papers that fail to do this are unlikely to be reviewed favorably.

## Paper Types

We welcome the submission of five different types of full papers:

*   **Technical papers:** Papers posing and addressing hypotheses about aspects of creative behavior in computational systems. Strong evaluation is essential.
*   **System or Resource description papers:** Papers describing the building and deployment of a creative system or resource. Presentation of results from the system or resource is expected.
*   **Study papers:** Papers which draw on allied fields such as psychology, philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, humanities, the arts, and so on. The contribution of the paper to CC should be made clear.
*   **Cultural application papers:** Papers presenting the use of creative software in a cultural setting. The emphasis here is on a clear description of the role of the system in the given context.
*   **Position papers:** Papers presenting an opinion on some aspect of the culture of CC research. The emphasis here is on carefully arguing a position.

Evaluation is expected in Technical papers (strong evaluation) and in System or Resource description papers. Although evaluation is not required in other types of papers, the contribution of the paper to CC should be made clear.

## Review Process

All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process.

The initial decision for the submission may be Accept, Reject or Shepherd. Papers that are recommended for shepherding will have to address the comments from the reviewers, and submit a revised article along with a summary of changes. The revised manuscript will be reviewed by the shepherd and the final decision will be communicated.

## No Show Policy

At least one author of each paper must be registered for the conference in order for the paper to be published in the proceedings. Presentation of an accepted paper is a requirement for publication in the proceedings. Any paper not meeting requirements will not be included in the conference proceedings under IEEE Xplore.

## Use of AI-assisted text

HiPC will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. The authors should verify whether the results are accurate before submission.

As required by IEEE, the use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.

## ArXiv Submission Policy

Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to HiPC 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work.

## Instructions for Authors

Submissions must be original work and may not be under submission to another journal or conference with proceedings at the time of review. Submissions must be in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) style, with the default margins and fonts, but with the addition of page numbers (e.g., by adding `\pagestyle{plain}`). They are limited to **16 pages** excluding bibliography and appendices, and to **20 pages** including bibliography and appendices. Optionally, any amount of clearly marked supplementary material may be supplied, following the main body of the paper, but reviewers are not required to read this supplementary material and submissions are expected to be intelligible and complete without it.

Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their LaTeX proceedings template. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. Submitted papers must be in PDF format and submitted electronically via the [ISC 2024 submission system (HotCRP)](https://isc24.hotcrp.com/). The submission must be anonymous with no author names, affiliations, or obvious references.

For papers that are accepted, the corresponding author must complete and sign a **Consent-to-Publish form**, through which the copyright for their paper is transferred to Springer. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made. Moreover, authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference.",đã có link 2025: https://isc25.skku.edu/

ATVA 2025 is the 23rd in a series of symposia aimed at bringing together academics, industrial researchers and practitioners in the area of theoretical and practical aspects of automated analysis, synthesis, and verification of hardware and software systems. ATVA solicits high quality submissions.

## Topics of Interest

*   Formalisms for modeling hardware, software and embedded systems
*   Specification and verification of finite-state, infinite-state and parameterized systems
*   Program analysis and software verification
*   Analysis and verification of hardware circuits, systems-on-chip and embedded systems
*   Analysis of real-time, hybrid, priced, weighted and probabilistic systems

## Submission Categories

ATVA welcomes submissions in the following two categories:

*   **Regular research papers** (18 pages, excluding references, must be anonymized)
*   **Tool papers** (10 pages, excluding references, not anonymized)

Submissions in both categories must be in Springer’s LNCS format. Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting can be found at the Springer website [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs). Adding line numbers (LaTeX package lineno) is highly recommended. Submissions authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed and encouraged.

An artifact evaluation will be undertaken, which will be optional for regular papers and mandatory for tool papers.

Papers must be submitted through EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atva2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atva2025) Accepted papers in both categories will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A few outstanding papers will be selected for a distinguished paper award. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference.

### Regular Papers

Regular papers should not exceed 18 pages in Springer’s LNCS format, not counting references and appendices. Additional material may be placed in an appendix, to be read at the discretion of the reviewers, and to be omitted in the final version.

Regular papers at ATVA 2025 will follow a full double-blind review process, which means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, the reference should be made in the third person. These are firm submission requirements, and any regular paper that does not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Authors of accepted regular papers will be invited (but are not required) to submit a relevant artifact for evaluation by the artifact evaluation committee. The submission deadline for this artifact evaluation will be soon after the paper acceptance notification.

Independent of the artifact evaluation process, research paper authors are encouraged to include a URL to a repository in their original submission, if such a repository is available and is pertinent to the paper. This repository could contain code, datasets, results, etc. This would be for the consideration of the PC reviewers of the submission, at their discretion. If such a URL is included in the submission, the contents of the repository should adhere to the guidelines of a double blind review process.

### Tool Papers

Tool papers should not exceed 10 pages in Springer’s LNCS format, not counting references. Tool papers will follow a single-blind review process. They do NOT need to be anonymized.

Each tool paper submission must be followed by a separate artifact submission via EasyChair. Please see the Artifact Evaluation track instructions in the conference web site for more information. Papers describing tools that have already been presented (in any conference) will be accepted only if significant and clear enhancements to the tool are reported and implemented.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are AoE (UTC-12h).

The IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the field of real-time systems, where researchers and practitioners showcase innovations covering all aspects of real-time systems, including theory, design, analysis, implementation, verification, evaluation, and experience.

RTSS 2025, the 46th edition of the event, will be held in **Boston, MA, USA, from December 2–5, 2025**.

## Scope

RTSS’25 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems theory and practice. RTSS is an expansive and inclusive event, continuing the tradition of embracing new and emerging areas of real-time systems research.

To be in scope, **ALL submissions must explicitly address some form of real-time requirements / constraints.**

Common examples of real-time requirements include (but are not limited to) deadlines, response-time bounds, thresholds on acceptable tail latencies as commonly found in service level agreements (SLAs), as well as statistical and stochastic notions of timeliness.

## Tracks

Manuscripts may be submitted to either:

*   **Track 1: Real-Time Systems and Foundations:** Focuses on the practical and theoretical foundations that enable predictable timing in computing systems. Including core real-time operating systems components, schedulability analysis and scheduling algorithms, theoretical foundations of real-time systems, and verification methods.
*   **Track 2: Design and Applications:** Focuses on real-time systems in a broader systems context, particularly emphasizing novel research on designs, implementations, and applications where real-time requirements are an integral part of a larger system or objective. This includes Cyber-Physical Systems, HW-SW integration and system-level design, and Internet of Things (IoT).

### Track 1: Real-Time Systems and Foundations

*   Practical and Theoretical Foundations of Real-Time Systems
*   Artificial Intelligence for Real-Time Systems Foundations

### Track 2: Design and Applications

*   Cyber-Physical Systems
*   Real-Time System Design for Artificial Intelligence
*   HW-SW Integration and System-Level Design
*   Internet of Things (IoT)

## Submissions

*   Empirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field is also welcome.
*   (Note that literature surveys that solely classify, review, and summarize existing research papers are not considered empirical research and are not in scope of the conference.)
*   Authors are invited to submit supplemental research artifacts such as source code, mechanized proofs, data sets, formal models, short demo videos, etc. alongside their manuscripts.

## Proceedings and Awards

*   All accepted papers will appear in the main program and proceedings (provided they are presented at the conference).
*   A selection of papers will receive recognition as outstanding papers and will be highlighted as such in the proceedings.
*   Best paper and best student paper awards will be presented at the conference, along with an award for the best presentation. (Note that submissions are eligible for the best student paper award provided that the first author is a student as of the submission deadline.)

## Important Dates

*   **Submission Deadline (firm):** May 22, 2025 (anywhere on Earth)
*   **Author Response Period:** July 14-17, 2025
*   **Author Notification:** July 25, 2025
*   **Camera-Ready Deadline (tentative):** September 16, 2025
*   **Conference:** December 2–5, 2025

## Remote Participation

*   RTSS’25 is an in-person conference (i.e., it is not a hybrid conference), but exceptions can be made for authors on a case-by-case basis according to the following TCRTS guidance:

>   In-person presentations are expected. However, if an author has a valid reason why neither they nor their co-authors can attend the conference in person, then exceptions can potentially be made at the discretion of the Program Chair. Authors who know in advance that this will apply to them, for example because they cannot get a visa for the host country, should contact the Program Chair prior to paper submission.

*   Following existing TCRTS policy, one author will be required to register for the conference at the “in-person” rate (either student or full) in any case.

*   Please contact the track chairs by email via [rtss25-track-chairs@mpi-sws.org](mailto:rtss25-track-chairs@mpi-sws.org) if you would like to inquire about a possible exception or in case of any questions.",

## Double-Blind Reviewing

PPoPP 2025 will employ a double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this process, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission and ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person.

## Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS)

To facilitate fair and unbiased reviews for all submissions, PPoPP 2025 may utilize the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) to assign papers to reviewers. From the authors’ perspective, this decision means that the submissions may be uploaded to the TPMS.

## Artifact Evaluation

To allow reproducibility, authors of accepted papers are encouraged to submit their papers for Artifact Evaluation (AE). More information will be posted on the AE website.

The 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE’25) will take place in **Valencia, Spain, from September 1-5, 2025**.

## Overview

The RE 2025 Research Track welcomes original papers focusing on traditional RE topics such as requirements elicitation, analysis, prioritisation, documentation, validation, evolution, and maintenance. It also highly encourages papers covering novel areas at the boundary of RE and other disciplines, including, but not limited to, software engineering/computer science at large, mechanical/electronic/civil and other engineering, business, social science, psychology, anthropology, and the humanities.

This year’s theme is **“Future-proofing Requirements Engineering”**, which focuses on innovating requirements engineering by embracing AI, DevOps, sustainability, security, personalization, and agile practices. It aims to equip professionals with the tools and methodologies needed to address the evolving challenges and opportunities in software development, ensuring robust, user-centric, and adaptable systems.

## Categories of Research Papers

The RE 2025 Research Track invites original submissions of research papers in two categories:

*   **Solution-focused Papers:** Present novel or significantly improved solutions for requirements-related problems, including new approaches, theories, tools, modeling languages, infrastructures, or other technologies. These papers are evaluated based on the significance of the problem addressed, novelty of the solution, clarity, technical soundness, and evidence of its benefits. A preliminary evaluation is expected.
*   **Evaluation-focused Papers:** Empirically assess phenomena, theories, or real-world artefacts (e.g., methods, techniques, or tools) relevant to requirements engineering. These papers apply empirical software engineering approaches (e.g., experiments, case studies, surveys) to report qualitative and/or quantitative data and results. The evaluation criteria focus on the soundness of the research questions, the appropriateness of the study design, data analysis, and threats to validity. Replication studies are welcome.

## Open Science Policy

The RE 2025 Research Track has an open science policy, supporting open data and open source principles. Authors are encouraged to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability. Sharing research data is not mandatory, but non-sharing needs to be justified.

## Submission

*   Submit your paper via the [RE’25 EasyChair system](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=re25).
*   Select the “Research Papers (Main Track)” option.
*   Abstracts should describe explicit coverage of context, objectives, methods, and results and conclusions, and should not exceed 200 words.
*   Papers must not exceed **10 pages** for the main body and up to **2 additional pages** for the references.
*   Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the [IEEE formatting instructions](https://conf.researchr.org/track/RE-2025/RE-2025-Research-Papers#Formatting-Instructions).

SafeComp, established in 1979 by the European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems, Technical Committee 7 on Reliability, Safety and Security (EWICS TC7), is an annual international conference covering the state-of-the-art, experience, and new trends in the areas of safety, security, and reliability of critical computer applications.

The 44th edition of SafeComp provides a unique occasion to explore and debate hot topics of current challenges and solutions for future safety critical systems.

## Theme

Managing safety in an era of a software defined computing continuum

Future societal and industrial systems will be increasingly relying on a digitalized infrastructure, from embedded systems, fog/edge-computing systems, to cloud and communications. Entire systems will also increasingly be software defined and upgradeable. Societal and industrial systems consequently be increasingly relying on such digitalized infrastructures, requiring an even stronger and proactive emphasis on key dependability properties, as emphasized by the SafeComp conferences. The theme for SafeComp 2025 has been chosen to highlight some of the following topics and challenges:

*   Predictability and reliability of cloud and edge computing, and AI components: The corresponding systems yet have to offer dependability properties suitable for critical systems
*   Architectures ensuring safety while enhancing performance
*   Co-design of applications and digital infrastructure to achieve cost-efficient dependability
*   Trustworthy DevOps – reconciling software and safety practices

## Paper Submission Guidelines

The tradition of SAFECOMP is to act as a platform for bringing academic research and industrial needs together. Therefore, industrial contributions and real-world experience reports are explicitly invited. We solicit two types of paper submission (in both cases, up to 14 pages incl. bibliography):

*   Research papers address a research gap and illustrate how the contribution submitted can help improve the state-of-the-art by advancing current knowledge.
*   Practical experience reports / tool descriptions provide new insights and valuable support to practitioners.

Papers exceeding the page limit will be excluded from the review process. All papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the International Programme Committee. Papers must not have been previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere.

All paper submissions must be formatted according to the LNCS templates provided by Springer. Abstracts and papers should be submitted in pdf through Easychair.

Based on the reviews, the Program Chairs will make one of the following initial recommendations for each submission:

*   Conditionally accept as IEEE TVCG paper.
*   Conditionally accept as conference paper.
*   Recommend as a two-page poster.
*   Reject.

**Review Cycle II (Initial notification to Final decision):**

The revision of each conditionally accepted paper will be reviewed by its coordinator, who will make a final recommendation regarding acceptance. Should the conditions for acceptance not be met, the paper will be rejected.

## Ethics and Responsibility

All submissions describing research experiments with human participants must follow the appropriate ethical guidelines required by the authors’ institution(s), and authors are required to secure and report their approval by the relevant ethics committee prior to collecting data. An approval by any ethical review board, if required by your institution, needs to be indicated via the submission system.

## Participant Diversity

To support high-quality research, all submissions describing research with human participants should strive for participant diversity. All submissions must report participant demographics (gender, age, etc.).

## Review Duties for Authors

For each submitted paper, one author will be required to register to review up to three papers through PCS at the time of submission.

## Additional Guidelines

*   All accepted submissions must be presented orally at the conference. An in-person presentation is expected, and online presentations will be accommodated only in exceptional cases.
*   All paper submissions must be in English.
*   Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously published.
*   Submissions will be checked for plagiarism using IEEE Crosscheck. Detection of significant plagiarism will lead to rejection.
*   The use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section.
*   Uploading the submitted manuscript to an online repository (e.g., arXiv) before the end of the review process does not constitute a reason for rejecting the manuscript. However, the authors should be advised that doing so can compromise the anonymity of their manuscript and therefore bias its double-blind review.

## Submission Guidelines

*   All submissions must be written in English.
*   Papers should be submitted electronically, in a PDF format, through the EasyChair submission system: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2025), by selecting the “UMAP25 Full and Short Papers” track.

### Format

We encourage two types of submissions in the ACM two-column format:

*   **Long papers** (8 pages at most plus additional pages for references): report on substantial contributions of lasting value.
*   **Short papers** (4 pages at most plus additional pages for references): discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper.

We recommend that supplementary material is linked to an external source using an anonymized link.

### Anonymity

Submissions must be anonymous, given that ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from submissions and avoid obvious identifying statements. Failure to anonymize your submission could result in desk rejection.

### Templates

Following the ACM Publication Workflow, all authors should submit manuscripts for review in the ACM double-column format.

*   LaTeX: Please use the latest version of the Primary Article Template – LaTeX.
*   Overleaf: (use \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart} for double-column).
*   Word: Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for preparing your article with Microsoft Word, ignoring the single-column instructions and the single-column submission template. Please use the double-column Word template.

### Accessibility

Authors are strongly encouraged to provide “alt text” (alternative text) for floats (images, tables, etc.) in their content.

### Submission Policy

ACM UMAP has a no dual submission policy.

## Review Process

ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from their submissions. Reviewers will evaluate papers based on their significance, originality, rigor, and contribution to the field. Papers that are out of scope, incomplete, or lack sufficient evidence to support the basic claims, may be rejected without full review. Furthermore, reviewers will be asked to comment on whether the length is appropriate for the contribution. In addition, ACM UMAP 2025 will introduce a new rebuttal stage during evaluation.

The ACM Code of Ethics gives the ACM UMAP program committee the right to (desk-)reject papers that perpetuate harmful stereotypes, employ unethical research practices, or uncritically present outcomes/implications that disadvantage minority communities.

## Registration and Presentation Policy

Each accepted paper must be accompanied by a distinct full author registration, completed by the early registration date cut-off.

Each accepted paper must be presented in person to be included in the conference proceedings, published by ACM, and available via the ACM Digital Library.

## Camera-ready Submission

Accepted papers will be subject to further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. We strongly recommend the usage of LaTeX/Overleaf for the camera-ready papers to minimize the extent of reformatting.

## Ethical & Human Subjects Considerations

ACM UMAP expects papers to include a discussion of the ethical considerations, as well as the impact of the presented work and/or its intended application, where appropriate.

### Submission Information

*   **Submission Platform:** All required materials must be submitted electronically to PCS by the abstract and paper deadline. In PCS, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select “SIGCHI”, “UIST 2025” and “UIST 2025 Papers”, respectively, and press “Go.” This track will be opened a few weeks before the submission deadline.
*   **Submission Format and Length:**
    *   Required Paper PDF and source files
    *   We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow.
    *   For LaTeX authors, submissions are strongly recommended to be in the double-column format ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) using \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}. (please use the downloadable LaTex template or the Overleaf template).
    *   For Word authors, submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) or the single-column template ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.pdf) ).
    *   UIST papers are of variable length. Paper length must be based on the weight of the contribution. A new idea presented in a compact format is more likely to be accepted than the same idea in a long format, and shorter, more focused papers are encouraged. As a guideline, consider
        *   Short Papers being submissions of 5,000 words or less.
        *   Standard Length Papers being submissions between 5,000 and 12,000 words are considered standard length (about 7,000-8,000 words on average).
    *   References and appendices are excluded from the word count.
    *   Size: < 20 MB (compressed PDF files are encouraged during submission)
    *   Please make appendices as separate PDF files and upload them as supplementary materials instead of including them as a subsection at the end of the original paper manuscript.
*   **Accompanying Video:**
    *   Optional, but highly encouraged
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   No more than 5 minutes long
    *   Size: < 250 MB
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
*   **Maximum File Size:** Maximum total size for all files < 300 MB
*   **Anonymity:** Anonymous, i.e. authors must remove their names and affiliations throughout all submission materials (paper, videos, supplementary material) ( [anonymity policy](https://uist.acm.org/2025/author-guide/#anonymity) )
    *   Discuss your own prior work in 3rd person and include a full reference with names.
*   **Selection Process:** Refereed, i.e. the program committee and two external reviewers will review submitted papers
*   **Publication:** Archival, i.e. accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed in digital form to conference attendees
*   **Quick rejection / Desk rejection policy**
    *   Papers, where the length is incommensurate with contribution or the stated length of the submission (i.e., short paper vs. standard length papers), will be desk rejected. Submissions of more than 5,000 words for short papers or 12,000 words for standard papers will be desk rejected if their length is not justified. In very exceptional cases, such submissions may be considered for full review, but authors must provide clear and strong justification for why submissions are required to be longer than the word limit.
*   **Anonymization Policy.** Authors are expected to anonymize their identities in the body of the paper but leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. Authors are required to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], …” and use instead “As described by Chetty et al. [10], …”. Papers that violate the anonymization policy by explicitly and unequivocally identifying the authors (i.e., beyond allowing the reviewers to simply ""guess""), including within the supplemental materials or external links to datasets, code repositories, etc., will be desk rejected. Any supplementary material (including the video) should also adhere to the anonymity rule.
*   Your submission must be original; it cannot be published or under concurrent review elsewhere. If you have any concurrent submissions to UIST or other venues that are closely related – i.e., are based on the same study, artifact, or dataset – you must include an anonymized version of that submission to the concurrent submissions field. Failure to do so will result in desk rejection. Please see [ACM guide on prior and simultaneous submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions).
*   **Research Quality and Lack of Relevant Context:** Papers must include sufficient detail for reviewers to evaluate research quality according to the norms and expectations of the UIST community. Papers should demonstrate clear connections to existing research literature in HCI and related fields, showing how the work builds upon or relates to prior work. Papers that lack adequate methodological details for proper evaluation, or that fail to engage with relevant prior research, may be desk rejected.
*   Your paper must be stand alone. Authors are encouraged to provide supplementary materials to support practices around research reproducibility as much as possible, however all important information to understand the contributions of your work must be in the main paper PDF. Heavy reliance on appendices and/or supplementary materials can be a ground for rejection including desk rejection.
*   Please ensure that you use the correct template and correct formatting of references. We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format, but will accept papers for review in either 1- or 2-column paper format if you are authoring in Word. Use of other templates or formats, including different citation styles, may result in desk rejection.

### Final Publication Format

As required by the TAPS workflow, camera-ready manuscripts of all papers that have been accepted must be submitted in the formats listed below for final publication in the ACM Digital Library.

*   For LaTeX authors, your source files will be used to auto-generate (1) a double-column PDF ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ), and (2) an accessible and responsive webpage (example HTML ) that will be placed in the Digital Library.
*   For Word authors, you will need to submit your paper in single-column format to correctly auto-generate (1) a double-column PDF ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ), and (2) an accessible and responsive webpage (example HTML ) in the Digital Library.

### Presentation Format

Talk at the conference delivered by one or more authors of the paper

### Video Preview

*   Video previews are mandatory.
*   Recommended resolution: 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
*   Length: 30 seconds
*   Size: < 150 MB
*   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file

### Demo Fast Track

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to participate in the UIST demo session. Details about this special/fast track of demos will be found on the demo page.


*   Please see the [video guide](https://uist.acm.org/2025/video-guide) for more information on producing a video preview.
*   We strongly recommend that authors make their videos accessible through following the guidelines under [Making Video Figures Accessible](https://uist.acm.org/2025/accessibility).

*   Please note that a DOI will not be provided for invited demo papers. Authors interested in having a DOI for their demo paper should consider submitting to the regular demo track.

### Additional Notes

*   **Accessibility:** Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. To this end, we allow 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline to provide alt-text for all figures and tables and upload video subtitles to make your optional video accessible. Allowing additional time for your paper and video submissions to be accessible will help increase the quality of the conference overall and enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. If the authors have difficulties with making their submission materials accessible, they are encouraged to contact the UIST 2025 Accessibility Chairs by emailing [accessibility2025@uist.org](mailto:accessibility2025@uist.org) and volunteers with questions or for assistance to ensure that all accessible materials are submitted by the deadline. We strongly recommend that authors read the [SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission](https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/) which describes the process to make a paper submission accessible, as well as the [SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/videos/), which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning.
*   The author list must be complete by the abstract submission deadline. Late author changes (i.e., additions or changes of order) require approval from program chairs and may be declined or might require paper withdrawal. Ensure all authors are listed in the correct order by the abstract deadline.
*   We will continue to put the papers up publicly on the ACM DL a week in advance of the conference.
*   Authors may submit a rebuttal after the reviews are released. Though the ACs may indicate if the rebuttal is likely to help the paper being accepted (based on reviews and internal discussions), any author may choose to respond. A rebuttal response by Associate Chairs and external reviewers will be enforced by the Program Chairs as much as possible.
*   The video has traditionally been due the same day as paper submissions and this has always been stressful. We will allow for 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline for uploading your optional video.
*   **Open source:** Our community welcomes open source and encourages the practice of creating software/hardware and sharing it through open-source and public repositories. However, open source is not a requirement or prerequisite for acceptance. Open source, as well as many other types of artifacts (e.g., videos, datasets, raw data, appendices), is recommended but completely optional, and will not be used for evaluation criteria. The paper should be evaluated on its own merits, not depending on supporting artifacts that are not submitted by the authors.

### ACM’s Publication Policies

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

### ORCID

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

### Posters

Posters provide an interactive forum in which authors can present their work to conference attendees during special poster sessions. Posters are an opportunity to describe new work, work that is still in progress, and work that is already presented in other venues but to share more with the UIST community.

*   **Extended Abstract:** The extended abstract should not exceed 2 pages (excluding references).
*   We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow.
*   For LaTeX authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/UIST2025_Poster_Example.pdf) using \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}
*   For Word authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ).
*   **Accompanying Poster:** Recommended physical size is equal to or less than 841 mm x 1189 mm (A0 size) in either portrait or landscape
*   **Accompanying Video:** Optional, but highly encouraged
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   No more than 5 minutes long
    *   Size: < 250 MB
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
*   **Maximum File Size:** Maximum total size for all files < 300 MB
*   **Anonymity:** IMPORTANT: Anonymous, i.e. authors must remove their names and affiliations throughout all submission materials (paper, videos, supplementary material) ( [anonymity policy](https://uist.acm.org/2025/author-guide/#anonymity) )
*   **Selection Process:** Reviewed. Less rigorous than a paper review and does not include an author’s rebuttal. Authors may expect to receive only light feedback. The submitted content is generally not required to make the same level of lasting and significant contribution as refereed content.
*   **Publication:** Semi-archival, i.e., authors may re-use and re-submit the content to other peer-reviewed venues (e.g., could be reused in a future UIST full paper submission). The 2-page extended abstracts will be included in the ACM Digital Library as adjunct proceedings and distributed digitally to conference attendees. The poster design will not be included in the ACM Digital Library
*   **Presentation Format:** At least one author is requested to register and stand by their poster during the poster session to speak with conference attendees
*   **Concurrent UIST Demo Submission:** The same work cannot be submitted to both the UIST Demo and Posters tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as demo submissions and will be rejected from the Posters track
*   **Novelty of Work:** Resubmission of posters previously shown at other venues is allowed
*   Please state previous poster venues and differences from previous posters in the appropriate box in PCS

### Demos

Demos are one of the highlights of the UIST conference. Accepted authors show implementations of novel and compelling interaction concepts, techniques, devices, and systems. We particularly encourage highly interactive demos— from novel web systems and prototype devices, to new materials, fabrication methods, XR, and large interactive installations.

*   **Submission Platform:** All materials must be submitted electronically to PCS before the submission deadline.
*   **Submission Format and Length:**
    *   Demo Abstract
    *   We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow.
    *   For LaTeX authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) using \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}.
    *   For Word authors, submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) or the single-column template ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.pdf) ).
    *   We do not have a strong page limit, but we recommend that authors prepare a manuscript of ~1,500-2,000 words to equate to the double column 2-page length, often 4-5 pages in the single column (plus references). Submissions could be both single-column or double-column format in PDF. We strongly encourage to use the double-column format.
*   **Floor Plan:** The demo submission should include a PDF document describing the envisioned setup and interaction (demo hardware components, tables, chairs, lights, and other equipment) so that organizers get a good understanding of your setup.
*   [Recommended submission template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rf91u5ioLQ0npQAIIkaOmwiP5J-fZjz61M19ezs5uSI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.h223k5sfeu1w)
*   **Demo Video:**
    *   This video should be a standalone demonstration of the work
    *   It shows the working demo in appropriate detail
    *   It will be published ahead of time (~2 weeks before the conference) on the conference website
    *   Length: up to 5 min
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file by the camera-ready deadline
*   **Preview Video:** Video previews are mandatory (7 days grace period after camera-ready deadline)
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   Size: < 150 MB
    *   Length: 30 seconds
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
*   **Anonymity:** Demo submissions are not anonymous. Author names and institutions will be visible to the reviewing committee throughout the submission process.
*   **Selection Process:** Demos are juried by the UIST demo chairs, and there is no rebuttal phase. Due to the nature of the juried process, authors will not receive review feedback and will only be informed about the decision.
*   **Publication:** Non-archival, ideas presented as a UIST demo can be resubmitted as an extended full paper in subsequent years. Authors may choose whether demo abstracts will be included in the ACM Digital Library as Adjunct Proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees. Demos that accompany a UIST paper submitted as a fast-track submission will not be included in the ACM Digital Library as Adjunct Proceedings.
*   **Presentation Format:** At least one author is required to be physically present at the conference and present their demo during demo sessions
*   **Lab Demos:** If the authors have multiple demo submissions from the same lab/company, we can group these demos together at the venue. Please indicate the submission IDs of all demos from the same lab on the PCS submission page.
*   **Concurrent UIST Poster Submission:** The same work cannot be submitted to both the UIST demo and poster tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as a demo submission and will be rejected from the poster track
*   **Novelty of Work:** Resubmission of demos previously shown at other venues is allowed

### Demos of Accepted UIST 2025 Papers

Authors of accepted full papers who also want to present a demo must submit an entry into the demos track. They have two choices:

*   Demos that accompany accepted papers will follow a fast-track process with an abbreviated submission. Although no demo abstract is required, authors are still required to submit a video preview and other relevant data (e.g., title, abstract, floorplan). Demos accompanying full papers will not receive a separate DOI. Note that unlike in previous years, there will be no option for a fast-track submission with a DOI. Authors who wish to have their demo abstract published with a DOI in the proceedings are welcome to submit a full demo submission by the demo track deadline.
*   Changes in author list and affiliations: Please make sure that all authors and their affiliation are correct before submitting in PCS. It is not possible to add or remove any author from a demo abstract after submission. It is not possible to change the affiliation of any author after the submission.

### Doctoral Symposium

The UIST Doctoral Symposium provides a unique opportunity for Ph.D. students to interact with established academic and industry researchers in the UIST community.

*   **Submission Format and Length:** Submit papers in the 2-column paper format. Submissions should be a maximum of 4 pages + references
*   **Accompanying Video:** Optional, but highly encouraged. Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec. No more than 5 minutes long. Size: < 250 MB. Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file.
*   **Maximum File Size:** Maximum total size for all files must be under 150 MB.
*   **Anonymity:** Not anonymous, include the single author's name and institution(s) on the submission.
*   **Selection Process:** Juried by the UIST Doctoral Symposium chairs and invited panelists. Criteria: anticipated contributions to the breadth and depth of the intellectual discussions of the symposium. Students at all levels of their PhD will be considered. Strong applicants will have at least one published technical paper at a UIST conference or similar venue. Does not include an author’s response or conditional acceptance, i.e. authors will only receive feedback along with the final decision.
*   **Publication:** Non-archival. Ideas presented at the UIST Doctoral Symposium can be resubmitted.
*   Doctoral Symposium abstracts (max 4 pager + references in 2-column format) will be included in the ACM digital library as adjunct proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees.
*   **Presentation Format:** Talk at the Doctoral Symposium event, followed by extensive discussion with the panel and the other student participants. The student author is requested to attend. The exact times of sessions will be announced after the acceptance notification date. Additionally, each student is encouraged to present a poster describing their work to the full conference within the UIST poster sessions.
*   **Novelty of Work:** The Doctoral Symposium abstract should describe ongoing work and might summarize the student's full dissertation work, or highlight a particular part in depth.
*   **Posters for Accepted Submissions:** Each student is encouraged to present a poster describing their work to the full conference. Posters will be presented within the UIST poster session.

### Workshops

Workshops provide an interactive forum in which organizers can discuss a designated area of interest with fellow conference attendees during special workshop sessions.

*   **Submission Format and Length:** Workshop Extended Abstract. The extended abstract should not exceed 2 sq pages (excluding references). The double-column ACM paper template should be used for the submission process. For Overleaf/LaTeX, this means that the following command should be used: \documentclass[sigconf, review]{acmart}
*   Accepted submissions will go through the ACM TAPS Workflow if the organizers choose to add their 2-page extended abstract to the ACM Digital Library.
*   **Anonymity:** Not anonymous, include author names and institutions on submission
*   **Selection Process:** Juried. Less rigorous than the paper review process and does not include an author’s response or conditional acceptance. Juried content is generally not required to make the same level of lasting and significant contribution as refereed content.
*   **Publication:** Workshop organizers can choose whether their 2-page extended abstract is included in the ACM Digital Library as adjunct proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees.
*   **Presentation Format:** Workshops will be full-day events happening the day before the main conference (i.e., on Sunday September 28th). At least one workshop organizer is requested to register and facilitate the workshop. Workshops should reflect the nature of UIST: engaging, interactive, and cutting-edge. Consider activities such as demonstrations, brainstorming, and prototyping. Workshop activities should target an audience of approximately 25-45 participants.

### Visions

*   **Submission Format and Length:** We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow. The abstract should be up to 1000 words (excluding references), which is roughly equivalent to a 1-page limit.
