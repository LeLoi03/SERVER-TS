We invite the submission of manuscripts presenting original research results to the **IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS) 2025**, which will be held from **July 2-4, 2025, in Gold Coast, Australia**.

Quality of Service (QoS) has long been a central focus for communications and networking researchers worldwide. While traditional QoS research areas continue to garner significant interest, emerging domains such as the Internet of Things, data centers, virtualization, cloud and fog computing, green computing, and artificial intelligence are driving a new wave of research into service guarantees related to QoS, Quality of Experience (QoE), Quality of Protection (QoP), Software Quality, Data Quality, and, more broadly, Quality of Information Technology.

For over two decades, IWQoS has established itself as a premier forum for presenting novel ideas on all QoS-related subjects. The 33rd International Symposium on Quality of Service (IEEE/ACM IWQoS 2025) aims to continue this tradition as an international platform for the presentation and discussion of cutting-edge research in the field. The scope of IWQoS encompasses both the latest theoretical advancements and experimental research papers.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Authors are invited to submit manuscripts not exceeding **10 single-spaced, double-column pages** (including references and appendices) using a font size of **10 points**.
*   Manuscripts must be formatted according to the standard IEEE template for LaTeX or Microsoft Word. Templates can be downloaded by selecting “Conferences” in the IEEE Template Selector at [https://template-selector.ieee.org/](https://template-selector.ieee.org/).

KR is a leading forum for research in Artificial Intelligence focusing on the explicit, declarative representation of knowledge and its computational management.","# KR 2025: Call for Papers - Main Track

The International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) is a well-established and vibrant field of research within Artificial Intelligence. KR builds on the fundamental thesis that knowledge can often be represented in an explicit declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated symbolic reasoning engines.

KR 2025 will be held in Melbourne, Australia, from **November 11-17, 2025**, co-located with CPAIOR 2025, ICAPS 2025, and NMR 2025.

## Main Track

We solicit papers presenting novel results on the principles of KR, which clearly contribute to the formal foundations of the field or show the applicability of KR techniques to implemented or implementable systems. We welcome papers from other areas that demonstrate clear use of, or contributions to, the principles or practice of KR. We also encourage ""reports from the field"" of applications, experiments, developments, and tests.

The additional fee for remote presentations may be waived when all authors are from countries marked with an asterisk (*) on the following list of IEEE eMembership Countries: [https://www.ieee.org/membership/join/emember-countries.html](https://www.ieee.org/membership/join/emember-countries.html).

Remote presentation is restricted to full and short papers. Further implementation details will be communicated as part of the author and presenter instructions.

## Publication

All papers are published in the IEEE LCN proceedings and IEEE Xplore. All published papers must include title, complete contact information for all authors, abstract, and keywords on the cover page. IEEE reserves the right to remove papers from IEEE Xplore that are not presented at the conference.

To facilitate this process:

*   Submitted papers must omit author names and institutions.
*   References to the authors' own related work should be in the third person (e.g., ""We build on the work of ..."" instead of ""We build on our previous work ..."").

## Awards and Special Issues

*   **Kleene Award:** For the best student paper(s).
*   **Distinguished Papers:** Around 10% of accepted papers will be selected.
*   **Special Issues:** Invited submissions to the Journal of the ACM and Logical Methods in Computer Science.
