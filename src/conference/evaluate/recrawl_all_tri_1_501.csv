## Reviewing Philosophy

We strongly encourage constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work. The aim of the reviewing process is to assess whether the work is close to being ready for publication, and the interaction between authors and referees is meant to guide the paper into a publishable state.

## Rebuttal Phase

As in previous years, there will be a rebuttal phase during the review process. Initial reviews will be sent to authors before final decisions are made, and authors will have an opportunity to address the issues brought up in the reviews.

## Awards

COLT will award both **best paper** and **best student paper** awards. To be eligible for the best student paper award, the primary contributor(s) must be full-time students at the time of submission.

## Dual Submissions Policy

Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings or journals may not be submitted to COLT.

## Publication

Accepted papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper should present the work at the conference. Accepted papers will be published electronically in the **Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)**. Authors will have the option of opting out of the proceedings in favor of a 1-page extended abstract, which will point to an open access archival version of the full paper.

## Call for Open Problems

## Sharing and Reproducibility

Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly accessible during the review process, unless there is an inevitable reason that prohibits sharing (e.g., it requires data from a specific company or it is medical data where there is no public alternative). Algorithms and resources used in a paper should be described as completely as possible to enable reproducibility. This includes model parameters, experimental methodology, hardware and software platforms used during empirical evaluations, and results. The reproducibility factor will play an important role in the assessment of each submission. In the case where data cannot be released publicly, authors are encouraged to include experiments on relevant public datasets and/or create simulated data with the same properties.

## Policies

Please read the [Dual submission, Plagiarism, and Conflict of Interest](https://ikdd.acm.org/cods-2025/common-instructions-and-policies.php) policies before finalising your submission.

## Awards and Grants

Several technical awards are available for best paper, etc. The awards will be announced during the conference.

Partial travel Grants will be available for students whose papers are accepted.

## Double Anonymity Requirement

CODS 2025 will be using double-anonymous reviewing for Research Track papers (but not the ADS Track papers). Please review the instructions below carefully.

*   Authors’ names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or anywhere else in the submission. Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. The file names of any documents submitted must not identify the authors of the submission. Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the authors’ names in the submission’s associated metadata.
*   Only after acceptance at the camera-ready stage should the author list, acknowledgments, and funding sources be added to the paper.
*   If a version of a submission already resides on a pre-publication server, such as arXiv, the authors do not need to remove it before submitting to CODS.
*   Be careful when referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper. Authors must refer to their own past work in the third person. This allows setting the context for your submission, while at the same time preserving anonymity. Do not omit referring to your own past related work because that could reveal your identity by negation. Limit self-references to only the essential ones. Extended versions of the submitted paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must not be referenced.
*   Many peer-reviewed conferences have successfully followed double anonymity for decades to offer more equity for all authors in the reviewing process. Common sense and careful writing can go a long way toward preserving double anonymity without diminishing the quality or impact of a paper. It is the responsibility of the authors to do their very best to preserve double anonymity.
*   Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to Desk Rejection.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE, UTC-1200)

*   **August 1, 2025:** Submission of papers
*   **September 22, 2025:** Final decision notifications (Accept / Reject)
*   **November 18, 2025:** Camera Ready Due

Papers identifying robust foundations for research areas lacking them are particularly welcome. Submissions should be prefixed with ""SoK:"" in the title and indicated via a checkbox on the submission form.

## Ethics

Authors are expected to carefully consider and address potential harms and negative consequences associated with their research. This includes documenting risk mitigation, safe data collection, responsible disclosure, and clearly stating the benefits of research outweighing harms. Consultation with an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is encouraged if applicable, but does not absolve researchers from ethical considerations. Consulting existing documentation like the Menlo Report is also recommended.

## Submission Instructions

*   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with published or simultaneously submitted work.
*   Papers must be submitted using the **two-column IEEE Proceedings style**.
*   Maximum length: **12 pages**, excluding bibliography and appendices.
*   Anonymized supplementary material (e.g., proof scripts) can be uploaded as a tar ball.
*   Papers failing to adhere to instructions may be rejected without merit.
*   At least one coauthor of each accepted paper must attend CSF to present.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

CSF 2026 employs double-blind reviewing. Submissions must:

1.  Omit author names and affiliations.
2.  Reference the authors’ own related work in the third person (e.g., ""We build on the work of ..."" instead of ""We build on our previous work ..."").
*   Do not omit or anonymize important background references.
*   Refer to the [FAQ](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/conferences/csf2018/faq.html) for more information.

## Major Revisions

Papers with a ""major revision"" decision must be resubmitted within the following two cycles with a writeup explaining how revision requirements are met. These papers can use 16 pages and must still be anonymized. They should be submitted as a new paper marked ""major revision"", referencing the previous submission. Decisions for resubmitted revisions are ""accept"" (possibly with shepherding) or ""reject"".

## Resubmissions of Rejected Papers

Rejected papers can be resubmitted. If resubmitted within 11 months of the last deadline, reviews and an explanation of how concerns were addressed must be submitted as supplementary material. Otherwise, they are reviewed as new submissions. All resubmissions must follow regular submission instructions, including page limits and anonymization.

The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research (CPAIOR 2025) will be held in **Melbourne, Australia**, from **November 10 to November 13, 2025**. The conference will be co-located with [ICAPS 2025](https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/) and [KR 2025](https://kr.org/KR2025/).

While the conference will take place later in the year than usual, papers are still due in December 2024, in order to not interfere with the usual sequence of conference deadlines.

## Aim and Scope

The aim of CPAIOR is to promote a space where researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Operations Research (OR) present innovative techniques, new applications, and original cutting-edge ideas, thereby encouraging researchers from one area to learn from the others. Of particular interest to the conference are papers that integrate concepts and methodologies from these different fields, either proposing interesting new techniques for complex/practical problems or expanding our theoretical insights and cross-field understanding. However, high-quality original papers from a single area are welcome when also relevant to the other communities involved. The conference also strongly encourages regular papers or experience reports showcasing CP/AI/OR techniques on challenging real-world applications.

## Topics of Interest

The program committee invites submissions that include, but are not limited to, the following topics:

*   New methodologies in the interface between predictive and prescriptive pipelines, such as machine learning techniques applied to tackle optimization problems and, conversely, CP/OR techniques to address AI and machine learning tasks.
*   Novel relaxation and inference methods based on constraint propagation, polyhedral techniques/cutting planes, convex/second-order conic optimization, graph-based algorithms, dynamic programming, and decision diagrams for optimization.
*   New search perspectives involving enumeration/branch-and-bound strategies, innovative decomposition techniques (e.g., based on column generation/Benders), intelligent backtracking, incomplete search, and learning-based heuristics.
*   Advanced integrated methods that expose new model transformations, communication strategies across MIP/CP/SAT solvers, distributed solution techniques, and solver selection (e.g., portfolio approaches).
*   Innovative models and applications of CP/AI/OR techniques.
*   Implementation or evaluation of CP/AI/OR techniques and optimization systems.

## Submission Types

Submissions are of two types:

1.  **Regular Papers:** Submitted for publication and presentation.
    *   **Long Papers:** At most **15 pages** plus references.
    *   **Short Papers:** At most **8 pages** plus references.
    Both long and short papers will undergo rigorous review and are eligible for awards. Short papers are particularly encouraged for interesting and novel work in progress.

2.  **Extended Abstracts:** Submitted for presentation only (not formally published in LNCS, but a collection will be published on the conference website).
    *   Length: One or two pages.
    *   May present preliminary work or work already published in other outlets (should state the outlet).

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Review Process:** Single-blind (author names are visible to reviewers, reviewer names are hidden from authors).
*   **Proceedings:** Published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (LNCS).
*   **Format:** Papers should be prepared in the LNCS format. Instructions and templates can be found on the Springer website.
*   **Submission Platform:** [OpenReview.net](https://openreview.net/group?id=cpaior.org/CPAIOR/2025/Conference)
*   **Originality:** Papers submitted to CPAIOR must not be under review at a different venue at the same time.

## Important Dates (Regular Papers)

*   **Abstracts Due:** **December 8, 2024** (AoE)
*   **Full Papers Due:** **December 15, 2024** (AoE, no extension possible)
*   **Rebuttal Phase:** January 26-29, 2025 (AoE)

The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW) is the premier venue for human-centered research in the design, use, and evaluation of technologies that support or affect social, cooperative, and collaborative practices in groups, organizations, communities, and networks.

CSCW 2026 will explore topics across sociotechnical domains including work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, design, entertainment, and ethics, with a particular focus on social computing and social media, crowdsourcing, and technologies for co-located or remote collaboration, communication, education, work articulation, coordination, awareness, and information sharing.

Submissions are expected to report on novel results from human-centered research discussing the design, development, use, and/or analysis of CSCW and social computing systems. New human-centered approaches to the conceptualization or critical analysis of such systems are also welcome.

Submissions exploring how computing technologies—including AI, machine learning, robotics, and AR/VR—relate to questions of race, indigeneity, gender, and the environment are particularly encouraged, provided they are properly contextualized within cooperative, collaborative, or social computing issues.

## Scope Guidelines

*   Contributions must have a focus on **social aspects of technology mediation** and be properly contextualized in the CSCW literature, referencing CSCW concepts and/or theories.
*   Papers whose research contributions are primarily of relevance or benefit to **individual users** will be considered out of scope.
*   Systems-based or algorithmic research not explicitly involving aspects of cooperative, collaborative, or social computing are also out of scope.

Authors should clearly state how their work builds upon, bridges, discusses, or cites prior CSCW work and offers new knowledge for the CSCW community, and how the results are useful for thinking about the design of computing technologies to support cooperative/collaborative work or social interactions.

## Topics of Interest

*   **Social and crowd computing:** Social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds, collaborative information behaviors.
*   **CSCW and social computing system development:** Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, toolkits for building social and collaborative systems.
*   **Methodologies and tools:** Novel human-centered methods, approaches, and tools for building or studying collaborative systems.
*   **Critical, historical, ethnographic analyses:** Studies of technologically enabled social, cooperative, and collaborative practices, including their political or ethical dimensions.
*   **Empirical investigations:** Findings, guidelines, and studies of social practices, communication, cooperation, collaboration, or use related to CSCW and social technologies.
*   **Domain-specific applications:** Healthcare, transportation, design, manufacturing, gaming, ICT4D, sustainability, education, accessibility, global collaboration.
*   **Ethics and policy implications:** Analysis of the implications of sociotechnical systems and algorithms.
*   **Emerging technologies:** Mobile and ubiquitous computing, game engines, virtual worlds, multi-touch, novel display technologies, vision and gesture recognition, big data, MOOCs, crowd labor markets, SNSs, computer-aided or robotically-supported work, sensing systems.
*   **Crossing boundaries:** Studies exploring interactions across fields of research, disciplines, distances, languages, generations, and cultures.

## Submissions

*   **Submission should be done via:** [https://disc25.hotcrp.com](https://disc25.hotcrp.com)
*   A submitted paper should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A submission should strive to be accessible to a broad audience, as well as having sufficient details for experts in the area.
*   There are two types of submissions: **regular papers** and **brief announcements**.
    *   **Regular papers** must report on original research that has not previously been published (and may not be concurrently submitted to other journals or conferences with proceedings). All ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in a paper, including experimental results, should be included in the submission.
    *   A **brief announcement** may describe work in progress or work presented elsewhere. It may also present a result that is short and elegant, but does not require a longer paper. It may also be used to announce a software distribution or an experimental result of interest that can be concisely described. The title of a brief announcement should start with the phrase ""Brief Announcement: "".
*   A paper that is not accepted as a regular paper may be invited as a brief announcement.
*   When requested by the program committee, each author of the submitted paper(s) is expected to prepare a professional review of a non-conflicted DISC 2025 submission that falls within their research expertise.

### Submission Format

*   Submissions must be in **English** in **pdf format** and they must be prepared using the LIPIcs (LIPIcs) LaTeX style template with:
    ```latex
    \documentclass[a4paper,anonymous,USenglish]{lipics-v2021}
    ```
*   Submissions must be **anonymous**, without any author names, affiliations, or email addresses. The contact information of the authors will be entered separately in the submission metadata.
*   **Regular papers:** There is no page limit, and authors are encouraged to use the “full version” of their paper as the submission. The initial **15 pages**, excluding the title page and a table of contents, should contain a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. Material other than the first 15 pages will be read at the committee’s discretion.
*   **Brief announcements:** Should comply with the above rules, replacing 15 pages with **5 pages**.
*   Submissions not conforming to the submission guidelines and papers outside of the scope of the conference will be rejected without consideration.

## Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)

The use of LLMs for submission preparation is permitted, although it is highly recommended that they only be used for cosmetic changes, e.g. proofreading of the text. The use of LLMs in technical parts should be treated in the same way as any other software or system, and thus carefully described and documented in the submission. Ultimately, the authors are responsible for the content of their submission, and mis-use of LLM may result in rejection. Any questions about the LLM use policy should be directed to the PC chair, Dariusz Kowalski (dkowalski@augusta.edu).

## Anonymous Submissions

We will use a relaxed implementation of double-blind peer review. Submissions must not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names and affiliation should not appear in the document itself. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).

You are free to disseminate your work through arXiv and other online repositories and give presentations on your work as usual. Moreover, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized.

## Conflict of Interest

The submission form provides an opportunity to specify conflicts of interest with any of the PC members and other member of research community. A conflict of interest is limited to the following:

*   A family member or close friend;
*   A Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years;
*   A person with the same affiliation;
*   A person involved in an alleged incident of harassment;
*   Frequent collaborators, or collaborators who have jointly published papers within the last two years.

If you feel that you have a valid reason for a conflict of interest beyond listed above, or any other issues related to the fair treatment of your submission, contact the PC chair, Dariusz Kowalski (dkowalski@augusta.edu), or the SafeTOC representative for DISC, listed at [https://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/](https://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/).

## Participation at DISC

It is expected that accepted papers and brief announcements be presented in-person at the conference.

## Publication

The proceedings will be published by LIPIcs. The final version of the paper has to be formatted following the LIPIcs guidelines. Regular papers will have **15 pages** in the final proceedings (excluding references), and brief announcements will have **5 pages** in the proceedings (including everything).

Accepted papers and brief announcements must be presented by one of the authors, with a full registration and according to the final schedule.

Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of the journal *Distributed Computing*.
The best paper at DISC will be considered for publication in the Journal of the ACM.

## Awards

Awards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper. To be eligible for the best student paper award, at least one of the paper authors must be a full-time student at the time of submission, and the student(s) must have made a significant contribution to the paper.",,

Use the provided [LaTex Package](https://www.computer.org/template/ieee-conference-template) or [Word Template](https://www.computer.org/template/ieee-conference-template).

*   Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file with embedded fonts.
*   The first page must include the title, paper type, and a maximum 150-word abstract.
*   Color figures are encouraged but should be readable in grayscale.
*   Limit file size to less than 15 MB.

## Artifacts

DSN supports open science. Authors are encouraged to make their code and datasets publicly available for reproducibility and replicability. A separate artifact evaluation track will be offered for accepted papers. Authors should indicate their intent to submit an artifact, its type, and reserve a DOI on an open-access repository (Zenodo or Figshare) at the time of paper submission. Artifacts will be evaluated by a dedicated Artifacts Evaluation (AE) committee.

## Review Process and Author Response

DSN employs a double-blind review process. In addition to a rebuttal process, a **Paper Revision Process** is in place for papers not early rejected. Authors will be invited to submit a revised paper along with a rebuttal to strengthen their submission and allow reviewers to see addressed comments. Revised papers may have an extra page allowance (12 pages for regular, 8 for practical/tool). The rebuttal is strictly limited to 750 words.

## Awards

DSN gives three Best Paper Awards, with one receiving a Distinguished Best Paper Award based on oral presentation quality. Awards are also given for Best Ph.D. Dissertation, Rising Star in Dependability, Test-of-Time, and Jean-Claude Laprie. A Distinguished Artifact Award is also presented.

## Open Science Policy

Authors are encouraged to make all research results accessible and ensure reproducibility. Sharing research data is not mandatory but is strongly encouraged.

## Ethical Considerations

Submissions describing experiments with human subjects or with ethical implications must discuss how ethical concerns were addressed and disclose if an ethics review was conducted. Papers reporting high-impact vulnerabilities should discuss steps taken to address them. The PC may examine the ethical soundness of papers.
