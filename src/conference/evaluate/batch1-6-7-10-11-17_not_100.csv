It will be co-located with the 21st International Workshop on OpenMP (IWOMP 2025), and the MPI Forum will also convene.","# Call for Paper

EuroMPI/USA 2025 will focus on advancing the ubiquitous Message Passing Interface (MPI) model and specification of parallel programming. The conference will also encompass extensions and alternative interfaces for high-performance heterogeneous and hybrid systems, benchmarks, tools, parallel I/O, fault tolerance, and parallel applications using MPI and other interfaces.

EuroMPI/USA 2025 will be hosted by the **University of North Carolina, Charlotte** and will be co-located with [IWOMP 2025](https://www.iwomp.org/) (October 1 - October 3, 2025), with joint tutorials and opportunities for interaction between the two communities. The MPI Forum will also meet following the conference.

Through the presentation of full papers, position papers, posters, and invited talks, the meeting will provide ample opportunities for attendees to interact and share ideas and experiences to contribute to the improvement and furthering of message-passing and related parallel programming paradigms. Having EuroMPI, IWOMP and the MPI Forum grouped together enables attendees to interact and share ideas and experiences to contribute to the improvement and furthering of message-passing, shared-memory parallelism, and related parallel programming paradigms -- and their combined usage.

The IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P) is a premier forum for computer security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners.

## Scope

We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security or privacy, as well as Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning widely-held beliefs. Papers without a clear connection to security or privacy will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.

## Conference Expectations and Review Process

*   **Single-Track:** While historically single-track, the conference may adjust based on submission volume.
*   **Rigorous Review:** Aiming for a rigorous and thorough review process, accepting papers with scientific merit.
*   **Revision Option:** Papers with a potential path for acceptance after revision may be invited for revision within four weeks of notification. Revised papers will be re-reviewed.
*   **Per-Reviewer Responses (New in 2025):** Reviewers will provide specific questions for authors to focus on in their responses, improving communication and timely feedback.
*   **Meta Reviews (Returning from 2024):** Publicly available meta reviews will outline PC reasons for acceptance and identified limitations.

## Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers

We solicit SoK papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge. Suitable papers provide new viewpoints, challenge beliefs with evidence, or present convincing taxonomies. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate. SoK papers should be prefixed with ""SoK:"" in the title and will be reviewed to the same standards as traditional research papers, with emphasis on community value.

## Paper Awards

Outstanding papers will be selected by the program committee and announced at the symposium.

## Important Dates

## Proactive Prevention of Harm

Authors must carefully consider and address potential harms associated with their research and its publication. Failure to adequately discuss such harms may result in rejection. This includes documenting how risks were addressed and mitigated, considering impacts on deployed systems, data collection safety, and responsible disclosure practices. Papers should include a clear statement on how the research benefit outweighs potential harms and the safety measures taken.

If IRB consultation is available, it is expected to be appropriately consulted and documented. IRB approval does not absolve researchers from considering ethical aspects or guarantee PC acceptance.

Consult resources like ""Common Pitfalls in Writing about Security and Privacy Human Subjects Experiments"" and the ""Menlo Report"" for guidance.

## Open Science Expectations

Researchers are expected to maximize the scientific and community value of their work by making it as open as possible. By default, all reproducible materials (code, data) must be released under an open source license. Exceptions apply for malware, protected human subject data, or proprietary data. All submissions must include a clear Data Availability statement explaining sharing plans or reasons for not sharing. Papers failing to meet commitments may be removed from the conference.

## Plagiarism and Duplicate Submission

All submissions must be original work. Plagiarism (of others or self) will be grounds for rejection. Overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers must be clearly documented. Simultaneous submission of the same or substantially similar paper to another venue is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection.

## Anonymous Submission

*   Papers must be submitted anonymously: no author names or affiliations on the title page, and authors must avoid revealing their identity in the text.
*   Refer to your previous work in the third person.
*   Blind references only if a third-person reference is infeasible.
*   Use anonymous services for hosting code/data (e.g., Anonymous Github, not Github or Google Drive).
*   Contact PC chairs with any questions. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   Authors may post preprints to archives like arXiv.
*   Papers blatantly violating anonymity may be rejected by the Program Chairs.

## Reviews from Prior Submissions

Authors may optionally submit a separate, anonymized document of prior reviews (from another conference) along with a description of how those reviews were addressed. This supplementary material is visible to reviewers only after they submit their own initial review.

## Page Limit and Formatting

*   **Page Limit:** Maximum 13 pages of body text. Unlimited additional pages for references and appendices. Data Availability statement is part of the appendix.
*   **Formatting:** Must use LaTeX in A4 format with the provided `eurosp-template.zip`. Do not use other IEEE templates.
*   **Format:** Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf).
*   **Rendering:** Ensure documents render correctly in Adobe Reader XI and when printed in black and white. Unusual fonts, images, or figures may cause issues.
*   Failure to adhere to page limit and formatting requirements can lead to rejection without review.

## Conference Submission Server

Papers must be submitted at [https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org](https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org) and can be updated until the deadline.

## Publication and Presentation

Authors are responsible for publication clearances. At least one author of an accepted paper must present at the conference. In-person attendance is expected. If travel is impossible, at least one author must register, but the presentation may be skipped or replaced by a linked video presentation if a replacement presenter cannot be found.",

### Satoshi Grace Period

On October 4th, 2024, we project that the Ethereum's Beacon Chain will publish a random number in slot 10100000 denoted ""RANDAO Reveal"". Based on the last (least significant) hex character of this number, we will offer a possible extension to the paper deadline as follows:

-   **0, 1:** 8 October (original deadline)
-   **2, 3, 4:** 9 October
-   **5, 6, 7, 8, 9:** 10 October
-   **A, B, C, D, E, F:** 11 October

The random number in slot 10100000 is `0x8fbc79eb733d3fef8d218a0924bda4a0ff676317790dc58c278a462f7d9c03aed1618be49df1fd77e44f0c8ef260e0ea14c7bda670d0262cc473a6a87b67eb21dcef93e75dd29d98f1c3872432e9de58e2b20f602795baa551c082cea435d52e` and the FC25 submission deadline is thus **11 October 2024**.

## Submission Categories

Contributions are sought in the following categories:

### Research Papers

-   **Regular papers:** 15 pages + references and appendices.
-   **Short papers:** 8 pages + references; no appendices.
-   **Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers:** 20 pages + references and appendices.

### Workshop Proposals

-   2 pages in length.

### Tutorial Proposals

-   2 pages in length.

## Submission Guidelines

### General Information

For each accepted paper, the conference requires at least one registration at the general or academic rate, and paper authors must sign the [IFCA copyright form](http://ifca.ai/documents/copyright.html) when submitting the final version. Alternatively, individual papers can be published as fully open access—the publisher charges authors a fee for this.

### Format

Papers must be formatted in standard [LNCS format (templates)](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines) and submitted as PDF files. Submissions in other formats will be rejected. All papers must be submitted electronically according to the instructions and forms found here and at the submission site.

### Anonymous Submission

Regular and short research paper submissions as well as SoKs must be anonymized with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. Failure to properly anonymize submitted papers is grounds for a desk rejection without review. It is acceptable (but by no means required) for submitted papers to be published online in non-anonymous form (e.g., on authors' websites or archives like the Cryptology ePrint Archive or arXiv.org). Program committee members will be instructed not to actively seek to de-anonymize papers.

### Original Submissions

Authors may submit only work that does not substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has been accepted for publication to any other peer-reviewed conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal. We consider double submission serious research fraud and will treat it as such. Note that it is acceptable for papers to appear in non-peer-reviewed formats (for example, as technical reports or in online archives such as ePrint). In case of doubt contact the program chairs for any clarifications.

### Ethics and Etiquette

Authors are required to read and follow this [information on ethics and etiquette](https://www.ifca.ai/docs/ethics-etiquette.html).

### Conflict of Interest

Authors must report in the submission site any conflicts with program committee members. A conflict exists if an author has the same affiliation as a committee member, has ever acted as their PhD supervisor or been supervised by them, has a close personal relationship with them, or if they have been co-authors on a paper within the past two years. PC chairs are not allowed to submit papers where they appear as (co-)authors.

PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the ""conflict chair"".

### Submission Portals

-   Research paper submissions must be uploaded through the [conference submission website](https://crypto.unibe.ch/fc25/).
-   Workshop and tutorial proposals should be sent by email to [fc25workshops@ifca.ai](mailto:fc25workshops@ifca.ai), and should not be anonymized.

## Evaluation Criteria

### Regular Research Papers

Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to rigorous peer review. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Submissions are limited to **15 pages** in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible without them.

### Short Papers

Short papers are also subject to peer review; however, the intention is to encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel applications, and corporate/industrial experiences. Short papers will be evaluated with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking participants' interest and future research avenues. Short paper submissions are limited to **8 pages** in standard LNCS format, excluding references. The title for short papers must begin with the text ""Short Paper:"". Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. The authors of some submissions not accepted as regular research papers may be offered the option of acceptance as a short paper.

### Systematization of Knowledge Papers

We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. To be suitable for publication, SoK articles must provide an added value beyond a literature review, such as novel insights, identification of research gaps, or challenges to commonly held assumptions. SoK paper submissions are limited to **20 pages** in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible without them. The paper title for systematization of knowledge papers must begin with the text ""SoK:"".

## Workshop Proposals

Proposals for workshops to be held in connection with the conference are solicited. A workshop can be a full day or half day in length.

Workshop proposals should include:

-   Title
-   (Draft) Call for papers
-   Brief summary and justification, including how it would fit into the greater FC scope
-   (Tentative) Program Committee and its chair(s)
-   One-paragraph biographies for key organizers, the expected (or previous, if the workshop has been held in previous years) number of submissions, participants and acceptance rates

Workshop proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to [fc25workshops@ifca.ai](mailto:fc25workshops@ifca.ai). Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots.

## Tutorial Proposals

Proposals for tutorials to be given in connection with the conference are solicited. A tutorial can be a full day or half day in length.

Tutorial proposals should include:

-   Title
-   Description
-   Name(s) of presenter(s)
-   Brief biographies for all presenters
-   Information about previous tutorials given by the presenter(s)

Tutorial proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to [fc25workshops@ifca.ai](mailto:fc25workshops@ifca.ai) (the same address as for workshop proposals). Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots.

## Rump Session

The conference will also include the popular ""rump session"" held on one of the evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the conference. Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the conference). This submission should consist of a talk title, the name of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract. Submissions may be sent via e-mail or submitted in person in the morning on the day of the session.

## General Information

The 31st Fast Software Encryption Conference (FSE 2025) will take place in **Rome, Italy** from **March 17-21, 2025**. FSE 2025 is organized by the **International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR)**.

The scope of FSE concentrates on fast and secure primitives for symmetric cryptography, including the design and analysis of block ciphers, stream ciphers, encryption schemes, hash functions, message authentication codes, (cryptographic) permutations, authenticated encryption schemes, cryptanalysis and evaluation tools, and security issues and solutions regarding their implementation.

Since 2017, FSE also solicits submissions for **Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers**. These papers aim at reviewing and contextualizing the existing literature in a particular area to systematize the existing knowledge. To be considered for publication, they must provide an added value beyond prior work, such as novel insights or reasonably questioning previous assumptions.

## Submission

Submissions are currently closed.

Author instructions for paper submission may be found on the submission page: [Paper Submission](/2025/papersubmission.php).

## Important Dates

*   **Conference begins:** March 16, 2025 (Note: The conference dates are March 17-21, 2025).

## Publication Model

From 2017, FSE has moved to an open-access journal/conference hybrid model. Submitted articles undergo a journal-style reviewing process. Accepted papers are published in **Gold Open Access** (free availability from day one) by the Ruhr University of Bochum in an issue of the newly established journal **IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology (ToSC)**.

The FSE event will consist of presentations of the articles accepted to the journal IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology, as well as invited talks and social activities.

For FSE 2025, authors can submit papers to the IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology four times, every three months on a predictable schedule. Authors are notified of the decisions about two months after submission. Papers accepted for publication before the end of January 2025 will be presented at that year's conference. It is mandatory that accepted papers at the IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology journal are presented at the corresponding FSE event.

## Stipends

Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration waived.
A limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students whose papers are accepted and who will present the paper themselves are encouraged to apply if such assistance is needed. Requests for stipends should be sent to the General Chairs.

## Welcome

Welcome to GROUP 2025! The ACM International Conference on Supporting Group Work (GROUP) is a premier yet intimate and welcoming venue for research on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Sociotechnical Studies, Practice-Centered Computing, Human Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Collaborative Learning, Open Source Software, and related endeavors. GROUP 2025 will be held at the **Omni Hilton Head Oceanfront Resort, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, USA, January 12-15, 2025**.

Key goals for the program are to encourage and facilitate researchers within CSCW, HCI for practice-centered computing, and sociotechnical studies to interact and to present recent research contributions. We also encourage research contributions from interdisciplinary groups to present work that might be difficult to place within one simple category. We are open to diverse and innovative research methods, and to contributions across broad areas such as systems, societies, participation, critique, collaboration, and human interaction. GROUP 2025 particularly encourages cross-disciplinary research across computing, social science, law, and algorithmic systems design, as well as participation from industry, academia, government, and other interested groups.

Our hope is that GROUP 2025 will be held as an in-person, physical event.

## Submission Guidelines

### Anonymity Requirements

Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Citations to authors’ own relevant work should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work.” If there are challenges with writing the paper in an anonymous way, please contact the paper chairs for advice.

Papers that clearly violate the anonymization policy, including within the supplemental materials, will be desk rejected. Please check in particular the front page, headers and footers, and the Acknowledgement section. Also, check the meta information in papers prepared using word.

GROUP does not have a policy against uploading preprints to SSRN or arXiv before they are submitted for review at the conference.

### Publication

All papers, design fictions, and notes will be published in the Group track of **Proceedings of the ACM on Human Computer Interaction (PACMHCI)**.

### Submission System and Templates

*   Main technical program submissions must be submitted online via the GROUP 2025 selection in Precision Conference Systems (PCS): [https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions)
*   The track for submission can be selected with: Society: Group > Conference/Journal: Group 2025 > Group 2025 Second Wave Research Papers.
*   ACM authoring templates and detailed instructions on formatting can be found at: [https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates)
*   Please note that some formatting details may change between acceptance and final submission due to the publisher’s requirements.

### Two Waves of Submissions

In recognition that research happens more frequently than a biennial conference, GROUP 2025 will offer authors two waves of submission opportunities. Both waves will undergo a rigorous two-round review process. Initial submissions that are reviewed positively will be invited to be revised and resubmitted.

*   **First Wave:** Submission Deadline: June 7, 2023. Accepted submissions will appear in PACMHCI in early 2024.
*   **Second Wave:** Submission Deadline: May 8, 2024. Accepted submissions will appear in PACMHCI in early 2025.

Submissions that are accepted after the revision process from both waves will be invited to present at the conference. It will be required that at least one author for each paper registers for the conference by the time the camera-ready version of the accepted paper is completed.

The conference will be held over **July 20-23rd, 2025 in Glasgow, Scotland, UK.**

We invite you to submit original contributions to IEEE ICDCS 2025.

## Tracks

Papers can be submitted to one of the following tracks:

*   Cloud Computing
*   Distributed Algorithms
*   Big Data, Models & Systems
*   Distributed Fault Tolerance
*   Distributed OS and Middleware
*   Edge Computing
*   IoT + CPS
*   Mobile Computing
*   Security, Privacy and Trust
*   Blockchains/Databases
*   Distributed Systems for AI/ML
*   AI/ML for Distributed Systems
*   Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures

## Paper Submission

The Paper strand provides the opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.

*   Papers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere.
*   All paper submissions should follow the IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format using 10pt fonts and the IEEE Conference template (downloadable by selecting “Conferences” in the IEEE-Template Selector: https://template-selector.ieee.org/).
*   Each submission can have up to **eleven (11) pages** (including figures, tables, appendices, and references). Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review.
*   The paper review process is **double-blind**. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent.
    *   While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content.
    *   To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymised GitHub repository with all source code, scripts and data needed for the reproduction of their results.
*   For each accepted paper, **at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference in-person to present their work on-site**. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.
*   Authors should adhere to ethic and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer to IEEE Code of Ethics and IEEE Policy of AI-Generated Text.

## Publication Opportunity

A set of highly selected IEEE ICDCS 2025 papers will be considered for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS). The selected papers will undergo an extension process, transforming them from their initial IEEE ICDCS conference format. These extended versions will then be subject to a review by an editor from IEEE TPDS.

## Scope

The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming how devices and systems interact, enabling smart applications across healthcare, manufacturing, energy, transportation, and smart cities. This rapid growth generates vast, diverse, and real-time data — Big Data — which demands advanced techniques for analysis, storage, security, and intelligent decision-making.

The convergence of IoT, Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning creates new opportunities for actionable insights, autonomous systems, and enhanced user experiences. In particular, emerging technologies such as Generative AI offer unprecedented capabilities for smart, connected environments.

However, security, privacy, trust, and ethical AI remain critical challenges. The conference invites research contributions, practical solutions, and case studies addressing these concerns and advancing the state of the art in IoT and Big Data ecosystems.

IoTDBS brings together researchers, practitioners, and industry experts to explore innovations, trends, and challenges shaping the future of smart systems and data-driven applications. Maintaining a high level of security and privacy in IoT environments is crucial, and we welcome recommendations, solutions, demonstrations, and best practices addressing all aspects of security and privacy in IoT and Big Data.

## Overview

The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) community needs data with known ground truth to develop, evaluate, and validate computerized image analytic tools, as well as to facilitate clinical training. Synthetic data are ideally suited for this purpose. Another motivation to generate synthetic data is to improve the generalizability of deep learning and machine learning algorithms that are affected by domain shift issues.

To generate synthetic data, a full range of models underpinning image simulation and synthesis, also referred to as image translation, cross-modality synthesis, image completion, domain adaptation, etc. have been developed over the years:

1.  Deep learning methods including fully-supervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, unsupervised, transfer, and multi-task learning.
2.  Deep learning model architectures including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), Flows, Transformers, and etc.
3.  Machine learning methods using hand-crafted features.
4.  Detailed mechanistic models (top–down), which incorporate priors on the geometry and physics of image acquisition and formation processes.
5.  Complex spatio-temporal computational models of anatomical variability, organ physiology, and morphological changes in tissues or disease progression.
6.  Applications of synthetic images including improving image quality, segmentation, tracking, detection, registration, and etc.

The goal of the Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging (SASHIMI) workshop is to bring together all those interested in such problems in order to engage in invigorating research, discuss current approaches, and stimulate new ideas and scientific directions in this field. The objectives are to:

*   Bring together experts on image synthesis to raise the state of the art.
*   Hear from invited speakers outside of the MICCAI community, for example in the areas of transfer learning, generative adversarial networks, or variational autoencoders, to cross-fertilize these fields.
*   Identify challenges and opportunities for further research.

We also want to identify the suitable approaches to evaluate the plausibility of synthetic data and to collect benchmark data that could help with the development of future algorithms.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

*   Fundamental methods for image-based biophysical modeling and image synthesis
*   Biophysical and data-driven models of disease progression, organ development, motion and deformation, image formation and acquisition
*   Virtual cell imaging
*   Segmentation/registration across or within modalities to aid the learning of model parameters
*   Imaging protocol harmonization approaches across imaging systems, sites and time points
*   Image synthesis for normalization and spatio-temporal intensity correction
*   Cross modality (PET/MR, PET/CT, CT/MR, etc.) image synthesis
*   Simulation and synthesis from large-scale databases
*   Machine and deep learning techniques in image simulation and synthesis
*   Handling uncertainty and incomplete data via simulation and synthesis techniques
*   Automated techniques for quality assessment of simulations and synthetic images
*   Image synthesis in high dimensional spaces (vectors, tensors, spatio-temporal features, etc.)
*   Handling uncertainty and incomplete data via simulation and synthesis techniques
*   Evaluation and benchmarking of state of-the-art approaches in simulation and synthesis
*   Normative and annotated datasets for benchmarking and learning models
*   Novel ideas on evaluation metrics and methods in image-based simulation and image synthesis
*   Applications of image synthesis in super resolution imaging and multi/cross-scale regression
*   Applications of image synthesis and simulation in medical image registration and segmentation

*   Applications of synthesis and simulation to image reconstruction from sparse data or sparse views

## Submission Types

This year, all papers submitted to SASHIMI will be split into two categories:

*   **Method-oriented paper:** The main emphasis during the review process will be put on the novelty, correctness of the presented method, and proper validation of the results. The authors are expected to submit a full-length paper which will be (upon acceptance) included in the conference proceedings.
*   **Application-oriented paper:** The main focus will be put on the novel application of an existing theoretical image synthesis method and the data which the given method is applied to. The data should be described in detail. For new data collected, the collection process should be described (experimental setup, device(s) used, image acquisition parameters, subjects/objects involved, instructions to annotators, methods for quality control). For existing datasets, citations, as well as descriptions if they are not publicly available, should be specified. If public, a link to a downloadable version of the dataset should be included. The authors are expected to submit a full-length paper which will be (upon acceptance) included in the conference proceedings.
