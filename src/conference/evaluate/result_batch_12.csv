## Paper Categories and Submission

We welcome regular papers and short papers. Submission for both is lightweight double-blind.

This means that:

1.  Author names and institutions must be omitted using the anonymous option of the document class.
2.  References to authors’ own related work should be in the third person.
3.  The identity of authors will be revealed to reviewers once they have submitted a first draft of their review.

The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing it more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized.

In addition, authors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as usual. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.

### Regular Papers

Regular papers must:

*   be no more than 16 pages in length excluding bibliographic references
*   not include an appendix, and
*   be in LIPIcs format.

### Short Papers

Short papers can be used to describe interesting work that is still ongoing and not fully mature. Accepted short papers will be published in the main proceedings and will be presented as short talks. Short papers must:

*   be no more than 6 pages in length excluding bibliographic references and may consist of an extended abstract,
*   have the phrase ""Short paper"" as a subtitle,
*   not include an appendix, and
*   be in LIPIcs format.

Both categories of papers must be prepared in LaTeX using the [lipics-v2021 style](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author) (v2021.1.3) and must be submitted electronically as pdf files through [HotCRP](https://itp25.hotcrp.com).

All submissions are expected to be accompanied by supplementary material containing verifiable evidence of a suitable implementation, such as the source files of a formalization for the proof assistant used.

Two forms of supplementary material may be submitted:

1.  Anonymous supplementary material is made available to the reviewers before they submit their first-draft reviews.
2.  Non-anonymous supplementary material is made available to the reviewers after they have submitted their first-draft reviews and have learned the identity of the authors. We strongly encourage anonymous supplementary material whenever possible.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract submission deadline:** March 12, 2025
*   **Paper submission deadline:** March 19, 2025
*   **Author notification:** May 23, 2025
*   **Camera-ready copy due:** June 27, 2025

## Publication

The conference proceedings will be published in Dagstuhl Publishing's Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series in Gold Open Access under the CC-BY-4.0 license.

## Registration and Participation

Remote attendance of the conference will be possible for a low or no fee. For all accepted papers, at least one author must pay a full registration fee. For presenters we strongly encourage physical participation since coming to the conference benefits the dissemination of the paper and the overall quality of the conference. Remote talks are only possible if agreed with the organizers by the registration deadline, but still one author must pay the full registration fee.

## Papers

We invite original paper submissions that are not under consideration elsewhere. Accepted papers will appear in the ACM Digital Library and citation indices. At least one author of all accepted papers must register with full registration fee (not student registration fee), attend in person, and present their paper during the main conference program. One registration covers one paper only.

A selected set of accepted top-quality full papers will be invited to submit their extended versions for publication in an ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS) special issue titled “Highlights of IUI 2026” that will appear in 2027.

## Reflection of practical and societal impact

We encourage authors to consider practical and societal implications of their work (as well as its shortcomings) throughout their projects and to include a reflection on those implications in their papers, in particular how the proposed methods and insights could be applied and deployed in a realistic setting and how they can improve people’s lives in the real world.

We also encourage authors to discuss potential ethical considerations of their work in terms of diversity, inclusion, and equality; and other topics under the broad responsible AI topic and its societal impact.

## Anonymization

ACM IUI uses a double-blind review process. All submissions (and supplemental materials) must be appropriately anonymized.

## Accessibility

Authors are asked to make their paper submissions accessible.

Please refer to the [Accessibility page](https://iui.hosting.acm.org/2026/accessibility/) of the conference site for further details and guidelines.

## Usage of Generative AI

All submissions must comply with the ACM policy on the usage of GenAI: the [April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) and Frequently Asked Questions. Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked.

Authors should include a “GenAI Usage Disclosure” section, right before the references, to provide full disclosure of all use of GenAI tools in all stages of the research (including the code and data) and the writing. This section, together with the references, will not be counted toward the word limit.

## Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects

Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment.

Please also see the [2021 ACM Publications policy on research involving human participants and subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects) before submitting.

## Additional Policies

Authors should also be aware of the [SIGCHI Policy for Submission and Review at SIGCHI Conferences](https://sigchi.org/about/policies/conference-policies/submission-and-review/) and ACM Publications Policies.

## Submission Format, Length, and Platform

We adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow.

Please prepare your submission for review in a single column format, using the latest templates: [Word Submission Template](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx), or the [LaTeX template](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-latex) using `\documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart}` for the LaTeX template.

Papers are of variable length. Paper length must be proportional to its contribution. We encourage authors to stay within a 10,000 word limit. Authors of papers exceeding 12,000 words should add a note at the end of their manuscript explaining how the length of the paper is commensurate with the contribution of the work.

## Submission Platform

All materials must be submitted electronically to the Precision Conference Submission (PCS) Portal (<https://new.precisionconference.com/>) by the abstract and paper deadlines.

In PCS, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for Society, Conference, and Track, please select “SIGCHI”, “IUI 2026”, and “IUI 2026 Papers”, respectively, and then press “Go”.

## Supplemental Materials

Submitting supplemental material (e.g., questionnaires, demo videos of applications, data sheets) is optional but encouraged.

If supplying a demo video, please follow the [SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/videos/).

## Publication and Open Access

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

Starting January 1, 2026, ACM will fully transition to Open Access. All ACM publications, including those from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be 100% Open Access.

Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs).

With over 1,800 institutions already part of ACM Open, the majority of ACM-sponsored conference papers will not require APCs from authors or conferences (currently, around 70-75%).

Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC to publish their papers, unless they qualify for a financial or discretionary waiver. To find out whether an APC applies to your article, please consult the list of participating institutions in ACM Open and review the APC Waivers and Discounts Policy. Keep in mind that waivers are rare and are granted based on specific criteria set by ACM.

Understanding that this change could present financial challenges, ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more time for institutions to join ACM Open. The subsidy will offer:

*   $250 APC for ACM/SIG members
*   $350 for non-members

This represents a 65% discount, funded directly by ACM. Authors are encouraged to help advocate for their institutions to join ACM Open during this transition period.

This temporary subsidized pricing will apply to all conferences scheduled for 2026."

JSSPP 2025 welcomes novel submissions in Regular Papers, Open Scheduling Problems, and Workload Traces. The proceedings of the workshops are published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science Series.","# JSSPP 2025: Call for Submissions

The 28th Workshop on Job Scheduling Strategies for Parallel Processing (JSSPP 2025) will be held in conjunction with IPDPS 2025 in Milan, Italy, on June 3-4, 2025.

JSSPP welcomes novel, unpublished Regular Papers (RP) as well as descriptions of Open Scheduling Problems (OSP) and Workload Traces (WT) coming from interesting scheduling domains.

## Call for Regular Papers (RP)

JSSPP solicits regular papers that focus on challenges in parallel scheduling, including but not limited to:

*   Design of new scheduling approaches.
*   Performance evaluation of scheduling approaches, including methodology, benchmarks, and metrics.
*   Fulfilling additional constraints in scheduling systems, like job priorities, price, energy requirements (Green Computing), accounting, load estimation, and quality of service guarantees.
*   Impact of scheduling strategies on system utilization, application performance, user-friendliness, cost efficiency, and energy efficiency.
*   Scaling and architecture of very large scheduling systems.
*   Operational challenges: Capacity planning, service level assurance, reliability.
*   Interaction between schedulers on different levels (e.g., processor vs cluster) and tenancy domains (single and multi-tenant)
*   Interaction between applications/workloads, e.g., efficient batch job and container/Pod/VM co-scheduling within a single system, etc.
*   Experience reports from large-scale compute production systems.
*   GPU/Accelerator (co)scheduling.
*   AI/ML-inspired scheduling approaches.

## Call for Workload Traces (WT)

JSSPP welcomes novel, unpublished papers introducing workload traces from workloads of real systems that offer challenges in the context of this workshop. These submissions should include:

*   Anonymized (if needed) workload artifacts that describe a significant share of individual units of resource scheduling (jobs, pods, VMs, functions, etc.) during a period of life in a parallel computing system.
*   A description of the parallel system running these workloads.
*   An analysis of the traces, modeling key workload features and highlighting scheduling challenges in their hosting systems.

We ask submitters to employ known workload description languages (e.g., SWF) to represent their traces or to attach schemas that allow interpreting them. The submission of artifacts that model the workloads is also encouraged.

## Call for Open Scheduling Problems (OSP)

JSSPP welcomes novel, unpublished papers describing open problems in large-scale scheduling. Submissions must include a concise description of the key metrics of the system and how they are calculated, as well as anonymized data publication of the system workload and production schedule. Ideally, anonymized operational logs would also be published.

## Submission Format

Paper formatting requirements are the same for Regular Papers, Workload Traces, and OSP-related submissions. Papers should be no longer than **20 single-spaced pages, 10pt font**, including figures and references. All submissions must follow the LNCS format.

See the instructions at Springer's website: [http://www.springer.com/lncs](http://www.springer.com/lncs)

All papers in scope will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.

## Submission Site

We will use OpenReview to manage the submissions and reviewing. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.

All listed authors must have an up-to-date OpenReview profile. Here is information on [how to create an OpenReview profile](https://openreview.net/faq).

New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks.

New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically.

The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflict of interest and paper matching. An incomplete OpenReview profile is sufficient ground for desk rejection.

To be considered complete, each author profile must be properly attributed with the following mandatory fields: current and past institutional affiliation (going back at least 5 years), homepage, DBLP (if there is prior publication), ORCID, Advisors and Recent Publications (if any). In addition, other fields such as Google Scholar, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar, Advisees and Other Relations should be entered wherever applicable.

Abstracts and papers can be submitted through OpenReview at this link: [KDD 2026 Research Track August | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=KDD.org/2026/Research_Track_August)

## Scope

For the Research track, we invite submission of papers describing innovative research on all aspects of knowledge discovery, data science and AI, ranging from theoretical foundations to novel models and algorithms for applied problems in science, business, medicine, and engineering. Visionary papers on new and emerging topics are also welcome, as are application-oriented papers that make innovative technical contributions to research. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   **Foundations of Knowledge Discovery and Data Science.**
*   **Modern AI and Big Data.**
*   **Trustworthy and Responsible Data Science.**
*   **Systems for Data Science and Scalable AI.**
*   **Data Science Applications.**

Survey papers that seek to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state of research on a specific topic, rather than to contribute a novel intellectual contribution, is out of scope.

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Deadlines:** The submission deadlines are strict and no extensions, regardless of circumstances, will be allowed. Placeholder or dummy abstracts are forbidden.
*   **Authorship:** Every person named as the author of a paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the paper and/or to the writing of the paper and must take responsibility for the entire content of a paper. Any use of generative AI tools must be disclosed and elaborated in the submission form.
*   **Maximum authorship:** In the research track, the number of submissions allowed per author is limited to 7 (seven) maximum per cycle.
*   **Authorship changes:** The full list of author names, including the ordering, must be finalized by submission deadline.
*   **Anonymity:** The review process for the research track will be double-blind. The submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information.
*   **Formatting Requirements:** Submissions must be in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the ACM template and format (also available in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)); Word users may use the [Word Interim Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
    *   Submissions must be a single PDF file: 8 (eight) content pages as main paper, followed by references and an optional Appendix that has no page limits.
*   **Originality and Concurrent Submissions:** Submissions must present original work—this means that papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference/journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted.
*   **Resubmission Guidelines:** A paper that receives a Resubmit decision during the Feb 2025 submission cycle may submit a revised version to the KDD 2026 (first cycle) deadline. A paper that was either rejected or withdrawn after receiving its reviews during the Feb 2025 deadline should not submit a revision
*   **Serving as Reviewer:** Every submission must nominate at least one author who is a qualified reviewer (i.e., authors with at least three papers in KDD or other related conferences).
*   **Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent:** Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when appropriate.

## Reviewing Process

*   **Reviewing:** Each submission will receive at least three independent reviews, overseen by an Area Chair (AC).
*   **Rebuttal:** Authors will have the chance to provide a response to each review during the rebuttal period.
*   **Withdrawal:** Authors may use the withdrawal button on OpenReview up until the end of the rebuttal period.
*   **Decision:** A range of factors including technical merit, originality, potential impact, quality of execution, quality of presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics, will be used by the ACs to make a recommendation. The PC Chairs will make the final decisions.
*   **Transparency:** By submitting paper(s) to KDD 2026, the authors agree that the original submission, reviews, meta-reviews, and discussions will be made public in OpenReview for all accepted papers.

## Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy

All authors and reviewers must declare conflicts of interest in OpenReview.

To assess and be able to exclude CFP violations, authors must give consent to the SIGKDD to process and share their submission and other relevant data pertaining to the submission such as authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses to related conference organizations.

## Publication and Presentation Policies

*   **Publication:** All accepted papers will be allowed the same maximum page length in the proceedings (12 pages, of which 9 are content pages), which will be published by ACM and will be accessible via the ACM Digital Library.
*   **Reproducibility:** In their submission, authors may refer to an anonymized GitHub repository, though not strictly required, it is highly recommended.
*   **Registration:** To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by a distinct conference registration, e.g., two multi-authored papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping authors.
*   **Presentation:** Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings.
*   **Official Publication Date:** The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library.

*   **Short papers**, which may describe (possibly preliminary or open-ended) research, applications (academic, industrial, or otherwise), and late-breaking results, can be up to **4 pages** long, including references. Short papers will also appear in the conference proceedings and will be citable as K-CAP 2025 publications.
*   **Visionary papers**, which describe outrageous ideas or potentially preliminary but highly innovative research, can be up to **2 pages** long, including references. Visionary papers will be presented as short talks in the conference program.

Authors of all paper types will present their work in plenary sessions during the conference. Presentation timing for the different types of papers will be announced once the program is crafted.

K-CAP is not a double-blind conference, hence authors should list their names and affiliations on the submission. Please use the ACM 2 column SIG Conference Proceedings template for your submission. Submissions in HTML format are welcome, so long as authors of HTML submissions also provide a conversion of their submission to a PDF file that adheres to the required ACM template for proceedings. Papers submitted to the main conference track should not have been published before in an archival venue, or currently be under review in an archival venue. Authors are welcome to submit papers that have been published as a preprint on arXiv, or in a non-archival venue like a workshop. Authors are allowed to use generative models as a tool but not to include them as co-authors. The use of such tools must be acknowledged and properly documented in the papers. In particular, authors are encouraged to add a credit statement capturing the contribution role of authors and models.

All submissions to K-CAP should be made through EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kcap2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kcap2025).

This year we will embrace the FAIR principles by collecting structured metadata of the datasets, software, ontologies and methods generated by K-CAP submissions. Authors will be encouraged to add these resources in the EasyChair submission form (together with a brief description). Accepted papers with resources will be highlighted in the main K-CAP conference page.

An author should register per accepted SHORT or FULL paper in order to appear in the proceeding.

## Paper Types and Formats

LREC-COLING 2024 invites high-quality submissions written in English.

*   **Regular long papers** – up to eight (8) pages maximum
*   **Short papers** – up to four (4) pages
*   **Position papers** – up to eight (8) pages

*Excluding any number of additional pages for references, ethical consideration, conflict-of-interest, as well as data, and code availability statements.

*Upon acceptance, final versions of long papers will be given one additional page – up to nine (9) pages of content plus unlimited pages for acknowledgments and references – so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account. Final versions of short papers may have up to five (5) pages, plus unlimited pages for acknowledgments and references. For both long and short papers, all figures and tables that are part of the main text must fit within these page limits.

Furthermore, appendices or supplementary material will also be allowed ONLY in the final, camera-ready version, but not during submission, as papers should be reviewed without the need to refer to any supplementary materials.

Linguistic examples, if any, should be presented in the original language but also glossed into English to allow accessibility for a broader audience.

Note that paper types are decisions made orthogonal to the eventual, final form of presentation (i.e., oral versus poster).

## Submission

Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system via the link: [https://softconf.com/lrec-coling2024/papers/](https://softconf.com/lrec-coling2024/papers/)

Both long and short papers must follow the LREC-COLING 2024 two-column format, using the supplied official style files. The templates can be downloaded from the Style Files and Formatting page provided on the website. Please do not modify these style files, nor should you use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.

## Author Responsibilities

Papers must be of original, previously-unpublished work. Papers must be anonymized to support double-blind reviewing. Submissions thus must not include authors’ names and affiliations. The submissions should also avoid links to non-anonymized repositories: the code should be either submitted as supplementary material in the final version of the paper, or as a link to an anonymized repository (e.g., Anonymous GitHub or Anonym Share). Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

If the paper is available as a preprint, this must be indicated on the submission form but not in the paper itself. In addition, LREC-COLING 2024 will follow the same policy as ACL conferences establishing an anonymity period during which non-anonymous posting of preprints is not allowed.

More specifically, direct submissions to LREC-COLING 2024 may not be made available online (e.g. via a preprint server) in a non-anonymized form after September 22, 11:59PM UTC-12:00 (for arXiv, note that this refers to submission time).

Also included in that policy are instructions to reviewers to not rate papers down for not citing recent preprints. Authors are asked to cite published versions of papers instead of preprint versions when possible.

Papers that have been or will be under consideration for other venues at the same time must be declared at submission time. If a paper is accepted for publication at LREC-COLING 2024, it must be immediately withdrawn from other venues. If a paper under review at LREC-COLING 2024 is accepted elsewhere and authors intend to proceed there, the LREC-COLING 2024 committee must be notified immediately.

## Ethics Statement

We encourage all authors submitting to LREC-COLING 2024 to include an explicit ethics statement on the broader impact of their work, or other ethical considerations after the conclusion but before the references. The ethics statement will not count toward the page limit (8 pages for long, 4 pages for short papers).

## Presentation Requirement

All papers accepted to the main conference track must be presented at the conference to appear in the proceedings, and at least one author must register for LREC-COLING2024. Papers will be presented either orally or as posters. The specific presentation modality of a paper will be decided based on its content, with no difference in quality implied. Papers that include a demonstration component will be presented as posters.

All papers accepted to the main conference will be required to submit a presentation video. The conference will be hybrid, with an emphasis on encouraging interaction between the online and in-person modalities, and thus presentations can be either on-site or virtual.
