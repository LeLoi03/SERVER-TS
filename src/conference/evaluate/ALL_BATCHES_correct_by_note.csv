The 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy. CCS has two review cycles in 2025.

## Review Cycles and Decisions

For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:

*   **Accept:** Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference, possibly after making minor changes with the oversight of a shepherd.
*   **Minor revision:** Papers in this category are considered promising but need some minor additional work. Authors will be given the opportunity to resubmit such papers, with appropriate revisions. The revised paper will then be re-evaluated.
*   **Reject:** Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Papers rejected from the first review cycle may not be submitted again to the second review cycle.

Authors of each accepted paper must ensure that at least one author registers for the conference, and that their paper is presented in-person at the conference if at all possible.

## Paper Submission Information

*   All submissions must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the corresponding deadline.
*   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings.
*   All submissions should be properly anonymized. Papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   Authors may submit up to a maximum of 7 papers for Cycle B.
*   Submitted papers will be evaluated based on their merits, particularly their importance to practical aspects of computer and communications security and privacy, novelty, quality of execution, and presentation.
*   For papers that might raise ethical concerns, authors are expected to convince reviewers that proper procedures (such as IRB approval or responsible disclosure) have been followed.
*   No modifications to the author list on a paper may be made after submission.

## Mandatory Reviewing

Authors submitting 3 papers or more may be required to submit reviews for other papers at CCS 2025. Failure to provide requested information may result in desk rejection.

## Withdrawing Policy

A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent, the paper cannot be withdrawn.

## Paper Format

*   Submissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format using ""sigconf"" 2-column format.
*   Maximum length: 12 pages, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material.
*   Reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material.
*   Authors should not change the font or the margins of the ACM format.
*   Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.

## Providing Artifacts at Submission Time

Submissions whose claimed contributions rely on artifacts (e.g., code, models, data sets) are expected to make these accessible to the reviewers, unless there are good reasons not to.

## Optional Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to submit artifacts for an optional Artifact Evaluation (AE) process.

## Conference Tracks

CCS features a multi-track format. Authors must select one track at the time of submission.

*   **Program Co-Chairs:** David Lie (University of Toronto), Véronique Cortier (CNRS, Loria)

## Submission Guidelines & Policies

All paper submissions must adhere to several important aspects:

### Final Submission Mindset

Submitting papers for review that are not yet complete and polished abuses the review process and is disrespectful to the Program Committee and the Computer Architecture community. All authors must affirm that their submission is, to the best of their abilities, complete, polished, and ready for comprehensive review. Furthermore, if all reviewers of a submission find that the submission is lacking in this regard, detailed reviewer feedback will be withheld from the authors. In other words, there is a cost to submitting unfinished work – it may “poison” future reviews without the authors gaining any feedback.

### Reviewer Continuity Initiative

HPCA 2026 is considering an initiative to maintain reviewer continuity for submitted papers that were rejected from MICRO 2025 on an opt-in basis. The goal for this initiative is to improve the fairness of the overall review process in Computer Architecture. It is in the best interest of authors and the community to have papers undergo a consistent revision process. However, please do not feel pressured to participate in this initiative, reviewers will not be made aware of your choice implicitly or explicitly.

If all authors of a submission opt in to the “reviewer continuity initiative”, reviewers who had previously reviewed a version of the submission for MICRO 2025 may be explicitly assigned to review the submission (PC members also must opt in to this initiative). If the authors do not opt in for “reviewer continuity”, reviewers of previous submissions may still be assigned to review the submitted version of the paper based on reviewer expertise, reviewer load balance, and other similar agnostic criteria.

### Revision Letters

If a submission has been previously reviewed and rejected from another venue or conference and is now being submitted to HPCA 2026, the authors must provide a letter explaining how the paper has been revised for this current submission, regardless of whether the authors opt to participate in “reviewer continuity” or not. Authors may choose to only permit the PC Chairs to have access and knowledge of this letter. Authors who opt in for reviewer continuity implicitly make their revision letter available to reviewers who reviewed a prior version for MICRO 2025. Note that it is not a requirement that papers be revised before being submitted to HPCA, but we expect a revision letter nonetheless.

### Abstract Registration and Final Submission

Authors must register an abstract one week before the paper submission deadline. The purpose is to ensure that authors are fully aware of all submission requirements, topic selection, conflict of interest registration, etc. All information regarding the submission may be edited up to final submission time but may not change once the review process has started. In particular, authorship at submission time must match that of the final publication, if accepted.

### Formatting and Submission Instructions

Detailed formatting and submission instructions will be made available on the submission site ([http://hpca2026.hotcrp.com](http://hpca2026.hotcrp.com)) at a later date.",

Welcome to the 2025 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2025)! ISMM is the premier forum dedicated to research in memory management, covering a broad range of topics including memory performance, allocator design, garbage collection, architectural support for memory management, persistent memories, emerging memory technologies, and more. ISMM 2025 aims to encourage submissions and participation from related fields such as computer architecture and computer systems, in addition to the core PL community.

Update: Submissions are now due **2025-03-18 (AoE UTC-12h)**.

## Submission Types

ISMM 2025 is soliciting full-length submissions covering new work on all memory management related topics in both software and hardware (and their cooperation), as well as papers presenting confirmations or refutations of important prior results. In addition to regular papers, ISMM also invites submissions of the following kinds:

*   **Surveys and comparative analyses** that shed new light on previously published techniques.
*   **Practitioner reports**, describing experience with memory management in production. Such papers are not expected to provide novel research contributions, but they should not have been previously published.
*   **Intellectual abstracts**, where researchers share designs, algorithms, or theory that may be interesting to the memory management community, but not yet evaluated.

Please indicate the submission type using a subtitle, e.g., `\subtitle{This submission is a regular paper}`.

## Co-location

ISMM 2025 will be held in-person as part of PLDI 2025, sharing the venue and activities.

## Areas of Interest

Areas of interest include but are not limited to:

*   Garbage collection algorithms and implementations
*   Memory allocation and de-allocation
*   Memory system design and analysis (both software and hardware)

*   Citations should be in **numeric style**, e.g., `[52]`.
*   Submissions must be printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper.
*   Ensure figures and tables are legible, even when printed in grayscale.
*   Appendices should be submitted as supplementary material and must also be anonymized.
*   Use the `sigplan` subformat of the `acmart` format. The first two lines of the LaTeX document should be:
    ```latex
    \documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart}
    \settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}
    ```

Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

ISMM uses double-blind reviewing. This means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, references to prior work done by the authors should be made in the third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. If you have doubts, please contact the Program Chairs.

## Declaring Conflicts

When submitting, you must declare potential conflicts, including adviser-advisee, institutional, financial, and recent co-authorship (last 2 years). Avoid spurious conflicts, as they can be grounds for rejection. Consult the Program Chair if unsure.

*   A paper is eligible for the Industry Session if:
    *   It describes industrial applications and/or practices;
    *   At least one co-author has an industrial affiliation.

Submissions to the Industry Session will be evaluated primarily on their practical significance.

## Submission Guidelines

Both research and industry papers are solicited. The submitted manuscript must describe original work not previously published and not concurrently submitted elsewhere. Abstract submission is a prerequisite for full paper submission.

We welcome high quality papers, adhering to the following two formats:

*   **Full Paper format:** technical content must fit within **10 pages**; references and acknowledgments can be arranged in 2 additional pages.
*   **Short Paper format:** technical content must fit within **6 pages**; references and acknowledgements can be arranged in 2 additional pages.

Both types of submission must be formatted according to the **IEEE conference proceedings format (two-columns, single-space, 10pt)**. Submitted papers are subject to single-blind reviews.

In some cases, the Program Committee may decide to accept a full paper submission as a short paper, in which case, the authors will be required to reduce its length for the final version.

By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one author will register at the full registration rate to the conference and present the paper in person. RTCSA 2025 reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from the digital library and indexing services), if the paper is not presented at the conference.

## Overview

The annual Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research (CIDR) is a systems-oriented conference, complementary in its mission to the mainstream database conferences like SIGMOD and VLDB, emphasizing the systems architecture perspective. CIDR gathers researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to discuss the latest innovative and visionary ideas in the field.

We invite contributions on novel approaches to data management systems, architecture, and usage including cloud based systems for data processing as well as related system issues such as data storage, networking, hardware acceleration, custom processors, memory hierarchies, processor interconnects, etc. in the context of data processing. We also encourage new approaches to data management and system building based on or in support of ML/AI technologies. CIDR encourages contributions about innovative and risky data management system architecture ideas, systems-building experience and insights, resourceful experimental studies, and provocative position statements. CIDR especially values innovation, experience-based insight, and vision.

## Contribution Types

CIDR 2026 invites two kinds of contributions:

*   **Papers** (at most 6 pages). We invite both regular research papers and more visionary papers that promote interesting ideas and ongoing work.

Evaluations are typically end-user evaluations or critical reflections on the design process.
3.  **Technical:** Primary contribution is a novel algorithm, mathematical model, tool, hardware element, or human-robot interface, with sufficient detail for reproducibility. Rigor, robustness, and appropriate evaluations (which may include user studies if appropriate, but not required) are expected. Papers may include proofs of correctness, demonstrations, simulations, or technical performance evaluations. A ""pathway to deployment"" description is required if no physical robot demonstration is included.
4.  **Systems:** Focuses on contributions that synthesize underlying techniques and/or technologies to achieve system-level HRI behavior. The contribution is best observed through the performance of an integrated system. This can involve novel system design or integration of novel techniques/components. Authors should emphasize novelty, significance, and wider systems knowledge applicable to future HRI problems.
5.  **User Studies:** Welcomes submissions providing new knowledge about human-robot interactions based on studies involving people (laboratory or field studies, ethnographic work, replication studies, industry case studies). Studies may involve autonomous robots, Wizard of Oz methods, or no physical robot. The primary knowledge contribution is expected to be from the study itself.

#### Subthemes (for User Studies Track)

*   **Interpersonal Constructs:** Emotional, social, behavioral, and interpersonal aspects of HRI.
*   **Special Populations:** Robots supporting learning, therapy, care, or personal growth across the lifespan.
*   **Teams, Collaboration & Communication:** Task-based interaction and teamwork with robots.
*   **None:** If no subtheme is appropriate.

## Evaluation Criteria

Technical research papers must not exceed 12 pages (including references). Submissions will be evaluated by at least three program committee members. The evaluation will focus on the novelty, originality, importance to the field, proper use of research methods, and presentation of the submissions.

## Submission Instructions

Submitted papers must have been neither previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop.

All submissions must be in English and must come in A4 paper size PDF format and conform, at the time of submission, to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt font, LaTeX users must use `\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}` without including the compsoc or compsocconf option). Also, papers must comply with the IEEE Policy on Authorship. Submissions must be submitted electronically in PDF before the due date via HotCRP.

The Chairs reserve the right to reject submissions (without reviews) that are not in compliance or out of scope for the conference.

IMPORTANT: The APSEC 2025 technical research track will use a double-blind reviewing process, which means that submissions must not reveal the authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-blind reviewing process. Please read the APSEC 2025 double-blind instructions carefully before preparing your paper.

## Double-Blind Policy

The APSEC 2025 technical research track will use a double-blind reviewing process, which means that submissions must not reveal the authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-blind reviewing process. Submissions must adhere to the following rules:

*   Omit authors’ names and institutions from your title page.
*   References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not “We build on our previous work…” but rather “We build on the work of…”)
*   There may be cases in which the current submission is a clear follow up of one of your previous work, and despite what recommended in the previous point, reviewers will clearly associate authorship of such a previous work to the current submission. In this case, you may decide to anonymize the reference itself at submission time. For example: “based on previous results [10]” .. where the reference is reported as “[10] Anonymous Authors. Omitted for double blind reviewing.” In doing so, however, please make sure that the APSEC 2025 submission is self-contained and its content can be reviewed and understood without accessing the previous paper.
*   Do not include acknowledgements of people, grants, organizations, etc. that would give away your identity. You may, of course, add these acknowledgements in the camera-ready version.
*   In general, aim to reduce the risk of accidental unblinding. For example, if you use an identifiable naming convention for your work, such as a project name, use a different name for your submission, which you may indicate has been changed for the purposes of double-blind reviewing. This includes names that may unblind individual authors and their institutions. For example, if your project is called GoogleDeveloperHelper, which makes it clear the work was done at Google, for the submission version, use the name DeveloperHelper or BigCompanyDeveloperHelper instead.
*   Avoid revealing the institution affiliations of authors or at which the work was performed. For example, if the evaluation includes a user study conducted with undergraduates from the CS 101 class that you teach, you might say “The study participants consist of 200 students in an introductory CS course.” You can of course add the institutional information in the camera-ready. Similar suggestions apply for work conducted in specific organizations (e.g., industrial studies). In such cases, avoid mentioning the organization’s name. Instead, you may just refer to the organization as “Org” or “Company”, etc. When appropriate and when this does not help too much in revealing the company’s name, you might mention the context (e.g., financial organization, video game development company, etc.).

APSEC 2025 believes in open science and that open science aids reproducibility and replicability. To improve these factors we encourage authors to consider disclosing the source code and datasets used within their paper, including extractors, survey data, etc. By sharing this information your contribution will be more impactful because others can follow up on your work and of course cite it. But please avoid linking directly to code repositories or tool deployments which can reveal your identity. Instead of doing so, please consider using services such as zenodo.org, figshare.com, which provide DOIs and support anonymous and semi-anonymous methods of archiving software and datasets. Archive.org is also recommended for the dissemination of larger datasets. These archived and anonymized datasets should be linked within the paper itself.

## Preprint Policy

To ensure a fair and unbiased double-blind review process, authors submitting papers to APSEC 2025 must comply with the following guidelines regarding the handling of non-anonymized versions. A non-anonymized version is considered any publicly available document (e.g., on arXiv) that contains essentially the same scientific content as the submitted paper, even if it differs in minor ways such as the title, paper structure or organization, length or formatting.

**Preprints Posted Before the Anonymity Period**

Authors are permitted to make a non-anonymized version of their paper publicly available before the anonymity period. The anonymity period starts one month before the submission deadline and ends when the paper is accepted, rejected, or withdrawn. However, in such cases, authors are responsible for minimizing the risk that reviewers can trivially link the submitted paper to a public version.

Specifically, authors must:

*   Take care to prevent the submitted manuscript from being associated with the non-anonymized version.
*   Not make the non-anonymized version easily discoverable via search engines by reusing distinctive phrases (e.g., title, keywords) from the submitted manuscript.
*   Not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period.
*   Not actively promote the non-anonymized version (e.g., via social media, blogs, or mailing lists).
*   Not reference, cite, or link to any non-anonymized version within the submitted manuscript.

**Post-Publication Preprint Policy According to IEEE Guidelines**

Upon acceptance and publication of a paper by IEEE, authors must update any publicly available non-anonymized version of the paper in one of the following ways:

*   Replace it with the full IEEE citation, including the Digital Object Identifier (DOI), or
*   Post the accepted version of the paper (i.e., the author’s final version prior to IEEE formatting), along with the DOI. The IEEE-published version must not be posted.

IEEE will provide each author with a preprint version of the article that includes the DOI, the IEEE copyright notice, and a statement confirming that the article has been accepted for publication by IEEE. Authors may post this preprint version in accordance with IEEE’s posting guidelines.

## Important Dates

*   Abstract Deadline (Optional): **July 13, 2025 (Extended)**
*   Paper Deadline: **July 20, 2025 (Extended)**
*   Author Notification: **September 20, 2025 (Extended)**

## Submission Categories

We solicit submissions in two categories:

*   **Technical Research Papers:** Describe innovative research in automating software development or automating support to users engaged in software development activities.
*   **Experience Papers:** Describe a significant experience in applying automated software engineering technology.

## Review Criteria

Each Technical Research paper will be evaluated based on:

*   **Significance:** The extent to which the paper’s contributions can impact the field of software engineering in practice or in research, and under which assumptions (if any).
*   **Novelty:** The extent to which the contributions are sufficiently original with respect to the state-of-the-art.
*   **Soundness:** The extent to which the paper’s key claims are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods.

Each Experience paper will be evaluated based on:

*   **Importance and Scope:** The extent to which the paper describes a problem of practical importance, explains how the problem was investigated, and in what context.
*   **Insights and Evidence:** The extent to which the paper’s conclusions are supported by evidence, and new insights, best practices, tools, or software processes are explained.
*   **Perspective:** The extent to which the paper identifies and discusses important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience

Additionally, the following criteria apply for both submission categories:

*   **Verifiability:** The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to understand how the evidence for key claims in the paper was produced, and how the paper supports independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions.
*   **Presentation:** The extent to which the paper’s quality of writing meets the high standards of ASE, including clear descriptions, adequate use of the English language, absence of major ambiguity, clearly readable figures and tables, and adherence to the formatting instructions provided below.

The outcome of each paper will be one of the following: Accept, Revision, Reject.

## Originality

Papers submitted to ASE 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere when being considered for ASE 2025. Authors should be aware of the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ.

## Double Anonymous Review Process

The ASE 2025 Research Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. 

Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the Q&A page.

## Artifact Availability and Supplementary Material

We actively support and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability. 

[Blog post on disclosing data for double-blind review](https://ineed.coffee/5205/how-to-disclose-data-for-double-blind-review-and-make-it-archived-open-data-upon-acceptance/)

## ACM Policy on Research Involving Humans

If work reported in the paper involves human subjects, authors will be required to affirm compliance with the [ACM Policy on Research Involving Humans](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

## Formatting and Submission Guidelines

Abstracts and papers must be submitted electronically through the ASE 2025 HotCRP submission site: [https://ase25.hotcrp.com/](https://ase25.hotcrp.com/). All submissions must be in English.

All submissions must be in PDF format and conform, at time of submission, to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use `\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}` without including the compsoc or compsocconf option).

Submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, including all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Up to two additional pages containing ONLY references are permitted. Submissions that do not adhere to these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review.

Experience papers should contain the phrase “experience paper” prominently in the abstract, to ensure that they are evaluated appropriately.

## Accepted Papers

Accepted papers will be permitted an additional page of content to allow authors to incorporate review feedback. The page limit for published papers will therefore be 11 pages (including all figures, tables, appendices) plus 2 pages containing only references. Note that all submitted papers must conform to the 10+2 requirement, described above.

We strongly encourage authors of accepted papers to archive the research artifacts associated with their ASE papers, including code and data, in a repository with a DOI.

If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to register for ASE 2025 and present the paper.

It is a prestigious forum for researchers and practitioners in Business Process Management, embracing interdisciplinary perspectives from computer science, information systems engineering, and management.","# BPM 2025: Call for Research Papers

The International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM) is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners in the field of BPM. The conference embraces the interdisciplinary nature of BPM, bringing together contributions from computer science, information systems engineering, and information systems management.

## Conference Tracks

The BPM conference is structured into three tracks:

*   **Track I: Foundations**
    *   Focuses on the underlying principles of BPM, including formal methods, algorithms, and conceptual models.
    *   Empirical evaluation is not mandatory, but technical quality and the potential to lay out new ways of modeling, analyzing, and improving BPM systems are essential.
*   **Track II: Engineering**
    *   Deals with engineering aspects of BPM research, including the development and investigation of artifacts and systems that aim to solve concrete problems in business environments.
    *   Requires rigorous and reproducible empirical evaluations to demonstrate the merits of the introduced artifact.
*   **Track III: Management**
    *   Focuses on the empirical, socio-technical, cognitive, psychological, managerial, and societal aspects of BPM.
    *   Seeks contributions that propose novel organizational and technology-enabled modes of BPM or advance our understanding of how organizations can develop process-oriented capabilities.

Submitting author teams are advised to pay special attention to the typical audiences for the contributions from each of the tracks. This will help them to select the right track for their work and shape their work according to the expectations from that audience.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

The BPM community is committed to the promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in all aspects of our professional activities. We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience.

## Open Science Principles

The BPM conference encourages authors of research papers to follow the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. In particular, the conference supports the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourages authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data in order to increase reproducibility and replicability.

Authors are asked to include in their manuscript links to private or public repositories where reviewers can find the research artifacts associated with the paper.

Those accepted papers that include research artifacts or datasets available on a publicly accessible archival repository with a DOI will be awarded with an “Artifacts Available” badge that will be included in the camera-ready version of the paper.

Authors are encouraged to self-archive their pre- and post-prints in open, preserved repositories, such as their institutional preprint repository, arXiv or other non-profit services, in line with Springer’s copyright agreement (see License to Publish form for LNCS, CCIS or LNBIP, §3)

## Submission Guidelines

*   Each paper must be submitted to exactly one track.
*   Papers must be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS formatting guidelines.
*   Submissions must be in English and cannot exceed 16 pages including references and appendices.
*   The title page must contain a short abstract clarifying the relation of the paper with the topics above.
*   Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the [BPM 2025 EasyChair submission site](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2025).
*   Submissions must be original contributions that have neither been published previously nor submitted to other conferences or journals while being submitted to BPM 2025.

## Double-Blind Review

BPM 2025 reviews are double blind. Thus, neither reviewers nor authors should be able to identify each other.

Papers including information that allows the identification of authors may be rejected at the discretion of the PC chairs.

## Awards

The BPM conference will recognize the best papers submitted to the conference with an award in two different categories:

*   Best paper award
*   Best student paper award

Papers eligible for the best student paper award are those whose contribution is carried out mainly by one or more (Ph.D.) student(s).

## BPM Forum

Papers that do not fully meet the quality criteria for the main conference, but make a significant contribution to the community, will be invited for presentation at the BPM Forum. Those papers make interesting contributions and will be published in full length in a separate post-proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP) series.

## Key Dates

*   **Paper Abstract submission:** 4 March 2025
*   **Paper submission:** 18 March 2025

## Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers

This year, CC will offer a second category of papers called “**Tools and Practical Experience**”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies. The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper.

The selection criteria for papers in this category are:

*   **Originality**
*   **Usability**
*   **Documentation**
*   **Benchmark Repository**
*   **Availability**
*   **Foundations**
*   **Artifact Evaluation**

## Double-Blind Reviewing Process

CC uses a double-blind reviewing process. Authors will need to identify any potential conflicts of interest with PC, as defined in the SIGPLAN policy.

To facilitate the double-blind reviewing process, submissions (including supplementary material) should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).

## Artifact Evaluation

Authors are encouraged to submit their artifacts for the Artifact Evaluation (AE). The Artifact Evaluation process begins after the acceptance notification and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers.

## Important Dates

All Deadlines are AoE (UTC-12h)

*   **Submission deadline:** Tue 5 Nov 2024
*   **Abstract deadline:** Tue 12 Nov 2024
*   **Author notification:** Wed 11 Dec - Fri 13 Dec 2024

## Dual Submission Policy

Submitting papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences is not allowed.

## Authorship Policy

Before paper submission, authors are advised to review ACM’s authorship policy carefully: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship).

## Submission Guidelines

Please submit papers through the [Precision Conference Submission Portal](https://new.precisionconference.com/).

*   **Revise and Resubmit:** CHI 2026 Papers will continue with a revise and resubmit phase for papers above a certain threshold.
*   **Paper Length:**
    *   Short Papers: Submissions of 5,000 words or less.
    *   Standard-Length Papers: Submissions between 5,000 and 12,000 words.
    *   Submissions of more than 12,000 words will be desk-rejected if their length is not justified.
*   A paper must be stand-alone. All important information must be in the main paper.
*   Paper submissions must follow the [SIGCHI Guide to an Accessible Submission](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/accessibility/).
*   Authors should ensure their work and writing are as inclusive as possible.
*   Your submission must be anonymized; please ensure that your submission conforms to the [Anonymization Policy](https://chi2026.acm.org/chi-anonymization-policy/).
*   Use the correct [template](https://chi2026.acm.org/chi-publication-formats/) ; a single-column format must be used for the reviewing phase.
*   Where relevant, authors are strongly encouraged to provide supplementary materials to support practices around research reproducibility as much as possible.

## ACM Open

All CHI 2026 papers will be published under ACM Open.

Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs).

Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC to publish their papers, unless they qualify for a financial or discretionary waiver. To find out whether an APC applies to your article, please consult the list of participating institutions in ACM Open and review the APC Waivers and Discounts Policy.

Understanding that this change could present financial challenges, ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition:

*   **$250 APC for ACM/SIG members**
*   **$350 for non-members**

## Publication Policies & Requirements

Authors must review ACM’s publications policies. Please read [this separate page](https://chi2026.acm.org/acm-publication-policies/) for them.

## Policy on Use of Large Language Models

Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text. Please review the [April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) before using these tools. The [SIGCHI blog post](https://medium.com/sigchi/acm-publications-policy-guidance-for-sigchi-venues-87332173aad1) describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools, which we refer to for guidance.

## Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects

Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. Please also see the 2021 ACM Publications policy on [research involving humans](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects) before submitting.

## Video Presentations

Authors can optionally upload a video presentation (a presentation video of your accepted work) by the video presentation deadline of **Thursday, March 12, 2026.** See [technical requirements for video content at CHI](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/videos/) for guidance when preparing a video presentation.

Papers should be formatted in the ACM Proceedings Style (using sigconf from [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)) and submitted via the conference submission website.

Submitted papers must be original work that has not appeared in and is not under consideration for another conference or a journal.

## Anonymizing Submissions

HPDC uses dual-anonymous (identities of reviewers and authors are not shared) reviewing. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of the author names.

## HPDC Policy on the use of AI

HPDC permits the use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants) to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you use these services merely for language rectification. The authors should verify whether the results are accurate before submission. Only the authors are fully responsible and accountable for the contents of their papers. AI tools are not eligible for authorship.

The use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text should have a citation to the AI system used in the acknowledgments section. The acknowledgment section should still follow the dual-anonymous submission guideline (i.e., any author-related information should not be included).

The International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) is the premier forum for new research results on the theory and applications of planning and scheduling technology. The 35th edition of the ICAPS conference series will be held in **Melbourne, Victoria (Australia), from November 9th to 14th, 2025**.

The program committee of ICAPS 2025 invites paper submissions on all aspects of automated planning and scheduling.

Contributions are welcome in each of the following categories:

*   Theoretical papers
*   Algorithmic papers
*   Modelling papers
*   Position papers
*   Tools papers

All submissions to the main technical track must be classified in terms of one or more high-level topics, and one or more relevant subject-matter keywords, which are available from the [ICAPS 2025 homepage](organisation/paper_classification_system).

## Key Dates

The reference timezone for all deadlines is UTC-12. That is, the deadline has not passed as long as there is still time anywhere in the world.

*   **October 1, 2024** - Submission site opens
*   **October 25, 2024** - Abstracts due
*   **November 1, 2024** - Full papers due (electronic submission, PDF)
*   **November 15, 2024** - Desk reject notification
*   **December 16, 2024** - Phase 1 author notification
*   **January 27-31, 2024** - Author feedback period
*   **February 28, 2025** - Phase 2 author notification

## Author Guidelines

All types of papers can be submitted as either long (8 pages AAAI style plus one page of references) or short (4 pages plus one page of references). Whether the paper is long or short must be indicated at submission time.

Over-length papers will be rejected without review. A paper is over-length whenever content other than the ethical impacts statement or acknowledgements section appears on page 9 (resp. Page 5) of long (resp. short) papers.

All papers that satisfy length and formatting requirements will be reviewed against standard criteria such as relevance, originality, significance, clarity, and soundness. Submissions are expected to meet the high standards of publication expected by ICAPS.

The review process has three possible outcomes:

1.  acceptance for oral presentation and inclusion in the archival proceedings of the ICAPS conference series;
2.  acceptance for poster presentation and non-archival extended abstract, for dissemination via the ICAPS 2025 website;
3.  rejection.

Papers submitted to ICAPS 2025 may not be submitted to other conferences or journals during the ICAPS 2025 review period, nor may they be already under review, accepted, or published in other conferences or journals.

Authors making multiple submissions must ensure that each submission has significant, unique content. Papers sharing co-authors and substantial overlap will be rejected. In case of doubt, please contact the program chairs of ICAPS 2025 before submission.

The format of ICAPS 2025 will be in-person. As such, we expect at least one author of each accepted paper to register for the conference and present their work in person, unless exceptional circumstances prevent this.

## Use of Generative AI

ICAPS 2025 continues the policy adopted in 2024 regarding using large-scale language models (LLMs) and other so-called “Generative AI” tools. Papers that include text generated from an LLM are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. We stress that this policy DOES NOT prohibit authors from using these technologies for editing or polishing author-written text.

This policy is in line with [standing AAAI policy](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/policies-for-aaai-25-authors) in that no AI system satisfies the criteria for authorship of papers published by AAAI Press (ICAPS’ publisher) and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in such papers.

Authors assume full responsibility for the content of submitted work, including checking for plagiarism and authenticity of all text.

## Ethical / Societal Impact

Authors are encouraged to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This statement can be included in either the main body pages or the reference page.

## Best Paper Awards and Journal Fast Track

Following the ICAPS tradition, we will award the best non-student and student papers. These papers may also receive an invitation to submit an extended version to a top AI journal, such as the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) or the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ).

## Submission Instructions

All submissions will be made electronically via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=icaps-conference.org/ICAPS/2025/Conference). Submitted papers must be anonymous for double-blind reviewing, must adhere to the page limits of the relevant submission type (long or short), and must follow the author kit instructions for formatting. We use a slightly modified version of the AAAI 2025 author kit that can be found [following this link](/files/icaps2025-author-kit.zip).

Authors can submit supplementary material (videos, technical proofs, additional experimental results) in addition to the PDF paper they submit.

Failure to comply with the submission instructions above will result in desk rejection.

## Double-blind requirements

Double-blind requirements are satisfied whenever authors omit their names and institutions, refer to prior work by themselves or others in the third person, and ensure that the acknowledgement notices or ethics statements do not include information that may identify them. We do not discourage authors from posting their manuscripts onto Arxiv.org or other similar repositories.

*   The first 12 pages of the submission (excluding the title page) should be enough to assess the paper and contain a summary of the main results, their motivation and importance, and evidence of their correctness.
*   Results previously published in conference proceedings or a journal (or scheduled for publication prior to IPEC) or under simultaneous submission will not be considered.

### Double-Blind Reviewing

IPEC 2025 employs a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person. Authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.

### Conflicts of Interest

Authors are responsible for declaring conflicts of interest with any of the PC members. You have a conflict of interest with:

*   family members and close friends;
*   Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years;
*   people with the same affiliation;
*   involved in an alleged incident of harassment (it is not required that the incident be reported);
*   reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter); and
*   frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.

## Conference and Paper Publication

Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the symposium and to incorporate the comments from the program committee.

The conference proceedings will be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series after the conference (post-proceedings).

The final submission will be made in LIPIcs format, with a higher page limit of 15 pages plus bibliography (no appendix).

## Awards

A best paper award and a best student paper award may be conferred.

Submissions of which all authors are students at the time of submission are also eligible for the best student paper award. Papers meeting the requirement for the best student paper award should indicate this during submission.

During the IPEC conference, the [IPEC Nerode Prize](https://eatcs.org/index.php/nerode-prize) will be conferred.

ASPLOS (the ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems) is the premier academic forum for multidisciplinary applied computer systems research spanning hardware, software, and their interaction. It focuses on practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and associated areas such as networking and storage. ASPLOS 2026 will be held in **Pittsburgh, USA, from March 22-26, 2026**.

## Program Chairs

*   Benjamin C. Lee, University of Pennsylvania
*   Harry Xu, University of California Los Angeles
*   Mark Silberstein, Technion – Israel Institute of Technology

## Important Dates

ASPLOS 2026 has moved to two submission deadlines – spring and summer – which are meant to encourage authors to submit their papers when they are ready.

### Spring Cycle

*   **Abstract submission:** March 05, 2025 (11:59pm Eastern)
*   **Full paper submission:** March 12, 2025

*   **Notification:** Nov 24, 2025

## Submission Website

*   [Spring Cycle HotCRP](https://asplos26-spring.hotcrp.com/)

## Scope and Expectations

The scope of ASPLOS 2026 covers all practical aspects related to computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems, as well as closely-related associated areas. We seek original, high-quality research submissions that improve and further the knowledge of applied computer systems, with emphasis on the intersection between the main ASPLOS disciplines:

*   Operating Systems
*   Programming Languages
*   Computer Architecture
*   Emerging Hardware

Research submission may be applicable to computer systems of any scale, ranging from small, ultra-low power wearable devices to large scale parallel computers and data centers.

Alphabetically sorted areas of interest related to practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems include but are not limited to:

*   Existing, emerging, and nontraditional compute platforms at all scales
*   Heterogeneous architectures and accelerators
*   Internet services, cloud computing, and datacenters
*   Memory, storage, networking, and I/O
*   Power, energy, and thermal management
*   Profiling, debugging, and testing
*   Security, reliability, and availability
*   Systems for enabling parallelism and computation on big data
*   Virtualization and virtualized systems

## Explicit Assessment of Interdisciplinary Research

The interdisciplinary nature of the paper will serve a significant factor when considering paper acceptance. At the time of the submission we will ask the authors to identify and briefly justify the core disciplines the paper contributes the most. Papers with a single specified discipline are less likely to appear in the conference. In addition, reviewers will be asked to assess the paper relevance to the declared disciplines and low relevance scores will affect the chances of acceptance. If the PC decides that the paper does not fit the selected disciplines at all, it will be rejected without review.

## Resubmissions

Authors of resubmitted work from ASPLOS or other venues must describe in a separate note the changes since the previous submission(s). This description helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit this document to one page.

Submissions rejected from ASPLOS must not be submitted to the next subsequent review cycles and will be desk-rejected otherwise. Thus

*   The papers rejected from ASPLOS’26 Spring may be submitted to ASPLOS’27 Spring
*   The papers rejected from ASPLOS’26 Summer may be submitted to ASPLOS’27 Summer

## Limit on the Number of Submissions by the Same Author

The number of submissions by the same author will be limited to 5 submissions per submission cycle. The submissions will be screened after the deadline, and violating authors will be requested to withdraw their submissions until the limit is met.

## Major Revisions

In addition to Accept and Reject outcomes, ASPLOS 2026 will offer some submissions a “Major Revision” decision. The authors of such submissions will be given the opportunity to apply a major revision to their work and resubmit it at the camera ready deadline (6 weeks from notification).

Revised submissions can use 13 pages (the same length as camera-ready versions, and 2 pages more than the original submission). The additional length is intended to let authors address the revision requirements.

Notifications of  major revisions will occur no later than two months after the revision submission deadline.

## Declaring Areas and Topics

Authors should indicate on the submission form the focused topics matching their work. The selection should be as accurate as possible, and include at most 3 topics. These will be used for reviewer assignments. Incorrect topic selection will result in assigning the paper to less competent reviewers.

## Anonymization

ASPLOS employs a double-blind review process, keeping author identities concealed from reviewers and vice versa. You must therefore make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission.

## Anonymized Supplemental Material and Appendixes

Supplemental material and Appendixes may be submitted as part of the submission file and have no  page limit. The submission must be self-contained within the page limit, and the supplemental material/appendixes should not be used as a way to circumvent this limit. The reviewers are neither required nor encouraged to read such material when making their decision.

## Declaring Conflicts of Interest

Authors must register all their conflicts in their HotCRP submission page. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a submission is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem or if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the submission will be summarily rejected.

## Declaring Authors

Declare all the authors of the submission upfront. Addition/removal of authors once the submission is accepted will have to be approved by the program chairs, since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for reviewer assignment.

## Originality and Concurrent Submissions

By submitting a manuscript to ASPLOS, the authors guarantee that the manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any conference, journal, or workshop.

## Ethical and Other Obligations

Authors are not allowed to break anonymity when interacting with known ASPLOS PC/ERC members, e.g., by mentioning/identifying work that they plan to submit to ASPLOS or have already submitted and is currently under review.

Authors must abide by the ACM ethics policy ([https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)).

## Formatting and Editing

Submissions must be printable PDF files. When creating your submission, you must use the sigplan proceedings template of ACM’s acmart Latex class available on the official ACM site.

## Page Layout and Limit

Full submissions must not exceed 11 pages of single-spaced two-column text. This page limit applies to all text, figures, tables, and footnotes. The only exceptions are the bibliographic references section and the appendices, which are not included in the page limit.

## Page Limit of Accepted Papers and Major Revisions

The authors of an accepted paper are allowed to use +2 pages in the camera-ready version beyond the aforementioned page limit. The same applies to major revisions, to accommodate added experiments and such.

## Font Size, Tables, and Figures

The submission’s text must use a 10pt font (not 9pt) or bigger. Labels, captions, and text within figures, graphs, and tables must use reasonable font sizes that, as printed, do not require extra magnification beyond “100%” to be legible.

## References

Because references do not count against the page limit, the space they occupy should not be “optimized” away. Notably, the full, non-abbreviated first and last names of all co-authors of all citations must be specified (no “et al.”). The reference citations within the submission (numbers in square brackets) should be hyperlinked to the corresponding items in the references section, to ease the job of reviewers.

Submissions that violate any of these restrictions might be rejected without being reviewed.

## Author Response Period

ASPLOS 2026 will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting; see exact dates specified above. Authors should generally focus their rebuttal on (1) correcting factual errors in the reviews and (2) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Authors are not allowed to attach files to the rebuttal HotCRP comment.

## Accepted Papers

Submissions selected by the program committee will be conditionally accepted, subject to revision and approval by a committee member acting as a shepherd. Accepted papers will be allowed two additional pages in the proceedings (and up to two more with a fee of $200 per page). We expect that one author of each accepted paper will physically attend the conference and present the work in a dedicated time slot.

ACM requires that all authors of accepted papers will adhere to the following policy. Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.

## Artifact Evaluation

Artifact evaluation will continue in 2026 as has become a tradition at ASPLOS. Please refer to the ASPLOS 2026 AEC web page for more information.

## Poster and Lightning Sessions

In addition to the regular presentations, the program may include poster and lightning sessions. If those are included, details can be found here when they become available.

## Wild and Crazy Ideas Session

The program will also tentatively include a WACI session. Details will become available later.

## Best Paper Award

The committee will select a handful of papers to receive a Best Paper Award.

## Confidentiality

All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

The 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE) is the leading conference on software reliability, focusing on approaches, techniques, and tools for assessing, predicting, and improving the reliability, safety, and security of software systems.

ISSRE 2025 introduces ***Early Decisions***. At the beginning of the author response period, authors will be notified with the following outcomes: ""Accept"", ""Reject"", or ""Response Recommended"".

The research track at ISSRE 2025 invites high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results exploring new scientific ideas, contributing new evidence to established research directions, or reflecting on practical experience. ISSRE solicits submissions in three categories: (1) full research regular (REG) papers, (2) practical experience reports (PER), and (3) tools and artefacts (TAR) papers.

## Paper Categories

Submissions can be made in one of the following categories:

*   **REG papers:** 12 pages (including references).
*   **PER papers:** 12 pages (including references).
*   **TAR papers:** 6 - 10 pages (including references).

Papers that exceed the number of pages for that submission category will be rejected without review.

*   Dependability attributes (i.e., security, safety, maintainability, survivability, resilience, robustness) impacting software reliability
*   Reliability threats, i.e. faults (defects, bugs, etc.), errors, failures
*   Reliability means (fault prevention, fault removal, fault tolerance, fault forecasting)
*   Software testing and formal methods
*   Software fault localization, debugging, root-cause analysis
*   Metrics, measurements and threat estimation for reliability prediction and the interplay with safety/security
*   Reliability of autonomous systems and (self-)adaptive systems
*   Reliability of AI-based systems, AI for Reliability Engineering
*   Reliability of Large Language/Foundational Model (LLM) and LLM for software reliability
*   Reliability of software services and Software as a Service (SaaS)
*   Reliability of model-based and auto-generated software
*   Reliability of open-source software
*   Reliability of software dealing with Big Data
*   Reliability of green and sustainable systems
*   Reliability of mobile systems
*   Reliability of software within specific technological spaces (e.g., Internet of Things, Cloud, Semantic Web/Web 3.0, Virtualization, Blockchain, networks softwarization, 5G/6G, edge-to-cloud computing)
*   Normative/regulatory/ethical spaces about software reliability
*   Societal aspects of software reliability

## Paper types

Papers submitted to CGO can be standard research papers, tools papers or practical experience papers. All must be written in the IEEE conference format (use the conference mode), and may have up to 10 pages, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 10 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. In other words, papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

Please be mindful of the [IEEE publishing policies](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/author-center/publishing-policies) when preparing and submitting your article.

### Tool papers

Tool papers must give a clear account of a new tool’s functionality. They must describe the problem that the tool helps to solve, how the tool works and provide an evaluation of the tool. There does not have to be novel research in the way the tool works, but it does have to solve a novel problem or in a novel (and better) way compared to existing tools.

Tools paper authors should prepend their paper title with ‘Tool:’ to provide clarity that this is a tools paper during the review process (this can be removed for the final camera-ready paper).

The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper. Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.

### Practical experience papers

Practical experience papers should summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies. They must make it clear where the novelty in the work comes from, which could be from applying known techniques to a new system (with novel features), from finding new ways to implement existing analyses or transformations in a unique way, or from applying established schemes to draw new conclusions about them.

Practical experience paper authors should prepend their paper title with ‘Practical:’ to provide clarity that this is a practical experience paper during the review process (this can be removed for the final camera-ready paper).

Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.

## Geographic Diversity and Inclusion

Authors of papers accepted for CGO 2026 are encouraged to present their work in person. However, to foster the participation of students and professionals from everywhere, CGO 2026 will allow the remote presentation of papers, if their authors are unable to travel to the conference venue for reasons beyond their control (e.g. visa issues). Additionally, the conference organization will try to make attendance of CGO 2026 affordable for as many people as possible, with a specific focus on students from universities located in under-represented countries who are paper authors.

## Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings.

## Distinguished Paper Awards

Up to 10% of papers accepted at CGO 2026 will be designated as Distinguished Papers, following the ACM policy. This award is open to both regular and tool papers.

## Submission Information

### Submission Site

Papers can be submitted at [https://cgo26-first-round.hotcrp.com/](https://cgo26-first-round.hotcrp.com/).

The Twenty-sixth International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (ACM HotMobile 2025) will be held **February 26-27, 2025** in **Palm Springs, CA**.

ACM HotMobile 2025 continues the series of highly selective, interactive workshops focused on mobile applications, systems, and environments, as well as their underlying state-of-the-art technologies. HotMobile's small workshop format makes it ideal for presenting and discussing new directions or controversial approaches.

## Call for Posters and Demos

HotMobile seeks proposals for posters and live demonstrations describing novel work on mobile systems, applications, and services. Posters and demonstrations will be presented during a reception at the workshop.

The poster/demo session is meant to introduce new or ongoing work and provide opportunities for authors to interact directly with workshop attendees. Posters are well suited to controversial work that can generate discussion or promising new ideas that have not been thoroughly evaluated. Live demos provide an opportunity to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of your research.

Accepted posters and demos will be published in the proceedings. This year's poster/demo session will feature a Best Poster/Demo award.

### Submission Guidelines for Posters and Demos

Submissions must include an extended abstract no longer than one 8.5x11-inch page, including all figures and references. The poster/demo should be uploaded to [https://hotmobile25-posterdemo.hotcrp.com/](https://hotmobile25-posterdemo.hotcrp.com/).

Please set up your page to be US letter size, 8.5x11 inches, two columns, using 10-pt font size for the text body, with at least one-inch margin on all sides. Submissions must be in Adobe PDF format. Please include the title of the poster/demo and the author list, including affiliations in both the PDF file and in the body of the email. Prefix your title with “Poster:” for a poster submission and “Demo:” for a demo submission. Please do not anonymize your submissions. The accepted posters and demos will need to submit a one-page version using 9-pt font size, which will provide more space for authors to accommodate reviewer feedback.

For demo submissions, we encourage the submission of an optional companion video that illustrates the demo. The companion video should highlight the technical contributions of the demo and should be no more than one minute in length. Include the YouTube URL of the companion video in the extended abstract.

### Important Dates for Posters and Demos

Submission deadline (extended): **January 20th, 2025 – AOE**

Notification of acceptance: **January 22nd, 2025**

Camera-ready deadline: **January 24th, 2025**

## Call for Papers

We solicit submissions of papers that (1) focus primarily on systems and applications and (2) propose new directions of research, advocate non-traditional approaches to old (or new) ideas, or generate controversy and discussion. We especially encourage papers that identify fundamental open questions, advocate a new approach, offer a constructive critique of the state-of-the-art, debunk existing assumptions, report unexpected early results, report on promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Novel ideas need not be supported by full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations suffice.

We take a broad view of Mobile Systems research. This includes:

*   Novel applications, environments, and devices supporting mobility.
*   Operating system and distributed system support for mobile computing.
*   Wearable computing, internet of things, edge computing, sensing, and context-awareness.
*   HCI issues related to mobile computing.
*   Security and privacy of mobile computing.
*   Management, configuration, and deployment of systems supporting mobility.
*   Wireless technology, as it pertains to mobile systems and applications.
*   Social issues related to mobile computing.
*   System and application support for the use of ML and AI on mobile platforms.

### Submission Guidelines for Papers

Submissions should contain 6 or fewer U.S. letter pages in PDF format, including all references, figures and tables. The submissions should not be anonymous. The submissions must meet the following formatting requirements:

*   Font size no smaller than 10pt.
*   Font size of the bibliography no smaller than 9pt.
*   Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column.
*   Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches x 11 inches).

We recommend the use of the ""sigconf"" ACM proceedings template, available at: [http://www.acm.org/](http://www.acm.org/), with the font size of the main body amended to 10pt. An example Tex document can be found [here](http://hotmobile.org/2018/downloads/sample-sigconf.tex).

Please note that it is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that the submissions are meeting all formatting requirements.

Submit your papers at the HotMobile 2025 submission server.

### Important Dates for Papers

Hard deadline for submissions: **October 11th, 2024, 11:59pm AoE**

Acceptance notification: **December 16th, 2024**

Presenting at HotMobile is a good way to get early feedback on research ideas at least one year away from a full-fledged conference submission to ACM MobiSys or other high-quality conferences. A full-length paper on the same topic submitted to a conference in less than a year is unlikely to include sufficient new material and mature ideas to warrant publication.

As is customary, papers must not have been published elsewhere and may not be simultaneously under submission at another venue. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be returned to the author(s) unread. As customary with the scientific peer review process, submissions will be handled as confidential material during the review.",

The conference welcomes talks presenting results in all areas of combinatorial optimization and its applications. Each talk must have been submitted following the instructions on this web. Each submission will be evaluated (accepted or rejected) by members of the Program Committee. ISCO2024 admitted two types of submissions:

*   **Extended abstracts** (up to 3 pages).
    *   The submission deadline was **29 February 2024** before 23:59 (CET). Accepted ""extended abstracts"" will be published online on the conference website (and will not be included in the LNCS issue).
*   **Regular papers** (up to 12 pages).
    *   The submission deadline was **10 January 2024** before 23:59 (CET). Accepted ""regular papers"" will be published by Springer in a LNCS issue. For an accepted ""regular paper"" to be included in the LNCS issue, it should be presented at the conference by one of the authors who has to complete the conference registration (pay) before **31 March 2024**. It is not allowed to submit a ""regular paper"" that has been submitted to a journal or another conference with proceedings published before the ISCO 2024 notification date. The authors of accepted ""regular papers"" will have to complete and upload their camera-ready version by **15 April 2024**. Appendices are allowed only if they fit within the 12-page limit in total.
    *   Please, read the [Guidelines](https://ull.ticmeet.com/assets/archivos/df08491a-926f-43d1-9b69-3600c0a213c0/Guidelines_to_authors.pdf).
    *   Submissions not following these guidelines will not be considered.

Each submission was reviewed by three anonymous reviewers. The main acceptance criteria are the quality and originality of the results and their relevance to the community. A ""regular paper"" submission will not be considered in any of the following cases: (i) it has already been published; (ii) it is under review by a journal or another conference with proceedings; or (iii) if it is submitted after the submission deadline.

While a person can submit several works, only one accepted work can be presented by the same speaker at the conference.

In addition, each accepted work must be associated with (at least) one conference registration completed (paid) before the early registration deadline (31 March). Accepted submissions not associated with a complete and exclusive early conference registration will be excluded from the scientific program and from the proceedings.

The submission of ""regular papers"" and ""extended abstracts"" was managed using [EquinOCS](https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/conference-proceedings/online-conference-system) Springer Nature Conference Proceedings Submission System.

## Paper Submission:

**Conference submission site:** [https://ppopp26.hotcrp.com](https://ppopp26.hotcrp.com)

All submissions must be made electronically through the conference website and include an abstract (100–400 words), author contact information, the full list of authors and their affiliations. Full paper submissions must be in PDF format printable on both A4 and US letter-size paper.

All papers must be prepared in two-column ACM Conference Format, specifically the acmart document class (available here: [https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/)) with the sigplan option and 10-point font size. We recommend preparing your submission in Latex starting with the following template: [https://ppopp26.sigplan.org/getImage/orig/ppopp-acmart-sigplanproc-template.tex](https://ppopp26.sigplan.org/getImage/orig/ppopp-acmart-sigplanproc-template.tex) . This template ensures that there are no line numbers and headers in the margins to avoid triggering HotCRP’s format checker. Refrain from squeezing additional space by tweaking the template above, e.g., by manipulating vertical space, reducing margins, line spacing, heading space, column separation, etc. Ensure that caption fonts are at least 9 pt and all fonts in figures and tables are at least 8 pt. Program chairs will inspect submissions using format checking tools and reserve the right to reject submissions that violate the formatting rules. If you would like to use Word or other Latex template, please ensure that your submission follows all the formatting guidelines. You may want to consult the official ACM information on the Master Article Template and related tools.

Papers should contain a maximum of 10 pages of text and figures, but NOT INCLUDING references. There is no page limit for references, and they must include the names of all authors (not et al.) and spell out the publication year and venue (and not simply point to the doi link). Appendices are not allowed, but the authors may submit supplementary material, such as proofs or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.

Submission is double-blind, and authors will need to identify any potential conflicts of interest with PC and Extended Review Committee members, as defined here: [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/) (ACM SIGPLAN policy).

## Double-Blind Reviewing

PPoPP 2026 will employ a double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this process, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).

To facilitate fair and unbiased reviews for all submissions, PPoPP 2026 may utilize the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) to assign papers to reviewers. From the authors’ perspective, this decision means that the submissions may be uploaded to TPMS.

## Artifact Evaluation

To allow reproducibility, we encourage authors of accepted papers to submit their papers for Artifact Evaluation (AE). The AE process begins after the acceptance notification and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact evaluation is voluntary and will not affect paper acceptance but will be taken into consideration when selecting papers for awards. Papers that go through the AE process successfully will receive at least one ACM reproducibility badge, printed on the published version. More information will be posted on the AE website.

Deadlines expire at midnight anywhere on Earth.

## ACM Publications Policies:

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects)

Starting from January 2026, all ACM publications become Open Access. See [https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess) for details. Authors must be aware that the Article Processing Charges listed in the page applies to all accepted papers.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.

*   Presentation: is the paper clearly presented and well-structured? To what extent can the content of the paper be understood by the general RE public? If highly technical content is presented, did the authors make an effort to also summarise their study in an intuitive way?

## NEW from RE’25: RE Open Data Initiative

RE’25 launches the RE Open Data Initiative. This initiative aims to collect data from practitioners and researchers, which can be used by authors of all the tracks, including the Research Track, as evaluation data for their studies. 

Data will be released between December 2024 and the beginning of January 2025. For more information, click [here](https://conf.researchr.org/track/RE-2025/RE-2025-re-open-data-initiative).

## Open Science Policy

The RE 2025 Research Track has an open science policy with the steering principle that all research results should be accessible to the public and, if possible, empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. However, sharing is expected to be the default, and non-sharing needs to be justified.

## Formatting Instructions

The format of your paper must strictly adhere to the **IEEEtran Proceedings Format**. LaTeX users: please use the LaTeX class file IEEEtran v1.8 and the following configuration (without option ‘compsoc’ or ‘compsocconf’): `\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}`.

Word users: please use [this Word template](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/conferences/conference-template-letter.docx).

## Submission Instructions

Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the [RE’25 EasyChair system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=re25). Select the RE’25 Research Track for your submission.

In order to guide the reviewing process, all authors who intend to submit a paper must first submit the title and abstract. Abstracts should describe explicit coverage of context, objectives, methods, and results and conclusions, and should not exceed 200 words.

Papers must not exceed **10 pages** for the main body and up to 2 additional pages for the references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the [IEEE formatting instructions](https://conf.researchr.org/track/RE-2025/RE-2025-Research-Papers#Formatting-Instructions). Submissions must be double-blinded in conformance with the instructions below.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract submission:** March 3, 2025
*   **Full Paper Submission:** March 10, 2025
*   **Notification:** May 23, 2025
*   **Camera Ready:** June 23, 2025

## Instructions for the Double-Blind Review Process

*   Omit all names and affiliations of authors from the title page, but keep sufficient space to re-introduce them in the final version should the paper be accepted.
*   Do not include any acknowledgements that might disclose your identity. Leave space in your submission to add such acknowledgements when the paper has been accepted.
*   Refer to your own work in the third person, as you would normally do with the work of others. You should not change the names of your own tools, approaches, or systems, since this would clearly compromise the review process; it would also violate the constraint that “no change is made to any technical details of the work”. Instead, refer to the authorship or provenance of tools, approaches, or systems in the third person, so that it is credible that another author could have written your paper. In particular, never blind references.
*   When providing supplementary material (e.g., tools, data repositories, source code, study protocols), do this via a website that does not disclose your identity. Please refer to the [Open Science Policy in the Call for Papers](https://conf.researchr.org/track/RE-2025/RE-2025-Research-Papers#Call-for-Papers) with guidelines on how to anonymize such content.
*   Adhere to instruction 3 when citing previously published own work.
*   Remove identification metadata from the PDF file before submission (in Adobe Acrobat Reader, you can check their presence with File Properties, or Ctrl-D).",

## Review Process

The review process will have two cycles.

### Review Cycle I (Submission to Initial notification)

Submissions will be assigned to two members of the VR 2026 International Program Committee (IPC): a coordinator (primary) and a secondary reviewer. Submissions that violate the submission guidelines or that receive low review scores from the coordinator and the secondary reviewer will be early rejected. This stage of the review process will be double blind. We will strive to have all other submissions receive a total of at least three reviews. Based on the reviews and in consultation with a subset of the IPC, the Program Chairs will make one of the following initial recommendations for each submission:

*   Conditionally accept as IEEE TVCG paper. Continuing our cooperation with the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG), the top submissions will be considered for publication in a special issue of IEEE TVCG.
*   Conditionally accept as conference paper. These submissions will be considered for inclusion in the Proceedings of IEEE VR, archived in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.
*   Recommend as a two-page poster. Authors of a submission receiving this recommendation have the option of condensing their submission into a two-page poster, including references. Subject to a final approval by the Posters chairs, accepted posters will be included in the IEEE VR Abstracts and Workshops proceedings and will be archived in the IEEE Digital Library. Note that IEEE VR does not consider posters as a final disclosure of research results. Thus, work accepted as an IEEE VR poster might be eligible for inclusion in future publications.
*   Reject.

### Review Cycle II (Initial notification to Final decision)

The revision of each conditionally accepted paper will be reviewed by its coordinator, who will make a final recommendation regarding acceptance. Should the conditions for acceptance not be met, the paper will be rejected.

## Additional Guidelines

*   **Abstract Submission:** A paper abstract must be uploaded seven days prior to the actual paper submission deadline.
*   **Ethics and Responsibility:** All submissions describing research experiments with human participants must follow the appropriate ethical guidelines required by the authors’ institution(s), and authors are required to secure and report their approval by the relevant ethics committee prior to collecting data.
*   **Participant Diversity:** All submissions describing research with human participants should strive for participant diversity.
*   **Review Duties for Authors:** For each submitted paper, one author will be required to register to review up to three papers through PCS at the time of submission.
*   **Presentation at the Conference:** All accepted submissions must be presented orally at the conference.
*   **Submission Language:** All paper submissions must be in English.
*   **Previous Publication and Plagiarism:** Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously published.
*   **AI-generated Text:** The use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section.
*   **Submission Anonymity:** IEEE VR uses a DOUBLE-BLIND review process.
*   **Pre-dissemination through public online repositories:** Uploading the submitted manuscript to an online repository (e.g., arXiv) before the end of the review process does not constitute a reason for rejecting the manuscript. However, the authors should be advised that doing so can compromise the anonymity of their manuscript and therefore bias its double-blind review.
*   **Videos:** Videos must be submitted according to the instructions on the submission website. Videos submitted with papers will automatically be considered for possible inclusion in the video proceedings (video submissions may also be made independently, as described in the separate Call for Videos).

Citations of the authors’ own published work (including online) must be in the third person, in a manner that is not traceable to the identity of the authors. For example, the wording “in [3], Mountain and River proposed…” is acceptable, whereas “in [3], we proposed…” is not. Here, reference [3] is listed explicitly as “Mountain, A. and River, A., Detecting Mountains and Rivers, In Proc. XYZ ’16, 721-741.” We welcome authors to extend their own existing non- or semi-archivable, as well as not-yet-peer-reviewed publications, such as extended abstracts. To avoid accusations of (self)plagiarism in these cases, we ask the authors to upload their work in a special field in PCS. These works can only be viewed by the submission coordinator.

Please note that failure to comply with any of the above requirements and guidelines will result in an automatic desk rejection of the paper!

## Contribution Types

We invite many types of research contributions, including interactive systems. However, evaluating systems that are built using existing techniques can be difficult. For example, a system can be built using a known machine-learning technique but it can enable entirely new functionality. In this case, reviewers will need to judge the novelty of the new functionality that the system enables without penalizing the work for leveraging an existing technique.

For reference, here’s a paper about evaluating interactive systems that reviewers and authors should both be familiar with:

James Fogarty (2017): Code and Contribution in Interactive Systems Research

We further accept studies that replicate known findings systematically to confirm or contradict previously found results.

## Supplementary Materials

Submissions may be (optionally) accompanied by additional materials such as images, videos, or electronic documents. These materials do not form a part of the official submission. They will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers. All content should be in a portable format that is unlikely to require the user to download additional programs. For example, you may prefer PDF or HTML for documents, PNG or JPEG for images, and QuickTime or MPEG for videos. The total file size for supplementary materials should not exceed a total of 50MB. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the additional material providing supplementary information or confirmation of results. It is, however, appropriate to refer to video footage in the paper.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

When designing and presenting user evaluations, please consider the following: User evaluations using non-representative or homogeneous participant populations can introduce biases in the results and conclusions. We recommend that researchers strive to use samples that are representative of the population for which the technology is being designed. If representative samples are not possible to collect, we recommend that the limitations of the population studied should be discussed within the paper and care must be taken when making claims about the findings. We recommend that participant demographic information should be reported for user evaluations so that future researchers understand the results based on the population studied.

## Accessibility

We ask authors to try to be as inclusive as possible when preparing a submission. For instance, please provide alt-text for figures and tables and make supplemental videos accessible with subtitles to enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. We recommend that authors read the SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission, as well as the SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos (especially the section “What accessibility considerations should I pay attention to when recording my video?”), which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning. If authors have difficulties with making their submissions accessible, they are encouraged to contact the VRST 2025 Accessibility Chairs by emailing [accessibility@vrst2025.org](mailto:accessibility@vrst2025.org).

## Policies

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference, and present their work in person at the conference. As the conference is in-person only, there will not be any opportunity to present remotely. Besides, it’s just so much better to meet your fellow XR enthusiasts in person!

All standing ACM policies apply to ACM VRST 2025.

*   [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) (which also contains statements regarding the use of generative AI)
*   [ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions)

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently committed to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

AUTHOR’S TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)

### Format

Two types of submissions are encouraged (reviewers will comment on whether the size is appropriate for each contribution), in the ACM two-column format:

*   **Long papers:** (8 pages at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) should report on substantial contributions of lasting value.
*   **Short papers:** (4 pages at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper.

It is recommended that supplementary material is linked to an external source using an anonymized link.

### Anonymity

*   Submissions must be anonymous, given that ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process.
*   Authors must omit their names and affiliations from submissions, and avoid obvious identifying statements.
*   Citations to the authors’ prior work should be made in the third person.
*   Failure to anonymize your submission could result in desk rejection.

### Templates

Following the ACM Publication Workflow, all authors should submit manuscripts for review in the ACM double-column format. Instructions for authors are given below:

*   **LaTeX:** Please use the latest version of the Primary Article Template – LaTeX to create your submission. Start the document with the `\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}` command to generate the output in a double-column format.
*   **Overleaf:** (use `\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}` for double-column). Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for [preparing your article with Overleaf](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/overleaf).
*   **Word:** Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for [preparing your article with Microsoft Word](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word), ignoring the single-column instructions and the single-column submission template. Please use the double-column Word template.

### Accessibility

Authors are strongly encouraged to provide “alt text” (alternative text) for floats (images, tables, etc.) in their content so that readers with disabilities can be given descriptive information for these floats that are important to the work. Moreover, authors should follow the [ACM Accessibility Recommendations for Publishing in Color](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/describing-figures) and SIG ACCESS guidelines on describing figures.

### Submission Policy

All submissions and reviews will be handled electronically. ACM UMAP has a no dual submission policy. Please consider the ACM’s publication policies regarding research involving human participants and subjects, and obtaining an ORCID ID.

## Review Process

*   ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process.
*   Authors must omit their names and affiliations from their submissions; they should also avoid obvious identifying statements.
*   Submissions not abiding by anonymity requirements will be desk rejected.
*   Reviewers will evaluate papers based on their significance, originality, rigor, and contribution to the field.
*   ACM UMAP 2025 will introduce a new rebuttal stage during evaluation.
*   The ACM Code of Ethics gives the ACM UMAP program committee the right to (desk-)reject papers that perpetuate harmful stereotypes, employ unethical research practices, or uncritically present outcomes/implications that disadvantage minority communities. Furthermore, reviewers will be explicitly asked to consider whether the research was conducted in compliance with professional ethical standards and applicable regulatory guidelines. Failure to do so could lead to a (desk-)rejection.

## Registration and Presentation Policy

*   Each accepted paper must be accompanied by a distinct full author registration, completed by the early registration date cut-off.
*   Each accepted paper must be presented in person to be included in the conference proceedings, published by ACM, and available via the ACM Digital Library. The official publication date is when the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library.

## Camera-ready Submission

Accepted papers will be subject to further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. We strongly recommend the usage of LaTeX/Overleaf for the camera-ready papers to minimize the extent of reformatting.

## Ethical & Human Subjects Considerations

ACM UMAP expects papers to include a discussion of the ethical considerations, as well as the impact of the presented work and/or its intended application, where appropriate. ACM UMAP further expects all authors to comply with ethical standards and regulatory guidelines associated with human subjects research, including research involving human participants and research using personally identifiable data. Papers reporting on such human subjects research must include a statement identifying any regulatory review the research is subject to (and identifying the form of approval provided), or explaining the lack of required review.

The 47th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval will be held **in-person** from **July 14th to 18th, 2024** in **Washington D.C., USA**.

SIGIR is the major international forum for presenting new research results and demonstrating new systems and techniques in Information Retrieval (IR).

## Important Dates for Full Papers

Time zone: Anywhere on Earth (AoE)

*   **Full paper abstracts due:** January 18, 2024
*   **Full papers due:** January 25, 2024
*   **Full paper notifications:** March 25, 2024

Full paper authors are required to submit an abstract by midnight January 18, 2024 AoE. Paper submission (deadline: midnight January 25, 2024 AoE) is not possible without a submitted abstract.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Full research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including the other tracks of SIGIR 2024).
*   Submissions must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 9 pages (including figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any content except references) in length, with unrestricted space for references, in the current ACM two-column conference format.
*   Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf templates are available from the [ACM Website](https://www.acm.org/) (use “sigconf” proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word).
*   ACM’s CCS concepts and keywords are required for review.
*   For LaTeX, the following should be used:
    `\documentclass[sigconf,natbib=true,anonymous=true]{acmart}`
*   Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir24](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir24)
*   At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, and the author(s) or their delegate(s) must present the work at the conference in person.
*   See this [brief checklist to strengthen an IR paper](https://sigir.org/sigir2022/checklist-to-strengthen-an-ir-paper/) for authors and reviewers.

## Anonymity and Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy

The full paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information; citations or discussion of your own prior work should be written up in third person form. It is acceptable to refer to companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments or deployed solutions if reviewers can not infer that the authors are currently affiliated with these organizations. You can submit to SIGIR 2024 papers that you have posted to pre-print/archival platforms (e.g. arXiv), or plan to post in the future, after submission. However, your paper must conform to the [SIGIR 2024 Pre-Print/ArXiv Policy](policy_arxiv.html). Breaking anonymity or pre-print/ArXiv policy puts the submission at risk of being desk rejected.

## Authorship Policy

Authors should carefully go through [ACM’s authorship policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) before submitting a paper. Please ensure that all authors are clearly identified in EasyChair before the submission deadline. To support the identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at abstract submission time. No changes to authorship will be permitted for the camera-ready submission under any circumstance or after the abstract submission deadline. So please, make sure you have them listed correctly at submission time.

## Desk Rejection Policy

Submissions that violate the anonymity, pre-print policy, length, or formatting requirements, or are determined to violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, author misrepresentation, falsification, etc., are subject to desk rejection by the chairs. Any of the following may result in desk rejection:

*   Figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgements, or any other content after page 9 of the submission.
*   Formatting not in line with the guidelines provided above.
*   Authors or authors’ institutional affiliations clearly named or easily discoverable.
*   Links to source code repositories that reveal author identities, or extended versions of the current paper. It is recommended to hold these for the final published version and [submit source code for artifact review](https://sigir.org/general-information/acm-sigir-artifact-badging/).
*   Change of authors after the abstract submission deadline.
*   Content that has been determined to have been copied from other sources.
*   Any form of academic fraud or dishonesty.
*   Lack of topical fit for SIGIR.

## Relevant Areas

Relevant areas include:

*   Search and Ranking
*   System, Efficiency and Scalability
*   Recommender Systems
*   Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing for IR
*   Conversational IR
*   Humans and Interfaces
*   Evaluation
*   Fairness, Accountability, Transparency, Ethics, and Explainability (FATE) in IR
*   Multi Modal IR
*   Domain-specific Applications
*   Other IR Topics

The Annual Meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (CogSci 2025) will be held from **July 30 – Aug 2, 2025**, in **San Francisco**, at the **Marriott Marquis**, offering both **In-Person & Virtual** participation options.

## General Information

CogSci 2025 will be fully hybrid with streaming of the entire program, except for workshops (which will all be in-person). Presenters can choose to present in-person in San Francisco or virtually, and virtual attendees will be able to view the entire program synchronously. Virtual talks will be presented synchronously throughout the program, and virtual posters will be available for asynchronous interaction via the conference app, as well as synchronous online interaction via video conferencing.

## Submission Categories

There are three categories of main conference submissions:

*   Research papers (presented as talks or posters)
*   Contributed symposia
*   Member abstracts

## Proceedings Publication

An online proceedings will be published by the Cognitive Science Society. At the time of final submission authors will be required to agree to release of their proceedings contribution under a CC-BY license. If your paper submission is accepted for presentation as a talk or as a poster, you will have the option of publishing just the abstract in the conference proceedings, rather than the full paper.

Submitted papers must be no more than 6 pages, plus an unlimited number of pages for references. Authors of accepted papers will have the opportunity to revise their submissions after the notification of decisions is sent (prior to the ‘final form’ proceedings-ready submissions deadline) and will be allowed unlimited space for references and acknowledgments (i.e., final submissions is 6 pages plus an unlimited amount of pages for references and acknowledgments).

To present a talk, you must submit a full research paper for review. If a submission is accepted, at least one author must both pre-register and attend the conference in order to have the submission appear in the program and conference proceedings.

## Key Dates

*All deadline times are UTC-11 by midnight. If a submission is made when it is still the deadline date at any location in the world, the submission will be considered for inclusion in the program.

*   Call for Submissions Open: **December 2, 2024**
*   Submissions Close: **February 3, 2025**
*   Meta-reviewers to Invite All Reviewers: **February 3-10, 2025**

The 16th International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC’25) will be held in **Campinas, Brazil**, from **June 23 to 27, 2025**.

ICCC welcomes papers on different aspects of Computational Creativity (CC), on systems that exhibit varying degrees of creative autonomy, on systems that act as creative partners for human creators, on frameworks that offer greater clarity or computational felicity for thinking about machine (and human) creativity, on methodologies for building or evaluating CC systems, on approaches to teaching CC in schools and universities or to promoting societal uptake of CC as a field and as a technology, and so on.

## Themes and Topics

Original research contributions are solicited in all areas related to Computational Creativity research and practice, including, but not limited to:

*   **Applications of Computational Creativity:** Computational applications of creativity in areas such as music, language, games, visual arts, design, architecture, entertainment, education, mathematical invention, scientific discovery, programming.
*   **Human-Machine Co-Creativity:** Systems, studies, frameworks, or methodologies related to co-creativity between humans and AI, with emphasis on systems in which the machine acts as a creative partner.
*   **Computational Creativity Evaluation:** Metrics, frameworks, formalisms, and methodologies for the evaluation of creativity in computational systems.
*   **Social Models:** Computational models of social aspects of creativity, including social creativity, the diffusion of ideas, collaboration, team dynamics, and creativity in social settings.
*   **Computational Paradigms:** Computational approaches for modeling cognitive aspects of creativity.
*   **Interdisciplinary Perspectives:** Perspectives on computational creativity which draw from philosophical and/or sociological studies in the context of creative AI systems.
*   **Data and Creativity:** Data science approaches to computational creativity.
*   **Societal Impact:** Ethical considerations in the design, deployment, or testing of creative AI systems, as well as studies that explore the societal impact of computational creativity and generative AI.
*   **Psychological Factors:** Computational models of psychological factors that enhance creativity.
*   **Provocations:** Raising new issues that bring the foundations of the discipline into question or throw new light on seemingly settled debates.

> A note on generative AI models: While the study of generative AI models is both welcomed and encouraged, such models and their application must be properly situated in the CC literature and evaluated according to acceptable practices in the field. Papers that fail to do this are unlikely to be reviewed favorably.

## Paper Types

We welcome the submission of five different types of full papers:

*   **Technical papers:** Papers posing and addressing hypotheses about aspects of creative behavior in computational systems. Strong evaluation is essential.
*   **System or Resource description papers:** Papers describing the building and deployment of a creative system or resource. Presentation of results from the system or resource is expected.
*   **Study papers:** Papers which draw on allied fields such as psychology, philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, humanities, the arts, and so on. The contribution of the paper to CC should be made clear.
*   **Cultural application papers:** Papers presenting the use of creative software in a cultural setting. The emphasis here is on a clear description of the role of the system in the given context.
*   **Position papers:** Papers presenting an opinion on some aspect of the culture of CC research. The emphasis here is on carefully arguing a position.

Evaluation is expected in Technical papers (strong evaluation) and in System or Resource description papers. Although evaluation is not required in other types of papers, the contribution of the paper to CC should be made clear.

## Submission Categories

ATVA welcomes submissions in the following two categories:

*   **Regular research papers** (18 pages, excluding references, must be anonymized)
*   **Tool papers** (10 pages, excluding references, not anonymized)

Submissions in both categories must be in Springer’s LNCS format. Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting can be found at the Springer website [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs). Adding line numbers (LaTeX package lineno) is highly recommended. Submissions authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed and encouraged.

An artifact evaluation will be undertaken, which will be optional for regular papers and mandatory for tool papers.

Papers must be submitted through EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atva2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atva2025) Accepted papers in both categories will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A few outstanding papers will be selected for a distinguished paper award. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference.

### Regular Papers

Regular papers should not exceed 18 pages in Springer’s LNCS format, not counting references and appendices. Additional material may be placed in an appendix, to be read at the discretion of the reviewers, and to be omitted in the final version.

Regular papers at ATVA 2025 will follow a full double-blind review process, which means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, the reference should be made in the third person. These are firm submission requirements, and any regular paper that does not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Authors of accepted regular papers will be invited (but are not required) to submit a relevant artifact for evaluation by the artifact evaluation committee. The submission deadline for this artifact evaluation will be soon after the paper acceptance notification.

Independent of the artifact evaluation process, research paper authors are encouraged to include a URL to a repository in their original submission, if such a repository is available and is pertinent to the paper. This repository could contain code, datasets, results, etc. This would be for the consideration of the PC reviewers of the submission, at their discretion. If such a URL is included in the submission, the contents of the repository should adhere to the guidelines of a double blind review process.

### Tool Papers

Tool papers should not exceed 10 pages in Springer’s LNCS format, not counting references. Tool papers will follow a single-blind review process. They do NOT need to be anonymized.

Each tool paper submission must be followed by a separate artifact submission via EasyChair. Please see the Artifact Evaluation track instructions in the conference web site for more information. Papers describing tools that have already been presented (in any conference) will be accepted only if significant and clear enhancements to the tool are reported and implemented.

SafeComp, established in 1979 by the European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems, Technical Committee 7 on Reliability, Safety and Security (EWICS TC7), is an annual international conference covering the state-of-the-art, experience, and new trends in the areas of safety, security, and reliability of critical computer applications.

The 44th edition of SafeComp provides a unique occasion to explore and debate hot topics of current challenges and solutions for future safety critical systems.

## Theme

Managing safety in an era of a software defined computing continuum

Future societal and industrial systems will be increasingly relying on a digitalized infrastructure, from embedded systems, fog/edge-computing systems, to cloud and communications. Entire systems will also increasingly be software defined and upgradeable. Societal and industrial systems consequently be increasingly relying on such digitalized infrastructures, requiring an even stronger and proactive emphasis on key dependability properties, as emphasized by the SafeComp conferences. The theme for SafeComp 2025 has been chosen to highlight some of the following topics and challenges:

*   Predictability and reliability of cloud and edge computing, and AI components: The corresponding systems yet have to offer dependability properties suitable for critical systems
*   Architectures ensuring safety while enhancing performance
*   Co-design of applications and digital infrastructure to achieve cost-efficient dependability
*   Trustworthy DevOps – reconciling software and safety practices

## Paper Submission Guidelines

The tradition of SAFECOMP is to act as a platform for bringing academic research and industrial needs together. Therefore, industrial contributions and real-world experience reports are explicitly invited. We solicit two types of paper submission (in both cases, up to 14 pages incl. bibliography):

*   Research papers address a research gap and illustrate how the contribution submitted can help improve the state-of-the-art by advancing current knowledge.
*   Practical experience reports / tool descriptions provide new insights and valuable support to practitioners.

Papers exceeding the page limit will be excluded from the review process. All papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the International Programme Committee. Papers must not have been previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere.

All paper submissions must be formatted according to the LNCS templates provided by Springer. Abstracts and papers should be submitted in pdf through Easychair.

### Submission Information

*   **Submission Platform:** All required materials must be submitted electronically to PCS by the abstract and paper deadline. In PCS, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for society, conference, and track select “SIGCHI”, “UIST 2025” and “UIST 2025 Papers”, respectively, and press “Go.” This track will be opened a few weeks before the submission deadline.
*   **Submission Format and Length:**
    *   Required Paper PDF and source files
    *   We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow.
    *   For LaTeX authors, submissions are strongly recommended to be in the double-column format ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) using \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}. (please use the downloadable LaTex template or the Overleaf template).
    *   For Word authors, submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) or the single-column template ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.pdf) ).
    *   UIST papers are of variable length. Paper length must be based on the weight of the contribution. A new idea presented in a compact format is more likely to be accepted than the same idea in a long format, and shorter, more focused papers are encouraged. As a guideline, consider
        *   Short Papers being submissions of 5,000 words or less.
        *   Standard Length Papers being submissions between 5,000 and 12,000 words are considered standard length (about 7,000-8,000 words on average).
    *   References and appendices are excluded from the word count.
    *   Size: < 20 MB (compressed PDF files are encouraged during submission)
    *   Please make appendices as separate PDF files and upload them as supplementary materials instead of including them as a subsection at the end of the original paper manuscript.
*   **Accompanying Video:**
    *   Optional, but highly encouraged
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   No more than 5 minutes long
    *   Size: < 250 MB
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
*   **Maximum File Size:** Maximum total size for all files < 300 MB
*   **Anonymity:** Anonymous, i.e. authors must remove their names and affiliations throughout all submission materials (paper, videos, supplementary material) ( [anonymity policy](https://uist.acm.org/2025/author-guide/#anonymity) )
    *   Discuss your own prior work in 3rd person and include a full reference with names.
*   **Selection Process:** Refereed, i.e. the program committee and two external reviewers will review submitted papers
*   **Publication:** Archival, i.e. accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed in digital form to conference attendees
*   **Quick rejection / Desk rejection policy**
    *   Papers, where the length is incommensurate with contribution or the stated length of the submission (i.e., short paper vs. standard length papers), will be desk rejected. Submissions of more than 5,000 words for short papers or 12,000 words for standard papers will be desk rejected if their length is not justified. In very exceptional cases, such submissions may be considered for full review, but authors must provide clear and strong justification for why submissions are required to be longer than the word limit.
*   **Anonymization Policy.** Authors are expected to anonymize their identities in the body of the paper but leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. Authors are required to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], …” and use instead “As described by Chetty et al. [10], …”. Papers that violate the anonymization policy by explicitly and unequivocally identifying the authors (i.e., beyond allowing the reviewers to simply ""guess""), including within the supplemental materials or external links to datasets, code repositories, etc., will be desk rejected. Any supplementary material (including the video) should also adhere to the anonymity rule.
*   Your submission must be original; it cannot be published or under concurrent review elsewhere. If you have any concurrent submissions to UIST or other venues that are closely related – i.e., are based on the same study, artifact, or dataset – you must include an anonymized version of that submission to the concurrent submissions field. Failure to do so will result in desk rejection. Please see [ACM guide on prior and simultaneous submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions).
*   **Research Quality and Lack of Relevant Context:** Papers must include sufficient detail for reviewers to evaluate research quality according to the norms and expectations of the UIST community. Papers should demonstrate clear connections to existing research literature in HCI and related fields, showing how the work builds upon or relates to prior work. Papers that lack adequate methodological details for proper evaluation, or that fail to engage with relevant prior research, may be desk rejected.
*   Your paper must be stand alone. Authors are encouraged to provide supplementary materials to support practices around research reproducibility as much as possible, however all important information to understand the contributions of your work must be in the main paper PDF. Heavy reliance on appendices and/or supplementary materials can be a ground for rejection including desk rejection.
*   Please ensure that you use the correct template and correct formatting of references. We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format, but will accept papers for review in either 1- or 2-column paper format if you are authoring in Word. Use of other templates or formats, including different citation styles, may result in desk rejection.

### Final Publication Format

As required by the TAPS workflow, camera-ready manuscripts of all papers that have been accepted must be submitted in the formats listed below for final publication in the ACM Digital Library.

*   For LaTeX authors, your source files will be used to auto-generate (1) a double-column PDF ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ), and (2) an accessible and responsive webpage (example HTML ) that will be placed in the Digital Library.
*   For Word authors, you will need to submit your paper in single-column format to correctly auto-generate (1) a double-column PDF ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ), and (2) an accessible and responsive webpage (example HTML ) in the Digital Library.

### Presentation Format

Talk at the conference delivered by one or more authors of the paper

### Video Preview

*   Video previews are mandatory.
*   Recommended resolution: 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
*   Length: 30 seconds
*   Size: < 150 MB
*   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file

### Demo Fast Track

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to participate in the UIST demo session. Details about this special/fast track of demos will be found on the demo page.


*   Please see the [video guide](https://uist.acm.org/2025/video-guide) for more information on producing a video preview.
*   We strongly recommend that authors make their videos accessible through following the guidelines under [Making Video Figures Accessible](https://uist.acm.org/2025/accessibility).

*   Please note that a DOI will not be provided for invited demo papers. Authors interested in having a DOI for their demo paper should consider submitting to the regular demo track.

### Additional Notes

*   **Accessibility:** Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. To this end, we allow 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline to provide alt-text for all figures and tables and upload video subtitles to make your optional video accessible. Allowing additional time for your paper and video submissions to be accessible will help increase the quality of the conference overall and enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. If the authors have difficulties with making their submission materials accessible, they are encouraged to contact the UIST 2025 Accessibility Chairs by emailing [accessibility2025@uist.org](mailto:accessibility2025@uist.org) and volunteers with questions or for assistance to ensure that all accessible materials are submitted by the deadline. We strongly recommend that authors read the [SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission](https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/) which describes the process to make a paper submission accessible, as well as the [SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/videos/), which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning.
*   The author list must be complete by the abstract submission deadline. Late author changes (i.e., additions or changes of order) require approval from program chairs and may be declined or might require paper withdrawal. Ensure all authors are listed in the correct order by the abstract deadline.
*   We will continue to put the papers up publicly on the ACM DL a week in advance of the conference.
*   Authors may submit a rebuttal after the reviews are released. Though the ACs may indicate if the rebuttal is likely to help the paper being accepted (based on reviews and internal discussions), any author may choose to respond. A rebuttal response by Associate Chairs and external reviewers will be enforced by the Program Chairs as much as possible.
*   The video has traditionally been due the same day as paper submissions and this has always been stressful. We will allow for 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline for uploading your optional video.
*   **Open source:** Our community welcomes open source and encourages the practice of creating software/hardware and sharing it through open-source and public repositories. However, open source is not a requirement or prerequisite for acceptance. Open source, as well as many other types of artifacts (e.g., videos, datasets, raw data, appendices), is recommended but completely optional, and will not be used for evaluation criteria. The paper should be evaluated on its own merits, not depending on supporting artifacts that are not submitted by the authors.

### ACM’s Publication Policies

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

### ORCID

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

### Posters

Posters provide an interactive forum in which authors can present their work to conference attendees during special poster sessions. Posters are an opportunity to describe new work, work that is still in progress, and work that is already presented in other venues but to share more with the UIST community.

*   **Extended Abstract:** The extended abstract should not exceed 2 pages (excluding references).
*   We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow.
*   For LaTeX authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/UIST2025_Poster_Example.pdf) using \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}
*   For Word authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ).
*   **Accompanying Poster:** Recommended physical size is equal to or less than 841 mm x 1189 mm (A0 size) in either portrait or landscape
*   **Accompanying Video:** Optional, but highly encouraged
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   No more than 5 minutes long
    *   Size: < 250 MB
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
*   **Maximum File Size:** Maximum total size for all files < 300 MB
*   **Anonymity:** IMPORTANT: Anonymous, i.e. authors must remove their names and affiliations throughout all submission materials (paper, videos, supplementary material) ( [anonymity policy](https://uist.acm.org/2025/author-guide/#anonymity) )
*   **Selection Process:** Reviewed. Less rigorous than a paper review and does not include an author’s rebuttal. Authors may expect to receive only light feedback. The submitted content is generally not required to make the same level of lasting and significant contribution as refereed content.
*   **Publication:** Semi-archival, i.e., authors may re-use and re-submit the content to other peer-reviewed venues (e.g., could be reused in a future UIST full paper submission). The 2-page extended abstracts will be included in the ACM Digital Library as adjunct proceedings and distributed digitally to conference attendees. The poster design will not be included in the ACM Digital Library
*   **Presentation Format:** At least one author is requested to register and stand by their poster during the poster session to speak with conference attendees
*   **Concurrent UIST Demo Submission:** The same work cannot be submitted to both the UIST Demo and Posters tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as demo submissions and will be rejected from the Posters track
*   **Novelty of Work:** Resubmission of posters previously shown at other venues is allowed
*   Please state previous poster venues and differences from previous posters in the appropriate box in PCS

### Demos

Demos are one of the highlights of the UIST conference. Accepted authors show implementations of novel and compelling interaction concepts, techniques, devices, and systems. We particularly encourage highly interactive demos— from novel web systems and prototype devices, to new materials, fabrication methods, XR, and large interactive installations.

*   **Submission Platform:** All materials must be submitted electronically to PCS before the submission deadline.
*   **Submission Format and Length:**
    *   Demo Abstract
    *   We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow.
    *   For LaTeX authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) using \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}.
    *   For Word authors, submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) or the single-column template ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.pdf) ).
    *   We do not have a strong page limit, but we recommend that authors prepare a manuscript of ~1,500-2,000 words to equate to the double column 2-page length, often 4-5 pages in the single column (plus references). Submissions could be both single-column or double-column format in PDF. We strongly encourage to use the double-column format.
*   **Floor Plan:** The demo submission should include a PDF document describing the envisioned setup and interaction (demo hardware components, tables, chairs, lights, and other equipment) so that organizers get a good understanding of your setup.
*   [Recommended submission template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rf91u5ioLQ0npQAIIkaOmwiP5J-fZjz61M19ezs5uSI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.h223k5sfeu1w)
*   **Demo Video:**
    *   This video should be a standalone demonstration of the work
    *   It shows the working demo in appropriate detail
    *   It will be published ahead of time (~2 weeks before the conference) on the conference website
    *   Length: up to 5 min
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file by the camera-ready deadline
*   **Preview Video:** Video previews are mandatory (7 days grace period after camera-ready deadline)
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   Size: < 150 MB
    *   Length: 30 seconds
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
*   **Anonymity:** Demo submissions are not anonymous. Author names and institutions will be visible to the reviewing committee throughout the submission process.
*   **Selection Process:** Demos are juried by the UIST demo chairs, and there is no rebuttal phase. Due to the nature of the juried process, authors will not receive review feedback and will only be informed about the decision.
*   **Publication:** Non-archival, ideas presented as a UIST demo can be resubmitted as an extended full paper in subsequent years. Authors may choose whether demo abstracts will be included in the ACM Digital Library as Adjunct Proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees. Demos that accompany a UIST paper submitted as a fast-track submission will not be included in the ACM Digital Library as Adjunct Proceedings.
*   **Presentation Format:** At least one author is required to be physically present at the conference and present their demo during demo sessions
*   **Lab Demos:** If the authors have multiple demo submissions from the same lab/company, we can group these demos together at the venue. Please indicate the submission IDs of all demos from the same lab on the PCS submission page.
*   **Concurrent UIST Poster Submission:** The same work cannot be submitted to both the UIST demo and poster tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as a demo submission and will be rejected from the poster track
*   **Novelty of Work:** Resubmission of demos previously shown at other venues is allowed

### Demos of Accepted UIST 2025 Papers

Authors of accepted full papers who also want to present a demo must submit an entry into the demos track. They have two choices:

*   Demos that accompany accepted papers will follow a fast-track process with an abbreviated submission. Although no demo abstract is required, authors are still required to submit a video preview and other relevant data (e.g., title, abstract, floorplan). Demos accompanying full papers will not receive a separate DOI. Note that unlike in previous years, there will be no option for a fast-track submission with a DOI. Authors who wish to have their demo abstract published with a DOI in the proceedings are welcome to submit a full demo submission by the demo track deadline.
*   Changes in author list and affiliations: Please make sure that all authors and their affiliation are correct before submitting in PCS. It is not possible to add or remove any author from a demo abstract after submission. It is not possible to change the affiliation of any author after the submission.

### Doctoral Symposium

The UIST Doctoral Symposium provides a unique opportunity for Ph.D. students to interact with established academic and industry researchers in the UIST community.

*   **Submission Format and Length:** Submit papers in the 2-column paper format. Submissions should be a maximum of 4 pages + references
*   **Accompanying Video:** Optional, but highly encouraged. Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec. No more than 5 minutes long. Size: < 250 MB. Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file.
*   **Maximum File Size:** Maximum total size for all files must be under 150 MB.
*   **Anonymity:** Not anonymous, include the single author's name and institution(s) on the submission.
*   **Selection Process:** Juried by the UIST Doctoral Symposium chairs and invited panelists. Criteria: anticipated contributions to the breadth and depth of the intellectual discussions of the symposium. Students at all levels of their PhD will be considered. Strong applicants will have at least one published technical paper at a UIST conference or similar venue. Does not include an author’s response or conditional acceptance, i.e. authors will only receive feedback along with the final decision.
*   **Publication:** Non-archival. Ideas presented at the UIST Doctoral Symposium can be resubmitted.
*   Doctoral Symposium abstracts (max 4 pager + references in 2-column format) will be included in the ACM digital library as adjunct proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees.
*   **Presentation Format:** Talk at the Doctoral Symposium event, followed by extensive discussion with the panel and the other student participants. The student author is requested to attend. The exact times of sessions will be announced after the acceptance notification date. Additionally, each student is encouraged to present a poster describing their work to the full conference within the UIST poster sessions.
*   **Novelty of Work:** The Doctoral Symposium abstract should describe ongoing work and might summarize the student's full dissertation work, or highlight a particular part in depth.
*   **Posters for Accepted Submissions:** Each student is encouraged to present a poster describing their work to the full conference. Posters will be presented within the UIST poster session.

### Workshops

Workshops provide an interactive forum in which organizers can discuss a designated area of interest with fellow conference attendees during special workshop sessions.

*   **Submission Format and Length:** Workshop Extended Abstract. The extended abstract should not exceed 2 sq pages (excluding references). The double-column ACM paper template should be used for the submission process. For Overleaf/LaTeX, this means that the following command should be used: \documentclass[sigconf, review]{acmart}
*   Accepted submissions will go through the ACM TAPS Workflow if the organizers choose to add their 2-page extended abstract to the ACM Digital Library.
*   **Anonymity:** Not anonymous, include author names and institutions on submission
*   **Selection Process:** Juried. Less rigorous than the paper review process and does not include an author’s response or conditional acceptance. Juried content is generally not required to make the same level of lasting and significant contribution as refereed content.
*   **Publication:** Workshop organizers can choose whether their 2-page extended abstract is included in the ACM Digital Library as adjunct proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees.
*   **Presentation Format:** Workshops will be full-day events happening the day before the main conference (i.e., on Sunday September 28th). At least one workshop organizer is requested to register and facilitate the workshop. Workshops should reflect the nature of UIST: engaging, interactive, and cutting-edge. Consider activities such as demonstrations, brainstorming, and prototyping. Workshop activities should target an audience of approximately 25-45 participants.

### Visions

*   **Submission Format and Length:** We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow. The abstract should be up to 1000 words (excluding references), which is roughly equivalent to a 1-page limit.

The 45th International Conference on Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems (FORTE 2025) is a forum for fundamental research on theory, models, tools, and applications for distributed systems. It is one of the three conferences of DisCoTec 2025, the 20th International Federated Conference on Distributed Computing Techniques, held in Lille, France, June 16-20, 2025.

FORTE 2025 invites submissions focused on foundational aspects of distributed software systems, presenting approaches or tools to formally model, soundly implement, and rigorously validate these demanding but ever more necessary systems and applications.

## Topics of Interest

The main topics of interest include:

*   Language concepts for concurrency and distribution, supported by rigorous semantics, well-supported pragmatics, and/or expressive illustrative use-cases.
*   Analyses techniques, methodologies, and/or algorithms, using testing and/or verification, to validate (aspects of) the soundness of various types of concurrent and distributed systems, including communication and network protocols, service-oriented systems, adaptive distributed systems, cyber-physical systems and sensor networks.
*   Principles for qualitative and quantitative security analysis of distributed systems.
*   Applications of formal methods and techniques for studying the quality, reliability, availability, and safety of concrete distributed systems. We are specially interested in “real-life” case studies and industrial applications involving real distributed systems.
*   Emerging challenges and hot topics in distributed systems (broadly construed), such as software-defined networks, distributed ledgers, smart contracts, and blockchain technologies, etc.

## Categories of Papers

FORTE 2025 solicits papers in the following categories:

*   **Regular papers (7-15 pages, not counting references):** describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission.
*   **Tool papers (7-15 pages, not counting references):** describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of FORTE. The paper should present the underlying theory of the tool, a clear account of the tool’s functionality and limitations, and include case studies (with rigorous experimental evaluation). The tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation, including a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes (submitted until a week after the paper submission deadline). Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted.
*   **Short papers (up to 6 pages, not counting references):** describing innovative and promising ideas, possibly in an early form, or demonstrating new tools (components), or presenting (i) calls to action, or (ii) substantiated reflections on current and/or future research perspectives related to FORTE, or a summary of a published journal paper clarifying why the presentation would enrich the program of FORTE.

## Artefact Submission

We invite you to also submit an associated artefact for evaluation (AE). Artefacts such as ancillary data, tools, and software will be assessed for availability, functionality, and reusability badges.

Instructions on how to upload artefacts can be found [here](/2025/FORTE_Artefact_Evaluation_Guidelines.pdf).

## Initial Manuscript Submission

Authors are invited to submit full regular papers (**6-8 pages**) of their work, reporting original research using the online submission system. Submissions of papers shorter than 5 pages may be automatically rejected.

Authors of accepted papers must submit the final paper version according to the deadline, register for the conference, and attend to present their paper(s). The maximum length for final papers is 8 pages without exceptions.

Initial Author Instructions - Work-In-Progress Papers, Technical Tracks and Special Session Papers

The submissions in the Work in Progress papers category describe research that have not yet produced the results required for a regular paper, but that due to its novelty and potential impact deserves to be shared with the community at an early stage. These submissions need to follow the guidelines for the regular and special session but limited to four (4) pages (total length including references).

WiP contributors are expected to give a short presentation of their work and to prepare a poster for the discussion forum that will take place after the presentations. More specifically, each WiP paper shall be presented by one of the authors in a very short oral presentation of 5 minutes, without any ensuing discussion, in its respective session.

Accepted and presented papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings and in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.

## Submission System Instructions

In the case you are using the new IES submission system for the first time, you will need to register at the ConfComm Login page. After registering wait for the confirmation email and verify your email address. If you don't get the confirmation email or have some problem with your submission, please contact us.

In case you already have an account with the IEC submission system you can [submit a paper to ETFA2025 here](https://confcomm.ieee-ies.org/app/general/conferences/ETFA25/initial-submission).

When submitting papers in the submission system, please select the correct track:

*   TT01 ... TT11 – technical tracks (regular papers).
*   SS01 … SS12 – special sessions (regular papers)
*   WS01, WS02, WS03 – workshops based on solicited papers (regular papers)
*   WIP TT01 … WIP TT11 – technical tracks (work-in-progress papers)
*   WIP SS01 … WIP SS12 – special sessions (work-in-progress papers)

Papers are solicited for regular Technical Tracks and Special Session tracks both as Regular papers and Work in progress (WIP) papers. Workshops based on solicited papers are instead accepting only regular papers (no WiP submissions will be accepted).

It brought together practitioners, researchers, and implementers of declarative programming to discuss theoretical advances, implementations, and applications. The proceedings are available online.","# FLOPS: Call for Papers

FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of declarative programming:

*   functional, logic, functional-logic programming
*   rewriting systems
*   formal methods and model checking
*   program transformations and program refinements
*   developing programs with the help of theorem provers or SAT/SMT solvers
*   verifying properties of programs using declarative programming techniques
*   foundations, language design, implementation issues (compilation techniques, memory management, run-time systems, etc.)
*   applications and case studies

FLOPS promotes cross-fertilization among different styles of declarative programming. Therefore, research papers must be written to be understandable by a wide audience of declarative programmers and researchers. In particular, each submission should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant for its area, and comparing it with previous work. Submission of system descriptions and declarative pearls are especially encouraged.

## Submission Categories

Submissions should fall into one of the following categories:

*   Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will be judged on originality, correctness, and significance.
*   System descriptions: they should describe a working system and will be judged on originality, usefulness, and design.
*   Declarative pearls: new and excellent declarative programs or theories with illustrative applications.

System descriptions and declarative pearls must be explicitly marked as such in the title.

Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshops proceedings may be submitted. Authors must follow [Springer’s Code of Conduct](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct). See also the ACM SIGPLAN Republication Policy. At least one author of each accepted paper should plan to attend the conference in person to present the work: there will be no general facility for online or pre-recorded presentation (but we will do our best to accommodate visa issues and similar unavoidable obstacles).

Submissions must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages excluding references, though system descriptions and pearls are typically shorter. The formatting has to conform to Springer’s guidelines. Regular research papers should be supported by proofs and/or experimental results. In case of lack of space, this supporting information should be made accessible otherwise (e.g., a link to an anonymized web page or an appendix, which does not count towards the page limit). However, it is the responsibility of the authors to guarantee that their paper can be understood and appreciated without referring to this supporting information; reviewers may simply choose not to look at it when writing their review.

Papers should be submitted electronically at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flops2024](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flops2024).

## Reviewing Process

FLOPS 2024 will employ a light double-blind reviewing process; reviewers will not see author names until they submit a review. To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:

*   author names and institutions must be omitted, and
*   references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work…” but rather “We build on the work of…”).

The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.

## Publication

The proceedings will be published by Springer International Publishing in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.

We expect to invite the authors of four to seven of the best papers to submit an extended version of their FLOPS paper to a special issue which will appear in the journal Science of Computer Programming (SCP).

## Transformation

Commencing in 2024, IJCLR has evolved from an aggregation of distinct workshops into a cohesive conference entity. This transformation encompasses the amalgamation of various topics of interest within the domains of learning and reasoning in artificial intelligence into a singular, integrated program. 

Furthermore, the conference now boasts a unified and extensive proceeding that serves as the official record for publications in this area. The ILP, AAIP, and CogAI have been integrated into the IJCLR program, signifying a consolidation of these areas under the IJCLR umbrella. Concurrently, NeSy and StarAI maintain their distinct conferences/workshops, focusing on their respective specialized topics. Despite this, they persist as pivotal components within the IJCLR framework, embodying two of the primary research domains. Their contribution to the IJCLR is further evidenced by the inclusion of dedicated area chairs and reviewers from both fields, underscoring their integral role in shaping the conference’s comprehensive academic direction and ensuring its high quality.

The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM) is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). This is the nineteenth Symposium in the series, sponsored by Florida Atlantic University. The Symposium will be held **January 7-9, 2026**, in **Ft. Lauderdale, Florida**.

## About the Symposium

ISAIM seeks submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled lessons learned from the development of the application. Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day Symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions.

Work that will have been published as of January 2026 should not be submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the previously published work. However, the ISAIM website proceedings are not archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review elsewhere at the time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM.

Authors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in an archival special volume of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and unpublished to be considered for the special volume.

## 11th International Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science (CALCO 2025)

**Dates:** June 16-18, 2025
**Location:** University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK
**Co-located with:** MFPS XLI

CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science. It is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques).

## Invited Speakers

*   Ugo dal Lago (University of Bologna) (joint special session on Quantitative Semantics)
*   Gordon Plotkin (University of Edinburgh) (joint keynote speaker)
*   Elena di Lavore (University of Oxford)
*   Alexander Kurz (Chapman University)

## Scope

Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer science. From data types to development techniques and specification formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from the large body of research proposed and implemented since the pioneering works of the 1960s. CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in both foundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science, traditional as well as emerging ones. CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS and WADT. This edition is planned as a physical, in-person event. It is expected that at least one author of each accepted paper will attend and give the presentation in person; exceptions can be made in case of unexpected travel/visa problems.

## Submission Categories

CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four categories of submissions:

1.  **Regular papers:** These papers should report on theoretical foundations, novel methods and techniques for software development, or experiences with technology transfer to industry.
2.  **(Co)Algebraic Pearls papers:** These papers present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way, illustrating an idea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing an application. Pearls are typically short and concise.
3.  **Early ideas abstracts:** These submissions lead to presentations of work in progress, or proposals for original venues of research.
4.  **Tool presentation papers:** These papers report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools.

Engineering real-world information systems requires a coherent design encompassing human, organizational, economic, societal, and technological aspects. Information systems are applied in diverse contexts such as business process management, geographical information systems, and digital twins. The discipline continually evolves with trends in data science, machine learning, process mining, blockchain, mobile computing, sustainability, new regulations, cyber warfare, and military conflicts, all influencing its development. Each application context and emerging trend can lead to specializations within information systems engineering, necessitating various research traditions and needs. While beneficial, these specializations risk creating silos. Thus, the CAiSE conference, the premier event for this discipline, aims to prevent such fragmentation.

Therefore, the theme for this year’s CAiSE conference is **""Bridging Silos.""** We encourage submissions that consider information systems engineering as a cohesive design involving multiple aspects. Submissions focused on specific specializations should explicitly position their results within the broader context to engage researchers across different areas and avoid silo formation.

The Computer Algebra in Scientific Computing (CASC) 2025 conference will take place from **November 24 – 28, 2025**, in **Dubai, The United Arab Emirates**.

## Conference Information

The tools of Scientific Computing play an important role in the natural sciences and engineering. Computer Algebra Systems and the underlying algorithms for Symbolic Computation play an increasingly important role within Scientific Computation. The CASC workshop series has been running for over two decades to explore the interaction of these topics, their implementation, and their application.

## Scope

The topics addressed in the workshop cover:

1.  **The theory of symbolic computation and its implementation in computer algebra systems.**
    This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   new methods on exact computation;
    *   symbolic algorithms and their complexity;
    *   automated reasoning in algebra and geometry;
    *   parallel symbolic / symbolic-numeric computation;
    *   symbolic / symbolic-numeric methods for differential, differential-algebraic and difference equations;
    *   symbolic / symbolic-numeric methods for polynomial equations and inequalities;
    *   the embedding of computer algebra technology within different software and hardware environments;

2.  **All other areas of scientific computing in regards to their benefit from or use of computer algebra methods and software.**
    This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   the use of computer algebra in approximate computation;
    *   computer algebra methods in big data analytics;
    *   computer algebra methods for simulation and modeling;

3.  **Applications of the above throughout the natural sciences and engineering.**

We welcome papers on both fundamental research and implementation issues. We also accept survey papers but these MUST BE CLEARLY LABELLED as such in the title.

## Conference Participation Options

We encourage wide participation at the workshop. In light of this, and that the conference scope spans computer science and mathematics (with their different publication traditions), we offer a variety of participation options:

1.  **Participation with an accompanying paper in LNCS:**
    CASC has a long running relationship with the Springer book series Lecture Notes in Computer Science to publish conference proceedings. Work submitted here should contain an original research result. Submissions should be prepared in the LNCS style and not exceed **20 pages**. Survey papers may have up to **25 pages**.
    [List of CASC proceedings published by Springer](https://link.springer.com/conference/casc)

2.  **Participation with abstract only:**
    Participants may opt to submit an extended abstract instead. These should have at least **2 and at most 4 pages** in the LNCS style. They must contain the main results of the talk (without proofs). They will be lightly reviewed and distributed locally at the conference. We see three main audiences for this option:
    *   Those who wish to talk on previously published work (in which case that work should be clearly cited in the abstract).
    *   Those whose work is not yet ready for publication, but wish to receive feedback.
    *   Those who plan to submit a journal paper on the work shortly.

## Accompanying Topical Collection of Mathematics in Computer Science

CASC has formed a relationship with the Springer Birkhäuser journal Mathematics in Computer Science (MCS) for an ongoing series of topical collections on topics presented at CASC workshops. Work submitted here must be of journal quality and will be reviewed to the usual standards of MCS. Submission will be opened after the conference for authors of extended abstracts presented at that years conference. There is no a priori page limit, but the length must be justified by the contents of the paper. At notification authors may be asked to revise their paper for a secondary deadline.

## Submission Link

All submissions should be done via EasyChair:

**SUBMIT:** [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=casc2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=casc2025)

In the EasyChair title field please prefix the paper title in the EasyChair metadata with either **LNCS** or **EA** to indicate which of the participation options is being used.

ISSTA is a leading research symposium for academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experiences in software testing and analysis.","# ISSTA 2025: Call for Papers

The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) 2025 invites high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental research on software testing and analysis.

## Submission Types

ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions:

1.  **Research Papers:** Describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.
2.  **Experience Papers:** Describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools, with carefully identified and discussed lessons learned for the community.
3.  **Replicability Studies:** Encouraging the replication of results from previous papers, going beyond simple re-implementation. These studies should clearly describe their purpose and value beyond the original result, and will be evaluated based on depth and breadth of experiments, clarity of writing, appropriateness of conclusions, actionable insights, and availability of artefacts.

## Publication

**NEW THIS YEAR:** The conference proceedings will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE), Issue: ISSTA 2025.

The program committee welcomes papers introducing a new concept, model or understanding; opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas; introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies, or new applications of known techniques; putting forth a bold, even if preliminary, vision or line of attack; or unearthing novel or surprising connections between different topics.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract submission deadline:** September 3, 2024
*   **Submission deadline:** September 5, 2024
*   **Notification to authors:** November 2, 2024
*   **Conference dates:** January 7-January 10, 2025

## Submission Instructions

Authors should register and submit their paper via the [hotcrp submission site](https://itcs2025.hotcrp.com/) by the strict deadlines.

*   The font size should be at least 11 point and the paper should be single column.
*   Beyond these, there are no specific formatting requirements.
*   Authors are required to submit a COI (Conflict of Interest) declaration upon submission.

## Review Process

The conference will employ a **lightweight double-blind reviewing process**.

*   Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.
*   This process is intended to help PC members and external reviewers come to a judgment without unconscious bias.
*   Important references should not be omitted or anonymized.
*   Authors are encouraged to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would, including posting papers to arXiv/ECCC/IACR.

## Paper Content & Style

*   Authors should strive to make their paper accessible not only to experts in their subarea, but also to the theory community at large.
*   The submission should include clear proofs of all central claims.
*   It is strongly recommended that the paper contain, within the first 10 pages, a concise and clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its significance, innovations, and place within (or outside) of our field's scope and literature.
*   The committee will put a premium on writing that conveys clearly, in as simple and straightforward a manner as possible, what the paper accomplishes.

## PC Member Submissions

Submissions authored by program committee members (with the exception of the PC chair) are allowed. Utmost care will be taken to avoid COIs with PC submissions, ensuring that such submissions receive no unfair advantage, and that the reviews and discussion remain confidential from the authors.

## Confidentiality

All submissions will be treated as confidential and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. The program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.

## Prior, Simultaneous, and Subsequent Submissions

*   Results published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS.
*   Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed.
*   Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences.

## Online Posting

Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the arXiv, the ECCC, or the Cryptology ePrint archive. It is generally expected that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers, with proofs, available before the conference begins.

## Conference Presentation

*   All talks are expected to be in person.
*   Talks in the conference will not be recorded. Instead, authors of each paper will be asked to upload a 20-25 minute talk, which will be posted online.

## Graduating Bits

Participants nearing graduation (on either side) will be given an opportunity to present (in 2-3 minutes) their results, research, plans, personality, and so on during the ""Graduating bits"" session. Details on how to participate will be provided closer to the conference date.

## Awards

The committee may award a ""best student paper"" award.

## Code of Conduct

ITCS is committed to an inclusive conference experience, respectful of all participants, and free from any discrimination or harassment. All ITCS attendees are expected to behave accordingly. If you experience or witness discrimination, harassment, or other unethical behavior at the conference, we encourage you to seek advice by contacting SafeToC advocates (http://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/).

## Proceedings

The accepted papers will be published by LIPIcs in the electronic proceedings of the conference. Authors of accepted papers can ask the PC chair to have only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the PDF of the full paper on an online archive.",

## Paper Categories and Submission

We welcome **regular papers** and **short papers**.

### Submission Process

Submission for both categories is **lightweight double-blind**. This means that:

1.  Author names and institutions must be omitted using the `anonymous` option of the document class.
2.  References to authors’ own related work should be in the third person.
3.  The identity of authors will be revealed to reviewers once they have submitted a first draft of their review.

*Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing it more difficult. Important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. Authors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as usual.* 

### Regular Papers

*   Must be no more than **16 pages** in length excluding bibliographic references.
*   Must not include an appendix.
*   Must be in LIPIcs format.

### Short Papers

*   Can be used to describe interesting work that is still ongoing and not fully mature.
*   Accepted short papers will be published in the main proceedings and will be presented as short talks.
*   Must be no more than **6 pages** in length excluding bibliographic references and may consist of an extended abstract.
*   Must have the phrase ""Short paper"" as a subtitle.
*   Must not include an appendix.
*   Must be in LIPIcs format.

## Formatting and Submission Platform

Both categories of papers must be prepared in LaTeX using the [lipics-v2021 style](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author) (v2021.1.3) and must be submitted electronically as pdf files through [HotCRP](https://itp25.hotcrp.com).

## Supplementary Material

All submissions are expected to be accompanied by supplementary material containing verifiable evidence of a suitable implementation, such as the source files of a formalization for the proof assistant used.

*   **Anonymous supplementary material** is made available to the reviewers before they submit their first-draft reviews.
*   **Non-anonymous supplementary material** is made available to the reviewers after they have submitted their first-draft reviews and have learned the identity of the authors.

We strongly encourage anonymous supplementary material whenever possible.

## Publication

The conference proceedings will be published in Dagstuhl Publishing's Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series in **Gold Open Access** under the CC-BY-4.0 license.

## Registration and Participation

*   Remote attendance of the conference will be possible for a low or no fee.
*   For all accepted papers, at least one author must pay a **full registration fee**.
*   For presenters, physical participation is strongly encouraged.
*   Remote talks are only possible if agreed with the organizers by the registration deadline, but still one author must pay the full registration fee.

JSSPP 2025 is planned as a **two-day, in-person meeting**.

The workshop aims to foster understanding and reproducibility in scheduling by building a bridge between the production and research worlds, and by tackling the lack of real-world data.

## Submission Types

JSSPP welcomes novel, unpublished contributions in the following categories:

*   **Regular Papers (RP):** Focusing on challenges in parallel scheduling.
*   **Open Scheduling Problems (OSP):** Describing clearly defined real-world scheduling problems to stimulate development of new approaches.
*   **Workload Traces (WT):** Introducing novel workload traces from real systems that present scheduling challenges.

## Topics of Interest

### Regular Papers (RP)

*   Scaling and architecture of very large scheduling systems.
*   Operational challenges: Capacity planning, service level assurance, reliability.
*   Interaction between schedulers on different levels (e.g., processor vs cluster) and tenancy domains (single and multi-tenant).
*   Interaction between applications/workloads, e.g., efficient batch job and container/Pod/VM co-scheduling within a single system.
*   Experience reports from large-scale compute production systems.
*   GPU/Accelerator (co)scheduling.
*   AI/ML-inspired scheduling approaches.

### Workload Traces (WT)

*   A description of the parallel system running these workloads.
*   An analysis of the traces, modeling key workload features and highlighting scheduling challenges in their hosting systems.

Submitters are asked to employ known workload description languages (e.g., SWF) or attach schemas for interpretation. Submission of artifacts modeling the workloads is also encouraged.

### Open Scheduling Problems (OSP)

Submissions must include:

*   A concise understanding of scheduling goals and their relation to one another.
*   Details of the workload (job arrival times, sizes, shareability, deadlines, etc.).
*   Details of the system being managed (size, break/fix lifecycle, allocation constraints).
*   A concise description of key system metrics and how they are calculated.
*   Ideally, anonymized operational logs would also be published.

## Submission Format

LCTES aims to bridge the gap between researchers and developers in programming languages and embedded systems engineering, fostering interaction and addressing common challenges.","# LCTES 2025: Call for Papers

Programming languages, compilers, and tools are crucial interfaces between embedded systems and emerging real-world applications, including deep neural networks, large language models, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare. These applications present challenges that often conflict with conventional design requirements and increase the complexity of embedded system designs. They also leverage new hardware paradigms like multicores (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs) and distributed systems. Consequently, programming languages, compilers, and tools are increasingly vital for addressing productivity, validation, verification, maintainability, safety, and reliability, while meeting performance goals and resource constraints.

The 26th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, Tools and Theory of Embedded Systems (LCTES 2025) invites original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that address these challenges. Both research papers on innovative techniques and experience papers on real-world system experimentation are welcome.

The symposium focuses on advances in biomedical imaging.","# Call for Academic Software Demos

We welcome proposals for in-person demos of academic, open, free, and non-commercial software. The software may or may not be directly associated with accepted ISBI 2025 papers and abstracts, but should still have relevance to accepted ISBI 2025 work. The academic demo sessions of ISBI 2025 will aim to showcase recent developments in the field, software used in ISBI 2025 papers, all relevant to the ISBI community. This will be an opportunity for presenters to perform live demos of their code/software while interacting with conference attendees face-to-face.

## Focus Areas

Demos should focus on **open science, reproducible research, clinically-translational work, and soft skills development**. Demos should provide material for all levels of expertise, including students, early career scientists, professionals, and clinical users. Demos should primarily focus on the (relatively mature) tools developed by the presenters rather than results.

## Demo Format

*   All accepted demos will be **in-person** in an assigned conference hall during the main conference.
*   Each demo will be provided with a **small table, power outlet, wireless (shared) Internet, and a monitor** during its assigned time slot.
*   Submissions should list all other supporting equipment that will be needed per demo, so the conference committee may do their best to arrange them.
*   Demo presenters are expected to bring their own laptops/PCs as needed for their demo.

## Demo Fee

*   There will be a **$140 fee** for the demo package (table, poster board, screen, power connection).
*   This fee must be paid upon registration by the presenter of the relevant paper the demo is attached to, who will be attending the conference, in addition to their conference attendee fee.

## Demo Proposal Requirements

Proposals should be **no more than one (1) page** in 12-point font submitted as a single PDF file. Demo proposals should contain the following sections:

*   **Title:** Must have the prefix ""Demo:"" (e.g., ""Demo:<Title>""). Include a brief topic overview and brief expected learning outcomes.
*   **Representative Image:** One ""representative image"".
*   **Relevance to ISBI community:** Emerging topics will be favorably considered if the link with the ISBI community is clearly established (the software is associated with an accepted ISBI 2025 paper or abstract).
*   **Software URLs:** List any GitHub or otherwise public software related URLs.
*   **Target Audience:** Describe from which areas potential participants are expected to visit the demo, what prior knowledge or skills are expected from the audience, and what software or programming languages might be involved.
*   **Presenter Information:** (Not included in page limit) Please provide names, affiliations, positions, and email addresses for each demo-presenter.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are 11:59pm USA (PST).

*   **Demo proposals due:** **February 24, 2025**
*   **Accept/Reject notification:** **February 28, 2025**

We are pleased to announce the 21st edition of the “Robotics: Science and Systems” (RSS) conference, to be held at the **University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA, from June 21 - 25, 2025**.

RSS is a **single-track conference** that connects researchers working on all aspects of robotics, including scientific foundations, mechanisms, algorithms, applications, and analysis of robotic systems. The single-track format allows attendees to learn about state-of-the-art research across all robotics domains. The conference will feature oral and poster presentations of accepted papers, demonstrations, invited talks, and panels.

## Announcement 1: LA Wildfire Support

In response to recent wildfires in Los Angeles, adjustments have been made to the RSS 2025 submission timeline. The abstract/title submission (January 17) and initial paper submission (January 24) deadlines remain unchanged. However, authors can update the PDF of their paper until **January 31, 2025**, which is also the supplementary material deadline. For more details, read the [full announcement](/updates/la-wildfires/).

## Announcement 2: Double Submissions

Submitting an abstract (by January 17) or a semi-complete paper (by January 24) that is currently under submission to another conference (e.g., ICRA, ICLR, CVPR) is considered a double submission and is forbidden by RSS rules. However, if a paper contains substantial innovation compared to the paper under review (qualifying it as a different and novel paper), it may be submitted to RSS.

## Submission Types

*   **Paper Contributions:** We invite submissions of high-quality research papers that introduce new ideas and stimulate future trends in robotics.
*   **Demo Contributions:** Submissions for demos are possible and will include a Demo Track during the main conference. These single-blind submissions can range from early research demos to mature production-ready systems. Open-source and open-access systems or interactive systems accessible to the community are especially encouraged. Demos can relate to hardware or software contributions, their integration, critical system components, and useful tools for the community.

The 31st IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS) is a top-tier conference with a focus on systems with timing requirements. RTAS’25 welcomes papers describing applications, case studies, methodologies, tools, algorithms, operating systems, middleware, or hardware innovations that contribute to the state of the art in the design, implementation, validation, verification, and evolution of systems with timing requirements.

RTAS’25 will be part of the [CPS-IoT Week](https://cps-iot-week2025.ics.uci.edu/) in **Irvine, USA, May 6-9, 2025**.

## Tracks

RTAS’25 consists of two tracks:

*   **Track 1: Systems and Applications**
*   **Track 2: Applied Methodologies and Foundations**

## Scope and Guidelines

To be in scope, papers must explicitly consider at least one of the following:

*   Some kind of timing requirements;
*   Improvements or innovations that directly support the fundamental properties of systems with timing requirements.

### Timing Requirements

The timing requirements of interest are broadly defined and include not only classical hard real-time constraints, but also soft real-time, probabilistic, quality-of-service (QoS), throughput or latency requirements. The authors should specifically state the types of timing-related properties addressed by the contribution(s) presented in their paper.

### Improvements or Innovations to Support Fundamental Properties

Work that supports the design, implementation, validation, or evaluation of deterministic, predictable, dependable, efficient, or next-generation systems with timing requirements are welcome. The authors should specifically state how their work can be used or built upon to ultimately achieve systems with timing requirements beyond the state of the arts.

Application areas can include, but are not limited to: resource-constrained embedded systems, distributed cyber-physical systems (CPS), cloud/edge/fog computing systems, cloud data centers, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile computing, robotics, smart grid, and smart cities, as well as middleware and frameworks, machine learning and signal processing algorithms.

## Peer Review Process

RTAS’25 follows a **double-anonymous peer reviewing process**: author identities and affiliations will not be revealed to reviewers. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a response to reviews before acceptance decisions are made, solely to provide clarifications and correct misconceptions. The response will not allow authors to introduce new material beyond the original submission or promise such material for the camera-ready version.

There will be an **optional artifact evaluation process** for accepted papers that assesses the reproducibility of the work.

## Submission Portal

[Submission Portal](https://rtas25.hotcrp.com/)

## Track 1: Systems and Applications

This track focuses on research of an empirical nature pertaining to (system- or component-) level analysis, optimization, and verification, as well as applications, runtime software, and hardware architectures for systems with timing requirements. Topics relevant to this track include, but are not limited to:

*   Applications with timing requirements
*   Real-time and embedded operating systems
*   Hypervisors and runtime frameworks
*   Hardware architectures, memory hierarchies, FPGAs, GPUs and accelerators
*   Networks with timing requirements
*   CPS/IoT infrastructure
*   Microservice technologies, cloud and edge computing
*   Real-time artificial intelligence and machine learning
*   Application profiling, WCET analysis, compilers, tools, benchmarks and case studies

Papers discussing design and implementation experiences on real industrial systems are especially encouraged. Papers submitted to this track should focus on specific systems and implementations. Authors must include a section with experimental results performed on a real implementation or demonstrate applicability to an industrial case study or working system. The experiment or case study discussions must highlight the key lessons learned. Simulation-based results are acceptable for architectural simulation, or other cases where authors clearly motivate why it is not feasible to develop and evaluate a real system.

Empirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field is also welcome in this track.

## Track 2: Applied Methodologies and Foundations

This track focuses on fundamental models and analysis techniques/methods applicable to systems with timing requirements to solve problems. The track welcomes knowledge-based models, models built from data, as well as a combination, and different types of analysis methods, including analytical, statistical, or probabilistic methods. Topics relevant to this track include, but are not limited to:

*   Modelling languages, modelling methods, model learning, model validation and calibration
*   Scheduling and resource allocation
*   System-level optimization and co-design techniques
*   Design space exploration
*   Verification and validation methodologies

Papers must describe the main context or use case for the proposed methods giving clear motivating examples based on real systems. The system models and any assumptions used in the derivation of the methods must be applicable to real systems and reflect actual needs. Papers must include a section on experimental results, preferably including a case study based on information from a real system. The use of synthetic workloads and models is acceptable if appropriately motivated and used to provide a systematic evaluation.

## Objectives and Scope

Runtime verification is concerned with the monitoring and analysis of the runtime behavior of software and hardware systems. Runtime verification techniques are crucial for system correctness, reliability, and robustness. They provide an additional level of rigor and effectiveness compared to conventional testing and are generally more practical than exhaustive formal verification.

Runtime verification can be used prior to deployment for testing, verification, and debugging purposes, and after deployment for ensuring reliability, safety, and security, and for providing fault containment and recovery as well as online system repair.

## Topics of Interest

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:

*   Specification languages for monitoring
*   Monitor construction techniques
*   Program instrumentation
*   Logging, recording, and replay
*   Combination of static and dynamic analysis
*   Specification mining and machine learning over runtime traces
*   Monitoring techniques for concurrent and distributed systems
*   Runtime checking of privacy and security policies
*   Metrics and statistical information gathering
*   Program/system execution visualization
*   Fault localization, containment, resilience, recovery, and repair
*   Monitoring systems with learning-enabled components
*   Dynamic type checking
*   Runtime verification for autonomy and runtime assurance
*   Runtime verification for assurance cases
*   Out-of-distribution and anomaly detection in ML-based systems
*   Safe reinforcement learning

    *   Cryptographic implementation analysis
    *   New cryptographic protocols with real-world applications
*   Blockchains and distributed ledger security
*   Meta-science in Security and Privacy
    *   Meta-science, or the study of scientific research itself, aims to enhance the efficiency, quality, and outcomes of research activities in our community. Submissions in this broad topic should focus on evaluations of research practices, replicability/reproducibility, ethics, research methodologies, data transparency, and peer-review processes.
    *   Contributions should extend beyond analysis, aiming to influence future research practices.
    *   **Replication and Reproduction:** Contributions to this sub-topic should primarily consist of studies that verify, refute, or refine prior technical results or widely-held beliefs. We encourage submissions that not only replicate studies but also offer meta-analyses that assess the replicability of research. Additionally, while replication studies often replicate original findings, we also value novel investigations into why certain studies fail to replicate. Papers that critically examine the conditions under which replication is feasible, or those that propose innovative methods to enhance the reliability of scientific findings, are especially welcome.
*   Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)
    *   SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research; they include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.
    *   SoK submissions should be prefixed with ""SoK:"".

## Research Ethics

Authors of all submissions must consider and discuss the ethics of their work. Papers must include a discussion of ethics and an argument for how their full research and publication process was ethical. Failure to do so may result in rejection.

## Open Science

Authors are expected to openly share their research artifacts by default. If artifacts cannot be shared, a detailed justification must be provided. Adherence to the open science policy needs to be explicitly discussed in the paper.

## Artifact Evaluation

Artifact evaluation will take place in two phases: availability after paper acceptance and before final papers are due; functionality and reproducibility after final papers are due. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to register their artifacts.

See the [Call for Artifacts](/conference/usenixsecurity25/call-for-artifacts) for more information.

## New Approach to Presentation of Papers

Accepted papers will be presented in various formats, including longer talks (tentatively 15 minutes), shorter presentations (tentatively 30 seconds to 1 minute), posters, and optional pre-recorded video presentations.

## Submission Policies and Instructions

See the [USENIX Security '25 Submission Policies and Instructions](/conference/usenixsecurity25/submission-policies-and-instructions) page for details.

Hunt Jr. Library at North Carolina State University.","# Call for Research Papers

We solicit original, unpublished research papers on computing technologies for modeling, programming, communicating, and reasoning, which are easier to learn, use or understand by humans than the current state-of-the-art. Papers should focus on efforts to design, formalize, implement, or evaluate those technologies and languages. This includes technologies intended for general audiences (e.g., professional or novice programmers, or the public) or domain-specific audiences (e.g., people working in business administration, production environments, healthcare, urban design or scientific domains). Empirical papers that validate current proposed solutions with rigorous scientific means (i.e., empirical studies, controlled experiments, rigorous case studies, etc.) are also welcome.

## Scope and Topics

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   **Visual languages:** Novel visual languages, Design, evaluation, and theory of visual languages and applications, Development of systems for manipulating and interacting with diagrammatic representations
*   **Human aspects and psychology of software development and language design**, such as supporting inclusion and diversity in programming
*   **End-user development, adaptation and programming**, Creation and evaluation of technologies and infrastructures for end-user development
*   **Representations:** Novel representations and user interfaces for expressing computation, Software, algorithm and data visualization
*   **Modeling:** Model-driven development, Domain-specific languages, including modeling languages, Visual modeling of human behavior and socio-technical systems
*   **Thinking more deeply about code:** Debugging, program comprehension, code review, Explainable ML/AI
*   **Future of work with AI:** Human-Centric AI-based tools, modeling end-user interactions with AI powered tools
*   **Low-Code/No-Code paradigm:** Approaches for creation and deployment of fully functional applications using visual abstractions and interfaces
*   **Education and Computational thinking:** using visual languages in education, teaching human-centric principals, educator and student perspectives

If you are not sure if your paper is a good fit for VL/HCC, feel free to email the PC Co-chairs (see “Contact” below). We welcome those new to the VL/HCC community to submit!

## Special Emphasis for 2025: Human-AI Collaboration

We seek research that highlights the situations in which human-AI interactions enhance, or degrade, the human experience in computing. Papers describing positive, negative and unclear impacts are all welcome.

## Paper Submissions

We invite two kinds of papers:

*   **Full-length papers:** up to 10 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements
*   **Short papers:** up to 5 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements

All accepted papers, whether full or short, should be complete, self-contained, archival contributions. Contributions from full papers are more extensive than those from short papers. Papers do not have to reach the maximum page limit, but they should be of an appropriate length for the content. Note that some full paper submissions may be accepted as short papers if reviewers deem contributions to be comparable in size to a short paper.

Papers could be research findings, industry experience reports, replication studies, or vision papers. Please select the appropriate page length for the content of your paper.

Papers must be submitted using the IEEE two-column conference paper format. Be sure to use the current IEEE conference paper format (which was updated in 2019), and to select the “US letter” template.

Papers should be submitted via the EasyChair system: [https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vlhcc2025](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vlhcc2025).

To facilitate the assigning of papers to reviewers, authors should submit paper abstracts via EasyChair at least 1 week prior to the paper submission deadline (see Important Dates below). The abstract must be no longer than 250 words.

All submissions will be reviewed by members of the Program Committee in a double-anonymous review process. Authors will then receive the reviews for their submissions and will be able to answer them in a rebuttal phase. Only after this step will the PC make a final decision about the acceptance of the submissions. Submissions and reviews for the technical program are managed with EasyChair. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for VL/HCC 2025 and present the paper at the conference. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference, including IEEE Xplore Digital Library, if the paper is not presented by the author at the conference.

The proceedings of IEEE VL/HCC are published in digital form by the IEEE Computer Science Society and archived in the IEEE Digital Library with an official ISBN number. Accepted papers will be available to conference attendees via the IEEE Open Preview program in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library).

## Double-Anonymous Reviewing

We follow a double-anonymous reviewing process. Both authors and reviewers are expected to make every effort to honor the double-anonymous reviewing process. In case of questions, please contact the Program Chairs. Authors should ensure that the submission can be evaluated without it being obvious who wrote the paper. This means leaving author names off the paper and using terms like “previous research” rather than “our previous research” when describing background. However, do not hide previous work – papers must still reference all relevant research using full (non-anonymized) citations, including the author’s own prior work, so that reviewers can evaluate novelty. Please reference your own prior work in the third-person just like you would do for any other related work (e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and instead write something like “As described by [10], …”). It is also important that authors specify all conflicts of interest with potential reviewers during the submission phase. Reviewers should not undertake any investigation that might lead to the revealing of authors’ identity. If identities are inadvertently revealed, please contact the Program Chairs. The Program Chairs will check all submissions for obvious signs of lack of anonymity and may ask authors to make changes and resubmit the paper within three days of the submission deadline. Only changes to resolve anonymity issues will be permitted.

## Evaluation and Justification

Papers are expected to support their claims with appropriate evidence. For example, a paper that claims to improve programmer productivity is expected to demonstrate improved productivity; a paper that claims to be easier to use should demonstrate increased ease of use.

However, not all claims necessarily need to be supported with empirical evidence or studies with people. For example, a paper that claims to make something feasible that was clearly infeasible might substantiate its claim through the existence of a functioning prototype.

Moreover, there are many alternatives to empirical evidence that may be appropriate for justifying claims, including analytical methods, formal arguments or case studies. Given this criterion, we encourage potential authors to think carefully about what claims their submission makes and what evidence would adequately support these claims.

Replication papers will be evaluated on their own merit in terms of methods used, findings discussed and comparison to original studies in terms of different context or use of different methods.

Vision papers should make a case for future needs and research directions in VL and/or HCC community interest areas within a timeline of the next 5 to 10 years.

Industrial experience reports with VL and/or HCC topics should describe context, lessons learned (positive or negative), and recommendations for research and practice as appropriate.

We expect short papers to have less comprehensive evaluation than full-length papers, and may have less technical detail, but sufficient to make the case for the contribution. New ideas and early research results would be expected to use a short paper format.

## Adhering to IEEE Guidelines

Please be sure that your submission follows the [IEEE requirements](https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/author-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-policies/)

Especially around Human Subject approvals and use of Generative AI:

### Research on Human and Animal Subjects

Authors of articles reporting on research involving human subjects or animals, including but extending beyond medical research, shall include a statement in the article that the research was performed under the oversight of an institutional review board or equivalent local/regional body, including the official name of the IRB/ethics committee, or include an explanation as to why such a review was not conducted. For research involving human subjects, authors shall also report that consent from the human subjects in the research was obtained or explain why consent was not obtained.

### Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text

The use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in a paper (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE publication. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the paper that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content. The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. In this case, disclosure as noted above is recommended.

## Policies

### Dual Submission

It is not appropriate to submit papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals. Such submissions violate our dual submission policy, and the organizers have the right to reject such submissions, or to remove them from the proceedings.

### Changes of Title / Abstract / Authorship

Submission titles should not be modified after the abstract submission deadline, and abstracts should not be modified by more than 50% after the abstract submission deadline. The author list at the submission deadline will be considered final, and no changes in authorship will be permitted for accepted papers.

### Double-Blind Review

All submitted papers must be anonymous. WISE 2025 follows the double-blind peer review principle. Authors must not include author information in the submitted document and should avoid citations or discussions that would make the authorship apparent.

### Reviewing Criteria

Accepted papers must contain significant novel results (theoretical or empirical). Results will be judged on their objective establishment and/or potential for scientific and technological impact. Reproducibility of results and availability of code will be considered.",
