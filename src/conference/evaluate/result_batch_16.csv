Short papers will be judged on originality, potential impact, and clarity, even without extensive evaluation. Both types of papers will be presented orally at the conference.

## Double Deadline

Thanks to the merging of several conferences, SenSys will transition to a new submission process with two deadlines.

Papers rejected in one cycle can be resubmitted to the next, but only with a strong statement justifying in detail how the revised version addresses the reviewers’ concerns. Resubmissions lacking this justification will be desk-rejected.

## Submission Guidelines

Submitted papers must be original, unpublished work, and must not be under review for any other publication at the time of submission. Submissions must be at most 12 pages (full papers) or 6 pages (short papers), and must include all figures and tables within the page limits. References may use as many pages as needed. Both formats should be prepared on single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages, using a 9-point font size in a two-column layout. Submissions must follow either the LaTeX template (preferred) or Word style files provided here. LaTeX submissions should specifically use the acmart.cls template with the sigconf option.

Authors are expected to make a good-faith effort to anonymize their manuscripts. The presence of non-anonymous preprints (such as those on arXiv or similar repositories) will not result in rejection. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but incidentally discovering such materials will not violate the double-blind policy. Submissions that do not comply with the specified size, formatting, or anonymization guidelines will not be reviewed. All papers must be submitted in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) through the designated conference submission system.

For submissions that involve research with human participants, including those using anonymized data, authors must include a brief description of how ethical considerations were addressed and whether the work received approval from an ethics review board (e.g., IRB). All authors are expected to comply with the policies of their institutions regarding data collection and research involving human subjects.

Submit your paper at [https://sensys26.hotcrp.com](https://sensys26.hotcrp.com).

## Camera-Ready Manuscript Details

Accepted submissions will be available on the ACM digital library. Please note that ACM uses 9-pt fonts in all conference proceedings, and the templates in both LaTeX and Word implicitly define the font size to 9-pt. Please refer to the publication chair's earlier Note and the User Guide of the new class.

    *   `ConfSymAcronym_PaperType_PaperNumber`
    *   **ConfSymAcronym** is specified as follows:
        *   CLD – IEEE CLOUD 2025
        *   CDH – IEEE ICDH 2025
        *   CWS – IEEE ICWS 2025
        *   EDG – IEEE EDGE 2025
        *   QSW – IEEE QSW 2025
        *   SSE – IEEE SSE 2025

        *   REG – regular papers
        *   SHT – short papers
        *   WIP – work-in-progress papers
        *   SYM – symposium papers
        *   WKP – workshop papers
    *   **PaperNumber** (#) is a 1-3 digit number generated by EasyChair.
    *   For example, CLOUD and ICWS may both have paper #15. Hence, the prefix ConfSymAcronym_PaperType_ must be correctly provided in author’s registration and camera-ready, so that their paper can be identified as “Paid” and be placed into the correct conference proceeding in a timely manner.
*   For symposia & workshops, their paper designators have been specified in the following table:

| Symposia & Workshops                                                      | Paper Designators |

## Information for Authors

### Paper Formatting

*   **Page limits:**
    *   Every “Regular Paper” manuscript can include **7 to 10 pages** for the main contents (including all text, footnotes, figures, tables and appendices) with additional pages for appropriate references.
    *   Every “Short Paper” manuscript can include **4 to 6 pages** for the main contents (including all text, footnotes, figures, tables and appendices) with additional pages for appropriate references.
    *   Every “Work-in-Progress” (WIP) manuscript can include up to **3 pages** (including main contents and references).
*   **Anonymous manuscripts:** All conferences affiliated with IEEE SERVICES implement a double-blind reviewing process. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their names and affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data contained in the paper.
*   **AI Generated Content:** The use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any article submitted to an IEEE publication. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content.
*   **Submission of Unpublished Articles or Technical Reports:** Per IEEE policy, unpublished articles or technical reports on a non-profit preprint server (e.g., ArXiv, organization web site, etc.) can be submitted for consideration after necessary changes are made to comply with the rules of IEEE SERVICES concerning authorship and anonymization for the double-blind review process (as stated above).

## Presentation Policy

*   **Registration:** All papers must be registered! Authors with two or more papers must register each paper separately. Papers with no registration will be removed from the conference proceedings in the IEEE’s Digital Library Xplore.
*   **Inexcusable no show:** When an in-person paper presentation cannot be delivered unexpectedly, a remote presentation with a recorded video as backup is allowed. Inexcusable no-shows will result in the papers being removed from the conference proceedings in the IEEE’s Digital Library Xplore.
*   **Paper presentation:** Each paper must be presented in English. Remote presenters must guarantee their availability at least for the presentation of their paper. A replacement should be identified in case of audio-video technical problems. All co-authors of a registered paper are entitled to receive a complimentary virtual registration code.
*   **Pre-recorded videos:** All remote presenters with papers in the proceedings must upload a pre-recorded video of their presentation. For onsite presenters, pre-recorded videos are optional.

### Presentation Time (including Q&A)

However, Computer Graphics Forum and SGP recommend that research papers be up to 10 pages (including all images, but excluding references). Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content.

## Anonymization

Review is based on a dual-anonymous reviewing process. All submitted papers must be anonymized. References to your own work should be made in the third person.

## Article submission

Articles must be submitted, in electronic pdf format, using the Submission and Review Management (SRMv2) system.

[https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/SGP2025_FP2](https://srmv2.eg.org/COMFy/Conference/SGP2025_FP2)

## Abstract submission

In order for a paper to be considered for publication, a corresponding abstract must be submitted. Although the abstract submission deadline (see timeline above) is not mandatory, it is strongly encouraged to abide by it.

## Reviewing process

Submitted papers undergo a two-stage review process, involving dual-anonymous assessment by carefully selected reviewers from the technical papers committee. Articles are conditionally accepted after the first round. Final acceptance is determined in the second round, based on the revised version of the article.

## Anonymity and Preprints

We are adopting the same policy as SIGGRAPH on preprints. Authors must not discuss the research described in submitted SGP papers with the media.

After submitting to SGP, authors may archive the submission without mentioning SGP as an institutional tech report or on arXiv or a similar service.

## Proceedings

The SGP proceedings will appear as a regular electronic issue of the Computer Graphics Forum, the International Journal of the EUROGRAPHICS Association. The journal status of the proceedings requires a two-stage review process with conditional acceptance after the first round and final acceptance based on the revised submissions.

## Awards and Recognitions

SGP 2024 will attribute three best paper awards, a software award recognising the authors of an open-source software that has greatly influenced the field, and a data set award designed to acknowledge the suppliers of high quality datasets used in geometry processing.

Please send nominations to awardnominations@geometryprocessing.org

The ACM SIGCOMM 2025 conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions or significant deployment experiences in communication networks and networked systems. SIGCOMM takes a broad view of networking which includes (but is not limited to):

*   All types of computer networks, including mobile, wide-area, data center, embedded, home, and enterprise networks.
*   All types of wired and wireless technologies, including optics, radio, acoustic, and visible light-based communication.
*   All aspects of networks and networked systems, such as network architecture, packet-switched and circuit-switched hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, resource management, performance, energy consumption and environmental impact, topology, robustness, security, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics, evolution, and interactions with applications.
*   All parts of the network life cycle, including planning, designing, building, operating, troubleshooting, migrations, and end-of-life.
*   All approaches and techniques, including theory, analysis, experimentation, and AI/machine learning.

SIGCOMM 2025 will accept submissions in two tracks: **research** and **experience**.

Strong research track submissions will significantly advance the state of the art in networking by, for instance, proposing and developing novel ideas or by rigorously evaluating or re-evaluating existing ideas. Strong experience track submissions will present key insights found in the course of executing deployments of networking techniques, especially in settings that most in the community cannot duplicate (for instance, for reasons of scale). Survey and tutorial papers are out of scope.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Submissions should be in two-column, 10-point format, and can be up to **12 pages** in length with as many additional pages as necessary for references and optional appendices.
*   All submissions must be anonymous, i.e., not reveal author names. Experience submissions, however, may reveal the name of the deploying organization or the deployed system.
*   All authors must be listed in HotCRP before the submission deadline so that reviewer conflicts are handled properly.
*   At paper registration time, authors must explicitly choose in the submission form whether their paper is to be considered for the research, or experience track. Each submission will only be considered for the one track identified at submission time.
*   Appendices may also include non-traditional material, such as videos, datasets, and code, all appropriately anonymized.
*   **Submission site:** [https://sigcomm25.hotcrp.com](https://sigcomm25.hotcrp.com)

## New this year

*   **SIGCOMM shorts:** A small number of the submissions will be invited to present a “lightning” talk at SIGCOMM’25 and a shorter version of the submission which will be included in the conference proceedings (up to two pages excluding references and appendices).
*   **One-shot revision:** A small number of submissions may be invited to a one-shot revision. Authors will be given a deadline (approximately 1.5 months after the revision request is issued) to submit a version of their work addressing all revision instructions. A revise-and-resubmit decision is not a guarantee for eventual acceptance.

## Ethics and Policy

All papers must include, in the main body of the paper, a statement or subsection about ethical issues raised by the work. Papers that do not include an ethics statement may be rejected.

Authors should also consult ACM Publications Policies and [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship), especially those around Authors; Plagiarism, Misrepresentation, and Falsification; Research Involving Human Subjects; Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions; Coercion and Abuse; and the use of Generative AI in papers.

## Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers

The authors of accepted SIGCOMM 2025 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process.

The SIGDIAL venue provides a regular forum for the presentation of cutting edge research in dialogue and discourse to both academic and industry researchers, continuing a series of 25 successful previous meetings. The conference is sponsored by the SIGDIAL organization – the Special Interest Group in discourse and dialogue for ACL and ISCA.

## Topics of Interest

SIGDIAL 2025 invites submissions of original research on all aspects of discourse and dialogue. We encourage formal, corpus-based, experimental, or analytical work, as well as work on implementations and applications, including but not limited to the following areas:

*   **Discourse Processing:** Research on rhetorical and coherence relations, discourse parsing, discourse connectives, reference resolution, event representation, and causality in narrative. This also includes work on argument mining, text quality and style, cross-lingual discourse analysis, and discourse considerations in applications like machine translation, text summarization, essay grading, question answering, and information retrieval. We particularly encourage submissions that explore discourse issues in text generated by large language models.
*   **Pragmatic and Semantic Modeling:** Investigations into the pragmatics and semantics of conversations, going beyond the single sentence level. This includes research on rational speech acts, conversation acts, intentions, conversational implicature, and presuppositions.
*   **Dialogue Systems:** Contributions related to task-oriented and open-domain dialogue systems, whether spoken, multimodal, embedded, situated, or text-based. This includes research on system components, evaluation, and applications. Specific areas of interest include knowledge representation and extraction for dialogue, state representation and tracking, policy learning, social and emotional intelligence, dialogue in virtual reality and human-robot interaction, entrainment, alignment, and priming. We also welcome work on generation for dialogue, style, voice, personality, and safety and ethics in dialogue systems.
*   **LLM-Based Dialogue Technologies:** Research on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in dialogue systems, including but not limited to areas like prompt engineering, fine-tuning for dialogue, data synthesis and augmentation for dialogue tasks, safety and ethics of LLMs in conversation, and evaluation of LLM-generated dialogue.
*   **Corpora, Tools, and Methodology:** Submissions focused on corpus-based and experimental work on discourse and dialogue. We encourage submissions related to annotation tools and schemes, crowdsourcing, evaluation methodologies, and corpora development.
*   **Applications of Dialogue and Discourse Processing Technology:** We welcome submissions showcasing innovative applications of dialogue and discourse processing technology in various domains.

## Submission Types

The following submission types are expected:

*   **Long Papers:** 8 pages max, excluding references and appendices; +1 page in the final version. Long papers should describe substantial, original, completed, and unpublished work. Include concrete evaluation and analysis where appropriate.

## Submission Instructions

Papers must be submitted electronically in printable pdf form via the submission site posted on this page. All submissions should satisfy the following requirements:

*   **Soft tracking:** All submissions, regardless of the selected track, will be treated equally in terms of acceptance criteria and review guidelines. Authors must select a track from among the ones listed on the submission website when submitting their paper. Optionally, a second track may be selected only for papers with a strong inter-disciplinary element. The five tracks adopted for SIGMETRICS 2026 (for all three deadlines) are:
    *   Learning
    *   Measurement & Applied Modeling
    *   Systems
    *   Theory
    *   Operational Systems Track (NEW!)
*   In addition to tracks, authors must select one or more topics from a list provided in the submission site.
*   The submission may have up to **20 pages**, in single-column acmsmall template format, for technical content (including all tables and figures), plus unlimited pages for references. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review. Additionally, authors may supplement their paper with an appendix, whose length is not constrained.
*   Reviewing is double anonymous (also known as double blind); please do NOT include your name or affiliation on the submission.
*   Authors must truthfully declare all conflicts with program committee members on the submission page.
*   Authors are encouraged to conform to the guidelines provided in the Professional Communication Guidelines section below.

## Policies

*   Anonymity guidelines: ACM SIGMETRICS is double anonymous, meaning that authors should make a good-faith effort to anonymize their papers.
*   Publication of a pre-submission version of the submission on your personal website, institutional archive, or the arXiv is allowed.
*   The paper must have a substantive title and abstract. Placeholders are not allowed after the registration deadline. Any submission that does not have a substantive title and abstract by the registration deadline will be rejected without further notice.
*   Submissions must present original research.
*   Authors are allowed to make light use of Large Language Models (LLMs), to improve presentation (e.g., editing, grammar, or figures), but not as part of the methodology or to create a significant part of the paper. Authors must declare their use of LLMs when submitting the paper.
*   Authors must declare at submission their efforts to ensure the reproducibility of the work: What data, code, and experimental artifacts will be publicly released when the paper is accepted?
*   It is ACM policy not to allow [simultaneous submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions), where the same paper is concurrently submitted to more than one conference/journal.
*   All accepted papers will undergo a shepherding process.
*   Authors have the option to “opt out” of publication in the ACM POMACS journal if they would like to publish their work in some other journal.
*   Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered.
*   To avoid any potential bias, the core conference organizers, including the General Chairs and Program Chairs, will not submit papers to any of the SIGMETRICS submission deadlines in this call for papers.

## Ethical Considerations

Papers describing experiments with users or user data should follow the basic principles of ethical research.
Authors must, as part of the submission process, attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s).
As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.

## Professional Communication Guidelines

As part of our efforts at fostering a professional and respectful environment, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or your conference presentation.

*   Featured Sessions
*   Keynotes

## Upcoming ACM Open Access Policy

Please be advised that beginning **1 January 2026**, ACM will implement a full transition to an Open Access publishing model. This policy will apply to all ACM publications, including those originating from ACM-sponsored conferences held from 2026 onward.

### Impact on SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 Contributors:

The new ACM Open Access policy does not apply to SIGGRAPH Asia 2025, which takes place 15–18 December 2025.

Authors submitting to SIGGRAPH Asia 2025 will not be subject to Article Processing Charges (APCs) associated with the new publishing model.

### For Future Planning:

For ACM conferences held in 2026 and beyond, papers whose authors are affiliated with institutions participating in the ACM Open program will have their APCs covered. Waivers and discounts may also be granted to those institutions that fall under the APC Waivers and Discounts Policy.

Authors affiliated with non-participating institutions may be required to pay an APC, with discounted rates (65%) in place during a transition period throughout 2026:

*   **$250 APC** for ACM/SIGGRAPH members
*   **$350** for Non-members

We recommend that authors and institutions review ACM’s Open Access policy to understand how these changes may affect future submissions.

### Final draft:

*   December 7th, 2025 – Final drafts submitted by authors to EasyChair

After final drafts are submitted and reviewed, your conference committee will submit them to the publishing coordinators (Sheridan Communications). They will then reach out to you in February to review your paper once more and submit your copyright forms.

During the submission process, you’ll also have the option to indicate whether you’re interested in participating in an Author Workshop. These workshops will be scheduled after the Call for Proposals closes. You can also find more information regarding these workshops in the SIGUCCS Slack #Conference and #General channels.

## Commitment to Inclusion and Accessibility:

All submissions and sessions should follow accessible and inclusive design practices—plain language, defined terms, alt text for visuals, and inclusive language. Need help? Our team of volunteers are here to support you!

## Be Part of Something Bigger:

SIGUCCS isn’t just a conference, it’s a community. By presenting, you contribute to a professional network that values mentorship, growth, and authentic exchange. If your work helps higher ed IT adapt, thrive, and support its people, we want to hear from you.

## Note: Open Access Pricing – Article Processing Charges (APCs)

ACM has migrated their publication process to an open access licensing structure. SIG members that are affiliated with, and publishing under the support of an Open ACM Member Institution can do so free of charge. Note, abstracts, which are ACM formatted documents up to 2 pages, have no publishing fee. If your institution is not part of the OpenACM program and your submission is more than 2 pages when formatted there will be a publishing fee:

From ACM regarding Open Access Pricing (APC Fees)

The pricing below is valid for all hybrid and gold open access publications for conferences scheduled in 2026:

Authors | List Price | ACM/ SIG Member Price | Open ACM Member Institution
------- | -------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------
ACM Proceedings Article | $350* | $250* | FREE
ACM Proceedings “Abstract” (up to 2 pages) | FREE | FREE | FREE

Important update on ACMs new open access publishing model for 2026 ACM Conferences!

Starting January 1, 2026, ACM will fully transition to Open Access. All ACM publications, including those from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be 100% Open Access. Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs). With over 1,800 institutions already part of ACM Open, the majority of ACM-sponsored conference papers will not require APCs from authors or conferences (currently, around 70-75%).

Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC to publish their papers, unless they qualify for a financial or discretionary waiver. To find out whether an APC applies to your article, please consult the list of participating institutions in ACM Open and review the APC Waivers and Discounts Policy. Keep in mind that waivers are rare and are granted based on specific criteria set by ACM.

Understanding that this change could present financial challenges, ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more time for institutions to join ACM Open. The subsidy will offer:

*   **$250** APC for ACM/SIG members
*   **$350** for non-members

This represents a 65% discount, funded directly by ACM. Authors are encouraged to help advocate for their institutions to join ACM Open during this transition period.

This temporary subsidized pricing will apply to all conferences scheduled for 2026."

**Bangalore, India, May 31-June 5, 2026**

[https://2026.sigmod.org](https://2026.sigmod.org)

The PACMMOD issues of SIGMOD 2026 seek contributions in all aspects of data management research. Authors of papers published in the PACMMOD issues of SIGMOD 2026 will be invited to present their work at the SIGMOD conference, May 31-June 5, 2026. The annual ACM SIGMOD conference is a leading international forum for data management researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and results, and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences.

## Highlights of 2026:

*   **Submission website:** [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMOD2026](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMOD2026) (available from about one week before the abstract submission deadlines of all four rounds).
*   **Four Paper Submission Deadlines:** January 17 (Round 1), April 17 (Round 2), July 17 (Round 3), October 17 (Round 4).
*   **Abstract, COIs and Paper Submission Dates:** Abstracts and COIs need to be submitted a week ahead of the main paper submission on Jan 10, Apr 10, Jul 10, or Oct 10. See also [Dates](./calls_papers_sigmod_research.shtml#dates). Each author of a paper needs a verified CMT account before submitting an abstract. Each author has to declare their individual domain and PC conflicts during abstract submission. While these conflicts are automatically applied to all their submissions, the authors need to check that conflicts are up to date in each round.
*   **COI declaration:** COIs must be declared by the abstract deadline by each author (1 week before the submission deadline). Missing COI declaration by the abstract deadline may lead to desk rejection. Please also read the requirements for COI declaration below carefully before submitting your paper.
*   **1 Year Wait:** Rejected papers cannot be submitted to SIGMOD until a full year has passed. I.e. a paper rejected at Round 4 of SIGMOD 2025 can only be resubmitted to Round 4 of SIGMOD 2026. A paper rejected at Round 2 can be resubmitted to Round 2, 3, and 4 of SIGMOD 2026.
*   **Double-Anonymity:** All submissions must be anonymized accordingly.
*   **No Special Tracks.** Previous data-intensive and data science applications tracks are now paper types in the main research track.
*   **ORCIDs:** ORCIDs are required for all authors at the time of abstract submission. See [Submission Guidelines](./calls_papers_sigmod_research.shtml#submission).
*   **Paper length:** Submissions must be at most 12 pages in length, plus an unlimited number of pages for citations.
*   **New! Appendix:** An appendix as a separate pdf can be submitted along with the paper. Note that the paper must be self-contained and the reviewers are not required to read the appendix.The appendix should be short and used judiciously by authors to include some helpful details such as proofs. A long appendix which covers material that contains contents which in fact expands the scope of the paper and cannot be sufficiently discussed in the main paper (e.g., contains many additional experimental results) will be ignored in the review process. Finally, note that the appendix is only used in the paper review process and will not be part of the camera ready version of accepted papers (as it is not part of the official review).
*   **New! Revisions and Author Feedback:** SIGMOD 2026 will have revisions and an author feedback phase. See [Review Process](./calls_papers_sigmod_research.shtml#review) for more details.
*   **New! Revision Plans from Authors with Author Feedback (before Decisions):** With the author feedback, authors can suggest a revision plan before a decision is reached. The proposed revision plan will be taken into account during decision making by the AE and the reviewers. See [Review Process](./calls_papers_sigmod_research.shtml#review) for more details.
*   **New! Interactive Discussion Phase (after Author Feedback and before Decisions):** The reviewers can ask authors directly and anonymously if further clarifications are needed.
*   **New! Presentations and Posters:** All papers will be presented at the conference. We will have long and short presentations to accommodate the growing number of papers in SIGMOD. In addition, all papers will also have a poster.

### Paper Types

The conference invites the submission of (1) Regular Research Papers, (2) Experiment & Analysis (E&A) Studies, and (3) Papers on Data-Intensive & Data Science (DI&DS) Applications that focus on data management challenges relevant to one of the topics in the call for papers. All papers are reviewed by the same SIGMOD program committee.

*   **Regular Research Papers:** Research Papers present original contributions related to aspects of data management mentioned in the list of topics above.
*   **Experimental Analysis (E&A) Studies.** The scientific contribution of an E&A paper lies in providing new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods in one of the topics in the list above rather than in providing new methods. E&A paper titles must use a suffix of "": [Experiments & Analysis]"", i.e., the full title of the paper should look like “<paper title>: [Experiments & Analysis]”.
*   **Data-Intensive & Data Science (DI&DS) Applications.** The scientific contribution of a DI&DS submission lies in providing new insights into data management challenges (see list of topics above) from real-world applications. DI&DS paper titles must use a suffix of "": [Data-Intensive & Data Science Application]"", i.e., the full title of the paper should look like “<paper title>: [Data-Intensive & Data Science Application]”.

## 2. Important Dates

There are 4 submission rounds (January, April, July, and October). Authors of submissions with a revision decision will be given approximately one month to submit a revised version. While we strive to adhere to the published timeline, we note that author feedback and notification dates may vary slightly. Submission deadlines are not expected to be altered.

As we have moved to quarterly deadlines, maintaining consistency is important, both to avoid confusion, and to better manage and plan the workload of the PC. We realize that deadlines may occasionally fall on holidays or weekends. However, we note that holidays are not common across different countries and cultures, and there is variability in which days of the week are considered workdays. We encourage authors to plan ahead and aim to submit a few days early if they wish to avoid a particular holiday or weekend.

## 3. Presentation and Dissemination

Accepted papers will be published in issues of the Proceedings of the ACM on Management of Data (PACMMOD) (https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod), with one issue corresponding to each submission deadline, and invited for presentation at the SIGMOD conference. The number of SIGMOD submissions has been growing steadily over many years resulting in more accepted papers while the duration of the conference is fixed. While the goal is to have a presentation slot for all accepted papers at the conference, based on the number of accepted papers, papers may be chosen to have longer or shorter slots. All papers will be presented as posters in addition. More details of the presentation format will be updated later in the process.

## 4. Submission Guidelines

*   **Submission Link:**	[https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMOD2026](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/SIGMOD2026)
*   **Submission Paper length:**	12 pages excluding references
*   **References:**	Unlimited
*   **Appendix:**	Yes, as a separate pdf, but only to include essential details. Note that the paper must be self-contained and the reviewers are not required to read the appendix. The appendix is only used during review and is not part of the camera-ready version of accepted papers. The appendix should be short and used judiciously by authors to include the essential details that may be useful in the review process (e.g., additional proofs). A longer appendix with additional results and material that cannot be sufficiently discussed in the main paper is discouraged and will definitively be ignored in the review process.
*   **File type and size:**	PDF (<= 10 MB)
*   **Paper size:**	Letter (8.5” x 11”)

**Format**

*   2-column ACM Proceedings format:
*   LaTeX:	sample-sigconf.tex (version 2e)
*   Word:	ACM’s official 2-column template
*   Overleaf:	ACM’s official 2-column template

*   **Anonymity:**	Double-anonymity (see below)
*   **Camera Ready Paper length:**	13 pages excluding references (for all accepted papers), no appendix, in 2-column ACM format, converted to the PACMMOD format

### Duplicate Submissions and Novelty Requirement

Following the ACM guidelines a paper submitted to SIGMOD 2026 cannot be under review for any other publishing forum or presentation venue, including conferences, workshops, and journals, during the time it is being considered for SIGMOD. Furthermore, after you submit a paper to SIGMOD, you must await the response from SIGMOD and only re-submit elsewhere if your paper is rejected—or withdrawn at your request—from SIGMOD. This restriction applies not only to identical papers but also to papers with a substantial overlap in scientific content and results.

### ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects

As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

### Inclusion and Diversity in Writing

We value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and professions. Both are important in our writing as well. Diversity of representation in writing is a simple but visible avenue to celebrate and ultimately help improve our community's diversity. Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Be vigilant and guard against unintentionally exclusionary examples.

### Policy on Authorship Requirements

We follow the [ACM policy on authorship requirements](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship). Specifically on the use of generative AI tools and technologies, the guidelines note that: ""Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work.""

## 5. Anonymity Requirements

Research track submissions are subject to the double-anonymity requirement.

Every research track paper submitted to SIGMOD 2026 will undergo a double-anonymous reviewing process, following the three principles put forward in (Snodgrass 2007): authors should not be required to go to great lengths to anonymize their submissions; comprehensiveness of the review trumps anonymizing efficacy. AEs retain flexibility and authority in managing the reviewing process.

It is the responsibility of authors to do their very best to preserve anonymity. Papers that do not follow these guidelines, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection.

## 6. Artifacts and Reproducibility

SIGMOD strives to establish a culture where sharing research artifacts (data, results, code, and scripts) is the norm rather than an exception. SIGMOD reproducibility has three goals: (a) Highlighting the impact of database research papers; (b) enabling easy dissemination of research results; and (c) enabling easy sharing of code and experimentation set-ups. In this context, we expect all papers to make their code, data, scripts, and notebooks available. Although it is not mandatory for acceptance, providing this extra material can help reviewers evaluate your work more thoroughly. Papers published at SIGMOD which have been successfully reproduced are also recognized and highlighted as such in the ACM Digital Library.

## 7. Conflicts of Interest

Each author is responsible for entering their ORCID, and their own individual domain and PC conflicts on CMT. You can mark your conflicts by clicking on your name (upper right-hand side on CMT) and selecting ''Domain Conflicts'' and ''Individual Conflicts''. We expect authors to have a single unique ORCID: the one used at submission will be used for publication.

It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members.

Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information after the abstract submission deadline are subject to immediate rejection.

## 8. Reviewing Process, Interactive Discussions, and Revisions

Each submission will first receive at least three reviews. At the discretion of the AE and the PC chairs, additional reviews may be procured.

There is an author feedback phase. Before the interactive discussion phase starts and decisions are made, authors will have a few days to read the initial reviews and submit feedback. 

Some papers will be invited to submit a revised version (minor or major). Authors will have one month to implement the revision items. The revision process is intended to be a constructive partnership between reviewers and authors."

## Code of Conduct

SoCG is dedicated to providing an environment that is free from harassment, bullying, discrimination, and retaliation for all participants. Starting in 2025, CG Week including SoCG will be organized as an event of the CG Society. All members of the Society are bound by its Code of Conduct. Only members of the Society can give a presentation and hence at least one author of each accepted paper must become a member of the Society. Society membership is free.

## Submission Guidelines

### Paper types

When writing or evaluating a SoCG paper, it is important to keep in mind that there are different types of contributions, each with its own strengths. To ensure that a submission is evaluated on its own merits, authors will need to identify the main strengths of their submission, as captured by four possible paper types. PC members and external reviewers will be asked to take into account these paper types together with their associated evaluation criteria when they evaluate a paper. There are no quotas for the paper types and submissions can be labeled with more than one paper type at the time of submission.

1.  **Mathematical Foundations:** A typical paper will contain theorems and proofs describing new results in discrete or combinatorial geometry, discrete differential geometry or topology, or in topological combinatorics. The paper will primarily be evaluated on its technical depth, the importance of the results, the elegance of the solution, the connection of the problem studied to computational geometry and topology, and the potential future impact on algorithm development.
2.  **Algorithmic Complexity:** A typical paper will contain algorithms, data structures, theorems, proofs, or lower bound constructions describing new results on computational geometry problems. The paper will primarily be evaluated on the (mathematical or computational) relevance and importance of the problem studied, its technical depth, the elegance of the solution, and the potential future impact of the results or the proposed new methods and techniques.
3.  **Experiments and Implementation:** A typical paper will make a clear contribution to the implementation and evaluationp of geometric algorithms, such as exact, approximate, or algebraic computation, algorithms engineering, or the experimental evaluation of competing algorithmic approaches. The paper will primarily be evaluated on the completeness and the expected impact of the proposed implementation, the soundness of the experiments, the quality and quantity of testing, and on the general amount of knowledge gained.
4.  **Applications:** A typical paper will describe the modeling and algorithmic choices made when developing or adapting computational geometry techniques for an application area. The paper will be primarily evaluated on the soundness of the modeling decisions, the ingenuity of the solution, the effectiveness of the proposed method, and the expected impact in the application area. One might also consider the lesson learned regarding the applicability or suitability of computational geometry tools to the specific area.

### Double Blind and PC submissions

SoCG will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process, and will allow PC members (other than the PC chairs) to submit to the conference as well. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, funding information, and email addresses should not appear in the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not ""We build on our previous work ..."" but rather ""We build on the work of ..."").

### Format

Submissions must be formatted in accordance with the LIPIcs proceedings guidelines. Authors are required to use the LaTeX class file [https://computational-geometry.org/documents/socg-lipics-v2021.cls](https://computational-geometry.org/documents/socg-lipics-v2021.cls) (V0.9, Sep 19, 2022), with the option “anonymous”.
Submissions must not exceed 500 lines, excluding front matter (title), references, and a clearly marked appendix (further described below), but including all other lines (in abstract, algorithms, tables, captions, etc.).

### Contents of the submission

Papers should be submitted in the form of an extended abstract, which begins with the title of the paper, as well as a short abstract. This should be followed by the main body of the paper that begins with a precise statement of the problem considered, a succinct summary of the results obtained (emphasizing the significance, novelty, and potential impact of the research), and a clear comparison with related work.

### Appendix and additional data

All details needed to verify the results must be provided. Supporting materials, including proofs of theoretical claims and experimental details, that do not fit in the 500-line limit should be given in an appendix.

### Previous or simultaneous submissions

Results previously published or accepted for publication in the proceedings of another conference cannot be submitted. Simultaneous submissions of the results to another conference with published proceedings are not allowed.

### Strict guidelines

Submissions deviating from the above guidelines risk being rejected without further consideration.

## Guidelines for reviewers

The guidelines for reviewers are available [here](https://computational-geometry.org/documents/socg-reviewing.pdf).

## Accepted Papers

### Presentation

An author of each accepted paper is expected to attend the symposium and present the paper (approximately 20 minutes). Note that SoCG 2025 will be organized as an event of the CG Society and hence the presenting author(s) must be a member of the Society. Society membership is free.

### Best paper award

An accepted paper may be selected as the best paper. All papers are eligible.

### Best student paper award

An accepted paper may be selected as the best student paper. A paper is eligible if all authors are students at the time of submission. This must be indicated in the submission process. There is a box provided for this purpose on the submission server.

### Best student presentation award

Based on the feedback from the audience, a presentation during the symposium by a student may be selected as the best student presentation.

## Invited papers and special issues

Authors of the best paper will be invited to submit an extended version of their paper to the Journal of the ACM, and authors of one (or more) most highly ranked papers may be invited to submit their full paper to the journal TheoretiCS. Authors of a selection of accepted papers from the symposium will be invited to submit extended versions of their papers to special issues of Discrete & Computational Geometry and Journal of Computational Geometry.

*   **Position papers:** Original long (up to 8 pages plus up to one page of references) and short (up to 4 pages plus up to one page of references) position papers discussing ideas and concepts related to heuristic and combinatorial search.
*   **Extended abstracts:** (up to 2 pages, including references) of original work, work-in-progress, or work that has recently appeared in or is under review at other venues.

## Submission Instructions

Submitted technical and position papers must be original and not submitted concurrently to a journal or another conference. Double-blind reviewing will be provided, so submitted papers must omit author names and affiliations.

Extended abstracts representing previously published work do not need to omit author information. Authors should mention on the first page where this paper has been published or accepted for publication.

Extended abstracts representing under-reviewed work should omit author names and affiliations. Authors should mention on the first page where this paper is currently under review.

The paper submission is a two-step process. First, the paper abstract needs to be registered in EasyChair by the Paper abstract submission deadline. Then, the full paper in PDF is due by the Paper submission deadline. Remember, without registering your abstract on time, you will not be allowed to submit the paper later.

Submissions may be accompanied by supplementary material (video, appendices), which must also be anonymized. Reviewers will not be required to consult such material.

SoCS will not accept any technical or position paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Authors are also required not to submit their technical or position papers elsewhere during SoCS's review period.

## Best Paper Awards

Technical papers will be considered for the best paper award. If the main authors, both in terms of work and writing, are students at the time of submission, the paper will be considered for a best student paper award.

## Camera-Ready Instructions

The page limit for camera-ready copies is the same as the page limit for submission papers. However, the last ""reference"" page of the long and short papers can include acknowledgment in addition to the references.

## Important Dates

*   **Paper abstract submission deadline:** March 19, 2025 (now closed)
*   **Paper submission deadline:** March 26, 2025 (now closed)
*   **Author response:** May 2-5, 2025 (already past)
*   **Notification:** May 16, 2025
*   **Camera-ready copy:** May 30, 2025

All deadlines are at 23:59 UTC-12.

## Topics

SOSP takes a broad view of systems and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including: operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, virtualization, networking as it relates to operating systems, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interaction of computer systems with related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, verification, and databases.

## Submission Criteria

Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. A good paper will:

*   Motivate a significant problem;
*   Propose and implement an interesting, compelling solution;
*   Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution;
*   Draw appropriate conclusions;
*   Clearly describe the paper's contributions; and
*   Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work.

We encourage submission of groundbreaking work in significant new directions, with the understanding that the evaluation criteria for papers addressing new problems may be different from those continuing a line of work in a more established area.

## Artifact Evaluation

SOSP will continue the successful tradition of running an optional Artifact Evaluation process.

Authors have a few days after acceptance notifications to register their artifact, then a few more days to polish them for evaluation.

The artifact evaluation process is cooperative. Authors have the opportunity to fix problems found by evaluators during the evaluation period, and are thus expected to reply within reasonable time.

## Originality

Submissions should contain original, unpublished material. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism is not allowed.

Submissions that extend the authors' previous work are welcome, but authors must explain the differences between the SOSP submission and the prior work.

Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in SOSP. Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is explicitly permitted.

## Anonymity

SOSP will use double-blind reviewing. Please make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication.

If the name of your project or system is already known to the community, your SOSP submission must use an anonymized name.

## Formatting

Papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format via the [web submission form](https://sosp26.hotcrp.com/) (TBD).

Submissions may have at most **12 pages of technical content**, including all text, figures, tables, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit. Use A4 or US letter paper size.

We encourage you to upload an early draft of the paper well before the deadline to check if the paper meets the formatting rules.

For Latex, we recommend you use:

```latex
\documentclass[sigplan,10pt]{acmart}
\renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{}
...
\settopmatter{printfolios=true}
\maketitle
\pagestyle{plain}
...
```

## Conflicts

To avoid conflicts of interest in the review process, when you register and submit your paper, we ask that you provide information about conflicts between any of the authors of your submission and PC members. Use the provided guidelines to determine conflicts.

## Author Response Period

SOSP will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work.

Submission of a response is optional. There is no explicit limit to the response, but authors are strongly encouraged to keep responses under 500 words; reviewers are neither required nor expected to read excessively long responses.

## Questions

Any questions about paper submissions can be emailed to program@sosp26.cit.tum.de."

[Overview of recent SoK papers](https://oaklandsok.github.io)

## Submission Deadlines & Decisions

For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:

*   **Accept:** Papers will be accepted for publication and presentation. The papers will immediately be published, open access, in the Computer Society’s Digital Library, and they may be cited as “To appear in the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy, May 2026”.
*   **Reject:** Papers are declined for inclusion. Rejected papers must wait for one year to resubmit to IEEE S&P.

## Public Meta-Reviews

All accepted papers will be published with a meta-review (< 500 words) in the final PDF that lists: (a) the reasons the PC decided to accept the paper and (b) concerns the PC has with the paper. Authors will be given the option to write a response to the meta-review (< 500 words) which will be published as part of the meta-review.

More information about the reasons behind this change can be found on the [2024 IEEE S&P website](https://sp2024.ieee-security.org/changes-cfp.html).

## Symposium Event

Each accepted paper will have: (a) a short talk presentation (e.g., 5-7 minutes) and (b) a poster presentation immediately following the talk session containing the paper. All accepted papers are required to present both a short talk and a poster.

## Resubmission of Rejected Papers

Rejected papers must wait one year before resubmission to IEEE S&P.

## Instructions for Paper Submission

All submissions must be original work. Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue is not allowed. Any author may not submit more than 6 papers per cycle.

## Anonymous Submission

Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review: no author names or affiliations may appear on the title page, and papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.

Authors should take extra care to not include authors’ information in the artifacts repository or artifacts content, so as not to break the anonymity of the paper submission.

## Conflicts of Interest

During submission, the submission site will request information about conflicts of interest of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members.

## Research Ethics Committee

IEEE S&P 2026 has a research ethics committee (REC) that will check papers flagged by reviewers as potentially including ethically fraught research.

Authors are encouraged to review the [Menlo Report](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CSD-MenloReport-PrivacyPrinciples-201008.pdf) for general ethical guidelines for computer and information security research.

## Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure

Where research identifies a vulnerability, we expect that researchers act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. A disclosure window of 45-90 days ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.

## Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research

Submissions that describe experiments that could be viewed as involving human subjects should disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable.

## Financial and Non-financial competing interests

Authors and PC members are required to declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in relation to the work described. More information regarding this policy is available [here](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2022/financial-con.html).

## Page Limit and Formatting

Submitted papers may include up to 13 pages of text and up to 5 pages for references and appendices, totaling no more than 18 pages. Papers must be formatted for US letter size paper. All submissions must use the IEEE “compsoc” conference proceedings template. Papers that fail to use the “compsoc” template are subject to rejection without review.

See the “IEEE Demo Template for Computer Society Conferences” [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/ieee-demo-template-for-computer-society-conferences/wqmwmnkgpkcc) for an example.

## Withdrawing Policy

A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper can not be withdrawn.

## Authorship Policy

Changes to the authorship list are not permitted while the paper is under submission.

All authors are required to submit an ORCID number at paper submission time. You can obtain an ORCID number [here](https://orcid.org/).

## Conference Submission Server

Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf).

Placeholder, incomplete, or inaccurate titles and abstracts may result in rejection without review.

### Paper Submission

Technical papers must be uploaded as PDFs by **February 13, 2025**. All submissions must follow the guidelines described below. Submissions that violate any of the requirements below may be rejected without review.

Contact the program chairs prior to submission at [soups25chairs@usenix.org](mailto:soups25chairs@usenix.org) if you have any questions about these requirements.

### Format and Page Limits

Papers must use the SOUPS formatting template (available for [MS Word](https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference-files/usenix2025_soups.doc) or [LaTeX](https://www.usenix.org/sites/default/files/conference-files/usenix2025_soups_latex-template.zip)) and be submitted as a PDF via the [web submission system](https://soups2025.usenix.hotcrp.com/). Submissions must be no more than **12 pages** (excluding acknowledgments, bibliography, and appendices).

Submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for references and for supplementary material in appendices.

Camera-ready versions of accepted papers have an official limit of **12 pages** (excluding acknowledgments, bibliography, and appendices) and **20 pages total** including references and appendices.

### Anonymous Submission

Reviewing is anonymous. No names or affiliations should appear on the title page or in the body of the paper, acknowledgments should be removed, and papers should avoid revealing the authors' identities in the text (e.g., don't name a specific organization's ethics review board or similar) or in the PDF metadata.

### Overlap with Previous Papers

[USENIX policy](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/submissions-policy) prohibits simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, and plagiarism. Any overlap between your submitted paper and other work either under submission, previously published, or submitted elsewhere before the SOUPS notification deadline must be documented in an explanatory note sent to the chairs.

Technical reports, e.g., arXiv reports, are exempt from this rule.

### Conflicts of Interest

The submission system will request information about conflicts of interest between the paper's authors and program committee (PC) members, including a brief explanation.

### Ethical Research

All papers, especially those with human subjects studies, are expected to discuss ethical considerations. Risks and benefits of the presented research should be weighed. Methodological decisions should be justified.

### Response

A response period will occur after the second round of reviews. Authors will be given a chance to see reviews, and they may provide a short response that will be considered in subsequent discussions. The response period is from **April 17–24, 2025**.

### Presentation

For accepted papers, we require at least one of the paper authors to attend the conference and present the work.

Accepted papers at an early round are definitely accepted and should not be submitted again at a later round. In case of resubmission, reviews from the previously submitted round will be transmitted to the reviewers of the resubmission round.

## Paper Submission

Papers are to be submitted electronically through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sss2025). All submissions must conform to the formatting instructions of Springer LNCS series. Each submission must be an original work written in English, in PDF format.

## Double-blind Review

All submissions must be anonymous. Please make sure you do not mention your own name or affiliation in the submission, and please do not include obvious references in the text that reveal your identity.

## Submissions

There are two types of submissions: **regular papers** and **brief announcements**.

*   A regular submission must not exceed **15 pages** (including the title, abstract, figures, and excluding references).
*   A brief announcement submission must not exceed **5 pages** including everything.

For the third round only, if requested by the authors on the cover page, a regular submission that is not selected for a regular presentation will also be considered for the brief announcement format.

## Publication

Regular papers and brief announcements will be included in the conference proceedings. Conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS conference series.

## Special Issue

Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of Theoretical Computer Science (Elsevier).

## Paper Award

Prizes will be given to the best regular paper and best student regular paper. A regular paper is eligible for the best student paper if at least one of its authors is a full-time student at submission time.

## Submissions

Submissions should be made through EasyChair, using [this submission link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=stacs2025).

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or a full paper with at most **15 pages**; this page limit excludes the title page, the references section, and a possible appendix.

In preparation of submissions, the usage of the LIPIcs style file is mandatory; no changes to font size, page geometry, etc. are permitted. Please refer to [LIPIcs author instructions](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author).

Submissions should be made to appropriate tracks. The PCs reserve the right to reassign a paper to a different track, if deemed necessary.

The extended abstract should contain a succinct statement of the considered issues and of their motivation, a summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their significance, accessible to non-specialist readers. This should be followed by a rigorous derivation of the claimed results. Proofs omitted due to space constraints should be put into an appendix, to be read by the program committee members at their discretion. It is allowed and encouraged to provide the full version of the paper as the appendix.

## Double-blind reviewing

STACS 2025 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process: submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way.

## Conflicts of interest

Authors will be invited to give a list of persons with a Conflict of Interest (COI).

## Rebuttal

There will be a rebuttal period for authors. Authors will receive the reviews of their submissions and have a few days to prepare and submit rebuttals.

## Conference

At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register at the conference. For authors who cannot present their paper in person, a possibility for remote presentation will be offered.

## Proceedings

Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the symposium. As usual, these proceedings will appear in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series, based at Schloss Dagstuhl. This guarantees perennial, free and easy electronic access, while the authors retain the rights over their work.

## STACS Code of Conduct

**Camera-ready deadline for accepted papers:** March 31, 2025.

## Scope

STOC 2025 seeks papers presenting new and original research on the theory of computation. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include:

*   Algorithms and data structures
*   Computational complexity
*   Randomness in computing
*   Algorithmic graph theory and combinatorics
*   Analysis of Boolean functions
*   Approximation algorithms
*   Cryptography
*   Computational learning theory
*   Continuous and discrete optimization
*   Economics and computation
*   Parallel and distributed algorithms
*   Quantum computing
*   Algorithmic coding theory
*   Computational geometry and topology
*   Computational applications of logic
*   Algebraic computation
*   Computational and foundational aspects of areas such as machine learning, fairness, privacy, networks, data management, databases and computational biology.

Papers that extend the reach of the theory of computing or raise important problems that can benefit from theoretical investigation and analysis are encouraged.

## Submission Format

Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information, and an abstract summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit, and authors are encouraged to use the ""full version"" of their paper as the submission.

Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper's importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This part of the submission should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea. Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.

Material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission. The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

STOC 2025 will use double-blind reviewing, and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity and should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person.

## Conflict of Interest Policy

The submission process will include a declaration of conflicts of interest (COI).
Authors should limit their COI declaration to the following categories:

*   Family member or close friend.
*   Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years.
*   Person with the same affiliation.
*   Person involved in an alleged incident of harassment.
*   Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter).
*   Frequent/recent collaborator, or recipients of joint funding (within the last 2 years or reasonably expected within the next year).

If an author believes that they have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, then they can contact the PC chair or any ToC advocate affiliated with this conference directly. Falsely declared conflicts risk rejection without consideration of merit.

## Submission Instructions

Authors are required to submit their papers electronically in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing).

The submission server is scheduled to open on October 1, 2024.

It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available on arXiv, ECCC, or a similar preprint service by the camera-ready deadline.

## Important Dates

*   **Paper submission deadline:** Monday, November 4, 2024, 7:59pm EST.
*   **Notification date:** by email on or before February 1, 2025.
*   **Camera-ready versions of accepted papers:** March 31, 2025.
*   **STOC talks:** Monday morning June 23 to Friday afternoon June 27, 2025.
*   **Publication date:** The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library.

## Additional Information

*   **Best Paper Award:** The program committee may designate up to three papers accepted to the conference as STOC Best Papers.
*   **Danny Lewin Best Student Paper Award:** A prize of $500 will be given to the author(s) of the best student-authored paper.
*   **Student Travel Awards:** SIGACT provides travel awards to students without available support, and researchers from developing countries.
