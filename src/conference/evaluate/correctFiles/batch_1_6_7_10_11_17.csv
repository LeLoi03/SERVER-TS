### Special Track on AI for Social Impact (AISI)

*   **Focus:** Emphasizes the fit between AI techniques and problems of social importance, the significance of the addressed problem, engagement with previous literature, novelty and justification of the AI-based approach, quality of evaluation, facilitation of follow-up work, and overall scope for social impact.
*   **Review Rubric:** Different from the main track.

### Special Track on AI Alignment (AIA)

*   **Focus:** Scalable oversight, mechanistic interpretability, empirical robustness evaluation, red-teaming, human cognitive and psychological factors, and safe-by-design engineering. Also welcomes work on transparent governance frameworks, economic incentives, institutional accountability, human-centered modeling and evaluation, and pluralistic coordination methods.
*   **Encouraged:** Submissions that release open datasets, reproducible code, or practical evaluation tools.
*   **Review Emphasis:** Technical correctness, appropriate coverage of related work, and relevance to the track.

## Topics of Interest

AAAI-26 welcomes submissions reporting research that advances artificial intelligence broadly conceived. Key areas include:

*   Machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, data mining, multiagent systems, knowledge representation, human-in-the-loop AI, search, planning, reasoning, robotics and perception, and ethics.
*   The conference expressly encourages work that cuts across technical areas (e.g., machine learning and computer vision), bridges between AI and related research areas (e.g., neuroscience, cognitive science), or develops AI techniques in the context of important application domains (e.g., healthcare, sustainability, transportation, and commerce).

## Review Criteria

*   All submissions will be rigorously evaluated for the significance and novelty of contributions, theoretical and/or empirical soundness, relevance to the AAAI community, and clarity of exposition.
*   Additional considerations include adherence to responsible research practices and steps to ensure reproducibility.
*   Preference is given to solid technical papers that explore new territory or point out new directions for research over those that only incrementally advance the state of the art within a narrow sub-area.

## AI-Assisted Peer-Review Process (Pilot Program)

*   AAAI-26 will implement a pilot program for an AI-Assisted Peer Review System to explore the use of AI in the review process.
*   AI-generated reviews and summaries will supplement human reviews but will not contain ratings or recommendations, and will not play a formal role in paper decisions.
*   The two-phase review process will include an AI-generated supplementary review in Phase 1, and authors will be able to respond to all reviews (including the AI-generated one) in Phase 2.
*   Privacy controls will be implemented to ensure confidentiality and compliance with data protection regulations.

ACII 2025 is scheduled just before the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (ICMI 2025) at the same venue, allowing attendees to combine both events.","# Call for Papers

The Association for the Advancement of Affective Computing (AAAC) invites you to submit your original research for presentation at the **13th International Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII 2025)**. The conference will be held as an **in-person event** in **Canberra, Australia**, from **October 8-11, 2025**. Accepted papers must be presented by one of the paper’s authors.

ACII 2025 will be held just before the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (href=""https://icmi.acm.org/2025/"" - ICMI 2025 , 13-17 Oct 2025) at the same venue, thus, enabling the attendees to combine two excellent conferences in one trip.

The ACII conference series is the premier international venue for interdisciplinary research on the design of systems that can recognise, interpret, and simulate human emotions and, more generally, affective phenomena. All accepted papers will be included in IEEE Xplore (subject to approval by the IEEE Computer Society) and indexed by EI. A selection of the best articles at ACII 2025 will be invited to submit extended versions to the IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing.

## Theme: Socially Responsible Affective Computing

Affective computing, with its ability to recognise and respond to human emotions, holds great potential for enhancing user experiences and fostering more natural interactions between humans and machines. It also has promising applications in fields such as mental health. However, this powerful technology also raises significant ethical concerns that must be addressed to ensure its responsible and transparent use.

One of the primary challenges is the potential misuse or exploitation of sensitive emotional data. Ensuring robust data privacy, clear ethical guidelines, and regulations around the use of emotional data is crucial. Additionally, the lack of transparency of many affective computing algorithms, systems built on limited data, and the potential for biases in emotion inference systems pose risks. Transparency, accountability, and mitigating biases in these systems are essential. Regulatory efforts such as the EU AI Act aim to establish legal frameworks for high-risk AI applications, including those related to emotional state detection.

At least one author of each accepted paper (for both tracks) must present the paper at the conference. Failure to do so will result in the paper not being published. All deadlines are at 23:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth) unless otherwise specified.

## New in 2025

To maintain high-quality peer review, each submission must nominate at least one author to serve as a reviewer, unless at least one author has served as an area chair. The nominated author should have published at least one first-author paper and at least one paper in top venues (e.g., ICML, NeurIPS, ICLR, ACML, AAAI, CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, or equivalent). Submissions without this nomination will be desk-rejected. If no author meets the requirement, contact acml_2025_programchairs@googlegroups.com before 30 June 2025 with the OpenReview submission ID.

It will be colocated with CBMI 2025 and MediaEval 2025.","# ACM Multimedia 2025: Call for Papers

Welcome to ACM Multimedia, the premier conference in multimedia, a research field that discusses emerging computing methods from a perspective in which each medium — e.g. images, video, audio — is a strong component of the complete, integrated exchange of information. The multimedia community has a tradition of being able to handle big data, has been a pioneer in large-scale evaluations and dataset creations, and is uniquely angled towards novel applications and cutting-edge industrial challenges. As such the conference openly embraces new intellectual angles from both industry as well as academia and welcomes submissions from related fields, such as data science, HCI, and signal processing.

ACM Multimedia 2025 will be held in **Dublin, Ireland**, from **October 27, 2025 to October 31, 2025**. The conference will be colocated with both CBMI 2025 and MediaEval 2025.

The conference invites papers in five major themes of multimedia: **Generative AI, Engagement, Experience, Systems and Understanding**.

## Regular Papers

ACM Multimedia 2025 calls for research papers presenting novel theoretical and algorithmic solutions to address problems across multimedia and related application fields. The conference also calls for papers presenting novel, thought-provoking ideas, and promising (preliminary) results in realising these ideas, especially surrounding multimodal AI, such as multi-agent, real-time human and machine intelligence working collaboratively. Our focus lies in promoting research that is inherently multimedia or multimodal in nature. While papers that involve unimedia/unimodal processing will not necessarily be rejected, papers that make multimedia/multimodal research contributions will be preferred for publication.

### Paper Length

The conference invites research papers of varying lengths from **6 to 8 pages**, plus additional pages for the reference pages. The reference page(s) are not counted towards the page limit of 6 to 8 pages. Authors may themselves decide on the appropriate length of the paper. All papers will undergo the same review process and review period.

### Submission Deadlines

*   **Abstract submission:** **04.04.2025**
*   **Regular paper submission:** **11.04.2025** (including supplementary materials, if applicable)

*Please note: The submission deadline is at 23:59 of the stated deadline date Anywhere on Earth (AoE).* See the full list of [Important Dates](https://acmmm2025.org/important-dates/).

### Submission Instructions

Submit your Regular Paper via OpenReview: [https://openreview.net/group?id=acmmm.org/ACMMM/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=acmmm.org/ACMMM/2025/Conference)

ACM MM’25 uses OpenReview for paper submission and peer review. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.

All listed authors must have an up-to-date OpenReview profile. The following page contains information on how to create an OpenReview profile. Note OpenReview’s moderation policy for newly created profiles:
*   New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks.
*   New profiles created with an institutional email will (normally) be activated automatically.

The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflicts of interest and paper matching. An incomplete OpenReview profile of any co-author is sufficient ground for desk rejection. To be considered complete, each author profile must be properly attributed with the following mandatory fields: current and past institutional affiliation (going back at least 5 years), homepage, DBLP (if there is prior publication), ORCID, Advisors and Recent Publications (if any). In addition, other fields such as Google Scholar, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar, Advisees and Other Relations should be entered wherever applicable.

Please note that we may ask any author to also serve as a reviewer. Authors who are also serving as reviewers will not be able to see the reviews on their own paper until they complete the reviews assigned to them in a proper and timely manner.

### Paper Format

Submitted papers (.pdf format) must use the ACM Article Template ([https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)). Please remember to add Concepts and Keywords.

Please use the template in traditional double-column format to prepare your submissions. For example, word users should use Word Interim Template, and LaTeX users should use sample-sigconf-authordraft template. When using sample-sigconf-authordraft template, for submission and review of manuscript you could use the following documentclass command instead of the example provided in the template:
```latex
\documentclass[sigconf, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart}
```

Please ensure that you submit your papers subscribing to this format for full consideration during the review process.

### Policies

*   **Multimedia/Multimodality Policy:** Our focus lies in promoting research that is inherently multimedia or multimodal in nature. While papers that involve unimedia/unimodal processing will not necessarily be rejected, papers that make multimedia/multimodal research contributions will be preferred for publication.
*   **Authorship and Generative AI Tools Policy:** Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. If generative AI language tools generate inappropriate language, plagiarized content, errors, mistakes, incorrect references, or misleading content, and that output is included in scientific works, author(s) will take full responsibility for the same.
*   **Length:** Submitted papers may consist of up to 8 pages. Up to two additional pages may be added for references. The reference pages must only contain references. Overlength papers will be rejected without review.
*   **Supplementary Material:** Optionally, you may upload supplementary material that complements your submission (50Mb limit). All the content other than that in the main paper should be written in the separate supplementary material. We do not allow appendix that follow right after the main paper in the main submission file.
*   **Blinding:** Paper submissions must conform with the “double-blind” review policy. This means that the authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the names of the authors. Please prepare your paper in a way that preserves anonymity of the authors. For reviewer assignment, the technical program chairs may employ local LLM instances or similar technologies to process your submissions. No information will be shared with third parties.
    *   Do not put the authors’ names under the title.
    *   Avoid using phrases such as “our previous work” when referring to earlier publications by the authors.
    *   Remove information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs).
    *   Check supplemental material (e.g., titles in the video clips, or supplementary documents) for information that may identify the authors’ identities.
    *   Avoid providing links to websites that identify the authors.
    *   Papers without appropriate blinding will be rejected without review.
*   **Originality:** Papers submitted to ACM Multimedia must be the original work of the authors. They may not be simultaneously under review elsewhere. Publications that have been peer-reviewed and have appeared at other conferences or workshops may not be submitted to ACM Multimedia. Authors should be aware that ACM has a strict policy with regard to plagiarism and self-plagiarism. The authors’ prior work must be cited appropriately.
*   **Author List:** Please ensure that you submit your papers with the full and final list of authors in the correct order. The author list registered for each submission is not allowed to change in any way after the abstract submission deadline, 04 April, 2025 (Note that this rule regards the identity of authors, e.g., typos are correctable).
    *Update 04 Apr- Following internal discussions, authors are permitted to modify the author list associated with their submission until the full paper deadline on 11 April 2025. However, such changes should be minimal and are strongly discouraged unless absolutely necessary, in order to maintain consistency and avoid confusion during the review process.
*   **Paper Title:** As per MM Policy, paper titles should remain the same between the camera-ready version and submission. Changing the title and abstract of a submission is possible until the final regular paper deadline, 11 April, 2025, although it is advised against making substantial changes.
*   **Proofreading:** Please proofread your submission carefully. It is essential that the language used in the paper is clear and correct so that it is easily understandable. (Either US English or UK English spelling conventions are acceptable.)
*   **ArXiv/Archive Policy:** In accordance with ACM guidelines, all SIGMM-sponsored conferences adhere to the following policy regarding arXiv papers: We define a publication as a written piece documenting scientific work that was submitted for review by peers for either acceptance or rejection, and, after review, has been accepted. Documentation of scientific work that is published in a not-for-profit archive without any form of peer-review (departmental Technical Report, arXiv.org, etc.) is not considered a publication. However, this definition of publication does include peer-reviewed workshop papers, even if they do not appear in formal proceedings. Any submission to ACM Multimedia must not have substantial overlap with prior publications or other work currently undergoing peer review anywhere. Note that documents published on website archives are subject to change. Citing such documents is discouraged. Furthermore, ACM Multimedia will review the documents formally submitted and any additional information in a web archive version will not affect the review.

### Rebuttal Policies

After receiving the reviews, the authors may optionally submit a rebuttal in OpenReview to address the reviewers’ comments. The rebuttal must maintain anonymity.

## Special Sessions

Special sessions will be organized by renowned scientists in their respective fields. Papers submitted to these sessions are reviewed according to the same criteria as the submissions to the regular sessions. Authors who submit a paper to one of these sessions are invited to mention it on the author submission form. Submissions to regular and special sessions follow identical format, instructions, deadlines and procedures. See the [special sessions page](https://www.esann.org/special-sessions) for details about the special sessions organized during ESANN 2025.

## Talks and Posters

Accepted papers are presented either as talks or posters. Authors may indicate their preference at submission; however as ESANN is a single-track conference, the number of slots for talks is limited. All poster presentations are coupled to a one-minute spotlight oral presentation during a plenary session; poster presentations increase the interaction with participants.

There is no difference in scientific quality between talks and posters. The reviewing and selection processes are identical. In addition, all full papers are published in the same way in the proceedings, regardless of the mode of presentation.

## Deadlines

Prospective authors are invited to submit their contributions before **27.11.2024** (extended submission deadline).

*   Decisions: **24.01.2025**

## Conference Theme

**Advancing Tourism Technology for a Better Future**

Digital transformation is no longer a buzzword—it’s the engine driving the evolution of tourism. At ENTER26, we ask: How can we harness technological innovation to create a future of tourism that is not only smarter, but more inclusive, ethical, and sustainable?

We particularly welcome contributions that investigate:

*   How can digital innovations advance sustainability, equity, and resilience in tourism?
*   What ethical frameworks do we need for responsible tech deployment in tourism and hospitality?
*   How can smart technologies be scaled without compromising human connection and cultural authenticity?
*   In what ways can technology be leveraged to co-create value with tourists, employees, and local communities?
*   How do new tools reshape learning, leadership, and labor in tourism ecosystems?
*   What is the role of ICT in regenerative and climate-positive tourism?

## Conflict of Interest (CoI)

> The program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and PC members to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest. In the one hand, during the bidding procedure, PC members will be required to indicate potential CoIs. On the other hand, authors will be asked during the submission process to indicate any PC members with whom they share CoIs as well as the types of CoIs. That is, if they and one the authors 1) share an institutional affiliation at the time of submission; 2) had at any time in the past a supervisor/PhD student relationship; 3) have collaborated or published with in the prior two years; 4) are in some form of financial relationship, or have been at some point during the past two years; or 5) are related, or have close personal friendships. For other forms of conflict, authors must contact the chairs and explain the perceived conflict. Program committee members who have conflicts of interest with a paper, including program co-chairs, will be excluded from discussing and reviewing the submission. Authors also need to notify the PC Chairs of any other reason or circumstance that creates a risk that professional judgement may be unduly influenced.

The IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P) is a premier forum for computer security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners.

## Scope

We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security or privacy, as well as Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning widely-held beliefs. Papers without a clear connection to security or privacy will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.

## Conference Expectations and Review Process

*   **Single-Track:** While historically single-track, the conference may adjust based on submission volume.
*   **Rigorous Review:** Aiming for a rigorous and thorough review process, accepting papers with scientific merit.
*   **Revision Option:** Papers with a potential path for acceptance after revision may be invited for revision within four weeks of notification. Revised papers will be re-reviewed.
*   **Per-Reviewer Responses (New in 2025):** Reviewers will provide specific questions for authors to focus on in their responses, improving communication and timely feedback.
*   **Meta Reviews (Returning from 2024):** Publicly available meta reviews will outline PC reasons for acceptance and identified limitations.

## Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers

We solicit SoK papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge. Suitable papers provide new viewpoints, challenge beliefs with evidence, or present convincing taxonomies. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate. SoK papers should be prefixed with ""SoK:"" in the title and will be reviewed to the same standards as traditional research papers, with emphasis on community value.

## Paper Awards

Outstanding papers will be selected by the program committee and announced at the symposium.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE = UTC-12h).

### Conference

*   **Venice, Italy:** 30 June - 4 July 2025

## Proactive Prevention of Harm

Authors must carefully consider and address potential harms associated with their research and its publication. Failure to adequately discuss such harms may result in rejection. This includes documenting how risks were addressed and mitigated, considering impacts on deployed systems, data collection safety, and responsible disclosure practices. Papers should include a clear statement on how the research benefit outweighs potential harms and the safety measures taken.

If IRB consultation is available, it is expected to be appropriately consulted and documented. IRB approval does not absolve researchers from considering ethical aspects or guarantee PC acceptance.

Consult resources like ""Common Pitfalls in Writing about Security and Privacy Human Subjects Experiments"" and the ""Menlo Report"" for guidance.

## Open Science Expectations

Researchers are expected to maximize the scientific and community value of their work by making it as open as possible. By default, all reproducible materials (code, data) must be released under an open source license. Exceptions apply for malware, protected human subject data, or proprietary data. All submissions must include a clear Data Availability statement explaining sharing plans or reasons for not sharing. Papers failing to meet commitments may be removed from the conference.

## Plagiarism and Duplicate Submission

All submissions must be original work. Plagiarism (of others or self) will be grounds for rejection. Overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers must be clearly documented. Simultaneous submission of the same or substantially similar paper to another venue is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection.

## Anonymous Submission

*   Papers must be submitted anonymously: no author names or affiliations on the title page, and authors must avoid revealing their identity in the text.
*   Refer to your previous work in the third person.
*   Blind references only if a third-person reference is infeasible.
*   Use anonymous services for hosting code/data (e.g., Anonymous Github, not Github or Google Drive).
*   Contact PC chairs with any questions. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   Authors may post preprints to archives like arXiv.
*   Papers blatantly violating anonymity may be rejected by the Program Chairs.

## Reviews from Prior Submissions

Authors may optionally submit a separate, anonymized document of prior reviews (from another conference) along with a description of how those reviews were addressed. This supplementary material is visible to reviewers only after they submit their own initial review.

## Page Limit and Formatting

*   **Page Limit:** Maximum 13 pages of body text. Unlimited additional pages for references and appendices. Data Availability statement is part of the appendix.
*   **Formatting:** Must use LaTeX in A4 format with the provided `eurosp-template.zip`. Do not use other IEEE templates.
*   **Format:** Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf).
*   **Rendering:** Ensure documents render correctly in Adobe Reader XI and when printed in black and white. Unusual fonts, images, or figures may cause issues.
*   Failure to adhere to page limit and formatting requirements can lead to rejection without review.

## Conference Submission Server

Papers must be submitted at [https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org](https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org) and can be updated until the deadline.

## Publication and Presentation

Authors are responsible for publication clearances. At least one author of an accepted paper must present at the conference. In-person attendance is expected. If travel is impossible, at least one author must register, but the presentation may be skipped or replaced by a linked video presentation if a replacement presenter cannot be found.",

## Submission Instructions

### Two Submission Deadlines

FAST '26 offers authors the option to submit to one of two submission deadlines to align with other major conferences and encourage authors to submit their work when ready.

### Submission Form

Please submit your short and long papers by one of the submission deadlines listed above, in PDF format via the [submission form](https://fast26spring.usenix.hotcrp.com/). Do not email submissions. There is no separate deadline for abstract submissions.

### Page Limits

*   **Long papers:** No longer than 12 pages, excluding references.
*   **Short papers:** No longer than 6 pages, excluding references.

Conciseness is valued; express ideas in fewer pages than the limit if possible.

### Formatting Requirements

*   Papers must be typeset on U.S. letter-sized pages in two columns using 10-point Times Roman font on 12-point leading (single-spaced), within a text block 7"" wide by 9"" deep.
*   Labels, captions, and other text in figures, graphs, and tables must use font sizes that, when printed, do not require magnification to be legible. References must not be set in a smaller font.
*   Submissions violating these requirements will not be reviewed, and no extensions will be given for reformatting.
*   A LaTeX template and style file are available on the [USENIX templates page](/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates).

### Double-blind Policy

Authors must not be identified in the submissions, either explicitly or by implication. Refer to your previous work as if written by a third party. Do not say ""reference removed for blind review."" Supplemental material must be anonymized. Submissions violating anonymization rules will not be considered for review. Contact the program co-chairs for clarification.

### Prior Workshop Paper Policy

If a submission extends a prior workshop paper, include an anonymized copy of the workshop paper as supplemental material.

### Simultaneous Submission Policy

Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud and is prohibited.

### Conflict Identification

Authors must indicate conflicts with PC members upon submission. Conflicts include institutional, advisor/advisee, collaboration within the past two years, and close family/friends. Guidelines are provided, and the PC will review conflicts.

### Author Response Period

FAST '26 allows authors to respond to reviews prior to the final decision. Responses are limited to 1000 words and should focus on correcting factual errors, addressing reviewer questions, and clarifying ideas.

### One-Shot Revision

A ""one-shot revision"" decision allows authors to address specific changes (potentially including new experiments) for a chance at acceptance. Revised papers have a single opportunity for acceptance or rejection.

### Policy on FAST Resubmissions

Papers rejected at the spring deadline cannot be resubmitted at the FAST '26 fall deadline. However, papers rejected from either deadline may be resubmitted for FAST '27.

## Contribution Types

*   **Long Papers:** Up to 12 pages, excluding references. Includes refereed papers, empirical evaluations, and new system designs.
*   **Short Papers:** Up to 6 pages, excluding references. Describe completed research with a smaller contribution that requires less analysis than long papers. Title should be prefixed with ""Short Paper: "".
*   **Deployed-Systems Papers:** Describe real operational systems, including systems in production. Focus on practical lessons learned. Title should be prefixed with ""Deployed System: "".
*   **Call for Artifacts:** Authors are encouraged to submit artifacts (traces, data, code, tools) to accompany their papers.

## Introduction
The **Twenty-second Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography (FDTC 2025)** will be held on **September 14, 2025**, in **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia**. FDTC 2025 is an event affiliated with **CHES 2025**, following the IACR calendar of events in cryptology.

## About FDTC
Fault injection is one of the most exploited means for extracting confidential information from embedded devices and for compromising their intended operation. Therefore, research on established as well as upcoming methodologies, and techniques for fault injection, architectures and design tools for the design of robust and protected cryptographic systems and embedded devices (both hardware and software), are essential. Fault injection case studies on popular categories of embedded devices like mobile phones, industrial control devices, hardware wallets for cryptocurrencies, security tokens, etc., are of high interest to improve the understanding of the implications on realistic applications. FDTC is the reference event in the field of fault injection appliances, fault attacks and countermeasures.

## Topics of Interest
Topics of interest include but are not limited to:

*   **Fault injection setups and praxis:**
    *   novel and improved mechanisms for fault injection, e.g., using lasers, electromagnetic induction, or clock / power supply manipulation
    *   practical issues in fault injection setups and validation results
    *   practical limitations of attacks and implications for security
    *   fault injection in emerging technologies, e.g., memristor, carbon nanotubes, etc.
*   **Case studies:**
    *   attacks on cryptographic implementations including post-quantum cryptography and lightweight cryptography
    *   attacks on embedded devices like mobile phones, industrial control devices, hardware wallets for cryptocurrencies, security tokens, smartcards, TEEs, secure enclaves, etc.
    *   attacks on machine learning architectures and validation of results
    *   attacks on privacy-preserving technologies, e.g., homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs and multi-party computation
    *   attacks on remote targets, e.g., fpgas in the cloud
*   **Related highly-invasive attacks on device security:**
    *   setups and practical results from invasive attacks, such as photonic emission analysis, laser thermal imaging, laser-voltage imaging, etc.
    *   practical issues, limitations and potential
*   **Countermeasures (detection, resistance and tolerance):**
    *   countermeasures for cryptographic implementations
    *   countermeasures for firmware of embedded devices, e.g., for bootloaders
    *   detection countermeasures, e.g., control flow integrity
    *   HW/SW co-design countermeasures for CPU architectures
*   **Design tools for analysis of fault attacks and countermeasures:**
    *   early estimation of fault attack robustness

*   **Regular papers:** Expected to offer novel foundational ideas, theoretical results, or algorithmic improvements to existing methods, along with experimental impact validation where applicable.
*   **Tool & Case Study papers:** Expected to report on the design, implementation or use of verification (or related) technology in a practically relevant context (which need not be industrial), and its impact on design processes.

Both Regular and Tool & Case study papers must use the IEEE Transactions format on letter-size paper with a 10-point font size. Preferably, use the [FMCAD template for papers](https://fmcad.or.at/latex/fmcad.cls).

Papers in both categories can be either **8 pages (long)** or **4 pages (short)** in length excluding references. Short papers that describe emerging results, practical experiences, or original ideas that can be described succinctly are encouraged.

Authors will be required to select an appropriate paper category at abstract submission time.

Submissions may contain an optional appendix, which will not appear in the final version of the paper. The reviewers should be able to assess the quality and the relevance of the results in the paper without reading the appendix.

Submissions in all categories must contain original research that has not been previously published, nor is concurrently submitted for publication. Any partial overlap with published or concurrently submitted papers must be clearly indicated.

FMCAD employs a rigorous peer-review process and each submission will be reviewed by at least four members of the program committee. The review process is **single-blind**. The review process will incorporate a feedback and rebuttal period during which authors will have the opportunity to formally respond to reviewer comments.

## Artifact Evaluation

FMCAD 2025 introduces optional artifact evaluation to enhance transparency and the usability of research outcomes. Authors reporting experimental results are strongly encouraged to publish their final data in a long-term repository (e.g. zenodo). With artifacts serving as supplementary evidence, high-quality artifacts can improve the likelihood of paper acceptance. Artifact evaluation will be integrated into the main review process, with one selected program committee member assessing the quality of the artifact alongside the paper. Details on artifact evaluation are available on the [artifacts page](https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/cfa).

## Publication and Registration

Accepted papers are published by TU Wien Academic Press under a Creative Commons license (the authors retain the copyright) and distributed through the IEEE XPlore digital library. IEEE CEDA is a technical co-sponsor of FMCAD. There are **no publication fees**.

Authors of accepted contributions will be required to sign the FMCAD copyright transfer form found here: [https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf](https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf).

For each accepted paper, at least one unique author must register for the conference. Moreover, authors of accepted papers ensure that at least one of them will attend the conference and present the work.

## Student Forum

Continuing the tradition of the previous years, FMCAD 2025 will host a Student Forum that provides a platform for graduate students at any career stage to introduce their research to the wider Formal Methods community, and solicit feedback.

Submissions for the student forum must be short reports describing research ideas or ongoing work that the student is currently pursuing, and must be within the scope of FMCAD. Work that has been partly published previously might be considered; the novel aspect to be addressed in future work must be clearly described in such cases. All submissions will be reviewed by a select group of FMCAD student forum committee members. Details on the student forum are available on the [student forum page](https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/student_forum).",

    *   Title: Answering Hamming
    *   Abstract: The story goes that while working at Bell Labs in the 1950s, the mathematician and computer scientist Richard Hamming would ask colleagues, ""what's the most important problem in your field?"" … and then follow up with, ""so, why aren't you working on it?"" Both questions have many possible answers, even for just one person at one time, but they are certainly provocative, tough and uncomfortable. In the talk, I will reflect on my personal answers at various times, some answers for evolutionary computation (EC) and evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) more broadly, and for adjacent fields to EC/EMO as well as for industrial research & innovation. My particular answers (or anyone's) are almost certainly not as important as the effort behind them to grapple with the questions.
    *   Bio: Based in the UK, Joshua Knowles is a scientific advisor for the multinational energy technology company SLB, and is a former Professor of Natural Computation at the University of Birmingham where he is presently an honorary senior fellow. He is also an honorary professor in the decision sciences group of Alliance Manchester Business School at The University of Manchester. A central figure in evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) since the late 90s, his work includes fundamental research on archiving with diversity, performance assessment, local search, hypervolume-as-selection, machine decision makers, heterogeneous objectives, and “multiobjectivization”. In 2004-5, he developed the influential multiobjective Bayesian optimization method, ParEGO, for expensive problems. More broadly, Josh is interested in and has published (joint work) on the evolution of evolvability, the evolution of cooperation, neutral evolution, and symbiogenesis (including Deep Optimization). Collaborating across disciplines, Josh has published applications of evolutionary and ML methods in premier journals in astrophysics, analytical chemistry, theoretical biology, bioinformatics, and operations research. In 2024, he was part of an international team that automated the design-engineering of drill bits for oilfield or geothermal drilling by EMO methods with deployment and testing in live operations. He is presently involved in pitching for investment in super-efficient heat exchanger technologies (for hyperscale data centers) partly designed by evolutionary methods.

    *   Title: Additive drift is all you need -- if you are an evolution strategy.
    *   Abstract: Drift analysis is a great tool for proving that optimization algorithms work the way we think they do, and for analyzing them, potentially in great detail. In this talk I will discuss drift analysis for evolution strategies. These algorithms exhibit linear convergence on a wide range of problems, which corresponds to a linear decrease of the logarithmic distance of the best-so-far sample from the optimum, giving rise to simple additive drift. That behavior is enabled by online adaptation of the step size, which decays at the same rate as the distance to the optimum. Moreover, modern evolution strategies like CMA-ES adapt not only the step size, but rather the full covariance matrix of their sampling distribution. The mechanism enables convergence at a problem-independent rate that depends only on the dimension of the search space. The primary challenge of proving the convergence of CMA-ES lies in establishing the stability of the adaptation process, which was recently achieved by analyzing the invariant Markov chain that describes the parameter adaptation process. Yet, a drift-based analysis is still desirable because it can yield much more fine-grained results. For instance, it can provide details about the transient adaptation phase, which often takes up the lion's share of the time for solving the problem. To achieve this, we need a potential function that appropriately penalizes unsuitable parameter configurations, or more precisely, configurations the algorithm tends to move away from. Designing a potential function that captures the dynamics of covariance matrix adaptation is an ongoing challenge. I will present our recent research efforts towards this goal and emphasize why relatively simple additive drift offers a powerful framework for achieving it.

It aims to bring together researchers working on formal techniques and the formal underpinnings of programming languages. Originally focused on Java, the workshop's scope was broadened to include Java-like languages such as C#, Kotlin, Rust, and Scala, and in 2024, it was renamed from ""Formal Techniques for Java-like Programs"" to ""Formal Techniques for Judicious Programming"" to reflect this broader scope. FTfJP 2025 will take place from June 30 to July 4, 2025, in Bergen, Norway, at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences.","# Call for Papers: FTfJP 2025 – Formal Techniques for Judicious Programming

Formal techniques are crucial for analyzing programs, precisely describing their behavior, and verifying their properties. Modern programming languages like C#, Java, Kotlin, Rust, and Scala are significant targets for these techniques due to their widespread use, stable interfaces, and complex libraries, presenting ongoing research challenges.

The Workshop on Formal Techniques for Judicious Programming (FTfJP) has been an annual event since 1999, held alongside ECOOP, to foster collaboration between those working in formal techniques and programming language research.

In 2024, the workshop name was updated from “Formal Techniques for Java-like Programs” to “Formal Techniques for Judicious Programming” to encompass a wider range of programming languages and related research.

## Paper Categories

We solicit two categories of papers:

*   **Full Papers:** (12 pages, excluding references) These papers should present a technical contribution, case study, or detailed experience report. Both complete and incomplete technical results are welcome; ongoing work that can stimulate discussion is particularly encouraged.
*   **Short Papers:** (6 pages, excluding references) These papers should advocate a promising research direction or present a position that is likely to stimulate discussion. This category is suitable for established researchers outlining a vision or early-career researchers planning their PhD path.

Both paper types will benefit from feedback at the workshop. Submissions will be peer-reviewed and evaluated based on clarity and their potential to generate interesting discussions. The reviewing process is single blind, meaning submissions do not need to be anonymized.

FTfJP is designed to encourage interaction, serving as a forum for diverse expertise, from experienced researchers to PhD students.

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Formatting:** Papers must be formatted according to the guidelines for [Springer LNCS papers](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

    ```

## Double-Anonymous Review Process

*   The **Research Papers Track** employs a double-anonymous review process. Please check the call for papers for other tracks to see if they also use this process.
*   Authors must ensure their submissions do not reveal their identities:
    *   Leave out author names and affiliations from the body of the submission.
    *   Cite related work by themselves in the third person (e.g., ""the prior work of XYZ"" as opposed to ""our prior work"").
    *   Do not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets). Replication packages are encouraged and details can be found in the [FSE Open Science Policy](https://conf.researchr.org/track/fse-2025/fse-2025-open-science-policy).
    *   Anonymize author-revealing company names; use general characteristics of organizations instead.
    *   Ensure paper acknowledgements do not reveal the origin of the work.

## Introduction

Green computing, in the context of cloud and pervasive computing, is an emerging research field in computer science and engineering. Pervasive and cloud computing are promising paradigms that have been seeing exponential growth in the deployments and poised to take major roles in human's daily life. But in order to realize this potential, both are facing the critical challenges related to energy consumption, for example, controlling the energy spent by the large-scale data centers and prolonging the battery life of mobile devices in pervasive computing and Internet of Things (IoT). New concepts and technologies such as mobile cloud computing (MCC), software-defined networking (SDN), Edge / Fog and hybrid cloud services can be explored to make data centers and wireless devices more energy efficient.

The 20th International Conference on Green, Pervasive, and Cloud Computing (GPC 2025) focuses on pervasive and environmentally sustainable computing. GPC 2025 will be held on **09th-12th December 2025** at **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia**, and will provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to discuss and exchange novel ideas, results, experiences and work-in-process on the Green, Pervasive, and Cloud Computing.

The **Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Visualization in Science and Education** will be held from **July 13 - 18, 2025**, at **Bates College, Lewiston, Maine**.

## Conference Theme: ""Visualization for Impact""

The 2025 conference continues the tradition of bringing together a multi-disciplinary group including researchers from the social and natural sciences, artists, technologists, journalists, educators from formal and informal settings, and others engaged in the production, study, and application of visualizations to advance and promote scientific understanding. The theme ""Visualization for Impact"" explores transdisciplinary and multi-dimensional topics such as:

*   Machine learning and visualization
*   Visualization for impact in AR/VR/XR
*   Visualization for action and social good
*   Visualization for education (literacy, activities, pedagogy)
*   Visualization of earth and environmental science
*   Visualization of uncertainty and qualitative data

The conference will explore how visualizations can inspire change, influence policies, and inform better decision-making. It will also examine how visualizations clarify or intensify uncertainty in data, how the mind understands complex data, and how visualizations support or obstruct mental models, applying technical, ethical, artistic, scientific, educational, and philosophical lenses.

## Conference Format

The conference is a premier, international scientific event focused on presenting cutting-edge and unpublished research, prioritizing time for discussion after each talk, and fostering informal interactions among scientists of all career stages. It is a five-day residential conference designed to increase camaraderie and create scientific communities.

*   **Short Papers:** Presenting unconventional ideas or new visions in any GPCE topics. Short papers do not always contain complete results as in the case of full papers, but can introduce new ideas to the community and get early feedback. Note that short papers are not intended to be position statements. Accepted short papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented at the conference. Short paper submissions must not exceed 6 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text `(Short Paper)` appended to their titles.

*   **Tool Demonstrations:** Presenting tools for any GPCE topic. Tools must be available for use and must not be purely commercial. Submissions must provide a tool description not exceeding 6 pages excluding bibliography and a separate demonstration outline including screenshots also not exceeding 6 pages. Tool demonstration submissions must have the text `(Tool Demonstration)` appended to their titles. If they are accepted, tool descriptions will be included in the proceedings. The demonstration outline will only be used to evaluate the planned demonstration.

*   **Generative Pearl:** An elegant essay about generative programming. Examples include but are not limited to an interesting application of generative programming and an elegant presentation of a (new or old) data structure using generative programming. Accepted Generative Pearl papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented at the conference. Generative Pearl submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text `(Generative Pearl)` appended to their titles.

## Paper Selection Criteria

The GPCE program committee will evaluate each submission according to the following selection criteria:

*   **Novelty:** Papers must present new ideas or evidence and place them appropriately within the context established by previous research in the field.
*   **Significance:** The results in the paper must have the potential to add to the state of the art or practice in significant ways.
*   **Evidence:** The paper must present evidence supporting its claims. Examples of evidence include formalizations and proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, and case studies.
*   **Clarity:** The paper must present its contributions and results clearly.

## Best Paper Award

Following the tradition, the GPCE program committee will select the best paper among accepted papers. The authors of the best paper will be given the best paper award at the conference.

## Paper Submission

The submission page will be announced soon. The submission link is: [https://gpce25.hotcrp.com/](https://gpce25.hotcrp.com/)

All submissions must use the [ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”](http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format). Be sure to use the latest LaTeX templates and class files, the SIGPLAN sub-format, and 10-point font. Consult the sample-sigplan.tex template and use the document-class `\documentclass[sigplan,anonymous,review]{acmart}`.

### Double-Blind Review Process

To increase fairness in reviewing, GPCE uses the double-blind review process:

*   Author names, institutions, and acknowledgments should be omitted from submitted papers.
*   References to the authors’ own work should be in the third person.

No other changes are necessary, and authors will not be penalized if reviewers are able to infer authors’ identities in implicit ways.

### ACM Artifact Badges

Authors that want to apply for an ACM Artifact Badge are asked to add a brief paragraph in the ACKs section of their submission. The paragraph should indicate which ACM Badge is the submission aiming for and what is part of the artifact.

The 13th International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction (HAI 2025) aims to be a major interdisciplinary forum for discussing and disseminating the latest research and results that have an impact beyond the boundaries of conventional interaction, including robots, software agents, and human-to-human communication via digital media. HAI brings together researchers from fields such as engineering, computer science, psychology, and sociology, and covers a wide range of topics, including human-robot interaction, affective computing, computer-supported cooperative work, games and serious games, and artificial intelligence, among others. This conference is held in cooperation with ACM.

The theme of HAI 2025 is **“Interaction and Imagination”**. With the development of generative AI, many agent systems have been proposed, and the methodology of human-agent interaction is at the stage of being implemented in society. At this stage, we believe it is necessary to re-examine the new future of human society that human-agent interaction will bring, from interaction to imagination. We welcome all submissions related to HAI, but especially encourage submissions that align with the theme of HAI 2025. The HAI conference welcomes submissions from a wide range of fields, including engineering, computer science, psychology, sociology, cognitive science, business, marketing, and design.

## Topics of Interest

*   studies of Human-Agent Interaction, with quantitative/qualitative results
*   theoretical models
*   technological advances
*   experimental methods
*   impacts of embodiment
*   character and avatar design
*   agents in applications, e.g. self-driving cars, social networks
*   agents in business and marking
*   experience design
*   autonomous and adaptive agents/systems
*   multi-agent interaction
*   social simulation

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Format:** HAI 2025 will accept only online submissions of PDF files. All submissions will be reviewed by three reviewers and will receive a meta review for quality assurance. The paper will be evaluated on the basis of research originality, excellence, and significance, and relevance to HAI. We also invite position papers, preliminary (but high impact) studies, and concept papers.
*   **Page Limit:** The page limit for full papers is **8 pages** (+ extra pages for references only). Submissions exceeding eight pages of content, excluding references, will be subject to desk rejection and will not undergo review.
*   **Templates:**
    *   **LaTeX:** [https://portalparts.acm.org/hippo/latex_templates/acmart-primary.zip](https://portalparts.acm.org/hippo/latex_templates/acmart-primary.zip)

The 11th ACM SIGIR / 15th International Conference on Innovative Concepts and Theories in Information Retrieval (ICTIR 2025) invites submissions with substantial and original research on innovative and foundational contributions to the field of Information Retrieval.

**Foundation** is defined as a scientific result that others can build upon and use for their own research. This includes original research on the theoretical aspects of Information Retrieval, topics from neighboring fields with a strong and clear connection to Information Retrieval, and novel approaches and methods for developing, improving, and evaluating models related to the field of Information Retrieval.

The conference welcomes papers on all aspects of Information Retrieval. See the [Call for Papers for SIGIR 2025](https://sigir2025.dei.unipd.it/call-full-papers.html) for a list of included topics. Topics from neighboring fields are also in scope, as long as there is a clear and significant connection to Information Retrieval.

## Submission Types

New to ICTIR, we welcome two types of submissions:

*   **Regular submissions**
*   **SIGIR-Revise-and-Resubmit (SIGIR-RR) submissions**

### SIGIR-Revise-and-Resubmit (SIGIR-RR) Submissions

SIGIR-RR submissions are for revised manuscripts of papers that were submitted to but not accepted by the SIGIR 2025 conference (only full and short paper tracks). Authors can use this option to address the issues raised in the SIGIR 2025 reviews and revise the paper accordingly.

In addition to the revised paper, the authors must attach the following information to the submitted PDF file:

*   **Explanation (1-3 pages with no style requirements):** A text including the SIGIR paper ID and responses to the SIGIR reviews, explaining how the issues raised by the SIGIR reviewers have been addressed in the revised paper.
*   **SIGIR submission:** The original anonymized submission file to SIGIR 2025.

## Special Theme

**“LLMs + IR, what could possibly go wrong?”**

Even though ICTIR 2025 welcomes papers on all areas of Information Retrieval as detailed above, its program especially welcomes research papers related to the following theme. This theme stands on the long-term relationship between LLMs and IR. In order to foster a lively discussion on this theme, we are seeking both innovative and foundational technical research papers and discussion papers that methodologically study this theme by providing impactful perspectives, opinions, or positions on the matter.

If you think you can make a strong contribution to the panel on this theme, but are unable to submit a paper, please reach out to the PC chairs at [pc-ictir2025@listes.isir.upmc.fr](mailto:pc-ictir2025@listes.isir.upmc.fr), with one abstract (1 page), articulating a talking point, and a short speaker bio.

## Double-blind Reviewing and Submissions to arXiv

The conference will employ a **lightweight double-blind reviewing process**.

*   A submission should not reveal the identity of the authors in any obvious way. In particular, the authors’ names, affiliations, or email addresses should be nowhere visible in the submission. Any reference to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person (that is, don’t say “our” when referring to such work).
*   If sharing code, make sure it is anonymous (e.g., using Anonymous GitHub and removing author names from it).
*   Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. Important references should be neither omitted nor anonymized.
*   Authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, or give talks about them.

## Submission Guidelines and Formal Requirements

*   We encourage authors to follow [this brief checklist](https://ictir2025.cs.umass.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Checklist.pdf) to strengthen an IR paper.
*   Research papers must describe original work that has not been previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not simultaneously submitted or currently under review in another journal or conference (including any archival workshops at SIGIR 2025).
*   The page limit is **9 pages** in ACM SIGIR style, excluding the references and the optional appendix. Shorter papers are equally welcome; the 9 pages is an upper bound, not a target.
*   By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including [ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).
*   Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, as well as an OpenReview account.

### Format Requirements

*   Submissions must be in English, in **PDF format**.
*   The length limit is at most **9 pages** (including figures, tables, proofs, acknowledgments, and any content except references and optional appendices).
*   Use the current ACM two-column conference format.
*   Suitable LaTeX, Word, and Overleaf templates are available from the [ACM Website](https://authors.acm.org/conferences/production-information/acm-conference-author-instructions) (use the “sigconf” proceedings template for LaTeX and the Interim Template for Word).
*   For LaTeX, the following should be used when submitting the paper:
    ```latex
    \documentclass[sigconf,natbib=true,anonymous=true]{acmart}
    ```
*   Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/SIGIR/ICTIR/2025/Conference).

## Presentation at the Conference

*   At least one author of an accepted paper must register and present the work at ICTIR 2025.
*   The works will be presented either as a long or short talk, with an optional poster presentation or invitation to a panel.

## Key Dates

*   **Paper submission deadline:** Thursday, April 24, 2025 (AoE)
*   **Notification of acceptance:** Thursday, June 5, 2025 (AoE)
*   **Camera-ready deadline:** Thursday, June 26, 2025 (AoE)

## Introduction

Following the widespread adoption of distributed computing in fields like big data and cloud computing, researchers are advancing paradigms for intelligent distributed computing to meet new demands of AI-driven applications. To achieve enhanced computational efficiency and stringent data privacy, novel approaches (e.g., intelligent resource scheduling, federated learning, and privacy-preserving architectures) have emerged as foundations for next-generation systems. However, these approaches require adaptive optimization and secure multi-node coordination, thereby posing significant challenges for scalability and robustness in AI-integrated environments. To address such challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence techniques (e.g., multi-agent reinforcement learning, decentralized optimization, and AI-driven security mechanisms) offers transformative design pathways. Therefore, the synergy of AI and distributed computing is critical for enabling efficient, secure, and scalable intelligent computational platforms.

### Policies

> By submitting to the ICPC Research Track, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the [ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism) and the [IEEE Plagiarism FAQ](https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/plagiarism/faqs.html). Papers submitted to ICPC 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for ICPC 2025. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken.

> Authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

### ORCID ID

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an **ORCID ID**, as it will be a requirement to complete the publishing process for accepted papers.

### Double-Anonymous Review Process

ICPC 2025 Research Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Authors must make every effort to honor this process:

*   Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission.
*   All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person.
*   While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to ICPC 2025.
*   During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. They should thus use a different paper title for any pre-print.
*   Carefully review any supplementary material to ensure it conforms to the double-anonymous policy (e.g., scrub code and data repositories of names, metadata).

Further advice can be found on the [ICSE Q&A page](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2022/icse-2022-submitting-to-icse2022--q-a).

### Authorship Policy

By submitting, authors acknowledge that they conform to the [authorship policy of the ACM](https://www.acm.org/publications/policy-on-authorship) and the [authorship policy of the IEEE](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/definition-of-authorship/).

### Submission Site

Submissions to the Technical Track that meet the above requirements can be made via the Research Track submission site:

[https://icpc2025-technical.hotcrp.com](https://icpc2025-technical.hotcrp.com)

> We encourage authors to upload their paper info early (and can submit the PDF later) to properly enter conflicts for double-anonymous reviewing. It is the sole responsibility of the authors to ensure that the formatting guidelines, double-anonymous guidelines, and any other submission guidelines are met at the time of paper submission.

## Exclusions

Submissions from the ICPC 2025 General Chair, Program Chairs, their current students, and current postdocs are not allowed to any ICPC 2025 track.

## Open Science Policy

The research track of ICPC 2025 strives to abide by Open Science policies. All research results should be accessible to the public, if possible, and empirical studies should be reproducible. Authors are encouraged to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability. Sharing research data is not mandatory, but is expected to be the default; non-sharing needs to be justified.

Upon submission, authors are asked:

*   To make their data available to the program committee (via upload of supplemental material or a link to an anonymous repository) – and provide instructions on how to access this data in the paper; or
*   To include in the paper an explanation as to why this is not possible or desirable; and
*   To indicate if they intend to make their data publicly available upon acceptance.

## Review and Evaluation Criteria

Research papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee. Reviewers will remain anonymous.

Submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

*   **Soundness:** The extent to which the paper’s contributions are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods;
*   **Significance:** The extent to which the paper’s contributions impact program comprehension, and if needed, under which assumptions;
*   **Novelty:** The extent to which the contributions are sufficiently original with respect to the state of the art and clearly explained and contrasted against it;
*   **Verifiability:** The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to support independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions;
*   **Presentation:** The extent to which the paper’s quality of writing meets the standards of ICPC, including clear descriptions and explanations, appropriate use of the English language, absence of major ambiguity, clearly readable figures and tables, and adherence to the formatting instructions.

## Author Response Period

ICPC 2025 will offer an author response period, allowing authors to inspect reviews and answer specific questions raised by the program committee.

## Withdrawing a Paper

The 20th International Conference on Integrated Formal Methods (iFM 2025) will take place on **19–21 November 2025** at **Inria Paris, France**, with co-located workshops scheduled for **17-18 November 2025**.

## Objectives and Scope

In the last decades, we have witnessed a proliferation of approaches that integrate several modelling, verification and simulation techniques, facilitating more versatile and efficient analysis of software-intensive systems. These approaches provide powerful support for the analysis of different functional and non-functional properties of the systems, complex interaction of components of different nature as well as validation of diverse aspects of system behaviour.

The iFM conference series is a forum for discussing recent research advances in the development of integrated approaches to formal modelling and analysis. The conference covers all aspects of the design of integrated techniques, including language design, verification and validation, automated tool support and the use of such techniques in software engineering practice. To credit the effort of tool developers, we use EAPLS artifact badging.

Areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

*   Formal and semi-formal modelling notations
*   Combining formal methods with different performance, simulation and system analysis techniques
*   Program verification, model checking, and static analysis
*   Theorem proving, decision procedures and SAT/SMT solving
*   Runtime analysis, monitoring and testing
*   Program synthesis
*   Modelling, analysis and synthesis of cyber-physical, hybrid, embedded, probabilistic, distributed or concurrent systems
*   Abstraction and refinement
*   Model learning and inference
*   Approaches to integrating formal methods into software engineering practice or industry
*   Approaches to integrating formal methods into standardisation or certification processes
*   Formal methods for artificial intelligence, including machine learning and data-based techniques
*   Tools and case studies supporting the integration of formal methods

## Important Dates (AoE)

*   **Abstract Submission (Optional):** 30 May 2025 / 13 June 2025
*   **Paper Submission:** 6 June 2025 / 20 June 2025(*)

(*)For submissions received by the deadline (20 June 2025), updates will be allowed until the end of 23 June 2025 (AoE)

## Paper Categories

iFM 2025 solicits high-quality papers reporting research results and/or experience reports related to the overall theme of formal methods integration. We solicit papers in the following categories:

1.  **Regular papers:** (limit 16 pages) presenting original scientific research results, tools, their foundation and evaluations, applications of formal methods, including rigorous evaluations and case studies.
2.  **Short papers:** (limit 6 pages) describing any work in the area of formal methods, including work-in-progress and preliminary results that are sufficiently interesting for the iFM community.

All page limits exclude the references. Appendices may be included, but they will only be read by a reviewer at their discretion.

Regular and short papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will undergo a thorough review process. Submissions will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity.

The submissions will be reviewed and selected for publication based on the above-mentioned criteria as well as suitability to the conference’s technical program. The review process is single blind.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Submissions for all categories should be made using the iFM 2025 EasyChair site: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ifm2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ifm2025)
*   Submissions must be in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style files.
*   Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers.
*   After a paper is accepted, the corresponding author of each paper must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper.
*   The conference proceedings will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.
*   A special issue of the Formal Aspects of Computing journal is planned for extended versions of selected papers from iFM 2025.
*   All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper must register to the conference by the early registration date.

## EAPLS Artifact Badging

Reproducibility of experiments is crucial to foster an atmosphere of open, reusable and trustworthy research. To improve and reward reproducibility and to give more visibility and credit to the effort of tool developers in our community, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit possible artifacts associated with their paper for evaluation, and based on the level of reproducibility they will be awarded one or more badges. See [https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/).

Artifact submission is optional and the result of the artifact evaluation will not alter the paper’s acceptance decision.

## Best Paper

iFM 2025 will honor the best paper selected with respect to reviews, program committee discussions and conference presentations with an award.

Welcome to Interspeech 2025!

Interspeech is the world’s largest and most comprehensive conference on the science and technology of spoken language processing. Interspeech conferences emphasize interdisciplinary approaches addressing all aspects of speech science and technology, ranging from psycholinguistic theories of human speech processing to advanced applications of speech technology.

The theme of Interspeech 2025 is **""Fair and Inclusive Speech Science and Technology""**. This theme aims to celebrate and incorporate the vast speech diversity both within and between individuals, as well as within and between languages. It emphasizes diversity as a source of richness and information, contributing to the development of fairer, more robust, and personalized speech technology applications and more accurate theories of human speech processing. By embracing this diversity, we can create theories and technologies that are inclusive of everyone, ensuring that speech science and technology benefit all individuals and communities.

Interspeech 2025 will feature oral and poster sessions, plenary talks by internationally renowned experts, tutorials, special sessions and challenges, show & tell, exhibits, and satellite events. Following Interspeech 2024, a **Blue Sky track** will be featured. Additionally, a **Speech Science Festival** for the general public will be held on the Sunday prior to Interspeech.

## Paper Submission

Please note that the paper submission deadline is earlier than previous years because the conference is held in August. The paper submission deadline is **February 12, 2025**.

Interspeech 2025 seeks original and innovative papers covering all aspects of human and machine speech science and technology. Papers must be written in English. The paper length is up to **four pages in two columns with an additional page for references and acknowledgments only**.

Submitted papers must conform to the format defined in the paper kit provided on the conference website (and as an overleaf template) and may optionally be accompanied by multimedia files. Interspeech 2025 will follow a **double-blind review process** so papers submitted for review should not reveal the identity or affiliation of the authors.

Authors must declare that their contributions are original and that they have not submitted their papers elsewhere for publication. Papers must be submitted electronically and will be evaluated through rigorous peer review on the basis of novelty and originality, technical correctness, clarity of presentation, key strengths, and quality of references.

The Technical Programme Committee will decide which papers to include in the conference programme using peer review as the primary criterion, with secondary criteria of addressing the conference theme and diversity across the programme as a whole. If accepted, each paper needs to be presented by one of the authors during the in-person conference.

## Blue Sky Track

Interspeech 2024 introduced the new **BLUE SKY track** for highly innovative papers in fields or directions that have not yet been explored. Large-scale experimental evaluation will not be required for papers in this track. The most experienced reviewers will assess the proposals for this track.

The 25th IEEE International Conference on Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (SCAM 2025) aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on theory, techniques, and applications concerning the analysis and/or manipulation of the source code of software systems. The term “source code” refers to any fully executable description of a software system, including machine code, (very) high-level languages, and executable graphical representations of systems. The term “analysis” refers to any (semi-)automated procedure yielding insight into source code, while “manipulation” refers to any automated or semi-automated procedure that takes and returns source code. SCAM 2025 solicits high-quality submissions on this critical area of research.
