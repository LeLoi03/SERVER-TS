## Submission Guidelines

*   **Submission Format:** Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information, and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit, and authors are encouraged to use the ""full version"" of their paper as the submission.
*   **Content:** Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This part should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea.
*   **Proofs:** Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.
*   **Length:** Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission.
*   **Formatting:** The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
*   **Anonymity:** STOC 2025 will use **double-blind reviewing**. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. This includes authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity and should ensure any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not ""We build on our previous work…"" but rather ""We build on the work of…""). Important references should not be omitted or anonymized. Authors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper (e.g., post on the web, submit to arXiv, give talks).
*   **Confidentiality:** All submissions will be treated as confidential and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees.
*   **PC Member Submissions:** Submissions authored or coauthored by PC members (other than the PC chair) are allowed.
*   **References:** Authors are encouraged to include hyperlink cross-referencing for bibliographic entries, theorems, sections, etc. A table of contents may be added on a page immediately following the title page. Authors are asked to avoid ""et al."" in citations, favoring an equal mention of all authors' surnames. Bibliographic references should preferably be alphanumeric (e.g., the first letters of the authors' surnames, or at least the first three followed by +) followed by the year of publication.
*   **Submission Server:** The submission server is scheduled to open on October 1, 2024. ([https://stoc25.hotcrp.com/](https://stoc25.hotcrp.com/))

## Important Dates

*   **STOC Paper Submission Deadline:** Monday, November 4, 2024 (7:59pm EST)

## Research Track

SYSTOR accepts both full-length and short papers. A short paper is intended for an idea that can be described and evaluated in fewer pages; the goal of the short paper is not for preliminary work or workshop-style position papers.

A good SYSTOR paper should present a novel, compelling solution to a well-motivated problem. The evaluation should demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the solution in settings that are as realistic as possible, including test applications workloads, system parameters, and assumed constraints. Authors should clearly describe their contribution in the context of prior work, and draw meaningful conclusions from their work.

The program committee also encourages submissions that describe lessons learned from operational (especially large-scale) system deployments. Such submissions are expected to include sufficient details of the system, its design goals, and the methods used for evaluating whether these goals were met.

The program committee will value submissions accompanied by supplemental material such as traces and open-source code that can help reproduce the reported results, and advance additional research in the field.

A small set of outstanding papers will be forwarded to a suitable journal, such as ACM journal Transactions on Storage (TOS) or Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS), for a fast-tracked review process for an expanded version of the paper.

As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

## Posters Track

SYSTOR also welcomes academic and industrial posters. See “Call for Papers” above for focus and relevant areas.

A good poster submission will articulate and motivate an interesting problem and describe a new insight or approach to addressing this problem. It will clearly present the work in progress (or attained results), and the expected outcomes from future work. The poster should present these details in a manner that is clear and captivating.

Poster submissions should include a one-page extended abstract, and a draft of the poster. The extended abstracts of accepted posters will be included in the online conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. The program committee will review poster submissions in a single-blind manner.

As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

Please follow the [poster formatting instructions](https://www.systor.org/2024/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/06/sample-systor2024-poster.pdf). The author kit, which contains the Latex style and template, is [available here](https://www.systor.org/2024/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/06/systor2024_poster_template.zip).

Accepted posters can opt-in for physical presentation at the Israeli Systems & AI Workshop in person.

## Submission Instructions

*   Research papers (full and short) should be submitted through: [https://systor25.hotcrp.com/](https://systor25.hotcrp.com/)
*   Posters should be submitted through: [https://systor25posters.hotcrp.com/](https://systor25posters.hotcrp.com/)
*   ISW-only posters (physical presence required) can be submitted by August 15. Send a title, abstract and name of presenter to Lior Shafir and Sarel Cohen.

## Review Process

The program committee will review submissions in a **double-blind manner**. All submissions should be properly anonymized, and all identifiable information should be removed whenever possible, including obvious self-references. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.

Any submissions accompanied by a non-disclosure agreement will be returned without review.

## Copyright and Originality of the Work

SYSTOR will enforce ACM’s plagiarism policy regarding copying and resubmitting prior work. Simultaneous submissions are not allowed: any work submitted to SYSTOR must not be under consideration for another workshop, conference, or journal.

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the earlier of either the first day of the conference or the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## Formatting Instructions

Submissions must be printable PDF files. When creating your submission, you must use the sigplan proceedings template of ACM’s acmart Latex class, which is available on the official ACM site. Your main LaTeX file should have the following structure:

```latex
% use the base acmart.cls

% use the sigplan proceeding template with the default 10 pt fonts

% nonacm option removes ACM-related text in the submission. 
\documentclass[sigplan,nonacm]{acmart}

% enable page numbers
\settopmatter{printfolios=true}
\begin{document}

\title{…}

\begin{abstract}

…
\end{abstract}

\maketitle % should come after the abstract

% Add the paper content here

% use the ACM bibliography style
\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{…}
\end{document}
```

Please ensure that your paper satisfies all the above requirements for content and formatting before submission; if you have a question about any of these issues, please email the program chairs.

Additional instructions regarding camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be sent directly to the corresponding authors and will appear here after the authors have been notified.

## Arxiv

A paper submitted to SYSTOR can be submitted simultaneously to Arxiv, with some changes. We would like the authors to make an honest effort to preserve anonymity. Please ensure the SYSTOR submission uses a different title and a different system name from the Arxiv version. It would be useful to let the chairs know if there is an Arxiv paper so that we can intervene if PC members find it accidentally and think the submission is plagiarizing the Arxiv paper.

## Open Source

The authors of a SYSTOR submission are encouraged to associate a source code repo with their submission, but this repo must be completely anonymized. It is alright if a named (= not anonymized) source code repo exists, so long as it isn’t associated/linked with the submission in any way. An anonymized repo can be a clone of the named repo, which is modified to be anonymous. Another way to do this is https://anonymous.4open.science/ .

## Camera-Ready Submission

Kindly review and finalize the title of your submission and the author list (including their order). Please use the “edit” version on the HotCRP submission site to make updates. Note the deadline for completing this action is prior to the Camera-ready date.

This information is needed to generate ACM copyright forms, which you need to sign *before* submitting your final camera-ready version. After completing the rights management form, you will be sent rights text and DOI info to add to the paper before the final PDF is generated and submitted.

Note that all accepted papers will be shepherded. Authors must address all reviewers’ comments and submit the final version. Following this, the shepherd will provide final approval for the camera-ready version within a week.

**Camera-Ready Submission Instructions**

These instructions apply to papers, short papers, and posters (extended abstracts). Contact proceeding publication chair Surbhi Palande for questions.

When authors submit their eRights forms to ACM, they receive confirmation messages that include the appropriate copyright text & DOI (document identifier) for their papers. Once complete, the camera-ready paper should be submitted through HotCRP.

Please follow these guidelines:

*   Make sure fonts are type 1 (scalable), NOT Type 3 (bit-mapped), and embedded within the document. More details can be found in General Instructions for Proceedings Volumes at www.acm.org/publications/gi-proceedings-current, item #8.
*   Authors must use the ACM classification system. For details see https://dl.acm.org/ccs and instructions in the paper template.
*   Please include paper keywords (specified with the \keywords command in (La)TeX).
*   Please include a short ABSTRACT section for posters. Do not put your entire extended abstract under this section.
*   Papers/posters must not include page numbers in the final manuscript and there is no need to include the “ACM Reference” (to remove these, you may need to use \settopmatter{printacmref=false,printfolios=false}.
*   Be sure that there are no bad page or column breaks, meaning no widows (last line of a paragraph at the top of a column). Section and subsection headings should remain with at least 2 lines of body text when near the end of a page or column.
*   Include the DOI in your paper that you received from ACM (use \acmDOI{####}) and update the ISBN data: \acmISBN{979-8-4007-1181-7}
*   The camera-ready version must include the updated copyright text you received from ACM. If you did not see an email referring to the ACM right management form, please check your SPAM folders. If this form is not received for a paper before the deadline, then that paper cannot be included in the proceedings.

Notes on adding copyright text:

*   Author(s) receive their copyright text upon completing the eRights form. This information is necessary and must be added to your publication.
*   Depending on this copyright text, the authors can take the following action:
    *   If authors use LaTeX they only need to set the correct option to \setcopyright (follow the eRights system option):
        *   `acmcopyright` ==> The authors transfer the copyright to the ACM (the “traditional” choice).
        *   `acmlicensed` ==>The authors retain the copyright but license the publication rights to ACM.
        *   `rightsretained` ==> The authors retain the copyright and publication rights to themselves or somebody else.
    *   If author(s) use Word they can copy the text they received (the full copyright text is included in the eRights reply)
*   Additionally note that the author can access the correct copyright under their paper edit submission link. At the top there is ‘Final version preparation’, which include the copyright text message. There is also a ‘Latex Instruction’ (collapsed) section with exact LaTeX instructions.
*   You should use the default class without font size and without the anonymous flag – `\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart,10pt}` – this would set 10pt font. Page count remains unchanged.
*   Alongside the camera-ready PDF, you will be required to *submit the source files* for your paper, including ALL files which were used to create the final output (PDF), be they Word, LaTeX, image files, etc. This is mandatory.

The following template contains the required settings: [Concise-Paper-Template.zip](https://www.systor.org/2024/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/08/SYSTOR-2024-Concise-Paper-Template.zip)

**Camera-Ready Submission Checks**

*   Verify all mandatory fields are filled in both HotCRP and the paper itself (title, authors, abstract, keywords, classification, refs)
*   Verify that the correct copyright text is inserted
*   Check formatting, margins, font sizes/types etc.
*   For additional information, refer to: ""www.acm.org/publications/gi-proceedings-current"".

TAP 2024 is the **18th International Conference on Tests and Proofs**, scheduled to take place on **September 9–10, 2024**, in **Milan, Italy**. The conference is part of **FM 2024**.

## Scope

TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability. Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of dynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic techniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Notable examples that provide evidence for the potential of a combination of static and dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based on symbolic execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking, or the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive enumeration. The verification of systems based on machine learning spurs novel combinations of dynamic and static analyses, e.g., property verification of surrogate models that are generated through testing.

TAP’s scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology, including foundational work, tool development, and empirical research. Topics of interest center around the combination of static techniques such as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.

## Invited Speakers

*   Deductive techniques supporting (novel) definitions of coverage criteria,
*   Specification inference by deductive or dynamic methods,
*   Testing and runtime analysis of formal specifications,
*   Search-based techniques for proving and testing,
*   Testing and Verification of systems based on machine learning,
*   Verification of verification tools and environments,

The conference is planned as a hybrid event, allowing for both in-person and remote participation.","# Call for Participation: TEI '26

We invite paper submissions from a wide range of perspectives: technical, applied, empirical, theoretical, philosophical, conceptual, and artistic. We welcome contributions from fields including but not limited to: tangible interaction design, embodied interaction design, embedded computing, digital fabrication, hybrid craft, e-textiles, wearables, haptics, robotics, smart cities, smart materials, and sustainability.

## Theme: 'Tide + Tied'

As this year's theme is 'Tide + Tied', we invite submissions that explore interdisciplinary knowledge, bridging the physical and digital, technology and humanity, resurgence and convergence, and beyond. We expect submissions to be clearly framed within the rapidly developing tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction field. Works framed as research through design and more technical contributions are particularly welcome.

## Contribution Types

Authors are invited to submit high-quality papers that contribute to advancing this rapidly developing field. Accepted submissions of all contribution types will be included as papers in the conference proceedings, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library.

*   **Artifact:** Research artifacts that advance the state of the art in Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction.
*   **Method:** Tools, approaches and techniques that enable researchers, technologists, designers and practitioners to study, research and work in Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction.
*   **Theory:** Explorations, extensions, refutations, instantiations and other developments of and to the theories pertaining to Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction.
*   **Empirical:** Studies and data that add to our understanding of Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction.

## Paper Length

Authors are encouraged to submit a paper with a length proportional to its contribution. While there is no maximum or minimum length for papers, the length of typical submissions is expected to be approximately **7,000–8,000 words** excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Papers should be succinct but thorough in presenting the work. Shorter, more focused papers are encouraged and will be reviewed like any other paper.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract Deadline:** July 31, 2025, AoE
*   **Full Submission Deadline:** August 7, 2025, AoE
*   **Video and Supplementary Material Deadline:** August 14, 2025, AoE

*   **TEI 2026 Conference:** March 8-11, 2025

## Submission Guidelines

*   **ACM Format Requirements:** TEI 2026 uses the new ACM workflow TAPS for submission templates and published papers. TAPS requires the use of a simplified one-column template for submission, while the final two-column paper will be rendered for publication after acceptance. We strongly recommend using the LaTeX templates rather than Word. Papers do not have a page limit. All relevant information, including submission templates in Word and LaTeX, can be found here: [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions)
*   **Authorship Policy:** Your submission must be original and cannot have been published or be under concurrent review elsewhere. Avoid using text generated by AI-tools; if used, disclose in the acknowledgements. Refer to the [ACM policy on authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship).
*   **Anonymization Policy:** All papers must be anonymized for review. Author and affiliation sections must be left blank. Remove identifying information from the document's metadata and the acknowledgements section. Citations to previous work should be left unanonymized, but authors are encouraged to cite their own work in the third person.
*   **Submission:** All abstracts and full papers must be submitted electronically via the Precision Conference (PCS) website before their respective deadlines. Authors must select their preferred presentation format (talk, demo, poster).

## Review Process

Each paper will be assigned a primary AC (1AC) and a secondary AC (2AC). The 1AC will find two external reviewers. Each paper will receive 3 detailed reviews. The 1AC will write a meta-review, and then present a recommendation to the Program Chairs. Program Chairs will make the final decision.

## After Acceptance

Authors of accepted papers must present their work at the conference. Accepted papers will be included in the Proceedings of TEI 2026 and available in the ACM Digital Library. Authors are responsible for obtaining permissions for licensed content and images, and must grant permission to record/stream their presentations.

## Policy on Use of Large Language Models

Text and images generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author's own text. Disclose LLM use in the acknowledgements section. Submissions with undisclosed LLM use may be desk-rejected.
