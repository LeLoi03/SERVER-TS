Papers will go through a rigorous peer-review process. All accepted papers will be presented at the conference.

## Ethics

The Program Chair(s) are responsible for the paper selection process and do not submit papers to avoid potential bias. Program Committee members and the Organizing Committee, including the General Chair(s), are allowed to submit papers because of double-blind reviewing and conflict-of-interest declaration and enforcement. The rationale for explicitly allowing General Chair(s) to submit is that they do not participate in the paper selection process, nor are they involved in the Program Chair and Program Committee selection process. See [here](https://microarch.org/bylaws.html) for the updated bylaws approved by the MICRO Steering Committee."

The ACM MobiCom conference seeks papers describing significant research contributions in the field of wireless networking and mobile computing. MobiCom solicits papers that address important research challenges and build practical working systems. Successful papers should propose novel ideas to attack such problems through rigorous analysis, system design, and real-world measurement or deployment of mobile networks, systems, and applications.

MobiCom 2025 will emphasize novelty and creativity while, at the same time, taking a broader and more inclusive view of wireless and mobile systems research. The review process will take into account techniques, system designs, implementations, and applications. The review process will also favor papers that describe how the authors will provide access to well-documented datasets, modeling and/or simulation tools, and codebases to support the reproducibility of their methods as well as papers that highlight and discuss not only the significance but also the limitations of the work.

MobiCom 2025 will have a separate category for challenge, experience, and verification papers. These are full papers that provide detailed technical insights from real-world deployments, especially in settings that are not easy for most in the community to duplicate (e.g., due to scale). MobiCom 2025 will also incorporate early notifications for papers rejected in round 1 as described below in more detail.

## Two Deadlines, Early Notification, and One-shot Revision

MobiCom 2025 offers authors the option of two deadlines and keeps the one-shot revision process to enhance the timeliness and quality of the scientific results from the research community. Each paper will go through the same rigorous reviewing process as in previous MobiCom conferences. The review process for each deadline will involve two rounds. Papers that are not selected to proceed after the first round will receive an early notification, including reviews.

Final decisions will be one of the following

*   **Accept:** Accepted papers will be presented at the MobiCom conference and appear as part of the proceedings and the MobiCom website. Note all the papers in this category will initially be conditionally accepted. The papers that go through a successful anonymous shepherding process will eventually be accepted.
*   **Reject:** Rejected after reviewed papers cannot be resubmitted until 11 months have passed since the last MobiCom deadline they were submitted to. We strongly encourage the authors to address reviewers' feedback before re-submitting the paper to MobiCom.
*   **One-Shot-Revision:** Papers, where a revision is required, will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted for the next deadline. For such papers, the reviewers will articulate a maximum of three major changes/clarifications that they would like to see. After the resubmission, the paper will be evaluated based on whether the authors have properly addressed the reviewers’ requests. Unlike in the shepherding process, the requested action points may include running additional experiments that obtain specific results and could take more than 4-6 weeks. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to MobiCom and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration.

## Submission Instructions

All paper submissions will be handled electronically at the [MobiCom 2025 paper submission website](https://mobicom25.hotcrp.com/).

*   Contain no more than twelve (12) single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed.
*   Submissions may include appendices (following bibliography references) and they will not count towards the 12 pages. However, reviewers are not required to read appendices or consider them in their review. Authors should thus ensure that the core paper is self-contained.
*   Font size no smaller than 10 points.
*   Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column.
*   Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches).
*   Submissions must be in PDF (Portable Document Format) authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats, including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted.
*   Authors' names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDFfile must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity.
*   Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: contact the PC chairs if you have a file larger than this limit.

You may find these templates useful in complying with the above requirements. For Latex users, please use \documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}.

## Submission Policy

In addition to the formatting requirements, all authors are expected to make sure that their paper complies with the following submission policies.

### Previous Publications

We allow submissions that extend a previous work published as a poster, demo, or workshop paper such as HotMobile or HotNets. However, in such case, the author(s) should (1) acknowledge their own previous workshop publication with an anonymous citation (e.g., ""[7] Anonymized workshop paper"") and (b) explain the differences between the MobiCom submission and the prior workshop paper (e.g. ""This paper extends a prior workshop paper [7] and differs in the following aspects ..."").

### No Simultaneous Submissions

All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is ACM policy ( href=""http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy"" - ACM Author Rights and Publishing Policy, Prior Publication, and Simultaneous Submissions ) not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved.

### Double-blind Submissions

All submissions will be evaluated through double-blind reviewing. Please do not violate this requirement by explicitly or implicitly leaking the identity of any co-author or institution.

### Conflict of Interest (CoI)

For a fair review process, program committee members who are COIs to any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion and decision-making of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark COIs in the submission website.

ACM MobiSys 2026 encourages the submission of papers that provide detailed technical explorations of real-world deployments of applications and systems.

## Important Dates

To Be Confirmed

Submission site: [https://mobisys26.hotcrp.com](https://mobisys26.hotcrp.com)

Note that titles and abstracts submitted to register the paper by the abstract deadline, albeit not final, must be sufficiently informative, i.e. it must contain a meaningful title and a meaningful abstract of at least 100 words which will reasonably correspond to the final version of the title and the abstract. Abstracts and/or paper tiles such as “TBD”, “XXX”, “coming”, “abcabc” or similar will be desk rejected. There will be no deadline extensions to the dates listed above.

All authors of the paper must be declared at the time of paper submission. Changes to the authorship list can only be accepted by the program chairs only if substantial reasoning is provided that the list of authors should change.

## Policy on Concurrent/Previous submissions

Papers whose contributions overlap with work currently under review elsewhere must not be submitted to ACM MobiSys 2026.

Papers whose contributions overlap with an earlier published paper will be considered only if

*   the previous paper was published (not just accepted) at a workshop before the ACM MobiSys 2026 submission date and
*   it adds significant new contributions over the previous paper. Authors uncertain whether their submission meets these guidelines should contact the program chairs. Papers accompanied by non-disclosure agreement forms will not be considered. Accepted submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

All submissions must describe original research not published or currently under review for another conference or journal. It is [ACM policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions) not to allow double submissions, where the same paper is submitted concurrently to more than one conference/journal. Any double submissions detected will be immediately rejected from all conferences/journals involved.

Posted technical reports (ArXiv or similar) do not count as prior publication. However, we encourage the authors to

*   Use different system names in the technical report and ACM MobiSys 2026 submission and
*   Avoid publicizing the technical report on social media or community blogs and webpages while it is under review by ACM MobiSys 2026.

## Resubmission Policy [New to MobiSys'26]

If your submission was based on work that was previously peer-reviewed and rejected, you are encouraged to provide a short summary of the points raised by the reviewers of your previous submission and how you addressed them. This non-mandatory summary can be submitted to the [submission system](https://mobisys26.hotcrp.com) and should not be part of the paper submission itself. We do not expect a full rebuttal addressing each point, but rather an indication to the reviewers of ACM MobiSys 2026 that you have taken the previous reviewers’ comments seriously and are not simply resubmitting the paper as it was to ACM MobiSys 2026. The summary you have provided will be visible to the reviewers after they submitted their review to avoid any bias against paper resubmissions.

## Double-Blind Review Process

As in the case of previous ACM MobiSys editions, ACM MobiSys 2026 will use a double-blind review policy during the initial paper review. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper. Only program committee chairs will know the identity of the authors and be able to interact with them during the review process, should the need arise. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed.

Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and technical correctness. Papers may be conditionally accepted and shepherded by a member of the program committee, with final acceptance determined by consent of the shepherd.

## Formatting Guidelines

Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (PDF). We will not accept papers in any other format. Any papers that do not adhere to the following guidelines may be rejected without review:

*   Contain no more than twelve (12) single-spaced and numbered pages, including figures, tables, any appendices, and any other material, followed by as many pages as necessary for bibliographic references. Papers whose non-bibliographic content is longer than 12 pages will not be reviewed.
*   Font size no smaller than 10 points.
*   Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column.
*   Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches by 11 inches).

Again, submissions must be in PDF. Authors should ensure that they are compatible with Adobe Acrobat (English version). Any other formats, including Postscript and MS-Word, will not be accepted.

Authors’ names must not appear anywhere in the paper or in the PDF file. The PDF file must also not contain any embedded hyperlinks, as these may compromise reviewer anonymity.

Limit the file size to less than 15 MB: please contact the Program Committee chairs if you have a file larger than this limit.

You may find these templates useful in complying with the above requirements. For LaTex users, please use `\documentclass[sigconf,10pt]{acmart}`. But as an author, you bear the final responsibility to verify that your submission is format-compliant.

## Ethics Review Board Approval Requirement

As part of the submission process, authors of papers that describe experiments on human subjects, or that analyze non-public data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), will be asked to certify that their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., Institutional Review Board (IRB), Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) or similar approval). We expect authors to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects. Papers that will not adhere to this rule will be rejected.

## Mandatory Registration

At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to register for the ACM MobiSys 2026 conference (at a non-student rate) and present the paper in-person.

## Artifact Evaluation and Paper Results Reproducibility

As in the case of previous two ACM MobiSys editions, the authors of accepted ACM MobiSys 2026 papers will have the option to opt for an artifact evaluation. By doing so, they commit to providing the implementations, models, test suites, benchmarks, and data used to derive the results presented in the paper to the artifact evaluation committee. Based on the evaluation, the papers will be awarded the appropriate artifact evaluation badgelink: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging). The artifact evaluation will be conducted after paper acceptance decisions.

Irrespective of taking part in the artifact evaluation, we encourage all authors to do their best to provide enough information in the paper allowing non-authors to replicate results presented in the paper.

## Early Rejection Notification and Rebuttal

ACM MobiSys 2026 will have early rejection notifications and a rebuttal phase. The authors of the papers that do not advance to the second round of review will be notified of the rejection of their paper. This allows the authors to plan for another submission and not have to wait for the ACM MobiSys 2026 review process to come to an end. The papers that do advance to the second round of review will get a chance to submit a rebuttal after the second round comes to an end. In the rebuttal, the authors will be asked to respond to the questions raised by the reviewers.

We ask the authors to limit their responses to correcting factual errors in the reviews or responding to specific questions posed by the reviewers. Responses must not include new experiments or describe additional work completed since submission. To lower the amount of effort for both the authors and reviewers, ACM MobiSys 2026 limits the rebuttal to 500 words.

## Conflict of Interest

To ensure a fair review process, PC members who have a conflict of interest with any author of the submission will not review or participate in the discussion of the submission. It is the author’s responsibility to mark conflict of interests in the submission website.

ACM MobiSys 2026 will follow the ACM policy and also add and extend rules on the specific relationships to explicitly define conflicts of interest of one submission as:

1.  any program committee member who works/worked at the same organizational affiliation with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;
2.  any program committee member who has co-authored any book, article, report, abstract or paper with collaboration in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;
3.  any program committee member who has collaborated on projects, such as funded grants, research or others with any co-author in the last 24 months or reasonably expected within the next 12 months;
4.  any program committee member who is/was the advisor or advisee of any co-author; These include your BSc advisor(s), Msc advisor(s), PhD advisor(s) and/or postdoctoral host(s).
5.  any program committee member who graduated from the same research group and/or was under the same advisor/supervisor/manager in the last 48 months;
6.  any program committee member who is exposed to the full or partial authorship of the work being submitted here in any public or private channel (including but not limited to interview talks, campus visits, research discussion, conversations);
7.  any program committee member who has family, marriage, blood or heritage relationships.
8.  any program committee member who has a close personal friendship or business relationship beyond professional settings that could affect the review process with any co-author;
9.  others perceivable conflicts.

Cases that do not require conflict of interest notification include:

*   Reviewers that are working on the same topic as you.
*   Collaborations with the reviewers on program committees, open source projects, etc.

A potential conflict of interest must be identified at the submission and can be updated at any point during the review process, but when possible, potential conflicts should be determined before acceptance decisions are made.

The author(s) must identify every conflict of interest out of all program committee members (including chairs) with any author of the submission and indicate the type of conflict during the submission process. For other forms of conflicts (item 8), the authors must contact the program chairs and explain the perceived conflict.

Knowingly hiding or falsifying a stated conflict of interest, and knowingly and falsely asserting a conflict of interest, e.g., to prevent or alter peer-reviewing, to discourage appropriate reviewing, or to seek disadvantage of another are both considered as a violation of this conflict of interest policy. We will return the violated submissions with no reviews. Please contact program committee chairs if you have any doubts regarding declaring conflicts of interest.

## Pitch Video for Accepted Papers [New to MobiSys'26]

All accepted ACM MobiSys 2026 papers will be asked to submit, together with a camera-ready version of their paper, a (approximately) 90 seconds video presenting their accepted project. The submitted video will be part of ACM MobiSys 2026 proceedings and added to the SIGMOBILE YouTube Channel.

## Policy on the Use of Large Language Models [New to MobiSys'26]

Following other major conferences such as [CHI 2025](https://chi2025.acm.org/for-authors/papers/), any text in submissions that is generated using large-scale language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly identified by the authors in the submitted paper. This policy does not apply to using LLMs for editing/proof-reading the author’s own text. Please carefully review the [April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) before you use these tools. While we do not anticipate using tools at a large scale to identify LLM-generated text, we will thoroughly investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.

## Keynote Speakers

MODELSWARD 2026 will have several invited keynote speakers, who are internationally recognized experts in their areas. Their names are not yet confirmed.

## Paper Submission

Authors can submit their work in the form of a complete paper or an abstract, but please note that accepted abstracts are presented but not published in the proceedings of the conference.

Complete papers can be submitted as a **Regular Paper**, representing completed and validated research, or as a **Position Paper**, portraying a short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue discussing ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research focused on one of the conference topic areas.

Authors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics.

Each paper should clearly indicate the nature of its technical/scientific contribution, and the problems, domains or environments to which it is applicable.

To facilitate the double-blind paper evaluation method, authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors.

All papers must be submitted through the online submission platform PRIMORIS and should follow the instructions and templates that can be found under Guidelines and Templates.

## Publications

All accepted complete papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and on digital support.

SCITEPRESS is a member of CrossRef and every paper on our digital library is given a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).

The proceedings will be submitted for indexation by SCOPUS, Google Scholar, DBLP, Semantic Scholar, EI and Web of Science / Conference Proceedings Citation Index.

It is planned to publish a short list of revised and extended versions of presented papers with Springer in a CCIS Series book (final approval pending).

A short list of best papers will be invited for a post-conference special issue of the Springer Nature Computer Science Journal.

MSR is a premier conference focusing on data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in software engineering, and invites contributions where software data plays a central role.","# MSR 2026: Call for Papers

The International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) is the premier conference for data science (DS), machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI) in software engineering.

The 23rd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories will be held on **April 13-14, 2026, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil**, co-located with [ICSE 2026](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2026).

The MSR conference invites significant research contributions in which software data plays a central role. MSR Technical Track submissions using data from software repositories, either solely or combined with data from other sources, can take many forms, including:

*   Studies applying existing DS/ML/AI techniques to better understand the practice of software engineering, software users, and software behavior.
*   Empirically-validated applications of existing or novel DS/ML/AI-based techniques to improve software development and support the maintenance of software systems.
*   Cross-cutting concerns around the engineering of DS/ML/AI-enabled software systems.

## Evaluation Criteria

We invite both **full (maximum ten pages, plus two additional pages of references)** as well as **short (four pages, plus references)** papers to the Research Track. Submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:

*   **Soundness:** How well the paper’s contributions address the research questions posed.
*   **Relevance:** The extent to which the paper successfully argues that its contributions help bridge a significant knowledge gap or tackle a crucial practical issue within the field of software engineering.
*   **Novelty:** How original the paper’s contributions are compared to existing knowledge.
*   **Presentation:** How well-structured and clear the paper’s argumentation is.
*   **Replicability:** The extent to which the paper’s claims can be independently verified.

All submissions are expected to adhere to the Open Science policy.

## Junior PC

MSR 2026 will once again integrate junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!

The main goal remains unchanged: to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members.

## Submission Process

All submissions must be in PDF format and conform to the official ACM Primary Article Template, which can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template page. LaTeX users should use the `sigconf` option, as well as the `review` and `anonymous` options.

Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the [submission site](https://msr2026.hotcrp.com) by the submission deadline. However, we encourage authors to submit at least the paper abstract and author details well in advance of the deadline.

All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:

*   All submissions must not exceed **10 pages** for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version.
*   Submissions must strictly conform to the ACM conference proceedings formatting instructions.
*   By submitting to MSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ.
*   If the research involves human participants/subjects, the authors must adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.
*   Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.
*   The MSR 2026 Technical Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities.

By submitting to MSR 2026 authors acknowledge that they conform to the [authorship policy of the ACM](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) , and the [authorship policy of the IEEE](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/definition-of-authorship/).

Submissions should also include a supporting statement on the data availability, per the Open Science policy below.

Any submission that does not comply with these requirements is likely to be desk rejected by the PC Chairs without further review.

## Open Science Policy

The MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. Please provide a supporting statement on the data availability in your submitted papers, including an argument for why (some of) the data cannot be made available, if that is the case.

Specifically, we expect all contributing authors to disclose:

*   The source code of relevant software used or proposed in the paper, including that used to retrieve and analyze data.
*   The data used in the paper (e.g., evaluation data, anonymized survey data, etc.)
*   Instructions for other researchers describing how to reproduce or replicate the results.

We encourage authors to make artifacts available upon submission (either privately or publicly) and upon acceptance (publicly).

## Submission Link

Papers must be submitted through HotCRP: [https://msr2026.hotcrp.com](https://msr2026.hotcrp.com)

## Submission Categories

MPLR accepts three types of submissions:

*   **Regular research papers:** describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms. Research papers will be evaluated based on their relevance, novelty, technical rigor, and contribution to the state-of-the-art. (Format: up to 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix)
*   **Work-in-progress research papers:** describing hot topics or promising new ideas, with perhaps less maturity than full papers. Work-in-progress papers will be evaluated with an emphasis on novelty and the potential of the new ideas instead of technical rigor and experimental results. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix)
*   **Industry and tool papers:** presenting technical challenges and solutions for managed language platforms in the context of deployed applications and systems. Industry and tool papers will be evaluated on their relevance, usefulness, and results. Suitability for demonstration and availability will also be considered for tool papers. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix; up to 12 pages allowed if justified by the content)

Accepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library, except if the authors prefer not to be included.

MPLR 2025 submissions must conform to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions and to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy.

MPLR 2025 will not hold its own poster session. Please consider submitting to the SPLASH poster track.

## Author Instructions

Submissions need to use the ACM SIGPLAN format with the sigplan style.

If you are using LaTeX, submissions need to use the acmart document class with the sigplan option (not the sigconf option). For ease of reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission using the LaTeX command `\settopmatter{printfolios=true}`. Please use the standard setting, e.g., the default font size for the SIGPLAN style is 10 point and the format uses two columns for the test.

All submissions need to be in PDF format. MPLR now uses double-blind reviewing. Authors should not show their names on a submission and should refer to their own work in third person. We further recommend that they avoid publicizing the work, at least under the same or similar title, while it is under review.

Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.

**Submission Site:** [https://mplr25.hotcrp.com](https://mplr25.hotcrp.com)

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Novelty:** The submission must be original work. It cannot have been published elsewhere nor be under concurrent review for publication by another conference or journal. Papers should be grounded in existing literature and knowledge and written for an interdisciplinary audience.
*   **Length and contribution:** Submissions can be of variable length. The paper length must match the contribution. Using the single-column format, the maximum length for a full paper is 16 pages (excluding references) and the maximum length for a short paper is 7 pages (excluding references).
    *   Successful full-paper submissions typically represent significant empirical, theoretical, or methodological advances in the field.
    *   Successful short-paper submissions offer more focused contributions with a smaller scope; they are not intended to be work-in-progress reports. Instead, they should offer complete, rigorously developed work with a solid contribution to the field.
*   **Formatting:**
    *   Templates: LaTeX template, [Word template](https://authors.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx)
    *   Submissions must be in PDF format.
    *   Papers must be in English. All references must be complete, accurate, accessible, and conform to the ACM Publication Format. Authors are required to use the single-column ACM Manuscript template. Submission preparation is described on the ACM Primary Template website.
    *   For LaTeX, the correct templates (Overleaf or LaTeX templates) can be found on ACM's ""Preparing your article for LaTeX"" page, using `\documentclass[manuscript, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart}` style for the document.
    *   For Word, the correct submission template can be found on ACM's ""Preparing your article for Word"" page, i.e., ""submission template"".
    *   The TAPS workflow we use is described on ACM's TAPS workflow page.
*   **Anonymity:** All submissions need to be fully anonymised, including any appendices or supplemental material and a potential acknowledgements section. Citations to the authors’ own previous work are NOT allowed to be anonymised. Authors should refer to their own prior work in the third person.
*   **Supplementary Material:** All videos and supplementary material must be anonymized. Authors are encouraged to submit an optional video of a maximum of 6 minutes to support their submission. Authors are encouraged to follow the Accessible Presentation Guide. To ensure reviewers can view the supplementary video, authors should use the H.264 encoding and the MP4 file format. The bit rate of videos can be lowered to accommodate the upload limits of EasyChair (max. 50 MB per file).
*   **Accessibility:** Authors are required to follow [SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission](https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/). If authors have questions or concerns about creating accessible submissions, please contact the Accessibility Chairs via [accessibilitydiversity2025@mum-conf.org](mailto:accessibilitydiversity2025@mum-conf.org) early in the writing process.
*   **Use of Generative AI:** Authors must adhere to the [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) regarding the use of generative AI in submissions. Authors are responsible for all content produced and must disclose their use.
*   **ACM Publications Policy:** By submitting an article to an ACM Publication, authors acknowledge that they and their co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies.
*   All authors are required to have an ORCID.

## Submitting

*   **Submission Platform:** Submissions are facilitated via the Easychair platform. Should authors encounter any difficulties, technical problems, or questions about this process, please contact the Paper chairs via [papers2025@mum-conf.org](mailto:papers2025@mum-conf.org).
*   **Metadata Integrity:** Changes in author names are not allowed after the submission deadline. Changes to the order of authors are allowed only before the camera-ready deadline. Minor changes to the title and abstract are permitted during the revision period.

## Selection Process

Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous double-blind review process managed by the Program Chairs. Each submitted paper will be reviewed by at least three reviewers, chosen from the pool of members of the Program Committee. Papers will be assigned through a bidding process.

There will be a single round of reviews with three potential outcomes: desk rejects, rejection, and conditional acceptance. No rebuttal phase is planned. Authors of conditionally accepted papers will find in the reviews a list of revisions and requested changes they need to satisfy to have their paper officially accepted into the program.

## Upon Acceptance

*   **Publication:** Accepted papers will appear in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library.
*   Accepted papers will follow the ACM TAPS workflow instructions. ACM will send authors a copyright form, which they have to complete.
*   The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of the conference.
*   The conference will follow the open access policy set by ACM at the time of the camera-ready version of accepted publications.
*   **Presentation Format:** Accepted papers must be presented at the conference. Authors with accepted publications will be informed closer to the conference about the duration of their assigned slot and the timing of their presentation.
*   For each accepted paper, full registration for the MUM 2025 conference is required by the early bird registration deadline.

## Important Dates

*   **Paper Submission:** August 21th, 2025 (AoE)
*   **Decision Notification:** October 6th, 2025 (AoE)
*   **Camera-ready deadline:** October 20th, 2025 (AoE)

## Important Dates

*   **Manuscript Due:** August 15th, 2025.
*   **Acceptance Notification:** October 7th, 2025

## Manuscript Submission

Paper submissions are managed through EasyChair. The submission link will be available soon.

### Manuscript page limit

*   **Regular Papers:** 8 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.
*   **Short Papers:** 4 pages, including all figures, tables, and references.

### Purchasing extra pages

*   **Regular Papers:** Up to 2 extra pages may be purchased at €100 (EUR) per extra page.
*   **Short Papers:** Up to 1 extra page may be purchased at €100 (EUR).

Authors can decide to submit full papers longer than 8 pages (up to 10 pages) before the reviewing process. This is an indication of their will to purchase extra pages during the registration process. Therefore, longer papers accepted as full papers cannot be shrunk when preparing camera ready versions. This is to respect the work made by reviewers and other authors which decided to stay in the limits. Authors who submitted papers as full papers which were accepted to the conference as short papers, will need to reduce their size to 4 pages (or 5 pages by purchasing 1 extra page) in the camera ready version.

## Accepted papers and Publication Policies

Every regular paper accepted must have attached to it at least one registration at the full rate. Thus, for a manuscript for which all authors are students, one student author will be required to register at the full registration rate. For manuscripts where at least one author is already registered at the full rate, this fulfills the obligation.

No-show papers are defined as papers submitted by authors who subsequently did not present the paper at the technical meeting. This year, all presentations will be given in person at the conference venue. No-show papers that were not withdrawn and were published in the Proceedings must be identified as ""No-Show"" in the files submitted to the Conference Publishing Services (CPS) for further publication. No-shows will not be available on IEEE Xplore or other public access IEEE forums. IEEE CPS will maintain an archive of no-shows.

The IEEE CPS strongly discourages changes and, in particular, withdrawals of papers once submitted and included in the program.

If under any circumstances it becomes necessary for the author to withdraw or change a paper, IEEE CPS policy dictates that the request to do this must come directly from the author and not from any third party. IEEE CPS policy also states that in this case, the author will be held liable for all costs that are incurred. It would then be up to the author to get reimbursed for the expense from any third party if he/she feels it is justified. The IEEE CPS cannot act as a policing entity on behalf of the author in this regard.

## AUTHORS’ KIT AND TEMPLATES

The author kit is provided on this page *.

*   LaTeX Template
*   Bibliography Style

Tips: Be sure to use the template's conference mode. See template documentation for details. Accordingly, check that the bibliography is properly formatted according to IEEE specifications. It is possible, but discouraged, to use other systems for the preparation of papers, e.g. MS-Word. Author kits for these systems can be found on this page."

## Submission Guidelines

All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through double-blind peer review.

As an author, you are required to preserve the anonymity of your submission, while at the same time allowing reviewers to fully grasp the context of related past work, including your own. Papers that do not conform to our double-blind submission policies will be rejected without review.

Only original papers that have not been published or submitted for review elsewhere will be considered. Submitted papers should be written in English by following the IEEE conference format, with a maximum length limit of **9 printed pages**, including all the figures, references, and appendices. Papers longer than 9 pages will not be reviewed. Each paper can be accompanied by an appendix of at most 2 pages. However, the reviewers are not obliged to read the appendix. The appendix is included in the 9 page limit.

All papers must be submitted in the Portable Document Format (PDF) electronically using EDAS: [https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=33421&track=129126](https://edas.info/newPaper.php?c=33421&track=129126)

At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference at the full (member or non-member) rate and the paper must be presented by an author of that paper at the conference.

## OpenReview

We are using OpenReview to manage submissions. Anyone who plans to submit a paper as an author or a co-author will need to create (or update) their OpenReview profile by the full paper submission deadline. Submissions without the authors' updated OpenReview profiles will be desk rejected.

Please be aware that OpenReview has a moderation policy for newly created profiles: New profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks. New profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically.

Our OpenReview portal is [https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Conference).

## Dual Submissions

Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that the authors have previously published or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed venues with proceedings or journals may not be submitted to NeurIPS.

## Anti-collusion

NeurIPS does not tolerate any collusion whereby authors secretly cooperate with reviewers, ACs or SACs to obtain favorable reviews.

## Code Submission

We strongly encourage accompanying code and data to be submitted with accepted papers when appropriate, as per the [code submission policy](https://neurips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy).

## Other Tracks

This year, the Datasets and Benchmarks track will share the exact same deadlines as the main conference program. DB submissions will also adhere to the main track's guidelines for formatting, supplementary materials, LLM use, ethics review, preprints, dual submissions, anti-collusion, author responses, and publication. Please refer to the [Datasets and Benchmarks CFP](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForDatasetsBenchmarks) for details on the track specific requirements; otherwise, the main track's CFP applies.

This year, we introduce a new Position Paper track, with formatting requirements that are consistent to those for the main conference and shared policies on double-blind reviewing, etc. The Position track also has a “lay summary” requirement for papers that are accepted for publication. The deadlines for position papers are shifted slightly later compared to those of the main conference. Please refer to the [Position Papers CFP](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPositionPapers) for more details.

## Financial Aid

Each paper may designate up to one (1) NeurIPS.cc account email address of a corresponding student author who confirms that they would need the support to attend the conference, and agrees to volunteer if they get selected. To be considered for Financial the student will also need to fill out the Financial Aid application when it becomes available."

## Submission Instructions

*   All submissions are treated as confidential.
*   NSPW does not accept previously published or concurrently submitted papers.
*   **Due Date:** April 25, 2025, 11:59 PM AoE
*   **Response Date:** May 30, 2025
*   **Format:** PDF format, 6-15 pages, ACM “sigconf” formatting
*   **Submit through EasyChair:** [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025)

Each paper requires **two** separate EasyChair submissions:

1.  Cover page with authors’ names, affiliation, and the participation statement.
2.  Anonymous PDF paper with a justification statement.

### Special Submission Instructions

*   The **participation statement** (on the cover page) must specify which author(s) will attend upon acceptance/invitation, that all authors will engage in good faith with the feedback given in the review and revision periods, and that all authors will abide by the NSPW code of conduct.
*   The **justification statement** (clearly marked as part of the PDF submission) briefly explains why the submission is appropriate for NSPW and the chosen submission category. The justification statement will not appear in the final publication.

Submissions that do not include both statements risk rejection without review. In addition, submissions should blind author identity where possible. The LaTeX document option `anonymous=true` provides a minimum level of protection; however, authors should also avoid referencing their own work in the first person or other obvious de-anonymization in the submission.

Organizers and Program Committee members are allowed to submit papers but will not be involved in evaluating their papers.

## Publication

NSPW'25 papers will be published in the International Conference Proceedings Series of the ACM Digital Library.

Note: ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance).

## Social Contract and Code of Conduct

All participants must commit to a “social contract”: no one arrives late, no one leaves early, no electronic distractions (including laptops, tablets, and mobile devices), attend all sessions of the 2.5-day program, share meals in a group setting, and comply with the code of conduct.

## Overview

NSDI focuses on the design principles, implementation, and practical evaluation of networked and distributed systems. Our goal is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community to foster a broad approach to addressing overlapping research challenges.

NSDI provides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further the knowledge and understanding of the networked systems community as a whole, continue a significant research dialog, or push the architectural boundaries of network services.

## Topics

NSDI invites any innovative solution for a significant problem involving networked systems, including topics from within the following list:

*   Highly available and reliable networked systems
*   Security and privacy of networked systems
*   Distributed storage, caching, and query processing systems
*   Sustainable, low-energy, and low-carbon networked systems
*   Cloud/multi-tenant systems
*   Mobile and embedded/sensor applications and systems
*   Systems aspects of networking hardware and physical layer communication technologies
*   Network and workload measurement systems
*   Self-organizing, autonomous, and federated networked systems
*   Managing, debugging, and diagnosing problems in networked systems
*   Virtualization and resource management for networked systems
*   Experience with deployed networked systems
*   Networked systems for big data
*   Testing and/or verification applied to networked systems
*   Networked systems for machine learning (ML) and ML for networked systems

Papers with no clear contributions to the design of systems or the networking stack will be considered out of scope.

The list of topics above is necessarily incomplete and imprecise. In its ongoing effort to adjust scope, the NSDI Steering Committee has identified a list of topics that are explicitly excluded from upcoming NSDI symposia. Papers whose core contributions are on the following topics are likely to be rejected for reasons of scope:

*   Physical layer contributions: beamforming, modulation techniques, communication through unconventional mediums (capacitative, inductive, acoustic)
*   Sensing and localization contributions: gesture sensing, environment mapping, remote sensing
*   Architecture contributions: voltage scaling, GPU resource scheduling, hardware level fault tolerance
*   User interface contributions

See the recent statement from the NSDI Steering Committee for more information about the ongoing scope adjustment process.

Authors will have the opportunity to explain why their paper is in scope for NSDI by answering the following question: What important problems or challenges in networked systems does this paper solve/address?

## Two Deadlines

NSDI '26 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines. Any paper submitted to one of these deadlines and accepted during the subsequent reviewing period will be presented at the conference and will appear as part of the proceedings. In the meantime, authors are permitted to advertise their papers as accepted by NSDI, for example, listing them on CVs. For more information, see [Additional Information about Multiple Deadlines Process](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi26/additional-info).

## One-Shot Revision

Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. Authors may then submit a version of their work addressing all revision instructions during the subsequent deadline. Papers revised and resubmitted following a one-shot-revision decision can only receive a decision of accept or reject, not revise; this is what makes revisions ""one-shot.""

If authors receive a one-shot-revision decision for a paper submitted to the fall deadline of NSDI '26, this gives them the option to make the requested changes and resubmit it to the next NSDI deadline, which is the ﬁrst deadline of NSDI '27. If the paper is accepted then, it will appear at NSDI '27, not NSDI '26.

## Policy on NSDI Resubmissions

As described above, each NSDI conference consists of two deadlines: spring and fall. Papers rejected from one of these deadlines cannot be submitted to the immediate next deadline.

If authors receive a one-shot-revision decision and choose to submit the paper to NSDI '26 they will be required to submit the old paper number from the one-shot-revision decision (e.g., one-shot-revisions from NSDI '25 fall being submitted to NSDI '26 spring will need to provide the NSDI '25 HotCRP paper ID). Papers with numbers that do not agree with previous HotCRP history will be automatically desk rejected. If authors receive a one-shot-revision decision but choose not to submit a revised version, the paper is treated as a reject, and the same resubmission policy applies.

## Extensions of Workshop Papers

Work that extends an author's previous workshop paper is welcome, but the paper should (a) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation and (b) explain the differences between the NSDI submission and the prior workshop paper. The online submission form will also require authors to submit the deanonymized citation and a short explanation of the differences from the prior workshop paper.

## Resubmission of SIGCOMM '25 and HotNets '26 Papers

Authors are free to submit SIGCOMM '25 rejected papers to NSDI '26 fall and significant extensions of HotNets '26 accepted papers to NSDI '26 fall, provided that the notifications from these conferences occur before the full paper submission deadlines for NSDI.

## Operational Systems Track

NSDI '26 also solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with large-scale, operational systems and networks. Since the evaluation of operational systems track papers requires understanding the real-world use of the system, papers in this track will be reviewed in a more limited double-blind process. Authors' names should be withheld, as usual. However, in contrast to other papers, authors need not anonymize the content of their submission in any other way—they may keep company names, links, real system names, etc., as appropriate for the paper.

Authors should indicate on the title page of the paper and in the submission form that they are submitting to this track.

The ﬁnal program will explicitly identify papers accepted from the operational track to distinguish them from papers accepted from the regular track.

## What to Submit

NSDI '26 is double-blind, meaning that authors should make a good faith effort to anonymize papers. Submissions—as well as ﬁnal papers—must be no longer than 12 pages, including footnotes, ﬁgures, and tables. Submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for references and for supplementary material in appendices. 

Submissions must be in two-column format, using 10-point type on 12-point (single-spaced) leading, in a text block 7"" wide x 9"" deep, with .33"" inter-column space, formatted for 8.5"" x 11"" paper.

Papers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review, and no deadline extensions will be granted for reformatting. 

All papers must be submitted via the [submission form](https://nsdi26spring.usenix.hotcrp.com/). Please do not email submissions.

## On the Use of Generative AI

Authors must not submit papers generated entirely by generative AI. Authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper is not completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP.

## Policies

Simultaneous submissions: Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. USENIX, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have committed them. See the [USENIX Conference Submissions Policy](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/author-resources/submissions-policy) for details.

Extensions on workshop papers: Previous publication at a workshop is acceptable as long as the NSDI submission includes substantial new material that has been developed since the publication of any earlier version. However, NSDI submissions cannot be concurrent with submission to a workshop venue.

Online technical reports: As added clarification for authors: NSDI allows submissions to be simultaneously stored online as technical reports, e.g., at arXiv, provided that the authors use a different title and system name in their submission from the technical report. This is to help avoid reviewer bias (in either direction) when judging the submission.

Authors uncertain whether their submission meets USENIX's guidelines should contact the Program Co-Chairs, [nsdi26chairs@usenix.org](mailto:nsdi26chairs@usenix.org).

Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered.

## Conflicts

At submission time, you must provide information about conflicts with PC members. 

You must not improperly identify a PC member as a conflict if none of these circumstances applies, even if for some other reason you want to avoid them reviewing your paper. 

## Ethical Considerations

Papers describing experiments with users or user data (e.g., network traﬃc, passwords, social network information), should follow the basic principles of ethical research.

Authors must, as part of the submission process, attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to, privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. 

## Processes for Accepted Papers

If your paper is accepted and you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa to attend the conference, please contact [conference@usenix.org](mailto:conference@usenix.org) as soon as possible.

Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process by a member of the Program Committee. 

By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. 

All papers will be available online to registered attendees before the conference. If your accepted paper should not be published prior to the event, please notify [production@usenix.org](mailto:production@usenix.org).

## Best Paper Awards

Awards will be given for the best paper(s) at the conference.

To encourage broader code and data sharing within the NSDI community, the conference will also present a ""Community Award"" for the best paper whose code and/or data set is made publicly available by the ﬁnal paper deadline.

Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.

## The Character of Onward! Papers

Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

## Selection Process

Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.

Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.

We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.

The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.

The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard. Now submissions are not allowed for the second phase deadline.

## Instructions for Authors

For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.

Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.

## Submission Site

[https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/](https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/)

## Concurrent Submissions

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.

## Policy on Double Blind Review

Onward! 2025 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:

*   Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper.
*   To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person.
*   To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements.

After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.

See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.

## Policy on Authorship Changes

Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.

## Format

Submissions should use [ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/), sigplan sub-format and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.

If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the \documentclass command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX \documentclass command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.

## Page Limit

To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted or the authors are asked for revisions, the revised main body of the manuscript and final submission will be limited to 17 pages plus references and supplementary material. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)

## Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)

**AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:** The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

All deadlines are firm. New papers may be submitted to either round.

## Submission Guidelines

### Template

SPLASH’s PACMPL templates and instructions are on the [SIGPLAN author information page](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/). Please use `\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review]{acmart}` at the top of your paper.

### Page Limit

Initial submissions must be at most 23 pages using the template. This page limit does not include required statements, references, or supplementary material. Revisions can go up to a maximum of 25 pages.

### Anonymity

PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Your papers must:

*   omit author names and institutions,
*   use the third person when referencing your work,
*   anonymize supplementary material.

Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.

### Novelty

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Re-Publication Policy.

### Data-Availability Statement

Add a section just before references titled **Data-Availability Statement** in the initial submission. Indicate whether an artifact exists, its nature and limitations, and whether it will be submitted for Artifact Evaluation. Include links to preliminary versions of (anonymized) artifacts, datasets, and so on.

### Procedure

Please submit using [HotCRP](https://oopsla2425.hotcrp.com/).

## Review Process

PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing. Each paper will typically receive three or more reviews. You will get an opportunity to respond to these reviews before decisions are finalized.

At the end of each round, each paper will receive one of the five following decisions:

*   Accept: Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).
*   Reject: Your paper will not appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).
*   Conditional Accept: Specific changes required.
*   Minor Revision: Several concerns that it would like to see revised.
*   Major Revision: Significant concerns that it would like to see revised.

## Reserve Reviewer Policy

For each paper, at least one senior author must register as a reserve reviewer. A paper is exempt if:

*   The paper has no senior authors.
*   At least one senior author is already in the RC for this conference.
*   Every senior author of the paper satisfies one or more of these criteria:
    *   is new to SIGPLAN (has never published in it before);
    *   is chairing a SIGPLAN conference with 150 or more submissions last year, this year, or next year;
    *   has some other exceptional circumstance.

## Publication

PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal. All papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge (USD 400), but payment is not required.

## Overview

The 19th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation seeks to present innovative, exciting research in computer systems. OSDI brings together professionals from academic and industrial backgrounds in a premier forum for discussing the design, implementation, and implications of systems software. OSDI emphasizes innovative research and quantified or insightful experiences in systems design and implementation.

OSDI takes a broad view of the systems area and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data, embedded systems, virtualization, networking as it relates to operating systems, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interface to related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, and databases. We encourage contributions with highly original ideas, new approaches, and groundbreaking results.

## Submitting a Paper

Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process by a member of the program committee.

A good paper will:

*   Motivate a significant problem
*   Propose an interesting and compelling solution
*   Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution
*   Draw appropriate conclusions
*   Clearly describe the paper's contributions
*   Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work

Submission Scope and Relevance: The OSDI steering committee, in maintaining a three-decade tradition of a single-track program, is committed to deepening discussions on key computer systems topics. Starting from OSDI '25, there will be a deliberate focus on selecting papers that offer significant contributions to computer systems research and align with community interests. Reviewers will evaluate submissions based on the topic relevance to computer systems and their potential to impact future research and practices in computer systems. Additionally, submissions must demonstrate relevance and offer unique insights to capture the interest of a substantial portion of OSDI attendees. By adhering to these criteria, OSDI aims to continue its legacy by focusing on innovative research that addresses pressing needs in the computer systems field.

Accepted papers will generally be available online to registered attendees before the conference. If your accepted paper should not be published prior to the event, please notify [production@usenix.org](mailto:production@usenix.org). The papers will be available online to everyone beginning on the first day of the symposium.

Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the OSDI '25 website; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. USENIX, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may, on the recommendation of a program chair, take action against authors who have committed them. See the [USENIX Conference Submissions Policy](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/submissions-policy) for details.

Submitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted as long as the authors have substantially addressed the previous reviewers' comments. If the prior conference's rejection notification has been received less than thirteen months before the OSDI '25 submission deadline, then the authors are requested to provide information regarding the previous submission and a summary of the subsequent revisions to the paper. This information should be uploaded via the submission form, and will not be shared with the OSDI '25 reviewers.

Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in OSDI. The online submission form will require authors to submit a copy of the related workshop paper and a short explanation of the new material in the conference paper beyond that published in the workshop version. The co-chairs may then share that paper with the workshop's organizers and discuss it with them.

Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is permitted. However, your OSDI submission must use an anonymized name for your project or system that differs from any used in such contexts.

USENIX discourages program co-chairs from submitting papers to the conferences they organize, although they are allowed to do so. Should either program co-chair submit work to OSDI '25, their papers will be handled exclusively by the other program co-chair and reviewed according to the same rigorous and double-blinded procedures that the program committee applies to all papers. In the event that a paper is co-authored by, or otherwise conflicted with both co-chairs, the co-chairs will designate a PC member to manage the reviewing process for that paper.

Questions? Contact your program co-chairs, [osdi25chairs@usenix.org](mailto:osdi25chairs@usenix.org), or the USENIX office, [submissionspolicy@usenix.org](mailto:submissionspolicy@usenix.org).

By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it. If the conference registration fee will pose a hardship for the presenter of the accepted paper, please contact [conference@usenix.org](mailto:conference@usenix.org). For very special support circumstances (such as travel restrictions or health issues), USENIX may provide the possibility of remote presentation and Q&A.

If your paper is accepted and you need an invitation letter to apply for a visa to attend the conference, please contact [conference@usenix.org](mailto:conference@usenix.org) as soon as possible. Visa applications are reportedly taking more than two months to process. Please identify yourself as a presenter or an author, and include your mailing address in your email request.

## Deadline and Submission Instructions

Authors must register abstracts and submit full papers by the dates indicated above. These are hard deadlines, and no extensions will be given. Submitted papers must be no longer than 12 single-spaced 8.5"" x 11"" pages, including figures and tables, plus as many pages as needed for references, using 10-point type on 12-point (single-spaced) leading, two-column format, Times Roman or a similar font, within a text block 7"" wide x 9"" deep. Accepted papers will be allowed 14 pages in the proceedings, plus references. Papers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review, and no deadline extensions will be granted for reformatting. Pages should be numbered, and figures and tables should be legible in black and white, without requiring magnification. Papers so short as to be considered ""extended abstracts"" will not receive full consideration.

## Supplementary Material

Authors may upload supplementary material in files separate from their submissions. PC members are not required to read supplementary material when reviewing the paper, so each paper should stand alone without it. Authors may use this for content that may be of interest to some readers but is peripheral to the main technical contributions of the paper. Examples of materials that may be included are: formal proofs that are only sketched in the paper; snippets of code that detail an algorithm presented in the paper; and methodological details that are not essential for the PC’s assessment but are important for reproducibility. Importantly, because the PC members are NOT required to read the supplementary material, the submission must stand alone without it. Attaching supplementary material is optional; if your paper says that you have formal proofs or source code, you need not attach them to convince the PC of their existence.

## Identity Blinding

The paper review process is double-blind. Authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves or their institutions either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). Submissions violating the detailed formatting and anonymization rules will be rejected without review. If you are uncertain about how to anonymize your submission, contact the program co-chairs, [osdi25chairs@usenix.org](mailto:osdi25chairs@usenix.org), well in advance of the submission deadline.

## Abstract Registration

Registering abstracts a week before paper submission is an essential part of the paper-reviewing process, as PC members use this time to identify which papers they are qualified to review. Abstract registrations that do not provide sufficient information to understand the topic and contribution (e.g., empty abstracts, placeholder abstracts, or trivial abstracts) will be rejected, thereby precluding paper submission.

## Conflicts

When registering your abstract, you must provide information about conflicts with PC members. A PC member is a conflict if and only if one or more of the following circumstances applies:

*   Institution: You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years (not counting concluded internships), or are going to begin employment at the same institution during the review period.
*   Advisor: You have a past or present association as thesis advisor or advisee.
*   Collaboration: You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, program co-chairship, or editorship within the past two years (December 2022 through December 2024).
*   Personal: You are close family relatives (spouses, domestic partners, parents, or children).

You must not identify a PC member as a conflict if none of these circumstances applies. For instance, the following are not sufficient grounds to specify a conflict with a PC member: they have reviewed the work before, they are employed by your competitor, they are your friend, they were your post-doc advisor or advisee, or they had the same advisor as you.

The chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding or removing conflicts if necessary. The chairs may reject abstracts or papers on the basis of missing or extraneous conflicts. If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program co-chairs.

Authors are also encouraged to contact the program co-chairs, [osdi25chairs@usenix.org](mailto:osdi25chairs@usenix.org), if needed to relate their OSDI submissions to relevant submissions of their own that are simultaneously under review or awaiting publication at other venues. The program co-chairs will use this information at their discretion to preserve the anonymity of the review process without jeopardizing the outcome of the current OSDI submission.

Papers must be in PDF format and must be submitted via the [submission system](https://osdi25.usenix.hotcrp.com/). For more details on the submission process, and for templates to use with LaTeX, Word, etc., authors should consult the detailed [submission requirements](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi25/requirements-authors).

## SUBMIT YOUR WORK

[https://osdi25.usenix.hotcrp.com/](https://osdi25.usenix.hotcrp.com/)

## Author Response Period

OSDI will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting, during the dates shown above. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments or data, describe additional work completed since submission, or promise additional work to follow.

Submission of a response is optional. The response can be of any length up to 2000 words. A shorter and crisper response is often advantageous, while a response longer than 2000 words is prohibited.

## Revise and Resubmit

OSDI '25 will continue the option to revise and resubmit for some of the rejected papers. If a paper is given this option as indicated in the notification, authors will be provided with a list of issues to address. Authors may then resubmit a revised version with a response to the issues. If accepted, the paper will be presented at OSDI '25."
