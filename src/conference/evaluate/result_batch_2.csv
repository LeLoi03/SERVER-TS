## Submission Information

Submissions should not exceed **17 pages, excluding bibliography**, in the Springer LNCS format. The LaTeX template is available at [Springer’s Information for Authors](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). The accepted papers will be allowed one extra page to accommodate reviewers’ feedback.

Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version -– for example, details of proofs -– may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. However, the paper must be understandable without the appendix. Reviewers are not obligated to review it.

Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers must be written in English. Accepted papers must be presented at the conference. For further details, please consult [Springer Nature Code of Conduct for Authors](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct).

Papers should be submitted via HotCRP: [https://aplas25.hotcrp.com/](https://aplas25.hotcrp.com/)

## Reviewing process

APLAS uses a light double-blind reviewing process, with a rebuttal phase, to address factual errors and minor misunderstandings. Reviewers will not see author names until they submit a review. Therefore, the authors must adhere to the following rules:

*   omit your names and institutions;
*   refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others;
*   omit the acknowledgments.

This process aims to help the reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. For more details, see the FAQ (on the OOPSLA submission site): [https://2025.splashcon.org/track/OOPSLA#faq](https://2025.splashcon.org/track/OOPSLA#faq).

The proceedings will be published as a volume in Springer’s LNCS series. Previous APLAS proceedings [https://link.springer.com/conference/aplas](https://link.springer.com/conference/aplas) can be found on SpringerLink. Authors interested in making their contributions Open Access, please refer to Springer’s webpage [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/open-access-publishing-in-computer-proceedings](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/open-access-publishing-in-computer-proceedings) for additional information, or contact the organizers.

## Best Paper Award

APLAS continues the tradition of the best paper award. The award will be announced on this website, and printed certificates will be issued to the authors at the conference.

## Submission Format

Submissions, in PDF, should start with a title page containing the title of the paper, each author's name, affiliation, and e-mail address, and a 1-2 paragraph abstract summarizing the paper's contributions. The title page should be followed by a technical exposition on single-spaced, single-column pages, letter-size paper, using page numbers, at least 1-inch margins all around, and at least 11-point font. The first 10 pages, following the title page, should contain a clear presentation of the main technical and conceptual ideas underlying the results, including the motivation behind the paper and a clear comparison with related work (not including the references). The submission should be accessible to a wide variety of researchers in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics. There is no page limit, but any material beyond the title page and the following 10 pages will be read at the sole discretion of the program committee.

Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which will be published before the end of the conference, will not be considered for acceptance. Simultaneous submission of the same (or an overlapping) paper to RANDOM/APPROX and to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed.

## Attendance Policy

At least one author of each accepted paper should attend the conference in person to present the work. An exception to this policy may be granted in case of unavoidable visa issues, in which case the paper will still be included in the proceedings, and a recorded talk video will be made available online, but the paper will not be given a presentation slot at the in-person event. Therefore, please make sure to make travel arrangements well in advance to attend the conference, especially if you need a visa for entering the United States of America.

## Proceedings

Accepted papers will be published in the online proceedings of the conference in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series, based at Schloss Dagstuhl. This guarantees perennial, free and easy electronic access, while the authors retain the rights over their work. We also expect that authors of accepted papers make a full version of their paper available online by the conference date.

## Evaluation Criteria

Technical research papers must not exceed **12 pages** (including references). Submissions will be evaluated by at least three program committee members. The evaluation will focus on the novelty, originality, importance to the field, proper use of research methods, and presentation of the submissions.

## Submission Instructions

Submitted papers must have been neither previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop.

All submissions must be in English and must come in A4 paper size PDF format and conform, at the time of submission, to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt font, LaTeX users must use \documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran} without including the compsoc or compsocconf option). Also, papers must comply with the IEEE Policy on Authorship. Submissions must be submitted electronically in PDF before the due date via HotCRP.

The Chairs reserve the right to reject submissions (without reviews) that are not in compliance or out of scope for the conference.

## Double Blind Policy

IMPORTANT: The APSEC 2025 technical research track will use a double-blind reviewing process, which means that submissions must not reveal the authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-blind reviewing process. Please read the APSEC 2025 double-blind instructions carefully before preparing your paper.

### Double-blind reviewing process instructions

*   Omit authors’ names and institutions from your title page.
*   References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not “We build on our previous work…” but rather “We build on the work of…”) 
*   There may be cases in which the current submission is a clear follow up of one of your previous work, and despite what recommended in the previous point, reviewers will clearly associate authorship of such a previous work to the current submission. In this case, you may decide to anonymize the reference itself at submission time. For example: “based on previous results [10]” .. where the reference is reported as “[10] Anonymous Authors. Omitted for double blind reviewing.” In doing so, however, please make sure that the APSEC 2025 submission is self-contained and its content can be reviewed and understood without accessing the previous paper.
*   Do not include acknowledgements of people, grants, organizations, etc. that would give away your identity. You may, of course, add these acknowledgements in the camera-ready version.
*   In general, aim to reduce the risk of accidental unblinding. For example, if you use an identifiable naming convention for your work, such as a project name, use a different name for your submission, which you may indicate has been changed for the purposes of double-blind reviewing. This includes names that may unblind individual authors and their institutions. For example, if your project is called GoogleDeveloperHelper, which makes it clear the work was done at Google, for the submission version, use the name DeveloperHelper or BigCompanyDeveloperHelper instead.
*   Avoid revealing the institution affiliations of authors or at which the work was performed. For example, if the evaluation includes a user study conducted with undergraduates from the CS 101 class that you teach, you might say “The study participants consist of 200 students in an introductory CS course.” You can of course add the institutional information in the camera-ready. Similar suggestions apply for work conducted in specific organizations (e.g., industrial studies). In such cases, avoid mentioning the organization’s name. Instead, you may just refer to the organization as “Org” or “Company”, etc. When appropriate and when this does not help too much in revealing the company’s name, you might mention the context (e.g., financial organization, video game development company, etc.).
*   APSEC 2025 believes in open science and that open science aids reproducibility and replicability. To improve these factors we encourage authors to consider disclosing the source code and datasets used within their paper, including extractors, survey data, etc. By sharing this information your contribution will be more impactful because others can follow up on your work and of course cite it. But please avoid linking directly to code repositories or tool deployments which can reveal your identity. Instead of doing so, please consider using services such as zenodo.org, figshare.com, which provide DOIs and support anonymous and semi-anonymous methods of archiving software and datasets. Archive.org is also recommended for the dissemination of larger datasets. These archived and anonymized datasets should be linked within the paper itself.

## Submission Instructions

Please read the instructions below before submitting your paper.

[SUBMIT YOUR PAPER HERE](https://asiaccs2025b.hotcrp.com/)

## Paper Formatting

Technical papers submitted for ASIACCS must be written in English. Papers must be in PDF format and at most **12 pages double-column**. We will allow up to 10 additional pages for the bibliography and well-marked appendices, but note that reviewers are not expected to read the appendices. Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest ACM Sigconf style conference template (available [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)). All fonts, images, tables, and figures must comply with common standards and not generate problems for reviewers. Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:” Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

## Conflicts of Interest

When submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs.

## Anonymous Submissions

ASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. Publishing the submission on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, is allowed but authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.

## Double and Concurrent Submissions

Submissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings. Double submission will result in immediate rejection.

## Ethical Considerations

The authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns.

## Early Rejection and Appeals

There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification email.

## Paper Revision and Resubmission

Rejected papers in the Cycle 1 cannot be resubmitted in the Cycle 2. A small number of the Cycle 1 submissions may receive a Revise decision, rather than Accept or Reject and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server.

## Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation

If a paper is accepted, the author list in the submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.

## Contact

For any questions related to paper submissions, please contact the PC chairs at [asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org](mailto:asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org)."

Asiacrypt 2025, organized by the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR), will take place in **Melbourne, Australia from December 8-12, 2025**, run by general chair Professor Joseph Liu. The proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. We solicit all original research papers on all aspects of cryptology for submission.

As a general IACR conference, we would like to be as inclusive as possible; in particular, a topic for any IACR area conference is a topic for Asiacrypt.

## How to submit

Author instructions for paper submission may be found on the submission page. Be aware that we are following [a new policy on use of AI tools by authors](aipolicy.php).

[Submit a paper](papersubmission.php)

## Important Dates

*   **May 16, 2025**: Submission deadline at 12:00 GMT
*   **Jul 13, 2025**: First round notification
*   **Jul 18, 2025**: Rebuttals due

*   **Dec 8, 2025**: Conference begins

## Schedule

Asiacrypt 2025 will operate a two-round review system with rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee selects a subset of submissions for further consideration in the second round, and the authors receive the first round notification with review comments. The authors of the selected submissions are invited to submit a text-based rebuttal letter to the review comments.

In the second round, the program committee further reviews the selected submissions by taking into account their rebuttal letter, acting on all answers of questions issued as pertinent to the decision. The PC chairs make the final decision of acceptance or rejection in consultation with the area chairs and the reviewers. Submissions that have not been selected during the first round of reviews may be resubmitted in other conferences after the first round notification date.

## Artifacts

In order to encourage open and reproducible research, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts associated with their papers, such as software or datasets, for review. The artifact review will be a collaborative process between authors and the artifact review committee. The goal of the process is not just to evaluate artifacts, but also to improve them for reproduction and reusability by the scientific community.

Artifacts that pass successfully through the artifact review process will be archived on IACR's artifact archive. With comparable merit, priority will be given to papers with machine-verified proofs.Please see the detailed call for artifacts (TBA). The Best Practical Paper must have an accepted artifact.

## Stipends & awards

Students whose papers have been accepted, who will present their talks at the conference, and contact the general chair in a timely fashion will have their registration waived. The primary source of information is the conference website, however, a limited number of stipends are available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students, whose papers are accepted and who will present the paper themselves, or from groups who are underrepresented at Asiacrypt at least in the last decade are especially encouraged to apply. Requests for stipends should go to the general chair.

The program chairs may in consultation with the PC choose to bestow two best (theory and practical) paper awards, and a best early-career paper award.

This prestigious forum brings together researchers and practitioners in the field of Business Process Management, covering computer science, information systems engineering, and management.","# BPM 2025: Call for Research Papers

The International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM) is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners in the field of BPM.

The conference embraces the interdisciplinary nature of BPM, bringing together contributions from the fields of computer science, information systems engineering, and information systems management.

The BPM conference is structured into three tracks: Foundations, Engineering, and Management. Each track has specific evaluation criteria, a separate track chair, and a dedicated program committee.

## Track I: Foundations

Track I invites papers that have a foundational nature, that is a formal, mathematical, algorithmic, or conceptual nature. Papers in this track are expected to focus on the underlying principles of BPM, computational theories, formal methods and algorithms for modeling, automating, analyzing, and optimizing business processes.

The typical audience for papers submitted to Track I are engineers who wish to build solutions on top of the presented formal methods and algorithms or the BPM community at large when it concerns new types of contributions.

## Track II: Engineering

Track II invites papers that deal with engineering aspects of BPM research. The focus is on the development and investigation of artifacts and systems that aim to solve concrete problems in business environments. This track covers tools and techniques for process modeling, the enactment of process models as well as process monitoring and analytics (including process mining techniques).

The typical audience for papers submitted to Track II are engineers who wish to analyze or further develop the artifact in question or analysts who wish to apply it in practice.

## Track III: Management

Track III invites papers that focus on the empirical, socio-technical, cognitive, psychological, managerial and societal aspects of BPM. This includes all techniques, tools, and methods that are employed in and across organizations to better govern business processes.

The typical audience for papers submitted to Track II are managers and decision makers who wish to draw lessons from what is presented.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

The BPM community is committed to the promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in all aspects of our professional activities.

## Open Science Principles

The BPM conference encourages authors of research papers to follow the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. The conference supports the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourages authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data in order to increase reproducibility and replicability.

Those accepted papers that include research artifacts or datasets available on a publicly accessible archival repository with a DOI will be awarded with an “Artifacts Available” badge that will be included in the camera-ready version of the paper.

## Submission

Each paper must be submitted to exactly one track. Papers must be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS formatting guidelines. Submissions must be in English and cannot exceed 16 pages including references and appendices. The title page must contain a short abstract clarifying the relation of the paper with the topics above.

Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the [BPM 2025 EasyChair submission site](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2025).

Submissions must be original contributions that have neither been published previously nor submitted to other conferences or journals while being submitted to BPM 2025.

BPM 2025 reviews are double blind. Thus, neither reviewers nor authors should be able to identify each other.

## Awards

The BPM conference will recognize the best papers submitted to the conference with an award in two different categories:

*   Best paper award
*   Best student paper award

Student papers must be clearly marked as such in the EasyChair system when submitting the paper and must be presented at the conference by a student author to be eligible for the best student paper award.

## BPM Forum

Papers that do not fully meet the quality criteria for the main conference, but make a significant contribution to the community, will be invited for presentation at the BPM Forum. Those papers will be published in full length in a separate post-proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP) series.

The International Conference on Cryptology and Network Security (CANS) is a premier forum for presenting research in the field of cryptology and network security. The conference seeks academic, industry, and government submissions on all theoretical and practical aspects of cryptology and network security, and its extended domains in modern computing systems. This year marks the 24th iteration of the conference and will be held in **Osaka, Japan**.

Proceedings of this year’s conference will be published by **Springer LNCS**; proceedings of previous iterations of the conference can be found online.

## Submission Guidelines

High-quality papers on unpublished research and implementation experiences may be submitted. All papers must be original and not substantially duplicated work that has been published at, or is simultaneously submitted to, a journal or another conference or workshop. All submissions must be written in English and span no more than **20 pages** in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format (a Springer template can be found in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)), including title, abstract, and bibliography. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level understandable by a non-expert reader and explain the context to related work.

Submitted papers may contain supplementary material in the form of well-marked appendices or a separate file archive (particularly for source code, data files, etc.). Note that supplementary material will not be included in the proceedings. Moreover, the main paper should be intelligible without requiring the reader to consult the supplementary material; the reviewers may optionally refer to the supplementary material, but are also permitted to base their assessment on the main paper alone.

Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper.

The conference will also consider short papers of up to **eight pages** in the LNCS format, excluding the bibliography (max 2 pages), for results that are not yet fully fleshed out or that simply require fewer pages to describe but still make a significant contribution.

All submissions must be processed with LaTeX2e according to the instructions given by Springer. Submitted manuscripts must be typeset in plain Springer LNCS format, in particular without changing the font size, margins or line spacing. Submissions not meeting these guidelines may be rejected without consideration of their merits.

Papers must be submitted via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cans2025). The deadline for registering new submissions is **April 28 anywhere on earth (AoE)**. Moreover, paper updates are permitted until **May 1st AoE**.

## Important Dates

*   Registration of new submissions permitted until: **April 28 AoE**
*   Updates of existing submissions permitted until: **May 1st AoE**
*   Notification: **10 July**
*   Camera-ready: **14 August**

## Presentation Requirements

At least one author of every accepted paper must register and pay the full registration fee (non-student) for the conference by the early registration deadline indicated by the organizers. Papers without a registered author will be removed from the sessions. Authors must present their own paper(s). Session proceedings, including all accepted papers, will be published in LNCS and will be available at the conference.

## Stipend

The CANS 2025 conference will offer a student grant program to partially support travel and accommodation expenses for full-time students. Eligibility is limited to students whose papers have been accepted, who have paid the conference fee, and who will present their paper at the conference in CANS 2025.

CC 2025 also features a second category of papers called 'Tools and Practical Experience'.","# CC 2025: Call for Papers

The ACM SIGPLAN 2025 International Conference on Compiler Construction (CC 2025) will be held in **Las Vegas, NV, USA, March 1 - 2, 2025**, co-located with CGO, PPoPP and HPCA.

CC 2025 is interested in work on processing programs in the most general sense: analyzing, transforming or executing input programs that describe how a system operates, including traditional compiler construction as a special case.

## Topics of Interest

Original contributions are solicited on topics of interest which include, but are not limited to:

*   Compilation and interpretation techniques, including program representation, analysis, and transformation; code generation, optimization, and synthesis; the verification thereof
*   Run-time techniques, including memory management, virtual machines, and dynamic and just-in-time compilation
*   Programming tools, including refactoring editors, checkers, verifiers, compilers, debuggers, and profilers
*   Techniques, ranging from programming languages to micro-architectural support, for specific domains such as secure, parallel, distributed, embedded or mobile environments
*   Design and implementation of novel language constructs, programming models, and domain-specific languages
*   Implications to compiler construction from emerging or non-conventional applications (e.g., deep learning, quantum computing, DNA computing, etc.)

## Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers

CC will offer a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies. The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper. Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.

The selection criteria for papers in this category are:

*   Originality
*   Usability
*   Documentation
*   Benchmark Repository
*   Availability
*   Foundations
*   Artifact Evaluation: Mandatory for Tool Papers

Tool and Practical Experience papers abide by the same limit of 10 pages in the ACM format, references excluded, and are not distinguished in the final proceedings.

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Submission site:** [https://cc25.hotcrp.com](https://cc25.hotcrp.com)
*   All submissions must be made electronically through the conference submission website and include an abstract (100–400 words), author contact information, the full list of authors and their affiliations. Full paper submissions must be in PDF formatted printable on US letter size paper.
*   All papers must be prepared in ACM Conference Format using the 2-column acmart format: use the options `\documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart}` for Latex, and `interim-layout.docx` for Word. The Word template (interim-layout.docx) on the ACM website uses 9pt font; you need to increase it to 10pt.
*   Papers should contain a maximum of 10 pages of text (in a typeface no smaller than 10 point) or figures, NOT INCLUDING references. There is no page limit for references and they must include the name of all authors (do not use et al.).
*   Appendices are not allowed, but the authors may submit anonymous supplementary material, such as proofs, source code, or data sets; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.

## Double-Blind Reviewing Process

CC uses a double-blind reviewing process. Authors will need to identify any potential conflicts of interest with PC, as defined in the SIGPLAN policy.

To facilitate the double-blind reviewing process, submissions (including supplementary material) should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).

## Artifact Evaluation

Authors are encouraged to submit their artifacts for the Artifact Evaluation (AE). The Artifact Evaluation process begins after the acceptance notification, and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers.

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.

## Important Dates
*   **Submission deadline:** Tue 5 Nov 2024
*   **Author notification:** Wed 11 Dec - Fri 13 Dec 2024
*   **Artifact Submission Deadline:** Fri 17 Jan 2025
*   **Camera-Ready Deadline:** Fri 24 Jan 2025

**Submission Deadline:** Friday, February 7, 2025, 23:59 AoE

## Scope

The conference seeks original research papers in all areas of computational complexity theory, studying the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints. Contributions are welcomed from all topics with connections to or motivated by questions in complexity theory, broadly construed. Submissions that address complexity-theoretic issues in complexity-adjacent areas such as coding theory, cryptography, game theory, learning, logic and privacy are especially encouraged.

Possible topics include but are not limited to:

*   Complexity classes
*   Reducibility and completeness
*   Circuit complexity
*   Communication complexity
*   Algebraic complexity
*   Proof complexity
*   Complexity in other concrete computational models
*   Interactive and probabilistic proof systems
*   Logic and descriptive complexity
*   Pseudorandomness and derandomization
*   Average case complexity
*   Quantum computation
*   Parametrized complexity
*   Fine-grained complexity
*   Complexity-theoretic aspects of:
    *   coding theory
    *   cryptography
    *   optimization (including inapproximability, continuous optimization)
    *   property testing
    *   streaming and sublinear computation
    *   distributed computation
    *   game theory
    *   machine learning
    *   privacy

## Submission

**Deadlines:** Papers must be submitted electronically via the submission server [here](https://ccc2025.hotcrp.com/), and received by **Friday, February 7, 2025, 23:59 AoE**. Notification of acceptance will be sent by **Friday, May 2, 2025**, and final camera-ready copies of accepted papers will be due **end of May, 2025**.

**Format:** Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper and an abstract of 1-2 paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. A submission must contain within its first 10 pages a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including discussion of its importance, prior work, and an outline of key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims (similar to the content of a brief oral presentation). There is no bound on the total length of a submission, but material other than the abstract, references, and the first 10 pages is considered as supplementary and will be read at the committee's discretion.

Submissions should include proofs of all central claims.

The submission should be in single-column format, use at least 11-point font, at least 1-inch margins, and at least single-spacing between lines. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Instructions for formatting camera-ready versions will be communicated to the authors of accepted papers.

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. (Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.) The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without unconscious bias, and is not intended to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may (and are in fact encouraged to) post their papers to arXiv/ECCC/IACR etc.

**Additional remarks:** In addition to the submission, authors may optionally send a short email to the program committee (PC) chair at [ccc2025chair@gmail.com](mailto:ccc2025chair@gmail.com) containing any additional remarks for the PC, such as the relationship with independent/concurrent work, differences from prior versions, conflict of interest statements, or clarifications concerning prior reviews of the work. Submissions involving PC members are not allowed.

**Conflict of interest:** We expect PC members and reviewers to recuse themselves from the evaluation of any submission, if they would not be able to give an objective opinion due to some conflict of interest (COI). Some examples why a COI may arise are being a thesis advisor, being an immediate family member or close friend, sharing a recent institutional affiliation or being a close collaborator. Any author may write to the PC chair at [ccc2025chair@gmail.com](mailto:ccc2025chair@gmail.com) if there is a COI that may not be covered by the above measure, such as significant interactions that would suggest the inability to assess a paper objectively. They need only give the names and affiliations of the people with whom a COI exists; no explanation is required. The COI will be held in confidence by the PC chair.

**Simultaneous submission policy:** Material which has been previously published in a journal or another conference proceedings, or which is scheduled for publication prior to September 2025, will not be considered for acceptance. Simultaneous submission of the same or essentially the same material to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed.

**Confidentiality:** All submissions will be treated as confidential and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees.

## Publication

**Online posting:** Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible on-line repository such as the [Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity](http://eccc.hpi-web.de/eccc) or the arXiv. It is hoped that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers publicly available by the camera-ready deadline.

**Proceedings:** The conference proceedings will be published under a Creative Commons BY license in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series. Publication in the conference proceedings does not preclude subsequent journal publication.

**Presentation:** Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the conference. The program committee will determine time allocations for presentations (between 15 and 45 minutes).

## Awards

**EATCS Luca Trevisan award for the CCC best student paper:** This award will be given to the best paper written solely by one or more students as judged by the program committee. A paper is eligible if all authors are full-time students on the day of the submission deadline. Authors should indicate their eligibility by using the check-box for this on the submissions page. The program committee may decline to make the award or may split it among several papers. Funding for the best student paper award is provided by EATCS.

**Best paper award:** This award will be given to the best paper submitted to the conference as judged by the program committee. The program committee may decline to make the award or may split it among two or more papers. Full versions of the papers chosen by the program committee to receive the best paper award will be invited for submission to the Journal of the ACM.

**Special journal issue:** The program committee will invite full versions of a select number of conference submissions to a special issue of the journal Computational Complexity.

## Conference Information

**Dates and location:** The conference will be held from **Tuesday, August 5 to Friday, August 8, 2025** in **Toronto, Canada**. The details of the conference format will be posted in due course.

**Travel allowances:** In order to defray the costs of attending the conference, travel allowances will be offered to students and post-doctoral fellows. More information will be made available on the conference webpage in due time.

**Visas:** A visa for Canada may be needed for attending the conference, e.g., for citizens of China, India, and Russia. See the visa website of the Canadian government for the exact rules for short-term stay visas. If a visa is needed, please get in touch with your local Canadian consulate as soon as possible; the whole process may take several months. Feel free to contact the local arrangements committee if you need a letter to obtain your visa.

**Code of conduct:** CCC 2025 is a participant in the SafeTOC initiative. The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of CCC. These require an environment that recognizes every person and group's inherent worth; fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect; and embraces diversity. The CCC'25 organizers are committed to providing an environment free of discrimination and harassment and expect all participants to honor that commitment.
