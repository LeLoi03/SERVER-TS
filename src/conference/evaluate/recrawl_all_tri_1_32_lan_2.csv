Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the SIGCHI Submission and Review Policy.

## Paper Guidelines Regarding Scope

In general, contributions must have a focus on social aspects of technology mediation and be properly contextualized in the CSCW literature.

Authors should clearly answer yes to the following:

*   Does your work build upon, bridge, discuss, or cite prior CSCW work in a significant manner? Does it make clear how it offers new knowledge of benefit to the CSCW community?
*   Have you clearly elaborated on how the results of your work are useful for thinking about the design of computing technologies to support cooperative/collaborative work or social interactions?

## Anonymous Review Policy

Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors' names and affiliations removed.

## Formatting and Length

Word authors: Use the ACM Small template, which is ONLY available at the following link: [https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates)

LaTeX authors: Use the template at [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions), and insert the acmsmall call.

Overleaf authors: Use the template at [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf), and use the acmsmall call.

Papers that use a completely different template will be desk rejected.

If a paper is shorter than 5000 words or exceeds 12,000 words, it will be submitted to additional scrutiny. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be desk rejected.

## Review Process

CSCW 2026 adopts a tiered review process. This tiered review process aims to ensure the quality of reviews while managing the increasing load.

## Policy on Use of Large Language Models in Writing Papers

Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) before you use these tools.

## Policy on Irresponsible Reviews

LLMs are NOT allowed to be used for writing the reviews nor the meta-reviews at any step. You cannot use an LLM to write your review.

## Decisions and Deadlines

CSCW will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, roughly 2-4 months from the initial submission (depending on the decision):

*   Conditional Accept with Minor Changes
*   Revise and Resubmit
*   Reject
*   Assisted Desk Reject

ICMI is a multidisciplinary forum that brings together multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) and social interaction research. The conference theme for 2025 is \'Safe and Responsible Multimodal Interactions\'.","# ICMI 2025: Call for Papers

The 27th International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (ICMI 2025) will be held in **Canberra, Australia**.

ICMI is the premier international forum for advancing research at the intersection of multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) and social interaction. Multimodal AI addresses technical challenges in machine learning and computational modelling, such as representations, data fusion, system design, and large-scale data management. Social interaction research encompasses both human-human interactions and human-computer interactions to uncover insights that bridge behavioural understanding with technology. A unique aspect of ICMI is its multidisciplinary nature which values both scientific discoveries and technical innovations, with an eye towards impactful applications that benefit people and society.

## Novelty

Novelty will be evaluated along two dimensions: scientific novelty and technical novelty. Accepted papers at ICMI 2025 must demonstrate novelty in at least one of these dimensions:

*   **Scientific Novelty:** Papers should contribute new scientific insights into human social interactions, including human-computer interactions. Authors are expected to conduct a thorough literature review and clearly articulate the scientific advancements and discoveries presented in their work.
*   **Technical Novelty:** Papers should introduce innovations in their computational approach for recognising, generating or modelling multimodal data. Novelty may also arise from creative and impactful new applications of existing methodologies.

## Ethical Conduct

Commitment to ethical conduct is mandatory and submissions must adhere to ethical standards in particular when human-derived data are employed. Authors are encouraged to consult the [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://ethics.acm.org/).

## ICMI 2025 Conference Theme: Safe and Responsible Multimodal Interactions

The focus is on exploring how multimodal systems and multimodal interactive applications can support safe, ethical, and inclusive interactions across diverse contexts, ensuring that advancements in multimodal AI and interaction technologies align with societal values and address pressing global challenges.

This theme emphasizes the importance of developing systems that prioritize users’ well-being, trust, and fairness. It calls for addressing critical issues such as bias mitigation, ensuring transparency in decision-making processes, and upholding privacy and security in handling multimodal data. Researchers are encouraged to explore innovative approaches that promote inclusivity and accessibility for underrepresented communities and vulnerable populations, fostering a more equitable digital future.

Furthermore, the theme highlights the role of multimodal AI in addressing real-world safety concerns, such as building reliable systems for mental health monitoring, assisting vulnerable users (e.g., children, elderly individuals, or those with disabilities), and supporting safety-critical applications, including healthcare, education, and autonomous systems.

The conference encourages the further development and application of model-based techniques for the construction and analysis of software and systems.,"# MODELSWARD 2026: Call for Papers

The International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering and Software Development provides a platform for participants from all over the world to present research results and application experience in using model-based techniques for developing all sorts of systems. Model-based software engineering has emerged over many years as an approach for developing IT systems in which models take a central role, not only for the analysis of these systems but also for their construction. More recently, a similar approach has become increasingly widely used not only for software systems, but also for physical, cyber-physical and business systems. This model-based software and systems engineering approach relies on an increasingly rich ecosystem of techniques, languages and tools. MODELSWARD is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners alike to come together and discuss, moving this ecosystem forward.

## Scope

This conference aims at fostering the further development and application of model-based techniques for the construction and analysis of software and systems. Papers reporting on original work in any of the areas listed below are welcome. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors will be published in the MODELSWARD proceedings. The submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three experts in this area, and acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. The conference is open to full research and (short) work-in-progress papers. Sessions are planned for both oral and poster presentations.

## Best Paper Award and Editorial Follow-Up

The best paper will receive the prestigious Mark Weiser Best Paper Award.

Selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions for a special issue of the Pervasive and Mobile Computing Journal.

## Submission Details

Paper submission must be done for the main conference and all associated events via EDAS. If you do not have an EDAS account, please, register first (it’s free) via the following link: [register](register). The direct submission link for PerCom 2026 is [here](here).

PerCom 2026 will follow a double-blind review process. Authors are expected to make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions. In particular, as in previous PerCom editions, publishing pre-prints of your submitted papers in online archives (e.g., arXiv) prior to submission does NOT disqualify the paper from consideration at PerCom. Moreover, we instruct reviewers NOT to go searching for pre-prints of submitted papers.

Submitted papers must be unpublished and not considered elsewhere for publication. Also, they must show a significant relevance to pervasive computing and communications. Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous review process handled by the Technical Program Committee. Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered.

The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as formatting instructions, can be found [here](here). Papers must be at most 9 pages of technical content (10pt font, 2-column format), including text, figures, and tables, and up to 1 additional page for references only.

PerCom 2026 introduces a rebuttal phase to further improve the quality of the review process. Authors are offered the opportunity to respond to the initial reviews. Particularly, they are encouraged to briefly clarify points, explain misunderstandings, etc.

PerCom would not be PerCom without its community. For this reason, we are looking for ways to strengthen the community and encourage meaningful interactions. To this end, all accepted papers must be presented in person by one of the authors, in addition to having an associated full registration. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the exclusion of the paper from the final proceedings and from the IEEE Digital Library, and the paper will not be eligible for the Best Paper Award.

We strongly advise authors of submitted papers to be prepared to apply for their visa (if required for entry into Italy) as soon as their paper is accepted.

Accepted papers will be published in IEEE Xplore. All accepted papers will be invited to submit an artifact abstract providing the code, data, results, etc. associated with the contribution.
