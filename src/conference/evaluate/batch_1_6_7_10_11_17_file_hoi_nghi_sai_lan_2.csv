From 2017, FSE has adopted an **open-access journal/conference hybrid model**. Submitted articles undergo a journal-style reviewing process. Accepted papers are published in **Gold Open Access** (free availability from day one) by the Ruhr University of Bochum in an issue of the newly established journal **IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology (ToSC)**.

The yearly FSE event consists of presentations of articles accepted to the journal IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology, as well as invited talks and social activities. This model improves reviewing and publication quality while retaining the highly successful community event FSE. For further information, please view the [ToSC FAQ page](https://tosc.iacr.org/FAQ).

For FSE 2025, authors can submit papers to the IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology **four times a year**, every three months on a predictable schedule. Authors are notified of the decisions about two months after submission. In addition to accept and reject decisions, papers may be provided with ""minor revision"" decisions (conditionally accepted with shepherd verification) or ""major revision"" decisions (invited to revise and resubmit to one of the following two submission deadlines, otherwise treated as a new submission).

**Papers accepted for publication before the end of January 2025 will be presented at FSE 2025.** It is mandatory that accepted papers at the IACR Transactions on Symmetric Cryptology journal are presented at the corresponding FSE event.

The 45th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (IEEE ICDCS 2025) is the premier international forum for researchers and practitioners to present, discuss, and exchange cutting-edge ideas as well as the latest findings on topics related to all aspects of distributed computing systems. The conference will be held over **July 20-23, 2025, in Glasgow, Scotland, UK**.

We invite you to submit original contributions to IEEE ICDCS 2025.

## Scope and Tracks

Papers can be submitted to one of the following tracks:

*   **Cloud Computing**
*   **Distributed Algorithms**
*   **Big Data, Models & Systems**
*   **Distributed Fault Tolerance**
*   **Distributed OS and Middleware**
*   **Edge Computing**
*   **IoT + CPS**
*   **Mobile Computing**
*   **Security, Privacy and Trust**
*   **Blockchains/Databases**
*   **Distributed Systems for AI/ML**
*   **AI/ML for Distributed Systems**
*   **Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures**

## Paper Submission Guidelines

The paper strand provides the opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.

Papers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere. All paper submissions should follow the **IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format** using **10pt fonts** and the **IEEE Conference template** (downloadable by selecting “Conferences” in the [IEEE-Template Selector](https://template-selector.ieee.org/)). Each submission can have up to **eleven (11) pages** (including figures, tables, appendices, and references). Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review.

### Double-Blind Review Process

The paper review process is **double-blind**. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content.

### Reproducibility

To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymised GitHub repository with all source code, scripts and data needed for the reproduction of their results.

### Registration and Presentation

For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a full author registration and attend the conference in-person to present their work on-site. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.

### IEEE Policies

> Note that all authors and contributors should adhere to ethics and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer to [IEEE Code of Ethics](https://www.ieee.org/about/corporate/governance/p7-8.html) and [IEEE Policy on AI-Generated Text](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/#ai-generated-text).

### Post-Conference Publication Opportunity

A set of highly selected IEEE ICDCS 2025 papers will be considered for publication in the **IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS)**. The selected papers will undergo an extension process, transforming them from their initial IEEE ICDCS conference format. These extended versions will then be subject to a review by an editor from IEEE TPDS.

## Paper Submission

Authors can submit their work in the form of a **complete paper** or an **abstract**. Please note that accepted abstracts are presented but not published in the proceedings of the conference.

Complete papers can be submitted as a **Regular Paper**, representing completed and validated research, or as a **Position Paper**, portraying a short report of work in progress or an arguable opinion about an issue discussing ideas, facts, situations, methods, procedures or results of scientific research focused on one of the conference topic areas.

Authors should submit a paper in English, carefully checked for correct grammar and spelling, addressing one or several of the conference areas or topics. Each paper should clearly indicate the nature of its technical/scientific contribution, and the problems, domains or environments to which it is applicable.

To facilitate the **double-blind paper evaluation method**, authors are kindly requested to produce and provide the paper **WITHOUT any reference to any of the authors**, including the authors’ personal details, the acknowledgments section of the paper and any other reference that may disclose the authors’ identity.

Only original papers should be submitted. Authors are advised to read INSTICC's ethical norms regarding plagiarism and self-plagiarism thoroughly before submitting and must make sure that their submissions do not substantially overlap work which has been published elsewhere or simultaneously submitted to a journal or another conference with proceedings. Papers that contain any form of plagiarism will be rejected without reviews. Authors should also avoid using an excessive number of self-citations.

All papers must be submitted through the online submission platform PRIMORIS and should follow the instructions and templates that can be found under [Guidelines and Templates](https://www.insticc.org/Portal/Submissions/Guidelines.aspx).

*   Only `.pdf` or `.doc` files will be accepted for paper submission.
*   Final author manuscripts will be 8.5"" x 11"", not exceeding **6 pages**; max **4 extra pages** allowed at additional cost.
*   **Helpful information for paper formatting for MS Word** can be found [here](https://www.scitepress.org/Documents/ICSOFT.docx).
*   **LaTeX Template:** There is a community provided LaTeX template: the CTAN package `iaria` (with full IARIA formatting rules, including IARIA citation style, but for providing citation style it is tightly bound to `pdflatex+biblatex+biber`). In addition, there is also `iaria-lite` (not bound to `pdflatex+biblatex+biber`, but compatible with any TeX stack; thus, it cannot provide the IARIA citation formattings, but only the titlepage and content-related IARIA formatting rules). Based on the `iaria` package, there is a [minimal working example as Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/iaria-template/wzgygjjqbqnj). When you are using the LaTeX templates, please still adhere to the [additional editorial rules](https://www.iaria.org/instructions/editorialrules.html).
*   Slides-based contributions can use the corporate/university format and style.
*   Your paper should also comply with the [additional editorial rules](https://www.iaria.org/instructions/editorialrules.html).

## Publications

All accepted complete papers will be published in the conference proceedings, under an ISBN reference, on paper and on digital support.

SCITEPRESS is a member of CrossRef ([http://www.crossref.org/](http://www.crossref.org/)) and every paper on our digital library is given a DOI (Digital Object Identifier).

SAT 2025, the 28th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing, invites submissions that cover all aspects of the theory and applications of propositional satisfiability broadly construed. This includes paradigms such as Boolean optimization using, e.g., MaxSAT and pseudo-Boolean (PB) solving, quantified Boolean formulas (QBF), satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), model counting, constraint programming (CP), and integer linear programming (ILP) for problems with clear connections to Boolean-level reasoning.

The conference will be held from **August 12-15, 2025**, with workshops on **August 10-11**, at the **University of Glasgow in Glasgow, Scotland**.

## Scope

SAT 2025 is the 28th edition of the International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing. The scope includes all aspects of the theory and applications of propositional satisfiability broadly construed. This includes paradigms such as Boolean optimization using, e.g., MaxSAT and pseudo-Boolean (PB) solving, quantified Boolean formulas (QBF), satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), model counting, constraint programming (CP), and integer linear programming (ILP) for problems with clear connections to Boolean-level reasoning.

This year, the **31st International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (CP)** will be co-located with SAT and will have synchronized deadlines and reviewing processes. The **SAT/SMT/AR summer school** will take place **August 6 - 8 in St. Andrews**.

### Topics of Interest

Topics of interest for the SAT 2025 conference include but are not limited to:

*   Theoretical advances (including algorithms, proof complexity, parameterized complexity, and other complexity issues)
*   Practical search algorithms
*   Knowledge compilation
*   Implementation-level details of SAT and SMT solving tools and SAT/SMT-based systems
*   Problem encodings and reformulations
*   Applications (including both novel applications domains and improvements to existing approaches)
*   Case studies and reports on scientific findings based on rigorous experimentation

### Out of Scope

Papers claiming to resolve significant long-standing open problems in mathematics or computer science (such as those for which a Millennium Prize is offered) are outside the scope of the conference, since there is insufficient time in the schedule to referee such papers. Instead, works of such importance should be submitted to an appropriate scientific journal for in-depth technical review.

## Paper Categories

Submissions to SAT 2025 are invited in the following three categories:

*   **Long papers:** (9 to 15 pages, excluding references and appendices)
*   **Short papers:** (up to 8 pages, excluding references and appendices)
*   **Tool papers:** (up to 8 pages, excluding references and appendices)

Long and short papers should contain original research with sufficient detail to assess the merits and relevance of the contribution. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their data and implementation available with the submission of papers reporting experimental results, and for theoretical papers a technical appendix or supplementary material should contain sufficient details to allow verification of the main claims. Submissions on applications and case studies are encouraged. Such papers should describe the details of the proposed approaches in sufficient depth, including their weaknesses and strengths, but they are not necessarily expected to introduce novel solving methods.

Long and short papers will be evaluated with the same quality standards and are expected to contain a similar contribution-per-page ratio. The authors should choose between a long or a short paper depending on the space they need to describe their contribution fully. The classification between long and short papers impacts the duration of the presentation slot for the work allocated during the conference. It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that their paper is self-contained within the chosen page limit, and there will be no reclassification of submissions by the PC.

Tool papers are expected to report on the design and implementation of a tool and its novel features. Here “tool” is interpreted broadly, including descriptions of solvers, preprocessors, et cetera, and systems that exploit SAT solvers or their extensions for use in a relevant problem domain. Papers describing tools with previously published tool papers have been published are expected to contain significant and clear enhancements to the tool.

## Submission

Submissions should not be under review or submitted elsewhere while under review for SAT 2025, and should not consist of previously published material. Submissions not consistent with these guidelines may be returned without review.

Submissions should be made via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sat2025).

Papers must be formatted in the LIPIcs LaTeX style, available [here](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author). Submissions must be made electronically in the form of PDF files. The reviewing process for SAT 2025 is **single-blind**. For reporting and managing conflicts of interest, SAT 2025 will use the ACM CoI policy.

Authors may submit a supplement containing detailed proofs, examples, software, detailed experimental data, or other material related to the submission to be consulted at the discretion of the reviewers. Supplements will be treated with the same degree of confidentiality as the submitted manuscript.

One author of each accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference.

Submissions can only be withdrawn before the author response period begins. No withdrawals will be allowed after the preliminary reviews have been communicated to the authors.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract registration:** March 24, 2025, 23:59 AoE
*   **Full paper submission:** April 3, 2025, 23:59 AoE
