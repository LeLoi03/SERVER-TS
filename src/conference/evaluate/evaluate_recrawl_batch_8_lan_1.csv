Its small workshop format is ideal for processing and discussing new directions or controversial approaches.

## Call for Papers (Full Papers)

We solicit submissions of papers that (1) focus primarily on systems and applications and (2) propose new directions of research, advocate non-traditional approaches to old (or new) ideas, or generate controversy and discussion. We especially encourage papers that identify fundamental open questions, advocate a new approach, offer a constructive critique of the state-of-the-art, debunk existing assumptions, report unexpected early results, report on promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Novel ideas need not be supported by full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations suffice. The program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion over a “6-pages conference paper.”

## Submission Guidelines & Policies

All paper submissions must adhere to several important aspects:

### Final Submission Mindset

Submitting papers for review that are not yet complete and polished abuses the review process and is disrespectful to the Program Committee and the Computer Architecture community. All authors must affirm that their submission is, to the best of their abilities, complete, polished, and ready for comprehensive review. Furthermore, if all reviewers of a submission find that the submission is lacking in this regard, detailed reviewer feedback will be withheld from the authors. In other words, there is a cost to submitting unfinished work – it may “poison” future reviews without the authors gaining any feedback.

### Reviewer Continuity Initiative

HPCA 2026 is considering an initiative to maintain reviewer continuity for submitted papers that were rejected from MICRO 2025 on an opt-in basis. The goal for this initiative is to improve the fairness of the overall review process in Computer Architecture. It is in the best interest of authors and the community to have papers undergo a consistent revision process. However, please do not feel pressured to participate in this initiative, reviewers will not be made aware of your choice implicitly or explicitly.

If all authors of a submission opt in to the “reviewer continuity initiative”, reviewers who had previously reviewed a version of the submission for MICRO 2025 may be explicitly assigned to review the submission (PC members also must opt in to this initiative). If the authors do not opt in for “reviewer continuity”, reviewers of previous submissions may still be assigned to review the submitted version of the paper based on reviewer expertise, reviewer load balance, and other similar agnostic criteria.

### Revision Letters

If a submission has been previously reviewed and rejected from another venue or conference and is now being submitted to HPCA 2026, the authors must provide a letter explaining how the paper has been revised for this current submission, regardless of whether the authors opt to participate in “reviewer continuity” or not. Authors may choose to only permit the PC Chairs to have access and knowledge of this letter. Authors who opt in for reviewer continuity implicitly make their revision letter available to reviewers who reviewed a prior version for MICRO 2025. Note that it is not a requirement that papers be revised before being submitted to HPCA, but we expect a revision letter nonetheless.

### Abstract Registration and Final Submission

Authors must register an abstract one week before the paper submission deadline. The purpose is to ensure that authors are fully aware of all submission requirements, topic selection, conflict of interest registration, etc. All information regarding the submission may be edited up to final submission time but may not change once the review process has started. In particular, authorship at submission time must match that of the final publication, if accepted.

### Formatting and Submission Instructions

Detailed formatting and submission instructions will be made available on the submission site ([http://hpca2026.hotcrp.com](http://hpca2026.hotcrp.com)) at a later date.",

## Paper Submission Categories

Submissions can be made in one of the following two categories:

1.  **Regular Papers:** Primary focus should be on new research ideas supported by experimental implementation and evaluation.
2.  **Open-Source Tools and Data Papers:** Primary focus should be on the design, development, and evaluation of new open-source tools or novel data sources.

Authors are required to indicate the category as a part of the submitted manuscript's title, using ""Paper Type: Regular"" or ""Paper Type: Open-source tools and data paper"". Submissions in both categories will be evaluated to the same standards.

## ACM Publication

Papers accepted and presented at HPDC 2025 will be published in the ACM Digital Library at no additional cost to the authors.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Technical papers should be at most **11 pages** in PDF format, excluding references. Accepted papers may use an additional page for camera-ready to incorporate reviewer feedback.
*   Papers should be formatted in the ACM Proceedings Style (using `sigconf` from [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)).
*   Submitted papers must be original work that has not appeared in and is not under consideration for another conference or journal.

## Anonymizing Submissions

HPDC uses dual-anonymous reviewing. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication.

*   The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of author names.
*   Reference your past work in the third person, as you would any other piece of related work.
*   If your submission extends a previous workshop paper or relates to a submission under review, cite the other work anonymously and email the deanonymized work to the PC chairs.
*   If reporting on system experiences at your institution, refer to the system anonymously but describe necessary properties. Consider describing frameworks using a different name and not sharing open-source code repositories if they are widely used.

## arXiv Submission Policy

Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit submission to HPDC. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and do not count as prior work. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title and do not revise the arXiv version during the review period).

## Author List After Acceptance

The author list cannot be changed after acceptance.

## Conflict of Interest Declaration

All authors must indicate their conflict of interest (institutional, collaborative, or personal) with PC members at the time of submission. Refer to the submission website for detailed guidelines.

## HPDC Policy on the use of AI

*   HPDC permits the use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly) for language rectification.
*   Authors must verify the accuracy of AI-generated results.
*   AI tools are not eligible for authorship.
*   The use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section, citing the AI system used. The acknowledgments section must still follow dual-anonymous guidelines.

## ACM Policy on Authorship

Refer to the ACM Policy on Authorship and the ACM's frequently asked questions page for policies on generative AI tools.

## Contact PC Chairs

*   Ivona Brandić (ivona.brandic@tuwien.ac.at)
*   Robert Wisniewski (bobww123@gmail.com)

## Submissions

Submit via the HPDC Submission Site: [HPDC Submission Site](https://hpdc.sci.utah.edu/)

## Suggestions for Document Preparation for Authors

Authors are encouraged to structure their introduction section as follows:

*   **Motivation:** Clearly state the objective and provide quantitative support for the problem.
*   **Limitation of state-of-art approaches:** Review prior works, articulate limitations, and explain novelty.
*   **Key insights and contributions:** Articulate major insights, specify novelty, describe key ideas, and list contributions.
*   **Experimental methodology and artifact availability:** Specify infrastructure, methodological details, and indicate artifact availability.
*   **Limitations of the proposed approach:** Clearly articulate major limitations and sensitive conclusions.

## Ethical Considerations

If research describes a new security-related attack, consider responsible disclosure. Papers should follow ethical principles and not alter security/privacy/equality expectations of users.

## Inclusive Description of Research Contributions

Consider using gender-neutral pronouns, diverse examples, and making the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

## Overview

The Thirty-Seventh Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence (IAAI-26) is a premier venue for novel studies of AI deployments in real-world applications. IAAI-26 features technical papers, best practices, invited talks, and panel discussions that explore challenges, methodologies, and lessons learned from the practical use of AI. Submissions should focus on applied AI; purely theoretical work and algorithmic descriptions are more suited for AAAI-26.

IAAI-26 seeks novel contributions in the following areas:

1.  **Deployed Applications** showcasing the novel use of AI with measurable benefits, best practices and lessons learned.
2.  **Innovative Applications of AI** on trajectory for full deployment.
3.  **Tools and Methodologies** that accelerate safer AI development and deployment and analysis of factors contributing to failures, incidents and their mitigation.

## Dates and Location

*   **Dates:** January 20 – January 27, 2026
*   **Location:** Singapore
*   **Collocated with:** AAAI-26

## Tracks and Topics

### 1. Deployed Highly Innovative Applications of AI

Papers submitted to this track must describe deployed applications that demonstrate measurable benefits through innovative use of AI technology. An application is considered deployed once it is in production and used by end-users, with meaningful data collected on its performance. Submissions may focus on either standalone applications or components of larger systems. Papers will be evaluated based on the quality of the problem description, AI approach, innovation in AI use, measurable improvements, deployment details, and lessons learned during development, deployment, and maintenance. In-depth algorithm descriptions are better suited for AAAI. Each accepted paper will receive the IAAI ‘Innovative Application’ Certificate Award.

*   **Page Limit:** 8 pages (excluding references and appendices).
*   **Format:** AAAI style and formatting guidelines.

### 2. Emerging Applications of AI

The Emerging Applications track focuses on novel applications of AI methods to real-world problems that are not yet fully deployed. Submissions should demonstrate potential for future deployment, addressing emerging engineering or sociotechnical challenges and their practical relevance. Papers will be evaluated on problem significance, innovation, AI methodology, technical quality, and clarity, with a clear path toward deployment. The Emerging Track is more selective than the Deployed Track, allowing papers that have not yet been fully deployed.

*   **Page Limit:** 6 pages (excluding references and appendices).
*   **Format:** AAAI style and formatting guidelines.

### 3. Tools and Methodologies for Moving Faster and Safer

Within this track, we solicit papers describing deployed tools, practices, policies, and methods improving applied AI innovation and deployment of AI systems. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   Incident Analysis: Analysis of development and deployment processes and artifacts, focusing on real-world harms resulting from one or more AI incidents.
*   Incident Trend Analysis: Analyze trends in AI incidents to identify unresolved challenges in the deployment of AI systems.
*   Incident Best Practices: Detail best practices in producing and deploying systems to prevent or mitigate AI incidents.
*   Deployed Process Organization: Tools that help manage and assure the development, evaluation, or deployment of AI systems.
*   Deployed Data Hygiene and Data Quality Tools: Tools designed to address challenges in processing raw data for use in AI systems.
*   Deployed Meta-Optimization: Tools for enhancing AI systems through algorithm configurators, algorithm portfolios, and hyperparameter optimization.
*   Deployed novel computational models: Tools to exploit new computational hardware, such as neuromorphic processors, quantum computers, and other application-specific AI chips and systems.

Papers will be evaluated primarily by the following criteria: the extent to which the research presented improves quality, development, deployment, maintenance costs, productivity, reliability, and scaling. The evaluation will strongly factor in the degree to which the research is likely to enable real-world applied AI researchers to produce better AI solutions, including factors related to ease of use, adoption, documentation, and impact on the practices of the applications community.

Papers will be reviewed by a program committee of AI researchers, industry experts, human factors, safety, and ethics, with a particular focus on whether the paper efficiently informs the production and deployment of AI systems.

*   **Page Limit:** 6 pages (excluding references and appendices).
*   **Format:** AAAI style and formatting guidelines.
