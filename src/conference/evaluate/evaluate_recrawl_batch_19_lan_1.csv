The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (USENIX ATC '25) will take place on **July 7–9, 2025**, at the **Sheraton Boston in Boston, MA, USA**. The conference is co-located with the **19th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI '25)**.

## Overview

USENIX ATC '25 seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. We are interested in systems of all scales, from small embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds.

The scope of USENIX ATC covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including but not limited to:

*   Operating systems
*   Runtime systems
*   Parallel and distributed systems
*   Storage
*   Networking
*   Security and privacy
*   Virtualization
*   Software-hardware interactions
*   Performance evaluation and workload characterization
*   Reliability, availability, and scalability
*   Energy and power management
*   Bug-finding, tracing, analyzing, and troubleshooting

We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract registrations due:** Tuesday, January 7, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Submissions due:** Tuesday, January 14, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Authors' response period:** Monday, April 7–Wednesday, April 9, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Notification to authors:** Friday, April 25, 2025
*   **Final papers due:** Tuesday, June 3, 2025

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Anonymity:** USENIX ATC '25 will employ **double-blind reviewing**. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   **Originality:** Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum, including journals, conferences, and workshops with proceedings.
*   **Registration:** Papers need to be registered and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract at the time of the abstract registration deadline will be rejected.
*   **Artifact Evaluation:** There will be an optional artifact evaluation process for accepted papers. Visit the href=""/conference/atc25/call-for-artifacts"" - Call for Artifacts page for details.
*   **Further Details:** For detailed submission instructions, please see the href=""/conference/atc25/submission-instructions"" - Submission Instructions page.

## Submission Types

USENIX ATC '25 accepts both **full and short submissions**.

*   **Full submissions:** Must not exceed **12 pages**, excluding references and appendices.
*   **Short submissions:** Must not exceed **6 pages**, excluding references and appendices.

Both types are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in scope. A short paper presents a complete idea that is properly evaluated, just like in a full-length submission. Optionally, authors can include an appendix to provide material that may be of interest to some reviewers, such as algorithm details, proofs, and code snippets, but is not central to the contributions of the paper.

## Deployed Systems Track

USENIX ATC '25 solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with real-world deployment of systems and networks. Papers for the deployed systems track need not present new ideas or results to be accepted but should convey practical insights. Note that the rules regarding submission and anonymization are different for deployed systems track papers.

## Generative AI Policy

Authors must not submit papers containing sections generated entirely by generative AI. Authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper does not include sections completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP. For more detailed questions about the appropriate use of generative AI, please feel free to contact the ATC co-chairs.

All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library in the VRST collection.

### Format

Paper submissions must be anonymous for a double-blind review process.

*   All submissions should be prepared using the Word or LaTeX templates from the official ACM Master article template packages and TAPS.
*   For LaTeX authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format using `\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}`.
*   For Word submissions, please use the linked single-column template.
*   Authors should prepare their materials using numbered citations and references.

### Submission Lengths

*   **LaTeX:** 4 to 9 pages, double column, excluding references.
*   **Word:** Approximately 8,000 words, including space for figures, tables, etc.

### Anonymity Guidelines

*   Remove all author and institution information.
*   Remove any clues that would directly identify any of the authors (e.g., institution names, acknowledgments).
*   Anonymize all PDF files, including metadata.
*   Citations of the authors’ own published work must be in the third person and not traceable to the authors' identity. Example: ""in [3], Mountain and River proposed..."" is acceptable, whereas ""in [3], we proposed..."" is not. Reference [3] should be listed explicitly as “Mountain, A. and River, A., Detecting Mountains and Rivers, In Proc. XYZ ’16, 721-741.”
*   Authors extending their own previous publications should upload these works in a special field in PCS.

Failure to comply with these requirements will result in automatic desk rejection.

### Contribution Types

We invite various research contributions, including interactive systems. Reviewers will judge the novelty of new functionality enabled by a system, even if it leverages existing techniques. Replication studies are also accepted.

*   Optional materials (images, videos, documents) can accompany submissions.
*   Total file size should not exceed 50MB.
*   Content should be in portable formats (e.g., PDF, HTML, PNG, JPEG, QuickTime, MPEG).
*   Accepted papers should stand on their own, with supplementary material providing additional information. Video references in papers are appropriate.

### Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

*   When designing and presenting user evaluations, consider using representative participant populations.
*   If representative samples are not possible, discuss the limitations of the studied population in the paper and be cautious with claims.
*   Report participant demographic information for user evaluations.

### Accessibility

*   Authors are asked to be inclusive.
*   Provide alt-text for figures and tables.
*   Make supplemental videos accessible with subtitles.
*   Refer to SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission and SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos.
*   Contact VRST 2025 Accessibility Chairs at [accessibility@vrst2025.org](mailto:accessibility@vrst2025.org) if you have difficulties.

## Policies

*   At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present their work in person. There will be no remote presentation opportunities.
*   All standing ACM policies apply, including:
    *   [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) (includes statements regarding generative AI)
    *   [ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions)
