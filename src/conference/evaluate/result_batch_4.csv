The 31st International Conference on Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming (**CP 2025**) will be held in **Glasgow, Scotland, August 10-15, 2025**, at the **University of Glasgow**.

CP is the premier international event for presenting research in all aspects of computing with constraints, including theory, algorithms, environments, languages, models, systems, and applications.

This year, CP is co-located with the 28th International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing (SAT 2025) and with the 18th International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS 2025). Note that the first two days (10 and 11th) will be dedicated to the Workshops and Doctoral Program.

## Tracks and Primary Keywords

CP has two tracks: **technical** and **application**. The former focuses on the scientific contributions made ""to"" CP, while the latter focuses on scientific contributions made ""with"" CP. The application track is particularly interested in papers that demonstrate the effectiveness of CP in solving real-world problems, as well as those that offer generalisable insights on the challenges and benefits for both users and developers of applying CP to both academic and real-world problems.

Former specialised tracks are replaced this year by a set of optional primary keywords, which are in addition to the keywords requested from authors every year. Their purpose is to enable submissions to self-identify the area of focus of the CP paper, support the identification of suitable reviewers, and potentially aid in the grouping of thematically related accepted papers in the conference program.

The primary keywords are:

*   Theory
*   Constraint Propagation, Explanation & Inference
*   Search (Complete & Heuristic)
*   SAT, MaxSAT & Logic Programming
*   Modelling & Modelling Languages
*   Operations Research & Mathematical Optimisation
*   Machine Learning & Generative AI
*   Verification, Certification & Testing
*   Hardware, Quantum, Security & Parallelism
*   Model Counting
*   Decision Diagrams & Dynamic Programming
*   Symmetries/Dominance
*   Model/Instance Explainability

## Important Dates

*   Abstract registration: March 24, 2025
*   Paper submission: April 3, 2025
*   Author rebuttal: May 8-12, 2025
*   Final notification: May 29, 2025
*   Camera Ready: June 9, 2025
*   Conference: August 10-15, 2025

Dates are intended as 11pm Anywhere on Earth (AoE, also known as UTC-12).

## Submission Instructions

The submission Web page for CP 2025 uses the OpenReview system: [https://openreview.net/group?id=a4cp.org/CP/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=a4cp.org/CP/2025/Conference)

Papers should be submitted in the form of a PDF file following [LIPIcs guidelines](http://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author)).

Two types of submissions are expected:

*   **Full papers:** up to 15 pages (references and appendices excluded).
*   **Short papers:** up to 8 pages (references and appendices excluded).

Appendices of up to 6 pages for full papers and up to 3 pages for short papers can be included and will not contribute towards the total page count.

All papers will go through a double-blind reviewing process, meaning that authors and reviewers are mutually anonymous. For this reason, submitted papers should not contain author names, affiliations, or links to identifying websites.

## Diversity Equity Inclusion (DEI) scholarship and other support

CP 2025 offers DEI scholarships to support individuals from underrepresented groups. Eligibility for the DEI scholarship requires applicants to be pursuing or holding a PhD in constraint programming or related fields. Note that paper submission is not required to qualify for the scholarship. Contact the DEI chairs for more information.

In addition to the scholarships, CP 2025 is willing to support attendees with childcare or accessibility needs on a best-effort basis; if you are interested, please get in touch early to discuss your needs.

## Use of Generative AI

CP 2025 is adopting the AAAI policy regarding the use of Generative AI systems such as ChatGPT. Papers that include text generated from an AI system are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental setup.

It aims to bring together researchers from CP, AI, and OR to present new techniques, applications, and theoretical & practical insights. Registration is now open, with early registration ending September 3, 2025.","# CPAIOR 2025: Call for Papers

The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research will be held in **Melbourne, Australia** from **November 10 to November 13, 2025**. The conference will be co-located with [ICAPS 2025](https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/home/).

While the conference will take place later in the year than usual, papers are still due in **December 2024**, in order to not interfere with the usual sequence of conference deadlines.

The aim of the conference is to promote a space where researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Operations Research (OR) present innovative techniques, new applications, and original cutting-edge ideas, thereby encouraging researchers from one area to learn from the others. Of particular interest to the conference are papers that integrate concepts and methodologies from these different fields, either proposing interesting new techniques for complex/practical problems or expanding our theoretical insights and cross-field understanding.

However, high-quality original papers from a single area are welcome when also relevant to the other communities involved. The conference also strongly encourages regular papers or experience reports showcasing CP/AI/OR techniques on challenging real-world applications.

The program committee invites submissions that include, but are far from limited to, the following topics:

*   New methodologies in the interface between predictive and prescriptive pipelines, such as machine learning techniques applied to tackle optimization problems and, conversely, CP/OR techniques to address AI and machine learning tasks.
*   Novel relaxation and inference methods based on constraint propagation, polyhedral techniques/cutting planes, convex/second-order conic optimization, graph-based algorithms, dynamic programming, and decision diagrams for optimization.
*   New search perspectives involving enumeration/branch-and-bound strategies, innovative decomposition techniques (e.g., based on column generation/Benders), intelligent backtracking, incomplete search, and learning-based heuristics.
*   Advanced integrated methods that expose new model transformations, communication strategies across MIP/CP/SAT solvers, distributed solution techniques, and solver selection (e.g., portfolio approaches).
*   Innovative models and applications of CP/AI/OR techniques.
*   Implementation or evaluation of CP/AI/OR techniques and optimization systems.

Submissions are of two types: **regular papers** (submitted for publication and presentation) and **extended abstracts** (submitted for presentation only).

The conference will recognize a **distinguished paper award** and a **student paper award**.

## Instructions for Regular Papers

Regular papers present original unpublished work and can be of two types:

*   **long papers** (at most 15 pages plus references)
*   **short papers** (at most 8 pages plus references)

Both long and short papers will undergo rigorous review and are subject to the same criteria of quality. Both types are also eligible for the distinguished paper or student paper award. Short papers are particularly encouraged for interesting and novel work in progress, for which the practical or theoretical relevance is not yet fully identified.

Submissions to CPAIOR are single blind. In a single blind review process, the author names are not hidden for the reviewers, but the reviewer names are hidden for the authors.

The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. All regular papers should be prepared in the format used for that series (LNCS instructions).

## Instructions for Extended Abstracts

Extended abstracts should be **one or two pages** in length and may present preliminary work or work already published in other outlets. The extended abstracts are submitted for presentation only (if accepted), and will not be formally published in the LNCS conference volume. A collection of the accepted extended abstracts will be published on the conference website. A submission representing work submitted or published in another outlet should state that outlet.

Extended abstracts will be reviewed to ensure appropriateness for the conference.

## Submission Process

We will use [OpenReview.net](https://openreview.net/group?id=cpaior.org/CPAIOR/2025/Conference) to manage the reviewing process. Reviewing will follow the same process as in previous years: the process is single-blind, and all submissions, reviews, rebuttals and comments will stay private throughout the entire review period as well as afterwards.

For any queries on the submission process, please contact the Program Chair Guido Tack at [cpaior2025@gmail.com](mailto:cpaior2025@gmail.com).

## Important Dates

**Submission schedule for regular papers (both long and short):**

## Review process

Submissions must not substantially duplicate published work or work that has been submitted in parallel to any other journal or conference/workshop with published proceedings. Additionally, submissions may not be submitted to any other venue unless notified of rejection or withdrawn by the authors. Accepted submissions may not appear in any other conference or workshop that has proceedings.

The review process will consist of two rounds with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee will reject some submissions; the rest will proceed to the second round. At the end of the first round, the authors will be either notified of rejection, or invited to submit a response to questions from the program committee (if any). The authors' response will be used to make the final decision in the second round.

The double-blind review process will follow the IACR Conflict of Interest Policy. The authors will be asked, at submission time, to help identify program committee members with potential conflicts of interest.

## Awards

The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall Best Paper Award. The Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper(s) authored exclusively by students and postdocs (at the time of submission). As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.

## Stipends

Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. A limited number of stipends will be available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Application instructions will be posted together with other registration information.

## Submission Process

CSCW 2026 uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: [https://new.precisionconference.com](https://new.precisionconference.com).

Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the SIGCHI Submission and Review Policy.

## Paper Guidelines Regarding Scope

Contributions must have a focus on social aspects of technology mediation and be properly contextualized in the CSCW literature. Papers whose research contributions are primarily of relevance or benefit to individual users will be considered out of scope.

Authors should clearly answer yes to the following:

*   Does your work build upon, bridge, discuss, or cite prior CSCW work in a significant manner? Does it make clear how it offers new knowledge of benefit to the CSCW community?
*   Have you clearly elaborated on how the results of your work are useful for thinking about the design of computing technologies to support cooperative/collaborative work or social interactions?

## Anonymous Review Policy

Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors' names and affiliations removed.

CSCW does not have a policy against uploading preprints to SSRN or arXiv before they are submitted for review at the conference. Nevertheless, to ensure the integrity of the peer review process, we ask that no authors publicize the work until the review process is complete.

## Formatting and Length

*   Word authors: Use the old interim ACM Small template, available at [https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates)
*   LaTeX authors: Use the template at [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions), and insert the acmsmall call.
*   Overleaf authors: Use the template at [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf), and use the acmsmall call.

Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be desk rejected. Note that additional materials can be submitted as appendices but be aware that reviewers are not bound to decide based on these materials.

## Tiered Review Process

CSCW 2026 adopts a tiered review process. In this review process, the previous “Editor” role will be replaced with “Senior Program Committee” (SPC).

## Policy on Use of Large Language Models in Writing Papers

Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) must be clearly marked.

## Policy on Irresponsible Reviews

LLMs are NOT allowed to be used for writing the reviews nor the meta-reviews at any step.

## Submission

Submission is through the EasyChair conference system, by following the [link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpm2025). The submission process requires registration to create an EasyChair account prior to submission.

## Submission Format

The authors should submit an extended abstract not exceeding **12 single-spaced pages** on A4 paper, excluding the title page (containing title, authors, affiliations, e-mail addresses, a short abstract, and keywords) and the references. The authors are required to use the [LaTeX style file supplied by Dagstuhl (LIPIcs)](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author). Papers must be submitted as a single file in PDF format.

Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication in the final version - for example details of proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. The program code of experimental papers should be made public, with reasonable documentation, such that the PC may evaluate replicability of experimental results.

Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work and surveys of important results. At the time the extended abstract is submitted to CPM, and for the entire review period, the paper (or essentially the same paper) should not be under review by any other conference with published proceedings or by a scientific journal.

At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference as a registered participant. The conference will be held in person at the University of Milano-Bicocca, within easy reach from the city center of Milan, Italy."

**July 26-29, 2026, Lisbon Portugal (colocated with FLoC 2026)**

CSF 2026 continues to have rolling deadlines. Starting from CSF 2020, CSF invites submissions three times a year. This year, the deadlines are in the Summer, Fall, and Winter. Dates and detailed submission instructions appear later in this document.

The Computer Security Foundations Symposium (CSF) is an annual conference for researchers in computer security. CSF seeks papers on foundational aspects of computer security, such as formal security models, relationships between security properties and defenses, principled techniques and tools for design and rigorous analysis of security mechanisms, as well as their application to practice. While CSF welcomes submissions beyond the topics listed below, the main focus of CSF is foundational security and privacy. Papers lacking foundational aspects risk desk rejection without further evaluation of their merits; contact the PC chairs when in doubt.

CSF was created in 1988 as a workshop of the IEEE Computer Society’s Technical Committee on Security and Privacy, in response to a 1986 essay by Don Good entitled “The Foundations of Computer Security—We Need Some.” The meeting became a “symposium” in 2007, along with a policy for open, increased attendance.

Proceedings will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press and will be available at the symposium. Some small number of papers will be selected by the Program Committee as ""Distinguished Papers"".

## Submission Server

### SoK papers: Systematization of Knowledge Papers

CSF 2026 solicits systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers in foundational security and privacy research. These papers systematize, re-formulate, or evaluate existing work in one established and significant research topic. Such papers must provide new insights. Survey papers without new insights are not appropriate. Papers trying to identify robust foundations of research areas still lacking them are particularly welcome. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form.

## Ethics

We expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out the research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so will result in summary rejection of a submission regardless of its quality and scientific value.

Although causing controlled harm is sometimes a consequence of legitimate scientific research in computer security and privacy, authors are expected to document how they have addressed and mitigated the risks.

If the submitted research has potential to cause harm, and authors have access to an Institutional Review Board (IRB), we expect that this IRB is consulted and its approval and recommendations are documented in the paper.

We encourage the authors to consult with existing documentation, e.g., Common Pitfalls in Writing about Security and Privacy Human Subjects Experiments, and How to Avoid Them or the Menlo Report and existing Safety consultation entities, e.g., the [Tor Safety Research Board](https://research.torproject.org/safetyboard/).

## Paper Submission Instructions

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with published proceedings.

Papers must be submitted using the two-column IEEE Proceedings style available for various document preparation systems at the [IEEE Conference Publishing Services page](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). All papers should be at most 12 pages long, not counting bibliography and well-marked appendices. Anonymized supplementary material such as proof scripts can be uploaded as a tar ball on the submission site. Committee members are not required to read appendices, and so the paper must be intelligible without them.

Papers failing to adhere to any of the instructions above will be rejected without consideration of their merits.

At least one coauthor of each accepted paper is required to attend CSF to present the paper. In the event of difficulty in obtaining visas for travel, exceptions can be made and will be discussed on a case-by-case basis.

CSF 2026 will employ double-blind reviewing. Submitted papers must (a) omit any reference to the authors’ names or the names of their institutions, and (b) reference the authors’ own related work in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). [Please see our frequently asked questions (FAQ) that address many common concerns](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/conferences/csf2018/faq.html). When in doubt, contact the program chairs.

## Decisions

The outcome of the review process can be one of the following three: accept, reject, major revision. In some occasions, accepted papers are shepherded for minor modifications.

### Major revisions

Papers with “major revision” decision must be re-submitted within the following two cycles, accompanied by a writeup explaining how the revision meets reviewers’ revision requirements. These papers will be reviewed by the same reviewers as those for the initial submission. They may use 16 pages in the usual IEEE template, but the 16 pages should contain everything, in particular bibliography and appendix (if any). In other words, revisions should be prepared as if they were camera-ready papers; although they should still be anonymized. For additional material authors may point to technical reports or supply additional material when submitting the paper. Such material should also be anonymized. Reviewers are, however, not obliged to read this material.

Authors should submit their revision as a new paper (rather than updating the previous submission) and mark it as “major revision”. For major revision papers the submission system will ask authors to provide additional information in a textbox, such as the cycle and the submission number of the previous submission.

The possible decisions for such resubmitted revised papers are the following: accept (possibly with shepherding) or reject, i.e., a major revision decision is excluded.

Like all papers, major revision papers can be withdrawn from the conference at any time.

Major revision papers not re-submitted within the following two cycles will be considered new submissions, reviewed by serving PC members. A writeup explaining how the revision meets previous reviewers’ revision requirements is optional. The layout of these papers has to follow the guidelines for regular submissions, in particular, for these papers the limit of 12 pages applies.

### Resubmissions of rejected papers

Rejected papers can be re-submitted at any time. If a rejected paper is re-submitted within 11 months of the last deadline they were submitted to (e.g., rejected submission from October 2024 is resubmitted for the July 2025 deadline), reviews and a writeup explaining how the current submission addresses concerns in the reviews must be submitted as supplementary material. The paper will be desk-rejected by the PC chairs if previous reviews or the explanation is missing. We may use a different set of reviewers for re-submissions. All resubmissions of rejected papers can optionally submit reviews from previous submissions and a writeup explaining how the current submission addresses concerns in the reviews as supplementary material. In any case, previously rejected papers should follow the paper submission instructions of regular submissions. In particular, the same page limit and format applies and submissions should be anonymized.

We also welcome systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers. These papers will not be judged on novel research contributions, but on their value to the research community. SoK papers should provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area; support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence; or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate for acceptance.

For submissions including practical evaluations, it is encouraged (but not required) to make implementations available to facilitate replicability and reproducibility.

Accepted papers (including SoK papers) will appear in the CT-RSA proceedings, published by Springer in its LNCS series.

CT-RSA is scheduled to be an in-person event. One of the things that makes CT-RSA special is the interaction between academia and industry. For that reason, it is strongly preferred that authors of accepted papers present their work in-person. Exceptions will be made only in the case of serious extenuating circumstances, such as COVID restrictions, visa delays, and other emergencies. The presenter of each paper will be given a free Full Pass to RSA Conference.

*   **Maximum number of pages:** 6 pages plus one extra page exclusively for references. If accepted as extended abstracts, manuscripts can be at most 2 page-long with an extra page to be used exclusively for references.
*   **Double-blind review process:** Manuscripts should not include authors’ names nor affiliations. Authors are expected to follow all reasonable efforts to ensure that their submission is compliant with the double-blind review process.
*   **Format:** A4 or Letter size pages, double column, single spaced, Times or equivalent font, at minimum 10pt size, avoiding the use of type-3 fonts. Baseline stretch to compress text is not allowed. Page numbers and copyright notices should not be included in the submission.
*   **Templates:**  Word DOCX ([DATE-conference-template-A4.docx](https://www.date-conference.com/DATE-conference-template-A4.docx)) and LaTeX ([DATE-conference-template-LaTeX.zip](https://www.date-conference.com/DATE-conference-template-LaTeX.zip)) files.
*   **Topic selection:** Carefully select the most appropriate research topic when submitting a paper. For track and topic list, see Tracks and Topics list ([/call-for-papers#Research-Papers](https://www.date-conference.com/call-for-papers#Research-Papers)). When submitting a paper, you will be asked to select a secondary topic (mandatory). Your primary and secondary topic selections will enable the Programme Committee to assign your paper to the best-fitting topic.

### Focus Sessions

*   Proposals must consist of an extended summary, describing the topic, the authors/speakers and the format. Each proposal should name a chair and a co-chair. The chair and co-chair are responsible for the preparation and the monitoring of the session; they cannot be selected among the moderators/panellists, or speakers/presenters.
*   Proposals should be submitted using the provided [Focus Session Proposal template](https://www.date-conference.com/DATE2026-Focus-Session-Proposal-Template.docx).
*   Hot-Topic Session presenters may optionally select to submit manuscripts for publication in the conference proceedings. Presenters may choose to submit one manuscript for each speaker, or a single collective paper representing the whole session. A paper can be of maximum 6 pages, plus 1 page for references. Such papers will undergo a review by at least 2 experts in the session’s topic, and feedback will be provided to the authors for possible necessary revisions.
*   Panel Sessions are allowed at most one (1) page for a summary position statement for each panellist. Such statements will be included in the conference proceedings.
*   All focus session manuscripts’ titles must begin with ""Focus Session: …"".

### Embedded Tutorials

*   The submission should motivate the topic and its relevance for both academia and industry, specify whether it covers foundational topics or cutting-edge ones, describe the target audience (expected type of attendees? expected number? alignment with typical DATE audience?), the reason for a tutorial (why a tutorial?, why now?). Hands-on tutorials are welcomed.
*   Moreover, the submission should include a brief abstract with a list of learning objectives, and a clear plan (organisation in sessions, possible speakers, what will be done to attract the audience), and the DATE topic to which it is more closely related. As the tutorials will be embedded in the main conference programme and delivered in person, hands-on content and embedded activities are encouraged.
*   A tutorial proposal should be submitted by the submission deadline indicated in the key dates table as a PDF file. If a tutorial submission is accepted, final information about the tutorial structure (confirmed speakers, final abstract, final agenda) must be provided by the CONFIRMED PLAN AND SPEAKERS deadline as listed in the key date table. Tutorial hand-out material (e.g., consisting of all slides and background reading material) must be uploaded as a single PDF or ZIP file at the DATE website by the final materials deadline.

### Workshops

*   Proposals should be submitted using the provided [workshop proposal template](https://www.date-conference.com/DATE2026-Workshop-Proposal-Template.docx).
*   Proposals must be submitted in PDF format by the submission deadline indicated in the key dates table.

### Late Breaking Results

*   LBR submissions should consist of a 2-page extended abstract, with the option of using one additional page for bibliographic references only.
*   Authors should use one of the templates provided on the DATE website and prepare a blind submission by the final paper deadline listed in the key dates table.
*   LBR paper titles must begin with ""Late Breaking Results: …"". This prefix must be used in both the submission and the camera-ready version of the paper.
*   **Formatting instructions:** format.pdf
*   **Templates:**  Microsoft Word ([DATE-conference-template-A4.docx](https://www.date-conference.com/DATE-conference-template-A4.docx)) and LaTeX ([DATE-conference-template-LaTeX.zip](https://www.date-conference.com/DATE-conference-template-LaTeX.zip)) files.

### Multi-Partner Projects

*   Submissions should consist of a paper, not exceeding 6 pages in length, with one extra page allowed only for bibliographic references.
*   All submitted papers should be formatted following the same format as for research paper submissions.
*   MPP submissions’ titles must begin with ""Multi-Partner Project: …"". Submissions need NOT be blind, and contributors’ names may be included or inferred in the manuscript.
*   Deadlines for abstract and final paper submissions are as reported in the key dates table.
*   Submissions will be peer-reviewed following a non-blind process.

## Important Reminders

*   **No Double Submissions:** Submissions simultaneously under review or accepted by another conference, symposium, or journal will be rejected. The DATE conference will work cooperatively with other publishing bodies to check for potential ""double-submissions"". Submissions can be made available as pre-prints (e.g., on arXiv) only AFTER the authors are notified of whether their manuscript is accepted or rejected.
*   **Authors List Cannot Be Modified:** The list and order of the authors cannot be modified after the submission deadline. It is extremely important that the full list of authors, in the correct order, is included when submitting the paper online. If the paper is accepted, authors will not be able to modify the authors’ list later on.
*   **Presenting Author and Registration Are Required:** Please note that each paper shall be accompanied by at least one full conference registration at the speaker rate (i.e., two speaker registrations are needed for two accepted papers. Moreover, at least one author for each paper is expected to attend the session where the paper is discussed and deliver the presentation, otherwise the paper will be removed from the published proceedings after the conference has taken place (despite full payment at the speaker rate) - non-author presenters are not allowed.

## Young People Programme

The DATE Young People Programme (YPP) is embedded in the conference and dedicated to the career development of young DATE attendees, and to forging connections with sponsoring companies and academic and research centres. The Young People Programme comprises three types of engagements: Career Fair, University Fair and PhD forum.

**ACM Designing Interactive Systems (DIS) 2026** will be held in **Singapore from 13 – 17 June 2026.**

## Theme: Beyond Interaction

In the face of climate change, pandemics, economic and political instability, and the accelerating pace of emerging technologies, the responsibilities of designing interactive systems have expanded well beyond the scope of traditional human-computer interaction. This calls for a paradigm shift: from a focus on isolated interactions to an ecosystemic perspective—one that attends to the complex networks surrounding humans and more-than-human actors, and that engages with layered sociotechnical, cultural, political, economic, and ethical concerns.

We seek to provoke fundamental reexaminations of what it means to design interactive systems by asking:

*   To what extent does the notion of “interactivity” reinforce a dyadic model of human-system relations, potentially limiting our understanding of more distributed, entangled, or systemic forms of interaction?
*   How do the things we design interact with broader sociocultural, political, economic, and planetary forces?
*   What lies beyond “interaction” that should be made visible in our design processes?
*   Given these interconnections, how should we redefine what is “interactive” in interactive systems? And how might such a redefinition help us better navigate their systemic impacts?

Singapore offers a rich context for engaging these questions. As a hyper-urbanized, multicultural hub at the heart of Southeast Asia—and a global testbed for technological innovation—it provides a unique vantage point for rethinking the boundaries of interaction.

## Submission Guidelines

DIMVA 2025 will adopt a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations must be excluded from the paper. Furthermore, authors should avoid obvious self-references, and should cite their own previous work in third person, whenever necessary. Papers that are not properly anonymized risk being rejected without review.

Submissions must be original work and may not be under submission to another venue at the time of review. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to physically present the submitted work at the conference, for the paper to be included in the proceedings.

Authors are encouraged to submit code appropriately anonymized, using, e.g., [https://anonymous.4open.science/](https://anonymous.4open.science/).

## Ethical Considerations

Submissions that report experiments with data gathered from human subjects should disclose whether the research received approval from an institutional ethics review board (IRB), if applicable, and what measures were adopted to minimize risks to privacy.

Submissions that describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties (e.g., in case of probing of network devices), and how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software or system vendors or owners before publication.

## Types of Submissions Solicited

We invite full papers for submission that present novel and mature research results. Full papers are limited to 20 pages in Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and appendices.

Papers that do not follow these formatting guidelines may be rejected without review.

While we do not accept short papers, we encourage authors to submit a poster instead, presenting original, still ongoing work that has not yet reached the maturity required for a full paper. For more information, please refer to the Call for Posters.

## Submissions

Submission should be done via the following web page:

[https://disc25.hotcrp.com](https://disc25.hotcrp.com)

A submitted paper should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A submission should strive to be accessible to a broad audience, as well as having sufficient details for experts in the area.

There are two types of submissions: regular papers and brief announcements. Regular papers must report on original research that has not previously been published (and may not be concurrently submitted to other journals or conferences with proceedings). All ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in a paper, including experimental results, should be included in the submission. A brief announcement may describe work in progress or work presented elsewhere. A brief announcement may also present a result that is short and elegant, but does not require a longer paper. It may also be used to announce a software distribution or an experimental result of interest that can be concisely described. The title of a brief announcement should start with the phrase “Brief Announcement: “.

A paper that is not accepted as a regular paper may be invited as a brief announcement.

When requested by the program committee, each author of the submitted paper(s) is expected to prepare a professional review of a non-conflicted DISC 2025 submission that falls within their research expertise.

## Submission format

Submissions must be in English in pdf format and they must be prepared using the LaTeX style template for LIPIcs ([https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/5#author)) with

```
\documentclass[a4paper,anonymous,USenglish]{lipics-v2021}
```

Submissions must be anonymous, without any author names, affiliations, or email addresses. The contact information of the authors will be entered separately in the submission metadata.

For regular papers, there is no page limit, and authors are encouraged to use the “full version” of their paper as the submission. The initial 15 pages, excluding the title page and a table of contents, should contain a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. (Illustrative figures are encouraged.) The submission must contain all necessary details, including full proofs of all claims in the paper.

Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the first 15 pages, excluding the title page and a table of contents, will be read at the committee’s discretion. Papers submitted as brief announcements should comply with the above rules, replacing 15 pages with 5 pages.

Submissions not conforming to the submission guidelines and papers outside of the scope of the conference will be rejected without consideration. All accept/reject decisions made by the program committee are final.

## Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)

The use of LLMs for submission preparation is permitted, although it is highly recommended that they only be used for cosmetic changes, e.g. proofreading of the text. The use of LLMs in technical parts should be treated in the same way as any other software or system, and thus carefully described and documented in the submission. Ultimately, the authors are responsible for the content of their submission, and mis-use of LLM may result in rejection. Any questions about the LLM use policy should be directed to the PC chair, Dariusz Kowalski (dkowalski@augusta.edu).

## Anonymous Submissions

We will use a relaxed implementation of double-blind peer review. Submissions must not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names and affiliation should not appear in the document itself. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of this process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try.

You are free to disseminate your work through arXiv and other online repositories and give presentations on your work as usual. Moreover, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized.

Brief announcements should also be submitted without author names and affiliations so that a reviewer can form an initial judgment without bias, but they can contain a reference to the full version of the work in the bibliography.

Please feel free to ask the PC chair if you have any questions about the double-blind policy of DISC 2025.

## Conflict of Interest

The submission form provides an opportunity to specify conflicts of interest with any of the PC members and other member of research community. A conflict of interest is limited to the following:

*   A family member or close friend;
*   A Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years;
*   A person with the same affiliation;
*   A person involved in an alleged incident of harassment;
*   Frequent collaborators, or collaborators who have jointly published papers within the last two years.

If you feel that you have a valid reason for a conflict of interest beyond listed above, or any other issues related to the fair treatment of your submission, contact the PC chair, Dariusz Kowalski (dkowalski@augusta.edu), or the SafeTOC representative for DISC, listed at https://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/.

## Participation at DISC

It is expected that accepted papers and brief announcements be presented in-person at the conference.

## Publication

The proceedings will be published by LIPIcs. The final version of the paper has to be formatted following the LIPIcs guidelines. Regular papers will have 15 pages in the final proceedings (excluding references), and brief announcements will have 5 pages in the proceedings (including everything). If more space is needed, the authors are encouraged to post the full version e.g. on arXiv and refer to it in their paper.

Accepted papers and brief announcements must be presented by one of the authors, with a full registration and according to the final schedule.

Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of the journal Distributed Computing.

The best paper at DISC will be considered for publication in the Journal of the ACM.

## Awards

Awards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper. To be eligible for the best student paper award, at least one of the paper authors must be a full-time student at the time of submission, and the student(s) must have made a significant contribution to the paper."

## Submission Tracks

**I. Submissions for Oral Presentations (Tracks A and B)**

Authors submitting a paper and/or proposal for a presentation may choose between two submission tracks. Submissions for oral presentations can be submitted to one of the two tracks (A) or (B).

*   **Track A – Full Paper:** For authors who want their full papers to be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings of Informatics (LIPIcs) conference proceedings.
    *   Submissions to Track A may not be previously published or simultaneously submitted to another conference or journal for publication.
    *   The paper is formatted in LaTeX using the LIPIcs-v2021 style. Please follow the LIPIcs formatting instructions found at [https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/documentation/authors). Papers that are not formatted using the LIPIcs style may be rejected without review.
    *   Each paper contains an abstract that briefly describes the primary results and their importance.
    *   The main text of the paper is limited to 15 pages; this count does NOT include the title, authors, affiliations and abstract or bibliography.
    *   An optional technical appendix is permitted if the authors deem it necessary to back up the claims made in the first 15 pages. However, it is at the discretion of the PC whether to read beyond the first 15 pages as part of the review process.
