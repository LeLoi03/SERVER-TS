*   **Track II: Engineering:** Focuses on the development and investigation of artifacts and systems that solve concrete problems in business environments. This includes tools and techniques for process modeling, enactment, monitoring, and analytics (process mining), with rigorous and reproducible empirical evaluations.
*   **Track III: Management:** Focuses on the empirical, socio-technical, cognitive, psychological, managerial, and societal aspects of BPM. It examines how process management concepts and information systems deliver business value, including strategic alignment, governance, methods, technology, people, and culture.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Each paper must be submitted to exactly one track. Authors are advised to consult track descriptions to select the most appropriate track.
*   Papers must be formatted according to **Springer’s LNCS formatting guidelines**.
*   Submissions must be in **English** and cannot exceed **16 pages**, including references and appendices.

## Paper Submissions

*   Authors are invited to submit original, full-length research papers that are not previously published, accepted to be published, or being considered for publication in any other forum.
*   Full-length papers should satisfy the standard requirements of top-tier international research conferences.
*   Manuscripts should be submitted to CIKM 2025 Easychair site in PDF format, using the **2-column ACM sigconf template**.
*   **Full papers:** Cannot exceed 9 pages, including an appendix, plus unlimited pages for the GenAI Usage Disclosure section and references (paper content is limited to 9 pages).
*   Rejected full papers will not be considered for publication as short papers.
*   The review of manuscripts will be **double-blind**, and submissions not properly anonymized will be desk-rejected without review.
*   At least one author of each accepted paper must register to present the work on-site in Seoul, Korea.

## Usage of Generative AI

*   Technical papers submitted to CIKM are required to include a **“GenAI Usage Disclosure” section** at the end of the limited pages of main contents and appendix, right before the references.
*   Authors must provide full disclosure of all use of GenAI tools in all stages of the research (including code and data).
*   This section, together with references, will not be counted toward the page limit.
*   AI tools may be used to edit and polish authors’ work (e.g., grammar checks, word autocorrect), but text “produced entirely” by generative/AI models is not allowed.

All submissions must comply with the ACM policy on the usage of GenAI: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/frequently-asked-questions#h-can-i-use-generative-ai-software-tools-to-prepare-my-manuscript](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/frequently-asked-questions#h-can-i-use-generative-ai-software-tools-to-prepare-my-manuscript)

## Dual Submission Policy

Submitting identical or substantially similar papers to other forums is not allowed. Abstract submissions are permitted for papers still under review, provided the review process concludes by the full paper deadline. Submissions must be withdrawn if accepted elsewhere or still under review by the deadline.

Anonymized work available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv) is allowed, but requires modifying the title and abstract, and refraining from citing the preprint to maintain anonymity.

## Authorship Policy

*   Authorship names, including ordering, must be finalized by the paper submission deadline. No changes are permitted after this deadline.
*   Authors are advised to review the [ACM’s authorship policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) carefully.

## ACM Conflict of Interest Policy

All authors must adhere to the ACM Conflict of Interest policy: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest)

## Desk Rejection Policy

Submissions failing to adhere to anonymity, length, or formatting requirements, or violating ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty (plagiarism, author misrepresentation, falsification), may be subject to desk rejection.

## ACM Policy Against Harassment

All authors and participants must adhere to the ACM Policy Against Harassment: [https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment)

## Important Dates (AoE)

*   **Paper Submission Deadline (Technical Papers):** February 6, 2025 (Firm)
*   **Poster Submission Deadline:** March 13, 2025
*   **Notification of Acceptance (Technical Papers):** April 4, 2025
*   **Notification of Acceptance (Posters):** April 7, 2025
*   **Camera-ready Version (Technical Papers):** May 1, 2025

## Paper Submission Categories

Submissions to HPDC can be made in one of the following two categories:

1.  **Regular papers:** The primary focus should be to describe new research ideas supported by experimental implementation and evaluation. Authors are strongly encouraged to open-source their software or hardware artifacts.
2.  **Open-source tools and data papers:** The primary focus should be to describe the design, development, and evaluation of new open-source tools or novel data sources.

Submissions in both categories will be evaluated to the same standards in terms of novelty, scientific value, demonstrated usefulness, and potential impact on the field. The chosen category at the time of the submission cannot be changed after the submission deadline.

Authors are required to indicate the category of the paper as a part of the submitted manuscript's title. The last line of the title should indicate the paper type by using one of the two phrases: **""Paper Type: Regular""** or **""Paper Type: Open-source tools and data paper""**.

## ACM Publication

Papers accepted and presented at HPDC 2025 will be published in the ACM Digital Library at no additional cost to the authors.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Authors are invited to submit technical papers of at most **11 pages** in PDF format, excluding references.
*   Accepted papers will have the flexibility to use an additional page in the camera-ready version to incorporate feedback from the reviewers.
*   Papers should be formatted in the ACM Proceedings Style (using `sigconf` from https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
*   Submissions must be original work that has not appeared in and is not under consideration for another conference or a journal.
*   Submit via the conference submission website: [HPDC Submission Site](https://hpdc.sci.utah.edu/hpdc2025/calls.html).

## Anonymizing Submissions

HPDC uses **dual-anonymous reviewing**. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or acknowledgments). The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of the author names.

Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. If your submission extends a previous workshop paper or relates to a submission currently under review, cite the other work anonymously and email the deanonymized work to the PC chairs.

If your submission reports on experiences with a system at your institution, refer to the system anonymously but describe the properties needed to evaluate the work. Tool/data papers should also adhere to the double-blind submission policy. If the described tool/dataset framework is already widely used, consider describing it using a different name and not sharing the open-source code repository in the paper.

## arXiv Submission Policy

Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit submission to HPDC 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission and do not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period).

## HPDC Policy on the use of AI

HPDC permits the use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly) for language rectification. Authors must verify the accuracy of AI-generated content, and are solely responsible for the paper's contents. AI tools are not eligible for authorship.

The use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section, citing the AI system used. The acknowledgments section should still follow the dual-anonymous submission guideline.
