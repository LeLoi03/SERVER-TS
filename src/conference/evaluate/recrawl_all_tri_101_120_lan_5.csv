The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW) is the premier venue for human-centered research in the design, use, and evaluation of technologies that support or affect social, cooperative, and collaborative practices in groups, organizations, communities, and networks. CSCW 2026 will explore topics across sociotechnical domains of work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, design, entertainment, and ethics.

CSCW 2026 will be held in the **USA** in **October 2026.** We will share the exact location and date as soon as possible.

## Scope

Papers are expected to report on novel results from human-centered research discussing the design, development, use, and/or analysis of CSCW and social computing systems, or introduce new human-centered approaches to the conceptualization or critical analysis of such systems. Submissions exploring how computing technologies — including those linked to recent developments in AI, machine learning, robotics, and AR/VR — relate to questions of race, indigeneity, gender, and the environment are particularly encouraged, providing they are properly contextualized within cooperative, collaborative, or social computing issues. Submissions by members of underrepresented groups are particularly welcome. Authors exploring historical and sociotechnical perspectives on CSCW systems are also encouraged to submit.

Contributions must have a focus on social aspects of technology mediation and be properly contextualized in the CSCW literature, with clear reference to CSCW concepts and/or theories informing, being affected or being proposed.

We invite contributions to CSCW across a variety of human-centered research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains, including:

*   Social and crowd computing
*   CSCW and social computing system development
*   Methodologies and tools
*   Critical, historical, ethnographic analyses
*   Empirical investigations
*   Domain-specific social, cooperative, and collaborative applications
*   Ethics and policy implications
*   CSCW and social computing systems based on emerging technologies
*   Crossing boundaries

## Submission Information

Send queries about paper submissions to [papers2026@cscw.acm.org](mailto:papers2026@cscw.acm.org).

To promote work-life balance, we have set all deadlines on Tuesdays to avoid weekends at any time zone. Note that the submission system is usually opened two weeks before each deadline (submission and revision).

### Submission Model

To support diverse and high-quality contributions, CSCW 2026 will use a two-round review process with the opportunity for major revisions reviewed by the same reviewers. Accepted papers are published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACM HCI) Journal.

**Important note:** CSCW 2026 papers will be published under ACM Open Access. Reading more details about ACM OPEN [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess).

The only submission deadline for new papers for CSCW 2026 will be in May 2025. Failure to submit a revised version of a paper by the associated deadline means that the paper has been withdrawn.

### Submission Process

CSCW 2026 uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: [https://new.precisionconference.com](https://new.precisionconference.com).

Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the SIGCHI Submission and Review Policy, including, but not limited to:

*   That the paper submitted is original, that the listed authors are the creators of the work, that each author is aware of the submission and that they are listed as an author, and that the paper is an honest representation of the underlying work.
*   Authors must provide a detailed explanation of any overlap and distinct contribution of each paper in the “Comments (optional)” field on the submission form.
*   That the work submitted is not currently under review at any other publication venue.
*   Authors should adhere to the new ACM policy in authorship, available at [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship).

### Paper Guidelines Regarding Scope

In general, contributions must have a focus on social aspects of technology mediation and be properly contextualized in the CSCW literature, with clear reference to CSCW concepts and/or theories informing, being affected or being proposed.

### Anonymous Review Policy

Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors' names and affiliations removed.

### Formatting and Length

*   Word authors: use the old interim ACM Small template, which is ONLY available at the following link: [https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates)
*   LaTeX authors: use the template at [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions), and insert the acmsmall call.
*   Overleaf authors: use the template at [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf), and use the acmsmall call.
*   Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be desk rejected.
*   Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. If a paper is shorter than 5000 words or exceeds 12,000 words, it will be submitted to additional scrutiny.

## Key Policies

### Reviewer Responsibilities

*   Anyone who submits must make themselves available as a reviewer for this CSCW cycle. If the authors do not agree to review, the paper will be desk rejected. Reviewers must volunteer to review on PCS by May 14, 2025 at 23:59 Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time.
*   You must volunteer to complete 3 reviews for each paper you submitted.
*   ACM policies forbid the uploading of author text into an LLM or similar system. Doing so, violates the author’s right to confidentiality and shares intellectual property without consent.
*   LLMs are NOT allowed to be used for writing the reviews nor the meta-reviews at any step. This policy includes but is not restricted to:You can NOT ask an LLM to write content for you. The review needs to be based on your own judgment. You can NOT share substantial content from the paper or your review with an LLM.

### SoK Papers: Systematization of Knowledge Papers

CSF 2026 solicits systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers in foundational security and privacy research. These papers systematize, re-formulate, or evaluate existing work in one established and significant research topic. Such papers must provide new insights. Survey papers without new insights are not appropriate. Papers trying to identify robust foundations of research areas still lacking them are particularly welcome. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form.

## Ethics

We expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out the research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so will result in summary rejection of a submission regardless of its quality and scientific value.

Authors are expected to document how they have addressed and mitigated the risks. If the submitted research has the potential to cause harm, and authors have access to an Institutional Review Board (IRB), we expect that this IRB is consulted and its approval and recommendations are documented in the paper.

## Important Dates AoE (UTC-12h)

*   CSF Symposium: July 26-29, 2026

## Paper Submission Instructions

Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with published proceedings.

Papers must be submitted using the two-column IEEE Proceedings style available for various document preparation systems at the [IEEE Conference Publishing Services page](https://ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/create-your-ieee-article/use-microsoft-word-or-latex-to-prepare-your-article-for-submission/ieee-conference-template-for-microsoft-word/). All papers should be at most 12 pages long, not counting bibliography and well-marked appendices. Anonymized supplementary material such as proof scripts can be uploaded as a tar ball on the submission site. Committee members are not required to read appendices, and so the paper must be intelligible without them.

CSF 2026 will employ double-blind reviewing. Submitted papers must (a) omit any reference to the authors’ names or the names of their institutions, and (b) reference the authors’ own related work in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). [Please see our frequently asked questions (FAQ)](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/conferences/csf2018/faq.html) that address many common concerns. When in doubt, contact the program chairs.

## Decisions

The outcome of the review process can be one of the following three: accept, reject, major revision. In some occasions, accepted papers are shepherded for minor modifications.

### Major revisions

Papers with “major revision” decision must be re-submitted within the following two cycles, accompanied by a writeup explaining how the revision meets reviewers’ revision requirements. The possible decisions for such resubmitted revised papers are the following: accept (possibly with shepherding) or reject, i.e., a major revision decision is excluded.

### Resubmissions of rejected papers

Rejected papers can be re-submitted at any time. If a rejected paper is re-submitted within 11 months of the last deadline they were submitted to, reviews and a writeup explaining how the current submission addresses concerns in the reviews must be submitted as supplementary material.

## What's New

There are two new things in this year’s Call that you should be sure to pay attention to:

*   Reserve Reviewer Policy
*   Data-Availability Statement

## Review Process

PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing. Each paper will typically receive three or more reviews. You will get an opportunity to respond to these reviews before decisions are finalized.

At the end of each round, each paper will receive one of the five following decisions:

*   **Accept:** Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).
*   **Reject:** Your paper will not appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).

    In addition, a resubmission in less than a year from the original submission is not guaranteed a review. A paper is considered a resubmission if, in the judgment of the Chairs, it is substantially similar to the original submission.
*   **Conditional Accept:** While the Review Committee likes the work, it would like to see some specific changes made. You will receive a list of specific required revisions.
*   **Minor Revision:** While the Review Committee likes the direction of the work, it has several concerns that it would like to see revised. These concerns go beyond what can be enumerated in a list. Thus, you may receive some specific required revisions, but can also expect to receive broader comments.
*   **Major Revision:** While the Review Committee thinks the direction of the work has promise, it has significant concerns that it would like to see revised. You may receive some specific required revisions, but will also receive broader comments that may take significantly longer to execute.

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Template:** SPLASH’s PACMPL templates and instructions are on the [SIGPLAN author information page](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/). Please use `\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review]{acmart}` at the top of your paper.
*   **Page Limit:** Initial submissions must be at most 23 pages using the template. Revisions can correspondingly go up to a maximum of 25 pages.
*   **Anonymity:** PACMPL uses double-blind reviewing. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted.
*   **Novelty:** Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Re-Publication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.
*   **Data-Availability Statement:** To help readers understand the state of the intended artifact, we ask you to add a section just before references titled Data-Availability Statement in the initial submission.
*   **Procedure:** Please submit using [HotCRP](https://oopsla2425.hotcrp.com/).
*   **Publication:** PACMPL is a Gold Open Access journal. All papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge (USD 400), but payment is not required.

## Reserve Reviewer Policy

To prepare for the possibility of a higher volume of submissions, we are implementing a new review policy: for each paper, at least one senior author must — unless exempt under the criteria specified in the source — register as a reserve reviewer. They must list their information on the submission form, and they must register themselves on TPMS.

## ACM Policies

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies.

## Submission Categories

MPLR accepts three types of submissions:

*   **Regular research papers:** describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms. Research papers will be evaluated based on their relevance, novelty, technical rigor, and contribution to the state-of-the-art. (Format: up to 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix)
*   **Work-in-progress research papers:** describing hot topics or promising new ideas, with perhaps less maturity than full papers. Work-in-progress papers will be evaluated with an emphasis on novelty and the potential of the new ideas instead of technical rigor and experimental results. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix)
*   **Industry and tool papers:** presenting technical challenges and solutions for managed language platforms in the context of deployed applications and systems. Industry and tool papers will be evaluated on their relevance, usefulness, and results. Suitability for demonstration and availability will also be considered for tool papers. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix; up to 12 pages allowed if justified by the content)

Accepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library, except if the authors prefer not to be included.

MPLR 2025 submissions must conform to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions and to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy.

MPLR 2025 will not hold its own poster session. Please consider submitting to the SPLASH poster track.

## Author Instructions

Submissions need to use the ACM SIGPLAN format with the sigplan style.

If you are using LaTeX, submissions need to use the acmart document class with the sigplan option (not the sigconf option). For ease of reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission using the LaTeX command `\settopmatter{printfolios=true}`. Please use the standard setting, e.g., the default font size for the SIGPLAN style is 10 point and the format uses two columns for the test.

All submissions need to be in PDF format. MPLR now uses double-blind reviewing. Authors should not show their names on a submission and should refer to their own work in third person. We further recommend that they avoid publicizing the work, at least under the same or similar title, while it is under review.

Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.

**Submission Site:** [https://mplr25.hotcrp.com](https://mplr25.hotcrp.com)

## Overview

NSDI focuses on the design principles, implementation, and practical evaluation of networked and distributed systems. Our goal is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community to foster a broad approach to addressing overlapping research challenges.

NSDI provides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further the knowledge and understanding of the networked systems community as a whole, continue a significant research dialog, or push the architectural boundaries of network services.

## Topics

NSDI invites any innovative solution for a significant problem involving networked systems, including topics from within the following list:

*   Highly available and reliable networked systems
*   Security and privacy of networked systems
*   Distributed storage, caching, and query processing systems
*   Sustainable, low-energy, and low-carbon networked systems
*   Cloud/multi-tenant systems
*   Mobile and embedded/sensor applications and systems
*   Systems aspects of networking hardware and physical layer communication technologies
*   Network and workload measurement systems
*   Self-organizing, autonomous, and federated networked systems
*   Managing, debugging, and diagnosing problems in networked systems
*   Virtualization and resource management for networked systems
*   Experience with deployed networked systems
*   Networked systems for big data
*   Testing and/or verification applied to networked systems
*   Networked systems for machine learning (ML) and ML for networked systems

Papers with no clear contributions to the design of systems or the networking stack will be considered out of scope.

The list of topics above is necessarily incomplete and imprecise. In its ongoing effort to adjust scope, the NSDI Steering Committee has identified a list of topics that are explicitly excluded from upcoming NSDI symposia. Papers whose core contributions are on the following topics are likely to be rejected for reasons of scope:

*   Physical layer contributions: beamforming, modulation techniques, communication through unconventional mediums (capacitative, inductive, acoustic)
*   Sensing and localization contributions: gesture sensing, environment mapping, remote sensing
*   Architecture contributions: voltage scaling, GPU resource scheduling, hardware level fault tolerance
*   User interface contributions

See the recent statement from the NSDI Steering Committee for more information about the ongoing scope adjustment process.

Authors will have the opportunity to explain why their paper is in scope for NSDI by answering the following question: What important problems or challenges in networked systems does this paper solve/address?

## Two Deadlines

NSDI '26 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines. Any paper submitted to one of these deadlines and accepted during the subsequent reviewing period will be presented at the conference and will appear as part of the proceedings. 

## One-Shot Revision

Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. Such a revision decision includes a summary of the paper's merits and a list of necessary changes that are required for the paper to be accepted at NSDI. Authors may then submit a version of their work addressing all revision instructions during the subsequent deadline. At that point, the paper will be reviewed to judge whether it addresses all the revision requirements requested.

A revise-and-resubmit decision is not a guaranteed acceptance.

During the revision period, the paper is still considered under review to NSDI and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration.

## Policy on NSDI Resubmissions

As described above, each NSDI conference consists of two deadlines: spring and fall. Papers rejected from one of these deadlines cannot be submitted to the immediate next deadline.

## Extensions of Workshop Papers

Work that extends an author's previous workshop paper is welcome, but the paper should:

*   (a) acknowledge their own previous workshop publications with an anonymous citation and
*   (b) explain the differences between the NSDI submission and the prior workshop paper.

## Resubmission of SIGCOMM '25 and HotNets '26 Papers

Authors are free to submit SIGCOMM '25 rejected papers to NSDI '26 fall and significant extensions of HotNets '26 accepted papers to NSDI '26 fall, provided that the notifications from these conferences occur before the full paper submission deadlines for NSDI.

## Operational Systems Track

NSDI '26 also solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with large-scale, operational systems and networks. Such operational papers need not present new ideas or results to be accepted; indeed, new ideas or results will not influence whether the papers are accepted.

Authors should indicate on the title page of the paper and in the submission form that they are submitting to this track.

## What to Submit

NSDI '26 is double-blind, meaning that authors should make a good faith effort to anonymize papers. Note that the operational track papers have different rules as described above.

Submissions—as well as final papers—must be no longer than 12 pages, including footnotes, figures, and tables. Submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for references and for supplementary material in appendices.

Submissions must be in two-column format, using 10-point type on 12-point (single-spaced) leading, in a text block 7"" wide x 9"" deep, with .33"" inter-column space, formatted for 8.5"" x 11"" paper.

Papers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review, and no deadline extensions will be granted for reformatting. 

If you wish, you may use the template for LaTeX available on the [conference paper templates page](/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates) . All papers must be submitted via the [submission form](https://nsdi26spring.usenix.hotcrp.com/). Please do not email submissions.

## On the Use of Generative AI

Authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper is not completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP.

## Policies

*   **Simultaneous submissions:** Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud.
*   **Extensions on workshop papers:** Previous publication at a workshop is acceptable as long as the NSDI submission includes substantial new material that has been developed since the publication of any earlier version.
*   **Online technical reports:** As added clarification for authors: NSDI allows submissions to be simultaneously stored online as technical reports, e.g., at arXiv, provided that the authors use a different title and system name in their submission from the technical report.

Authors uncertain whether their submission meets USENIX's guidelines should contact the Program Co-Chairs, [nsdi26chairs@usenix.org](mailto:nsdi26chairs@usenix.org).

Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered. All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the USENIX NSDI '26 website; rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

## Conflicts

At submission time, you must provide information about conflicts with PC members. A PC member is a conflict if any of the following three circumstances applies:

*   Institution
*   Advisor
*   Collaboration

You must not improperly identify a PC member as a conflict if none of these circumstances applies.

## Ethical Considerations

Papers describing experiments with users or user data should follow the basic principles of ethical research.

Authors must attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to, privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans.

## Processes for Accepted Papers

Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process by a member of the Program Committee.

By submitting a paper, you agree that at least one of the authors will attend the conference to present it.

All papers will be available online to registered attendees before the conference.

## Best Paper Awards

Awards will be given for the best paper(s) at the conference.

## Community Award

To encourage broader code and data sharing within the NSDI community, the conference will also present a ""Community Award"" for the best paper whose code and/or data set is made publicly available by the final paper deadline.

The 24th IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom), will be held in **Pisa, Italy in March 2026** as an in-person physical event.

PerCom is the premier annual scholarly venue in pervasive computing and communications. Pervasive computing is at the forefront of mobile systems research and has found its way into many commercial applications due to tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics such as wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, ambient intelligence, and smart devices.

## Scope

PerCom 2026 solicits research contributions in all areas pertinent to pervasive computing and communications, especially those that cross traditional research boundaries. In particular, PerCom targets contributions in:

*   Advances in pervasive systems and infrastructures:
*   Theories, models, and algorithms
*   Domain-specific challenges and novel applications
*   Intersections of PerCom with:
*   Enablers for PerCom instrumentation
*   New techniques for user-level concerns
*   Technological innovations

Contributions can be analytical, empirical, technological, methodological, or a combination thereof. Papers reporting strong systems engineering contributions backed by solid and appropriate evaluations are strongly encouraged.

Contributions should be **novel**, should demonstrate a **significant impact**, and should be **rigorous**.

Note that the impact of the contributions should be demonstrated in the context of pervasive computing and communications applications.

## Submission Details

Paper submission must be done for the main conference and all associated events via EDAS. If you do not have an EDAS account, please, register first (it’s free). The direct submission link for PerCom 2026 is [here](https://edas.info/).

PerCom 2026 will follow a double-blind review process. Authors are expected to make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions. In particular, as in previous PerCom editions, publishing pre-prints of your submitted papers in online archives (e.g., arXiv) prior to submission does NOT disqualify the paper from consideration at PerCom.

Submitted papers must be unpublished and not considered elsewhere for publication. Also, they must show a significant relevance to pervasive computing and communications. Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous review process handled by the Technical Program Committee. Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered.

The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as formatting instructions, can be found [here](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). Papers must be at most 9 pages of technical content (10pt font, 2-column format), including text, figures, and tables, and up to 1 additional page for references only.

PerCom 2026 introduces a rebuttal phase to further improve the quality of the review process. Authors are offered the opportunity to respond to the initial reviews. Particularly, they are encouraged to briefly clarify points, explain misunderstandings, etc.

All accepted papers must be presented in person by one of the authors, in addition to having an associated full registration. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the exclusion of the paper from the final proceedings and from the IEEE Digital Library, and the paper will not be eligible for the Best Paper Award.

We strongly advise authors of submitted papers to be prepared to apply for their visa (if required for entry into Italy) as soon as their paper is accepted.

Accepted papers will be published in IEEE Xplore. All accepted papers will be invited to submit an artifact abstract providing the code, data, results, etc. associated with the contribution.
