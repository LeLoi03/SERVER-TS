Scheduled for July 20â€“24, 2025, the conference will take place both in-person at the ACC Liverpool, UK, and virtually via ISCB's Nucleus platform. The event focuses on advancing computational methods for biological problems, bringing together experts from various scientific disciplines to foster dialogue and collaboration.","# ISMB/ECCB 2025: Call for Papers

We invite abstract submissions for research in bioinformatics and computational biology, covering both ongoing work (previously Late-Breaking Research) and published research from the past 18 months (previously Highlights Track). Accepted abstracts can be considered for oral and/or poster presentations.

## Submission Process

*   **Track Selection:** Submit your abstract to the Community of Special Interest (COSI) or Open Session Track that best fits your research area. You can also identify two alternative tracks during submission.
*   **Content:** Abstracts should convey a scientific result and not be an advertisement for commercial software. If your topic falls outside the listed COSIs, you can select ""General Computational Biology"".
*   **Submission Site:** All abstracts must be submitted via the conference submission site by the abstract deadlines (which are not specified in the provided text, with a note to check a non-existent table or key dates page).

## Abstract Requirements

*   **Abstract Summary:** A brief and concise summary of the background/motivation, method, results, and conclusion/significance (maximum 250 words).
*   **Long Abstract (for Talks):** If submitting for a talk, an optional PDF of up to two (2) pages can be uploaded to provide additional details, figures, and graphics.
*   **Format:** Abstracts must not contain personal information (title, position, affiliation); these details are collected via the EasyChair submission system.

## Presentation Policies

*   **Presenting Author:** All submissions must select a presenting author, who must also be a corresponding author. Presenters of accepted abstracts are required to attend the conference (either in-person or virtually) and must register and pay the conference fees.
*   **Multiple Presentations:** The same research cannot be presented as an oral presentation more than once. Research can be presented as both a talk and a poster if submitted as two separate submissions with two different presenters. A presenting author may present NO MORE THAN ONE talk or poster on the same topic.
*   **Remote Presentation Options:** ISCB strongly prefers in-person presentations. Remote presentation options are available for reasons such as maternity/paternity leave, care for a family member, personal/medical disability, sickness, financial hardship, or potential visa problems. Request for a waiver must be made by **May 15, 2024** (if granted, virtual presenters must provide a pre-recorded talk).

## LLM Policy

ISMB/ECCB 2025 follows the ISCB policy for acceptable use of large language models.

## Poster Details

*   **Presentation Hours:** Scientific research exchange for posters will be from 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM & 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM on July 21-24, 2025.
*   **Poster Size:** Recommended poster size is A0 (84.1cm wide and 118.9cm tall).
*   **Onsite Printing:** No onsite poster printing is available.
*   **Submission:** Only the poster abstract needs to be uploaded during submission. Accepted poster presenters will upload a Poster PDF and a short 5-7 minute MP4 talk closer to the conference.
*   **Review of Fields/Techniques:** Posters reviewing a specific field or technique are accepted and do not need to contain original work, but should not be advertisements.

## FAQ

*   **Multiple Abstracts:** Yes, but the same person cannot deliver more than one talk on the same topic. Labs are encouraged to involve multiple presenters.
*   **Poster PDF Submission:** No, only the abstract is required during submission. Poster PDF and talk video are uploaded later.
*   **Previously Accepted Work:** Yes, previously published work can be considered, but the publication year and DOI must be noted.

## Types of Submissions Solicited

We invite **full papers** for submission that present novel and mature research results. Full papers are limited to **20 pages** in Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and appendices.

> Papers that do not follow these formatting guidelines may be rejected without review.

While we do not accept short papers, we encourage authors to submit a poster instead, presenting original, still ongoing work that has not yet reached the maturity required for a full paper. For more information, please refer to the Call for Posters section below.

## Submission Guidelines

DIMVA 2025 will adopt a **double-blind reviewing process**. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations must be excluded from the paper. Furthermore, authors should avoid obvious self-references, and should cite their own previous work in third person, whenever necessary. Papers that are not properly anonymized risk being rejected without review.

Submissions must be original work and may not be under submission to another venue at the time of review. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to physically present the submitted work at the conference, for the paper to be included in the proceedings.

Authors are encouraged to submit code appropriately anonymized, using, e.g., [https://anonymous.4open.science/](https://anonymous.4open.science/).

### Ethical Considerations

Submissions that report experiments with data gathered from human subjects should disclose whether the research received approval from an institutional ethics review board (IRB), if applicable, and what measures were adopted to minimize risks to privacy.

Submissions that describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties (e.g., in case of probing of network devices), and how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software or system vendors or owners before publication.
