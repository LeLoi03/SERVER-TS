## Paper Types

Papers submitted to CGO can be standard research papers, tools papers or practical experience papers. All must be written in the IEEE conference format (use the conference mode), and may have up to **10 pages, references excluded**. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 10 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. In other words, papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.

Please be mindful of the [IEEE publishing policies](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/author-center/publishing-policies) when preparing and submitting your article.

### Tool Papers

Tool paper authors should prepend their paper title with ‘Tool:’ to provide clarity that this is a tools paper during the review process (this can be removed for the final camera-ready paper).

The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper. Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.

### Practical Experience Papers

Practical experience paper authors should prepend their paper title with ‘Practical:’ to provide clarity that this is a practical experience paper during the review process (this can be removed for the final camera-ready paper).

Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.

## Geographic Diversity and Inclusion

Authors of papers accepted for CGO 2026 are encouraged to present their work in person. However, to foster the participation of students and professionals from everywhere, CGO 2026 will allow the remote presentation of papers, if their authors are unable to travel to the conference venue for reasons beyond their control (e.g. visa issues).

## Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact.

## Submission Information

### Submission Site

Papers can be submitted at [https://cgo26-first-round.hotcrp.com/](https://cgo26-first-round.hotcrp.com/).

### Submission Guidelines

Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements before it is submitted:

*   The paper must be original material that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal.
*   Your submission is limited to ten (10) letter-size (8.5″x11″), single-spaced, double-column pages, using 10pt or larger font, not including references. There is no page limit for references. We strongly encourage the use of the IEEE Conference Template. Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be outright rejected at the discretion of the program chairs. (Please make sure your paper prints satisfactorily on letter-size (8.5″x11″) paper: this is especially important for submissions from countries where A4 paper is standard.)
*   Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 10 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.
*   Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper.
*   Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in the paper.
*   Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass.
*   Please number the pages.
*   To ease reviewing, please add line numbers to your submission. In LaTeX you can use the lineno package, with the ‘switch’ option.
*   The paper must be written in English.
*   The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other format, and we must be able to print the document just as we receive it.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a paper is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem OR if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the paper may be rejected.

The 45th International Conference on Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems (FORTE 2025) is a forum for fundamental research on theory, models, tools, and applications for distributed systems. It is one of the three conferences of DisCoTec 2025, the 20th International Federated Conference on Distributed Computing Techniques, held in Lille, France, June 16-20, 2025.

FORTE 2025 invites submissions focused on foundational aspects of distributed software systems, presenting approaches or tools to formally model, soundly implement, and rigorously validate these demanding but ever more necessary systems and applications.

## Topics of Interest

The main topics of interest include:

*   Language concepts for concurrency and distribution, supported by rigorous semantics, well-supported pragmatics, and/or expressive illustrative use-cases.
*   Analyses techniques, methodologies, and/or algorithms, using testing and/or verification, to validate (aspects of) the soundness of various types of concurrent and distributed systems, including communication and network protocols, service-oriented systems, adaptive distributed systems, cyber-physical systems and sensor networks.
*   Principles for qualitative and quantitative security analysis of distributed systems.
*   Applications of formal methods and techniques for studying the quality, reliability, availability, and safety of concrete distributed systems. We are specially interested in “real-life” case studies and industrial applications involving real distributed systems.
*   Emerging challenges and hot topics in distributed systems (broadly construed), such as software-defined networks, distributed ledgers, smart contracts, and blockchain technologies, etc.

## Categories of Papers

FORTE 2025 solicits papers in the following categories:

*   **Regular papers (7-15 pages, not counting references):** describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission.
*   **Tool papers (7-15 pages, not counting references):** describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of FORTE. The paper should present the underlying theory of the tool, a clear account of the tool’s functionality and limitations, and include case studies (with rigorous experimental evaluation). The tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation, including a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes (submitted until a week after the paper submission deadline). Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted.
*   **Short papers (up to 6 pages, not counting references):** describing innovative and promising ideas, possibly in an early form, or demonstrating new tools (components), or presenting (i) calls to action, or (ii) substantiated reflections on current and/or future research perspectives related to FORTE, or a summary of a published journal paper clarifying why the presentation would enrich the program of FORTE.

## Artefact Submission

We invite you to also submit an associated artefact for evaluation (AE). Artefacts such as ancillary data, tools, and software will be assessed for availability, functionality, and reusability badges.

Instructions on how to upload artefacts can be found [here](/2025/FORTE_Artefact_Evaluation_Guidelines.pdf).

Artefact submissions are mandatory for tool papers and optional for regular papers. Tool papers must submit an artefact that, at least, satisfies the requirements for the Functional badge. Papers not meeting this clause are rejected. Moreover, the acceptance of artefacts is conditional on the tool paper being accepted.

Choose the “FORTE 2025 Artefact Evaluation” track in EasyChair when submitting your artefact.

## Publication

The FORTE proceedings will be published by Springer as LNCS-IFIP volume 15732 and will comprise accepted submissions from all categories.

## Special Issue

Selected papers will be invited to a special issue of Logical Methods in Computer Science.

## Initial Manuscript Submission

Authors are invited to submit full regular papers (**6-8 pages**) of their work, reporting original research using the online submission system. Submissions of papers shorter than 5 pages may be automatically rejected.

Authors of accepted papers must submit the final paper version according to the deadline, register for the conference, and attend to present their paper(s). The maximum length for final papers is 8 pages without exceptions.

Initial Author Instructions - Work-In-Progress Papers, Technical Tracks and Special Session Papers

The submissions in the Work in Progress papers category describe research that have not yet produced the results required for a regular paper, but that due to its novelty and potential impact deserves to be shared with the community at an early stage. These submissions need to follow the guidelines for the regular and special session but limited to four (4) pages (total length including references).

WiP contributors are expected to give a short presentation of their work and to prepare a poster for the discussion forum that will take place after the presentations. More specifically, each WiP paper shall be presented by one of the authors in a very short oral presentation of 5 minutes, without any ensuing discussion, in its respective session.

Accepted and presented papers will be copyrighted to IEEE and published in conference proceedings and in the IEEE Xplore® Digital Library.

## Submission System Instructions

In the case you are using the new IES submission system for the first time, you will need to register at the ConfComm Login page. After registering wait for the confirmation email and verify your email address. If you don't get the confirmation email or have some problem with your submission, please contact us.

In case you already have an account with the IEC submission system you can [submit a paper to ETFA2025 here](https://confcomm.ieee-ies.org/app/general/conferences/ETFA25/initial-submission).

When submitting papers in the submission system, please select the correct track:

*   TT01 ... TT11 – technical tracks (regular papers).
*   SS01 … SS12 – special sessions (regular papers)
*   WS01, WS02, WS03 – workshops based on solicited papers (regular papers)
*   WIP TT01 … WIP TT11 – technical tracks (work-in-progress papers)
*   WIP SS01 … WIP SS12 – special sessions (work-in-progress papers)

Papers are solicited for regular Technical Tracks and Special Session tracks both as Regular papers and Work in progress (WIP) papers. Workshops based on solicited papers are instead accepting only regular papers (no WiP submissions will be accepted).

It brought together practitioners, researchers, and implementers of declarative programming to discuss theoretical advances, implementations, and applications. The proceedings are available online.","# FLOPS: Call for Papers

FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of declarative programming:

*   functional, logic, functional-logic programming
*   rewriting systems
*   formal methods and model checking
*   program transformations and program refinements
*   developing programs with the help of theorem provers or SAT/SMT solvers
*   verifying properties of programs using declarative programming techniques
*   foundations, language design, implementation issues (compilation techniques, memory management, run-time systems, etc.)
*   applications and case studies

FLOPS promotes cross-fertilization among different styles of declarative programming. Therefore, research papers must be written to be understandable by a wide audience of declarative programmers and researchers. In particular, each submission should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant for its area, and comparing it with previous work. Submission of system descriptions and declarative pearls are especially encouraged.

## Submission Categories

Submissions should fall into one of the following categories:

*   Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will be judged on originality, correctness, and significance.
*   System descriptions: they should describe a working system and will be judged on originality, usefulness, and design.
*   Declarative pearls: new and excellent declarative programs or theories with illustrative applications.

System descriptions and declarative pearls must be explicitly marked as such in the title.

Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally published workshops proceedings may be submitted. Authors must follow [Springer’s Code of Conduct](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct). See also the ACM SIGPLAN Republication Policy. At least one author of each accepted paper should plan to attend the conference in person to present the work: there will be no general facility for online or pre-recorded presentation (but we will do our best to accommodate visa issues and similar unavoidable obstacles).

Submissions must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages excluding references, though system descriptions and pearls are typically shorter. The formatting has to conform to Springer’s guidelines. Regular research papers should be supported by proofs and/or experimental results. In case of lack of space, this supporting information should be made accessible otherwise (e.g., a link to an anonymized web page or an appendix, which does not count towards the page limit). However, it is the responsibility of the authors to guarantee that their paper can be understood and appreciated without referring to this supporting information; reviewers may simply choose not to look at it when writing their review.

Papers should be submitted electronically at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flops2024](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flops2024).

## Reviewing Process

FLOPS 2024 will employ a light double-blind reviewing process; reviewers will not see author names until they submit a review. To facilitate this, submitted papers must adhere to two rules:

*   author names and institutions must be omitted, and
*   references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work…” but rather “We build on the work of…”).

The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas.

## Publication

The proceedings will be published by Springer International Publishing in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.

We expect to invite the authors of four to seven of the best papers to submit an extended version of their FLOPS paper to a special issue which will appear in the journal Science of Computer Programming (SCP).

The 26th Annual International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (ACM HotMobile 2025) will be held **February 26-27, 2025 in Palm Springs, CA**.

HotMobile's small workshop format makes it ideal for presenting and discussing new directions or controversial approaches.

## Call for Papers

We solicit submissions of papers that (1) focus primarily on systems and applications and (2) propose new directions of research, advocate non-traditional approaches to old (or new) ideas, or generate controversy and discussion. We especially encourage papers that identify fundamental open questions, advocate a new approach, offer a constructive critique of the state-of-the-art, debunk existing assumptions, report unexpected early results, report on promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Novel ideas need not be supported by full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations suffice.

We take a broad view of Mobile Systems research. This includes:

*   Novel applications, environments, and devices supporting mobility.
*   Operating system and distributed system support for mobile computing.
*   Wearable computing, internet of things, edge computing, sensing, and context-awareness.
*   HCI issues related to mobile computing.
*   Security and privacy of mobile computing.
*   Management, configuration, and deployment of systems supporting mobility.

## Background

“ICTs” or “Information & Communication Technologies” comprise electronic technologies for information processing and communication, as well as systems, interventions, and platforms built on such technologies and the data generated by them.

“Development” refers to a range of activities aimed at improving the lives of people, and includes, but is not restricted to poverty alleviation, education, healthcare, communication, gender equality, better governance, improved infrastructure, improved agricultural practices, environmental conservation, and sustainability.

The conference program will reflect the multidisciplinary nature of ICTD research and diverse publishing traditions within this field. Papers must address and appeal to a broad multidisciplinary audience.

## Call for Full Papers

*   Contributions should be more than six pages long (single column ACM template).
*   There is no hard page limit, but papers with length incommensurate to contributions will be rejected.
*   Accepted papers typically represent a major advance for the field of ICTD and will be presented as oral presentations.
*   Full Papers will be evaluated via double-blind peer review.
*   Full Papers will be evaluated according to their novel research contribution, methodological soundness, theoretical framing and reference to related work, quality of analysis, quality of writing and presentation, and relevance to a broad audience of researchers.
*   All acceptance will be conditional, and the final version of the paper will be checked by reviewers before final acceptance.
*   All accepted Full Papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library. A subset of the Full Papers will also appear in a special issue of the Information Technologies & International Development journal.

## ACM Open Access Publishing Model

ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance here: [https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance](https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance).

Full details of the new ICPS publishing model: [https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/faq](https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/faq)

Full details of the ACM Open program: [https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess)

Please direct all questions about the new model to [icps-info@acm.org](mailto:icps-info@acm.org).

## Human Subjects and Ethical Considerations

Authors are strongly encouraged to read and follow the community-defined [minimum ethical standards for ICTD research](https://ictdethics.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/Minimum-Ethical-Standards-for-ICTD_ICT4D-Version-2.0.pdf).

Submissions that describe experiments with human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects, or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:

*   Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable.
*   Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect.

If a paper raises significant ethical concerns, it might be rejected based on these concerns.",

## Conference History

IJCLR was initiated in 2021 through the amalgamation of:

*   the International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
*   the International Workshop on Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming (AAIP)
*   the International Workshop on Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy)
*   the International Workshop on Statistical Relational AI (StarAI)
*   the International Workshop on Cognitive AI (CogAI, joined from 2023)

## Transformation

Commencing in 2024, IJCLR has evolved from an aggregation of distinct workshops into a cohesive conference entity. This transformation encompasses the amalgamation of various topics of interest within the domains of learning and reasoning in artificial intelligence into a singular, integrated program. 

Furthermore, the conference now boasts a unified and extensive proceeding that serves as the official record for publications in this area. The ILP, AAIP, and CogAI have been integrated into the IJCLR program, signifying a consolidation of these areas under the IJCLR umbrella. Concurrently, NeSy and StarAI maintain their distinct conferences/workshops, focusing on their respective specialized topics. Despite this, they persist as pivotal components within the IJCLR framework, embodying two of the primary research domains. Their contribution to the IJCLR is further evidenced by the inclusion of dedicated area chairs and reviewers from both fields, underscoring their integral role in shaping the conference’s comprehensive academic direction and ensuring its high quality.

The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM) is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). This is the nineteenth Symposium in the series, sponsored by Florida Atlantic University. The Symposium will be held **January 7-9, 2026**, in **Ft. Lauderdale, Florida**.

## About the Symposium

ISAIM seeks submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled lessons learned from the development of the application. Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day Symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions.

Work that will have been published as of January 2026 should not be submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the previously published work. However, the ISAIM website proceedings are not archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review elsewhere at the time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM.

Authors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in an archival special volume of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and unpublished to be considered for the special volume.
