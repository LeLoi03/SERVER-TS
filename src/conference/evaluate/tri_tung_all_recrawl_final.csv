The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW) is the premier venue for human-centered research in the design, use, and evaluation of technologies that support or affect social, cooperative, and collaborative practices in groups, organizations, communities, and networks.

CSCW 2026 will explore topics across sociotechnical domains including work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, design, entertainment, and ethics, with a particular focus on social computing and social media, crowdsourcing, and technologies for co-located or remote collaboration, communication, education, work articulation, coordination, awareness, and information sharing.

Submissions are expected to report on novel results from human-centered research discussing the design, development, use, and/or analysis of CSCW and social computing systems. New human-centered approaches to the conceptualization or critical analysis of such systems are also welcome.

Submissions exploring how computing technologies—including AI, machine learning, robotics, and AR/VR—relate to questions of race, indigeneity, gender, and the environment are particularly encouraged, provided they are properly contextualized within cooperative, collaborative, or social computing issues.

## Scope Guidelines

*   Contributions must have a focus on **social aspects of technology mediation** and be properly contextualized in the CSCW literature, referencing CSCW concepts and/or theories.
*   Papers whose research contributions are primarily of relevance or benefit to **individual users** will be considered out of scope.
*   Systems-based or algorithmic research not explicitly involving aspects of cooperative, collaborative, or social computing are also out of scope.

Authors should clearly state how their work builds upon, bridges, discusses, or cites prior CSCW work and offers new knowledge for the CSCW community, and how the results are useful for thinking about the design of computing technologies to support cooperative/collaborative work or social interactions.

## Topics of Interest

*   **Social and crowd computing:** Social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds, collaborative information behaviors.
*   **CSCW and social computing system development:** Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, toolkits for building social and collaborative systems.
*   **Methodologies and tools:** Novel human-centered methods, approaches, and tools for building or studying collaborative systems.
*   **Critical, historical, ethnographic analyses:** Studies of technologically enabled social, cooperative, and collaborative practices, including their political or ethical dimensions.
*   **Empirical investigations:** Findings, guidelines, and studies of social practices, communication, cooperation, collaboration, or use related to CSCW and social technologies.
*   **Domain-specific applications:** Healthcare, transportation, design, manufacturing, gaming, ICT4D, sustainability, education, accessibility, global collaboration.
*   **Ethics and policy implications:** Analysis of the implications of sociotechnical systems and algorithms.
*   **Emerging technologies:** Mobile and ubiquitous computing, game engines, virtual worlds, multi-touch, novel display technologies, vision and gesture recognition, big data, MOOCs, crowd labor markets, SNSs, computer-aided or robotically-supported work, sensing systems.
*   **Crossing boundaries:** Studies exploring interactions across fields of research, disciplines, distances, languages, generations, and cultures.

## Submission Model

CSCW 2026 will use a **two-round review process** with the opportunity for major revisions.

Accepted papers will be published in the **Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACM HCI)**.

**All CSCW 2026 papers will be published under ACM Open Access.**

The 17th ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computing Systems, **EICS 2025**, will take place from **June 23-27, 2025 in Trier, Germany**.

EICS focuses on engineering interactive computing systems and their user interfaces, addressing software quality factors such as usability, user experience, reliability, and security.

## About EICS

EICS 2025 is the sixteenth international ACM SIGCHI conference devoted to engineering interactive computing systems and their user interfaces. Work presented at EICS covers all stages of the engineering life-cycle of interactive systems - inception, requirements, design, specification, coding, data analytics, validation and verification, deployment and maintenance.

EICS focuses on models, languages, notations, methods, techniques and tools that support designing, developing, validating and verifying interactive systems.

## Call for Full Papers & Technical Notes

EICS Full Papers and Technical Notes are published as articles in the Journal Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACM - EICS series). There are three submission deadlines per year, and authors can choose when to submit. Papers may be accepted after submission and review or may be recommended for revisions and re-submission to the next round.

Submissions for the journal of this venue should present original and mature research work within the scope of the conference. Accepted journal papers can be either regular research papers or technical notes.

Technical Notes are shorter, more focused contributions that focus specifically on system contributions and technical work. They require an illustrative example of the system and can be validated through simulation, feasibility, or comparisons. Tech Notes will be judged on their technical merits and relevance to interactive systems concerns.

There are no length restrictions on Full Papers and Technical Notes, nor any limit to the number of references that may be included.

Full Papers and Technical Notes should be written in the ACM format; see [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions)

Papers are submitted using [https://new.precisionconference.com](https://new.precisionconference.com)

## Topics

Submissions advance the state of the art of the engineering of interactive systems. Topics include, but are not limited to:

*   Modeling, specification, and analysis of interaction and interactive systems
*   Requirements engineering for interactive systems
*   Methods, processes, principles, and/or tools for building interactive systems (e.g., design, implementation, prototyping, evaluation, verification and validation, testing)
*   Software architectures for interactive systems
*   Formal methods within interactive systems engineering
*   Bridging the gap between engineering and design practices
*   Engineering design and evaluation tools
*   Computational techniques for designing and evaluating interactive systems
*   Interactive data-driven systems
*   Explore and/or employ diverse interaction techniques and devices (e.g., adaptive, context-aware, tangible, haptic, touch and multitouch input, voice, gestures, recognition of physiological signals, multimodal input, mobile and wearable systems, virtual, augmented, mixed and extended reality)
*   Engineering hardware or software integration in interactive systems (e.g., fabrication and maker processes, physical computing, cyber-physical systems)
*   Engineering interactive systems for diverse user groups (e.g., children, elderly, people with disabilities,…)
*   Engineering collaborative multi-user interactive systems
*   Engineering interactive systems embedding AI-technologies
*   Engineering interaction-driven AI-technologies
*   Applying AI technologies in methods, processes, and tools for building interactive systems in all stages of the engineering lifecycle

## Instructions for Authors

ACISP 2025 will have two rounds of submission. Round one will be on 6 Nov 2024. Round two will be on 19 February 2025. The first round will have the results including reject, major revision, and accept. For the major revision, we encourage authors to submit the updated manuscripts to round two. Round two only includes accept and reject.

All the submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted to another conference or journal for consideration of publication. Submissions must be fully anonymous with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references. Submissions must be written in English and have at most 20 pages including bibliography using Springer's LNCS package with no changes to the style. Submissions can exceed 20 pages, but any content beyond 20 pages should be placed in the Appendix. Papers should be sufficiently intelligible and self-contained without appendices so that PC members can make decisions without reading appendices. Submissions not meeting the submission guidelines risk rejection regardless of their merits.

The proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag as a volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Accepted papers will be limited to 20 pages (including bibliography and appendices) in LNCS format. Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that at least one of the authors will register and attend the conference and present their paper.
