A good paper will:

*   Motivate a significant problem
*   Propose an interesting and compelling solution
*   Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution
*   Draw appropriate conclusions
*   Clearly describe the paper's contributions
*   Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work

### Submission Scope and Relevance

The OSDI steering committee, in maintaining a three-decade tradition of a single-track program, is committed to deepening discussions on key computer systems topics. Starting from OSDI '25, there will be a deliberate focus on selecting papers that offer significant contributions to computer systems research and align with community interests. Reviewers will evaluate submissions based on the topic relevance to computer systems and their potential to impact future research and practices in computer systems. Additionally, submissions must demonstrate relevance and offer unique insights to capture the interest of a substantial portion of OSDI attendees. By adhering to these criteria, OSDI aims to continue its legacy by focusing on innovative research that addresses pressing needs in the computer systems field.

## Submission Instructions

*   **Accepted Paper Length:** Accepted papers will be allowed 14 pages in the proceedings, plus references.
*   **Formatting:** Papers not meeting the criteria will be rejected without review. Pages should be numbered, and figures and tables should be legible in black and white, without requiring magnification.
*   **Supplementary Material:** Authors may upload supplementary material in files separate from their submissions. PC members are not required to read supplementary material. Each paper must stand alone without it.
*   **Anonymity:** The paper review process is double-blind. Authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions and should not identify themselves or their institutions either explicitly or by implication.
*   **Abstract Registration:** Registering abstracts a week before paper submission is essential for PC members to identify qualified reviewers. Abstracts that do not provide sufficient information will be rejected, precluding paper submission.
*   **Conflicts:** Authors must provide information about conflicts with PC members when registering their abstract.
*   **Simultaneous Submission:** Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud.
*   **Prior/Concurrent Publication:** Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in OSDI. Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, is permitted, but your OSDI submission must use an anonymized name for your project or system.
*   **Remote Presentation:** For very special circumstances, USENIX may provide the possibility of remote presentation and Q&A.

The conference welcomes contributions on a wide spectrum of network measurement topics, including a dedicated track for replicability and reproducibility.","# Call for Papers

The Passive and Active Measurement (PAM) conference brings together researchers and operators to discuss novel and emerging work in the area of network measurement and analysis. PAM is inclusive of all areas of network measurement, but focuses on systems-based research and real-world data. Measurement technology is needed at all layers of the network stack, and work with operational impact or relevance to the broader network research community is especially welcomed, as are early and promising measurement techniques and replications or reproductions of existing studies.

PAM 2025 will be organized as a **virtual meeting**.

## Topics of Interest

Original contributions that advance the state-of-the-art in the following areas are invited:

*   Applications (e.g., web, streaming, games)
*   Data centers and cloud computing
*   Energy
*   IoT (e.g., smart home, SCADA, ICS, embedded systems)
*   Measurement tools and software
*   Network security
*   User privacy
*   Overlays (e.g., P2P, CDNs)
*   Physical Layer
*   Routing
*   Social networks
*   Topology
*   Transport/congestion control
*   User behavior and experience, QoE
*   Virtualization (e.g., SDN, NFV)
*   Visualization
*   Wireless, cellular, and mobile
*   Replicability and reproducibility track

Although PAM traditionally attracts early stage contributions, works that are a reappraisal or independent validation of previous results, or which enhance the reproducibility of network measurement research, for instance by publishing new datasets on an existing topic, are explicitly included in PAM’s scope.

## Replicability and Reproducibility Track

PAM 2025 will trial a new Replicability and Reproducibility Track for submissions that aim to reproduce or replicate results that have been previously published at PAM, TMA, IMC or the measurements track at SIGCOMM, CoNEXT, SIGMETRICS or other networking conferences. For the definitions of replicability and reproducibility, please see ACM’s site.

It is expected that a paper in this track explicitly explains the following:

*   Which paper the authors aim to replicate/reproduce.
*   Whether the paper will be replicated or reproduced.
*   What the PAM community stands to learn from the replication or reproduction.

Authors must clearly mark a replicability/reproducibility paper in HotCRP as such and must include a full citation of the work(s) the paper aims to replicate or reproduce.

Papers in this track should offer comparisons and analysis to the systems, settings, and data used in the work they replicate.

As described in similar replication tracks (e.g., USENIX SOUPS), replication papers:

*   Will be held to the same technical standards as other submissions,
*   Should use up to date methodologies and avoid using outdated techniques only because they appeared in previous studies,
*   May repeat procedures of existing studies, or explore their extensibility,
*   And should provide an explanation of the value of performing a replication study.

Submissions will be assessed by the PAM TPC and must conform to the same criteria and rules as full submissions on the main track.

## Submission Guidelines

### General Submission

Authors should only submit original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. PAM welcomes both short and long submissions. This includes early-stage contributions of work that is less mature but shows exciting promise, articulates a high-level vision, and describes challenging future directions for the community or validates, verifies important results, or presents new ideas that challenge existing assumptions.

Submissions should describe original research, with succinctness appropriate to the topics and themes they discuss. We will consider paper submissions that extend previously published short, or preliminary papers (including PAM short papers), following the model of the ACM SIGCOMM policy.

### Submission Requirements

All submissions must satisfy the following requirements:

*   Follow Springer LNCS format.
*   **Short papers:** Up to 11 pages for technical content (up to 5 pages for appendices and references).
*   **Long papers:** Up to 24 pages for technical content (up to 5 pages for appendices and references).
*   *Note:* Reviewers are not required to read appendices. Everything needed to evaluate the paper should appear in the first 11 pages for short and 24 pages for long papers.

### Anonymization

*   Reviewing will be **double-blind**.
*   Do not include names or affiliations of authors in the submission.
*   Refer to your prior work in the third person.
*   Make a best effort to anonymize system names that would give you away.
*   If you have any concerns about how to anonymize your paper while maintaining its integrity, contact the PC chairs.

### Submission System

Please submit your paper at: [https://hotcrp.dacs.utwente.nl/pam2025/](https://hotcrp.dacs.utwente.nl/pam2025/)

## Ethical Considerations

> Ethics will be considered during the review process. Each paper must include a statement detailing the ethical considerations of the work. If the authors believe the submission does not raise ethical concerns, authors must indicate so in a short statement that is clearly marked in the paper. The ethical considerations sections should either be included as a clearly marked appendix (entitled “Ethical considerations”) or a clearly marked section in the main body of the paper.
>
> Papers describing experiments with users or sensitive user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information) must follow basic precepts of ethical research and subscribe to community norms. These include: respect for privacy, secure storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent if users are placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential, beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), and risk mitigation.
>
> Authors may want to consult the Menlo Report for further information on ethical principles and the Allman/Paxson IMC 2007 paper for guidance on ethical data sharing.
>
> Note that submitting research for approval by each author’s institutional ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient – in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will consider the ethical soundness and justification of any paper, just as it does its technical soundness. Authors unsure about ethical issues are welcome to contact the program committee co-chairs. If work has been submitted to an IRB or ethics committee, the ethical considerations section or appendix should clearly indicate this and - if available - must include the reference number of the IRB/ethics committee approval.

## Awards

There will be two awards for papers of exceptional merit:

*   **Best Paper Award:** will recognize the paper that is deemed by the committee to have the highest merit of all the submissions.
*   **Community Contribution Award:** will be given to the best paper that makes relevant datasets, source code, or platforms available to the public by the time the camera-ready is submitted. These artifacts must be sufficiently documented such that any researcher can use them to repeat the results or procedures described in the paper, and they must be placed in a sufficiently long-lived archival repository (e.g., Github, Bitbucket, or CRAWDAD).

The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation (PEPM) has a history going back to 1991 and has been held in conjunction with POPL every year since 2006. The origin of PEPM is in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over time, PEPM has broadened its scope to include a variety of research areas centered around semantics-based program manipulation — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analyzed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties.

PEPM 2025 will be held on **January 21, 2025**, in **Denver, Colorado, United States**, in conjunction with POPL 2025.

## Scope

In addition to the traditional PEPM topics, PEPM 2025 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular:

*   Semantics-based and machine-learning-based program synthesis and program optimization.
*   Modeling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications.

More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2025 include, but are not limited to:

*   Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation.
*   Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation.
*   Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation.
*   Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security.

This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the program co-chairs, Guillaume Allais (guillaume.allais@strath.ac.uk) and Annie Liu (liu@cs.stonybrook.edu).

## Submission Instructions

### Submission System

Paper submission must be done for the main conference and all associated events via [EDAS](https://edas.info/). If you do not have an EDAS account, please register first (it’s free).

### Anonymization

PerCom 2026 will follow a **double-blind review process**. Authors are expected to make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions. In particular, publishing pre-prints of your submitted papers in online archives (e.g., arXiv) prior to submission does NOT disqualify the paper from consideration at PerCom. Moreover, we instruct reviewers NOT to go searching for pre-prints of submitted papers.

### Format and Length

*   Submitted papers must be unpublished and not considered elsewhere for publication.
*   Only electronic submissions in **PDF format** will be considered.
*   The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as formatting instructions, can be found [here](https://percom.org/submission-instructions/).
*   Papers must be at most **9 pages** of technical content (10pt font, 2-column format), including text, figures, and tables, and up to **1 additional page for references only**.

## Review Process

*   PerCom 2026 introduces a **rebuttal phase**. Authors are offered the opportunity to respond to the initial reviews. Particularly, they are encouraged to briefly clarify points, explain misunderstandings, etc.
*   Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous review process handled by the Technical Program Committee.

## Publication and Awards

*   The best paper will receive the prestigious **Mark Weiser Best Paper Award**.
*   Selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions for a **special issue of the Pervasive and Mobile Computing Journal**.
*   Accepted papers will be published in **IEEE Xplore**.
*   All accepted papers will be invited to submit an artifact abstract providing the code, data, results, etc. associated with the contribution.

## Community Engagement

*   All accepted papers **must be presented** in person by one of the authors, in addition to having an associated full registration.
*   Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the exclusion of the paper from the final proceedings and from the IEEE Digital Library, and the paper will not be eligible for the Best Paper Award.
*   Authors are strongly advised to be prepared to apply for their visa (if required for entry into Italy) as soon as their paper is accepted.
*   Remote presentations and pre-recorded videos are not allowed unless all authors of an accepted paper are under special circumstances that prevent them from attending the conference in person. Requests for such exceptions will be considered carefully by the organizing committees. We are sympathetic to concerns and sentiments about our in-person focus. We will accommodate remote authors/speakers if they have Visa-related travel or COVID/health-related travel issues on case-by-case basis.

PLOS 2025 is held in conjunction with the href=""https://sigops.org/s/conferences/sosp/2025/"" - **31st ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP '25)**.

## Rationale

This workshop brings together researchers and developers from the PL and OS domains to discuss recent work at the intersection of these fields. It serves as a venue for discussing new visions, challenges, experiences, problems, and solutions arising from the application of advanced programming and software engineering concepts to OS construction, and vice versa.

## Suggested Paper Topics

*   Domain-specific and type-safe languages for the OS;
*   The design of language-specific unikernels;
*   Language-based approaches to crosscutting system concerns, such as security and run-time performance;
*   PL support for system verification, testing, and debugging;
*   Synthesis of OS code;
*   Static/dynamic OS configuration and specialization;
*   PL support for OS integration of modern hardware (NVM, HBM, FPGAs, accelerators, RDMA, etc.);
*   The use of OS abstractions and techniques in language runtimes;
*   Verification and static analysis of OS components;
*   Critical evaluations of new programming language ideas in support of OS construction; and
*   Experience reports on applying new language techniques in commercial OS settings.

## Agenda

The workshop will be a highly interactive event with an agenda designed to promote focused and lively discussions. Part of the workshop program will be based on paper presentations. PLOS welcomes research, experience, and position papers; papers describing industrial experience are particularly encouraged.

The 47th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP 2026) will be held from **May 18-21, 2026**, at the **Hilton San Francisco Union Square, San Francisco, CA**.

## Overview

Since 1980, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for presenting developments in computer security and electronic privacy, and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field.

## Submission Topics

We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in any aspect of security or privacy. Papers may present advances in the theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and measurement of secure systems. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice.

Topics of interest include:

*   Applied cryptography
*   Attacks with novel insights, techniques, or results
*   Authentication, access control, and authorization
*   Blockchains and distributed ledger security
*   Cloud computing security
*   Cyber physical systems security
*   Distributed systems security
*   Economics of security and privacy
*   Embedded systems security
*   Formal methods and verification
*   Hardware security
*   Hate, Harassment, and Online Abuse
*   Human-centered security and privacy
*   Intrusion detection and prevention
*   Malware and unwanted software
*   Network security and measurement
*   ML - Methods for confidentiality and privacy of data in ML systems
*   ML - Methods for integrity and availability of ML systems
*   ML - Novel attacks on ML systems
*   ML - Verifying security and privacy properties of ML algorithms
*   Operating systems security
*   Privacy-enhancing technologies, anonymity, and censorship
*   Program and binary analysis
*   Protocol security
*   Security and privacy metrics
*   Security and privacy policies
*   Security architectures
*   Security for at-risk populations
*   Software supply chain security
*   Systems security
*   User studies for security and privacy
*   Web security and privacy
*   Wireless and mobile security/privacy

This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; S&P is interested in all aspects of computer security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to security or privacy, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.

## Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers

We solicit SoK papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge. Suitable papers provide an important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate.

Submissions should be prefixed with “**SoK:**” in the title and have a checkbox selected on the submission form.

*   **Submission Deadline:** April 1, 2026 (AoE)
*   **Author Response Period:** TBD
*   **Author Notification:** July 3rd, 2026
*   **Camera Ready Due:** August 28, 2026
*   **Workshops:** September 29, 2026
*   **Conference:** September 30, 2026 - October 2, 2026
*   **Submission Site:** [HotCRP Submission Site](http://sosp26.hotcrp.com/)
*   **Artifact Evaluation:** [Sysartifact-website](https://sysartifacts.github.io/sosp2026/)

## Topics

SOSP takes a broad view of systems and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including:

*   Operating systems
*   File and storage systems
*   Distributed systems
*   Cloud computing
*   Mobile and edge systems
*   Secure and reliable systems
*   Systems aspects of big data and machine learning
*   Embedded and real-time systems
*   Virtualization
*   Networking as it relates to operating systems
*   Management and troubleshooting of complex systems

We also welcome work that explores the interaction of computer systems with related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, verification, and databases. Preference will be given to work that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with or measurements of state-of-the-art implementations.

## Submission Criteria

Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. A good paper will:

*   Motivate a significant problem;
*   Propose and implement an interesting, compelling solution;
*   Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution;
*   Draw appropriate conclusions;
*   Clearly describe the paper's contributions;
*   Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work.

## Artifact Evaluation

SOSP will continue the successful tradition of running an optional Artifact Evaluation process. Authors have a few days after acceptance notifications to register their artifact and then a few more days to polish them for evaluation. The process is cooperative, allowing authors to fix problems found by evaluators.

## Originality and Resubmissions

Submissions must contain original, unpublished material. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism is not allowed.

Prior or concurrent workshop publication is permitted, provided authors submit a copy of the workshop paper and explain the new material in the conference paper. Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts (like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, social media) is explicitly permitted.

Resubmissions of papers previously rejected from other conferences are permitted, but authors must have improved the paper to address substantive issues raised in previous reviews and provide a summary of the revisions.

## Anonymity

SOSP will use **double-blind reviewing**. Authors must make a good faith attempt to anonymize their submissions:

*   Avoid explicit or implicit identification of yourself or your institution.
*   Use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of author names on the first page.
*   Anonymize project or system names if they are already known to the community (e.g., via arXiv).
*   Reference your own related work in the third person, as you would any other author's work (e.g., ""Our system modifies the XYZ operating system built by Lee et al. [Lee17]"").
*   For concurrent submissions on related topics, cite an anonymized version and discuss the relation, and email a copy of the concurrent submission to the PC chairs.
*   If reporting on institutional experiences, refer to the system anonymously but describe necessary system properties.
*   Check with the program chairs if uncertain about anonymity rules.

Submissions that allow author identification may be rejected or returned for editing.

## Supplementary Material

Authors may optionally include supplementary material as a separate document for items not critical for evaluation but of interest to readers (e.g., formal proofs, additional analyses). The submission must stand alone without it.

## Formatting

*   Submissions must be in **PDF format** via the web submission form.
*   Maximum **12 pages** of technical content (excluding bibliography).
*   Use A4 or US letter paper size.
*   Text and figures must fit inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block.
*   Use two columns separated by 8 mm (0.33 in) whitespace.
*   Use 10-point font on 12-point leading.
*   Graphs and figures should be readable in grayscale and color.
*   All pages should be numbered, and references hyperlinked.
*   Submissions violating formatting rules will not be considered. Use the [official SIGPLAN LaTeX](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) or [MS Word templates](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) from the ACM.

## Confidentiality

Submissions will be treated as confidential. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors must provide information about conflicts with PC members during submission. Conflicts include:

*   **Institutional:** Same institution (employed within the past two years), or upcoming employment.
*   **Advisor:** Past or present association as PhD thesis advisor or advisee.
*   **Collaborator:** Collaboration on a project, publication, grant, or editorship within the past two years.
*   **Personal:** Close family relatives.

PC members cannot review papers they are conflicted with.

## Author Response Period

Authors will have an opportunity to respond to reviews. Responses should be limited to:

*   Correcting factual errors in reviews.
*   Directly addressing reviewer questions.

Responses must not include new experiments, promise future work, or rely on supplementary materials.

## Accepted Papers

Papers will be subject to revision and approval by a program committee shepherd. Authors of accepted papers are expected to supply electronic versions and are encouraged to supply source code and raw data for artifact evaluation. All accepted papers will be made available online in advance of the conference. Papers of particular merit may be forwarded to ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS) or Communications of the ACM's Research Highlights (CACM RH).

## Types of Submissions

We encourage researchers to submit three categories of papers to the symposium:

*   **Technical papers:** Original long (up to 8 pages plus up to one page of references) and short (up to 4 pages plus up to one page of references) papers are the standard category. We welcome technical papers that report substantial original research in search or in related areas that are not under review in other archival conferences or journals.
*   **Position papers:** In addition to the main technical track, we encourage authors to submit original long (up to 8 pages plus up to one page of references) and short (up to 4 pages plus up to one page of references) position papers discussing ideas and concepts related to heuristic and combinatorial search. Examples of position papers could include thoughtful critiques or bold new perspectives of the field, historical perspectives and analysis, technical discussions of various implementation techniques, methodological contributions, and insightful reports on new and demanding applications.
*   **Extended abstracts:** To foster the exchange of ideas at SoCS, we encourage authors to submit extended abstracts (up to 2 pages, including references) of original work, work-in-progress, or work that has recently appeared in or is under review at other venues such as AAAI/ICAPS/IJCAI. Most archival conferences do not consider a 2-page extended abstract as preventing the submission of a full-length technical paper giving full details on the same work. For recently published work, authors can alternatively submit their original published paper for review (no page limit and no need to remove author information, but please indicate on the front page when and where the paper was published). If the submission is accepted, authors will then be required to submit a 2-page abstract for the proceedings. The submitted version itself will not be reprinted in the proceedings. All extended abstract submissions will be lightly reviewed in order to ensure that they are of interest to the SoCS community.

## Submission Instructions

*   Submitted technical and position papers must be original and not submitted concurrently to a journal or another conference. **Double-blind reviewing** will be provided, so submitted papers must omit **author names and affiliations**.
*   Extended abstracts representing previously published or under-review work should mention this on the first page (e.g., in the title).
*   The paper submission is a two-step process. First, the paper abstract needs to be registered in EasyChair by the Paper abstract submission deadline. Then, the full paper in PDF is due by the Paper submission deadline. Remember, without registering your abstract on time, you will not be allowed to submit the paper later.
*   Submissions may be accompanied by supplementary material (video, appendices), which must also be anonymized. Reviewers will not be required to consult such material - submitted paper should stand on their own. The omission of supplementary material will not disadvantage a submission during the review.
*   SoCS will not accept any technical or position paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Authors are also required not to submit their technical or position papers elsewhere during SoCS's review period.

*   [Author kit](https://aaai.org/authorkit25/)
*   [Submission link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=socs2025)

## Important Dates

All deadlines are at 23:59 UTC-12.

*   **Paper abstract submission deadline:** March 19, 2025 (now closed)
*   **Paper submission deadline:** March 26, 2025 (now closed)
*   **Author response:** May 2-5, 2025 (already past)

As this year's theme is **'Tide + Tied'**, we invite submissions that explore interdisciplinary knowledge, bridging the physical and digital, technology and humanity, resurgence and convergence, and beyond. We expect submissions to be clearly framed within the rapidly developing tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction field. Works framed as research through design and more technical contributions are particularly welcome.

TEI '26 is planned as a hybrid conference, allowing remote participants to present and attend portions of the program. However, only in-person attendance will offer the full 'tangible and embodied' experience.

## Contribution Types

Authors are invited to submit high-quality papers that contribute to advancing this rapidly developing field. We highlight the following non-exclusive set of contribution types:

*   **Artifact:** Research artifacts that advance the state of the art in Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction. Artifacts can demonstrate new technologies (e.g., new sensing techniques or algorithms), new forms of input (e.g., novel interaction techniques) or new designs (e.g., provocative or evocative objects, systems or services).
*   **Method:** Tools, approaches and techniques that enable researchers, technologists, designers and practitioners to study, research and work in Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction. Methods can include new forms of study design or data analysis, as well as new engineering processes or frameworks.
*   **Theory:** Explorations, extensions, refutions, instantiations and other developments of and to the theories pertaining to Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction, such as theories of cognition or the mind as well as design theories and conceptual frameworks.
*   **Empirical:** Studies and data that add to our understanding of Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction by, for example, providing quantitative accounts of salient aspects of human performance or qualitative characterizations of experiences with tangible artifacts and systems. Empirical submissions can detail outcomes from a very wide range of lab, field and online studies.

Each contribution type will be peer-reviewed on its own merits. We seek high-quality work regardless of the specific subdomain or topic, and we expect the work to be positioned firmly in, and building on, prior research in our field.

## Paper Length and Submission

Authors are encouraged to submit a paper with a length proportional to its contribution. While there is no maximum or minimum length for papers, the length of typical submissions is expected to be approximately **7,000–8,000 words** excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a submission relative to its method and length. Papers should be succinct but thorough in presenting the work. Shorter, more focused papers are encouraged and will be reviewed like any other paper. Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected.

Accepted submissions of all contribution types will be included as papers in the conference proceedings, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract Deadline:** July 31, 2025, AoE
*   **Full Submission Deadline:** August 7, 2025, AoE
*   **Video and Supplementary Material Deadline:** August 14, 2025, AoE

## Submission Guidelines

### ACM Format Requirements

TEI 2026 uses the new ACM workflow TAPS for submission templates and published papers. TAPS requires the use of a simplified **one-column template for submission**, while the final two-column paper will be rendered for publication after acceptance. We strongly recommend using the LaTeX templates rather than Word.

Papers do not have a page limit. All relevant information, including submission templates in Word and LaTeX, can be found here: [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions)

### Authorship Policy

Your submission must be original. TEI only accepts original submissions. This means that your submission cannot have been published in another peer-reviewed venue or be under concurrent review at another peer-reviewed venue. Similarly, if you make multiple submissions to TEI 2026 Papers, their contributions must be distinct & self-contained from each other. Please refer to the [ACM policy on authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) for details.

Authors should avoid using text generated by AI-tools (e.g., LLMs such as ChatGPT or similar). The use of AI-tools must be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of your submission.

### Anonymization Policy

All papers must be anonymized for review. Author and affiliation sections and credits must be left blank. Authors of accepted submissions will add this information in preparation of the ""camera-ready"" version. We use a relaxed model that does not attempt to conceal all traces of identity from the body of the paper. Refer to the [ACM IMWUT Anonymization Policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/journal/imwut/author-policies#:~:text=with%20the%20Editors.-,Anonymization,in%20the%20PDF%20meta%2Ddata).

Authors are expected to remove author and institutional identities from the title and header areas of the paper. Make sure that no description that can easily reveal authors' names and/or affiliations is included in the submission (e.g., too detailed descriptions of where user studies were conducted). Also, please make sure that identifying information does not appear in the document's metadata (e.g., the 'Authors' field in your word processor's 'Save As' dialog box). In addition, we require that the acknowledgements section be left blank, as it could also easily identify the authors and/or their institution. Further suppression of identity in the body of the paper is left to the authors' discretion. We do expect that authors leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. However, authors are encouraged, but not required, to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid ""As described in our previous work [10], … "" and use instead ""As described by Jones et al. [10], …""

### Policy on Use of Large Language Models

Text and images generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author's own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools, and we refer to it for guidance. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect LLM-generated text, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk-reject papers where LLM use is not clearly marked.

### Submission Platform

All abstracts and, subsequently, full papers must be submitted electronically via the [Precision Conference (PCS) website](https://precisionconference.com/) before their respective deadlines. At the time of submission, authors must select their preferred presentation format.

## Review Process

1.  Paper bidding by the Associate Chairs (ACs).
2.  Program chairs will assign each paper to a primary AC (1AC) and a secondary AC (2AC).
3.  The 1AC will find two external reviewers.
4.  Each external reviewer and the 2AC will write a detailed review of their assigned submissions and assess the contribution of the research to the field. Thus, each paper will receive 3 detailed reviews.
5.  The 1AC is responsible for the quality of the reviews and will write a meta-review of the paper, summarising the reviews from the two external reviewers and the 2AC. If 1ACs disagree with the other reviews, they are encouraged to write a separate review in addition to the meta-review.
6.  The 1AC will present a recommendation for the paper's acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs.
7.  Program Chairs will decide the final acceptance of all papers for inclusion in the program in a discussion phase, based on the 1AC recommendation, the reviews and fit to the conference.

## After Acceptance

After conditional acceptance, authors will have the opportunity to implement minor modifications at the discretion of the Program Chairs. Authors will receive confirmation of final acceptance after the camera-ready version is submitted. One author of each accepted paper is required to register for TEI 2026. Accepted papers will be included in the Proceedings of TEI 2026, and will become available in the ACM Digital Library and be distributed digitally to conference delegates as part of the conference proceedings.

At the conference, authors of accepted submissions must present their work and be available to answer questions from other conference participants. Presenters of papers will have a presentation slot at the conference of approximately 20 minutes, though this may be altered prior to the conference based on scheduling needs. Information on presentations will be sent by email to the corresponding author. Papers whose authors do not present in any form (talk, demo and/or poster) may be removed from the ACM Digital Library and the conference proceedings.

Accepted authors should ensure they have obtained permissions to use licensed content and images that depict identifiable people in their conference contributions (papers/pictorial, videos, and presentations). Authors will also be required to give permission to include their contributions in the ACM Digital Library. Authors can either assign copyright or a license to the ACM or they can pay a fee to ACM for open access. More information on rights management can be found here: [https://authors.acm.org/](https://authors.acm.org/). Finally, and as part of this rights management process, presenting authors will be asked to opt-in to and grant permission to record and/or stream their presentations at the conference.

## TEI Ethical Research Statement

As a TEI community, we follow the ACM ethical research guidelines and adhere to the ACM policy of involving human participants. Authors are encouraged to include details in the methodology section on participants' recruitment, selection, and consent. Deviations or novel considerations should be discussed, when different from typical practice.

For details, please consult the ACM guidelines below:

1.  [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)
2.  [ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects)

## TAPS Procedure

Further details on the TAPS publication procedure, what happens after acceptance of your paper? Read the following page carefully if you have not yet done so: [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) For papers to be published via TAPS, the following steps will take place:

*   Some time after you submitted the copyright form that you receive from ACM, you will receive an email from TAPS asking you to upload your source files and supplementary files to TAPS.
*   We strongly suggest using the LaTeX template instead of the Word template for preparing the camera-ready (TAPS) version. Finalizing the submission using the Word template/workflow has caused authors some frustration. Please use the ACM Master Article Class and the included template.
*   If you are using the Word template, please prepare and submit your camera-ready version as a single-column manuscript by following these ACM provided guidelines: [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions)
*   Prepare your source files and pack them into a ZIP file that follows the directory structure shown on the TAPS page. Note: You are also required to submit PDF version of your paper. However, this PDF is just for troubleshooting – all content for the Digital Library is compiled directly from the sources.
*   Upload the ZIP file either via the upload form on the TAPS page (only for small files) or by uploading it to the external service linked on the TAPS page.
*   TAPS will check whether the sources are valid and can be compiled. After some time the TAPS page will either show you a success message or an error message (you need to check the page manually from time to time).
*   In the latter case, you will be given an error log. Please fix all issues and upload the ZIP file again until the manuscript compiles successfully.
*   Once upload and compilation are completed successfully, you need to check whether PDF and HTML versions were generated correctly. Please check whether author names, figures, equations, references, etc. are rendered correctly in both formats. If not, click the ""reject"" radio button in order to upload a new version.
*   Once you are satisfied with the results, please click the ""approve"" radio button.
*   The proceedings chairs will check your submission for completeness and obvious formatting problems. If there are changes required, they will contact the corresponding author by email.

TAP 2024 is the 18th International Conference on Tests and Proofs. TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability.

Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of dynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic techniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Notable examples that provide evidence for the potential of a combination of static and dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based on symbolic execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking, or the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive enumeration. The verification of systems based on machine learning spurs novel combinations of dynamic and static analyses, e.g., property verification of surrogate models that are generated through testing.

TAP’s scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology, including foundational work, tool development, and empirical research. Topics of interest center around the combination of static techniques such as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.

## Invited Speakers

*   **Rosemary Monahan** (Maynooth University, Ireland)
*   **Rüdiger Ehlers** (TU Clausthal, Germany)

## Topics of Interest

Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

*   Verification and analysis techniques combining proofs and tests,
*   Static analysis of programs with the aid of dynamic techniques,
*   Deductive techniques supporting the automated generation of test vectors and oracles,
*   Deductive techniques supporting (novel) definitions of coverage criteria,
*   Specification inference by deductive or dynamic methods,
*   Testing and runtime analysis of formal specifications,
*   Search-based techniques for proving and testing,
*   Testing and Verification of systems based on machine learning,
*   Verification of verification tools and environments,
*   Applications of test and proof techniques in new domains,

## Publication and Open Access

ACM's upcoming transition to Open Access, effective January 1, 2026, means all ACM publications, including those from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be 100% Open Access. Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs).

*   **ACM Open Participants:** Most ACM-sponsored conference papers will not require APCs from authors or conferences.
    *   List of participating institutions in ACM Open: [https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/open-participants](https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/open-participants)
*   **Non-ACM Open Participants:** Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC, unless they qualify for a waiver.
    *   APC Waivers and Discounts Policy: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/policy-on-open-access-apc-waivers-and-discounts](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/policy-on-open-access-apc-waivers-and-discounts)

## Temporary Subsidy for 2026

To ease the transition, ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026:

*   **$250 APC for ACM/SIG members**
*   **$350 for non-members**

This represents a 65% discount, funded directly by ACM. Authors are encouraged to advocate for their institutions to join ACM Open.

## Anti-Harassment Policy

SIGMOD 2026 adheres to the ACM Policy Against Harassment. Any participant who experiences unacceptable behavior may contact any current member of the SIGMOD Executive Committee, the PODS Executive Committee, or DBCares. Concerns will be kept in strict confidence.

## Introduction

As computer systems, communication networks and artificial intelligence (AI) undergo rapid development, accompanied by increasing complexity, the expectations of users for trust, security, and privacy have grown considerably. This presents a significant challenge, as traditional security technologies and measures may struggle to meet the evolving demands within open, dynamic, heterogeneous, mobile, wireless, and distributed computing environments. Consequently, the imperative is to construct systems and networks that enable users to access more comprehensive services while concurrently upholding trust, security, and privacy. In response to this challenge, trusted computing and communications have emerged as pivotal and innovative technologies, capturing the heightened interest of researchers. These advancements offer promising solutions to address the intricate demands of contemporary computing landscapes.

The conference continues the tradition of successful IEEE TrustCom conferences held from 2002 to 2023 across Asia, Europe, Australia, and America. It will feature sessions of regular presentations, workshops, tutorials, and keynote speeches.
