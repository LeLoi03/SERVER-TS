The conference brings together researchers, practitioners, businesses, artists, designers and students from various disciplines. The theme for TEI '26 is 'Tide + Tied'.","# TEI '26: Call for Papers

We invite paper submissions from a wide range of perspectives: technical, applied, empirical, theoretical, philosophical, conceptual, and artistic. We welcome contributions from fields including but not limited to: tangible interaction design, embodied interaction design, embedded computing, digital fabrication, hybrid craft, e-textiles, wearables, haptics, robotics, smart cities, smart materials, and sustainability.

As this year's theme is 'Tide + Tied', we invite submissions that explore interdisciplinary knowledge, bridging the physical and digital, technology and humanity, resurgence and convergence, and beyond. We expect submissions to be clearly framed within the rapidly developing tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction field. Works framed as research through design and more technical contributions are particularly welcome.

## Contribution types

Authors are invited to submit high-quality papers that contribute to advancing this rapidly developing field. We highlight the following non-exclusive set of contribution types:

*   **Artifact:** Research artifacts that advance the state of the art in Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction. Artifacts can demonstrate new technologies (e.g., new sensing techniques or algorithms), new forms of input (e.g., novel interaction techniques) or new designs (e.g., provocative or evocative objects, systems or services).
*   **Method:** Tools, approaches and techniques that enable researchers, technologists, designers and practitioners to study, research and work in Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction. Methods can include new forms of study design or data analysis, as well as new engineering processes or frameworks.
*   **Theory:** Explorations, extensions, refutations, instantiations and other developments of and to the theories pertaining to Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction, such as theories of cognition or the mind as well as design theories and conceptual frameworks.
*   **Empirical:** Studies and data that add to our understanding of Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction by, for example, providing quantitative accounts of salient aspects of human performance or qualitative characterizations of experiences with tangible artifacts and systems. Empirical submissions can detail outcomes from a very wide range of lab, field and online studies.

## Submission Guidelines

Authors are encouraged to submit a paper with a length proportional to its contribution. While there is no maximum or minimum length for papers, the length of typical submissions is expected to be approximately 7,000–8,000 words excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a submission relative to its method and length. Papers should be succinct but thorough in presenting the work. Shorter, more focused papers are encouraged and will be reviewed like any other paper. Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected.

Accepted submissions of all contribution types will be included as papers in the conference proceedings, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library.

## TEI Ethical Research Statement

As a TEI community, we follow the ACM ethical research guidelines and adhere to the ACM policy of involving human participants.

For details, please consult the ACM guidelines below:

1.  ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct: [https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)
2.  ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects)

## ACM Format Requirements

TEI 2026 uses the new ACM workflow TAPS for submission templates and published papers. TAPS requires the use of a simplified one-column template for submission, while the final two-column paper will be rendered for publication after acceptance. We strongly recommend using the LaTeX templates rather than Word. Papers do not have a page limit. All relevant information, including submission templates in Word and LaTeX, can be found here: [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions)

## Authorship Policy

Your submission must be original. TEI only accepts original submissions. This means that your submission cannot have been published in another peer-reviewed venue or be under concurrent review at another peer-reviewed venue.

Please refer to the ACM policy on authorship for details: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship). Authors should avoid using text generated by AI-tools (e.g., LLMs such as ChatGPT or similar). The use of AI-tools must be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of your submission.

## Anonymization Policy

All papers must be anonymized for review. Author and affiliation sections and credits must be left blank. Authors of accepted submissions will add this information in preparation of the ""camera-ready"" version. We are using the ACM IMWUT Anonymization Policy: [https://dl.acm.org/journal/imwut/author-policies#:~:text=with%20the%20Editors.-,Anonymization,in%20the%20PDF%20meta%2Ddata](https://dl.acm.org/journal/imwut/author-policies#:~:text=with%20the%20Editors.-,Anonymization,in%20the%20PDF%20meta%2Ddata).

## Submission

All abstracts and, subsequently, full papers must be submitted electronically via the Precision Conference (PCS) website before their respective deadlines.

## Policy on Use of Generative AI / Large Language Models

Text and images generated from AI services, such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author's own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship before you use these tools: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/ai-authorship-policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/ai-authorship-policy). The SIGCHI blog post describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools, and we refer to it for guidance: [https://sigchi.org/blog/2023/04/ai-authorship-policy-and-guidelines/](https://sigchi.org/blog/2023/04/ai-authorship-policy-and-guidelines/).

## Review Process

After a paper-bidding process by the ACS, the program chairs will assign each paper to a primary AC (1AC) and a secondary AC (2AC). The program chairs will identify ACs with expertise in the topic area of each submission
The 1AC will find two external reviewers. Each external reviewer and the 2AC will write a detailed review of their assigned submissions and assess the contribution of the research to the field. Thus, each paper will receive 3 detailed reviews.
Once the reviews are written, the 1AC is responsible for the quality of the reviews and will write a meta review of the paper, summarising the reviews from the two external reviewers and the 2AC. If 1ACs disagree with the other reviews, they are encouraged to write a separate review in addition to the meta-review.
The 1AC will present a recommendation for the paper's acceptance or rejection to the Program Chairs. Program Chairs will decide the final acceptance of all papers for inclusion in the program in a discussion phase, based on the 1AC recommendation, the reviews and fit to the conference.

Only accepted regular and short papers will appear in the LNCS proceedings. All paper categories will go through a review process suitable for the given category.

## Authors Guidelines

Submitted papers must describe work not previously published, and they must neither be accepted nor under review in a journal or at another conference with refereed proceedings.

### Paper preparation

Authors are required to submit their manuscripts electronically in PDF using the LNCS style. Authors using LaTeX can download the needed macros at [Springer-Verlag site](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/editor-guidelines-for-springer-proceedings). Papers should respect the page limits announced above; full proofs may appear in a clearly marked technical appendix which can be read by the reviewers.

The submission process is completely managed via the EasyChair website. Please use the following submission URL: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ucnc2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ucnc2025)

### Preparing the final version for the proceedings

The final versions of accepted papers must be formatted in LaTeX using Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes style.

*   For regular papers, authors might use up to 16 pages including references, title page and acknowledgements (i.e., one more page to be used if the implementation of the corrections requested by the reviewers requires additional space).
*   For short papers, authors might use up to 6 pages including references, title page and acknowledgements.

Please also consult the [Instructions for Authors](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/editor-guidelines-for-springer-proceedings) provided by Springer for the preparation and formatting of the manuscript.

The final version should be uploaded on the Easychair website in zipped format containing the following:

*   The final source files, including bib files, images, non-standard LaTeX packages, etc.
*   A final PDF file corresponding exactly to the final source files.
*   A license-to-publish agreement, signed by hand by the corresponding author on behalf of all of the authors of the paper.

Use the following information to fill out the copyright form:

*   Title of the Book or Conference Name: Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation, 22st International Conference, UCNC 2025
*   Volume Editor(s) Name(s): Enrico Formenti, Luca Manzoni

Moreover, if appropriate, please also give us a suggestion for an abbreviated running head, and information about the correct representation of authors’ names, where necessary.

For LBA and posters, you only need to upload to Easychair the pdf and LaTeX source files.

Please make sure that you follow the standards set out in [Springer's code of conduct](https://www.springer.com/us/authors-editors/book-authors-editors/your-publication-journey/publishing-integrity).

**Important**. At least one author of each accepted paper, late-breaking abstract and poster has to register, attend the conference and present the work.

The call for papers is now closed.

The Symposium on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) invites submissions on all aspects of human factors and usability in the context of security and privacy. USEC ’25 aims to bring together researchers already engaged in this interdisciplinary effort with other researchers in relevant areas. We encourage economics, HCI, AI, theoretical computer science, cryptography, psychology, and business studies researchers and practitioners to submit original research in this area. We particularly encourage collaborative research from authors in multiple fields.

## Areas of Interest

Topics include, but are not limited to:

*   Innovative security or privacy functionality and design
*   New applications of existing models or technology
*   Usability evaluations of new or existing security or privacy features and lessons learned
*   Security testing of new or existing usability features
*   Psychological, sociological, and economic aspects of security and privacy
*   Research and design methodologies for human-centric security and privacy research
*   Reports of replicating previously published studies and experiments
*   Reports of failed usable privacy/security studies or experiments, with the focus on the lessons learned from such experience
*   Systematization of Knowledge
*   Inclusive security and privacy
*   Ethics in human-centric security and privacy research
*   Workforce, labels, cyber-physical systems
*   Usability in smart manufacturing

All submissions must clearly relate to the human aspects of security or privacy. Papers on security or privacy that do not address usability or human factors will not be considered. Likewise, papers on usability or human factors that do not address security or privacy will not be considered. The determination of whether a paper is within scope will be solely at the discretion of the program committee chairs.

## Submission Guidelines for Papers

All submissions must be original work; authors must clearly document any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers from any of the authors. All papers should be written in English. We will review longer papers on mature/completed work in a research track, as well as shorter papers on work in progress, or work that has yet to begin, in a vision track. We aim to provide a venue for researchers at all stages of their careers and at all stages of their projects. The text must be in Times font, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line spacing. Use the [templates for NDSS Symposium and co-located events](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2025/submissions/templates/).

*   **Research Track:** Papers must not be more than 12 pages in length using the two-column submission format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. Authors have the option to attach supplementary appendices with study materials. Reviewers are not required to read appendices, so your paper should be self-contained without them.
*   **Meta-Science Track:** Papers must not exceed 12 pages in length using the two-column submission format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices. Authors are encouraged to scale the length of their paper according to the contributions they describe therein. Additionally, authors have the option to attach supplementary appendices with materials such as study protocols, datasets, or detailed methodological descriptions that would not otherwise take up valuable space within the body of the paper. However, reviewers are not required to read these appendices, so the main paper should be self-contained without them.
*   **Vision Track:** Papers must be up to 5 pages in length using the two-column format, excluding bibliography and well-marked appendices.

The submission portal for papers: [https://usec25.hotcrp.com/](https://usec25.hotcrp.com/)

Reviewing will be double-blind. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper. Authors’ prior work should be preferably referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded. Submissions that violate these requirements will be rejected without review. The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.

## Important Dates

*   Submission Deadline: **25 November 2024, 11:59 pm, Anywhere-on-earth (AOE)**
*   Reviews Due: **16 December 2024**
*   Discussion Period: **16-19 December 2024**
*   Notification of Acceptance: **20 December 2024**
*   Camera Ready Deadline: **28 January 2025**
*   Workshop Date: **24 February 2025**

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors and Program Committee members are required to indicate any conflict of interest and its nature. Advisors and those that they are advising, as well as authors and PC members with an institutional relationship are considered to share a conflict of interest. Professional collaborations (irrespective of whether they resulted in publication or funding) that occurred in the past 2 years and close personal relationships equally constitute a conflict of interest. PC members, including chairs, that have a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper."

## Overview

The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. We are interested in systems of all scales, from small embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds. The scope of USENIX ATC covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including but not limited to: operating systems; runtime systems; parallel and distributed systems; storage; networking; security and privacy; virtualization; software-hardware interactions; performance evaluation and workload characterization; reliability, availability, and scalability; energy and power management; and bug-finding, tracing, analyzing, and troubleshooting.

We value submissions more highly if they are accompanied by clearly defined artifacts not previously available, including traces, original data, source code, or tools developed as part of the submitted work. We particularly encourage new ideas and approaches.

Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum, including journals, conferences, and workshops with proceedings. They will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity. An idea or a design that the PC deems flawed can be grounds for rejection. USENIX ATC '25 will employ double-blind reviewing. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.

Papers need to be registered and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract at the time of the abstract registration deadline will be rejected.

There will be an optional artifact evaluation process for accepted papers.

## Submission Type: Full vs. Short

USENIX ATC '25 accepts both full and short submissions. Full submissions must not exceed **12 pages**, and short submissions must not exceed **6 pages**. In both cases, the page limit excludes references and appendices but includes all text, figures, tables, footnotes, etc.

## Deployed Systems Track

USENIX ATC '25 solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with real-world deployment of systems and networks. Papers for the deployed systems track (occasionally referred to as the operational systems track in other USENIX conferences) need not present new ideas or results to be accepted but should convey practical insights. Note that the rules regarding submission and anonymization are different for deployed systems track papers. The final program will explicitly identify papers accepted to the deployed systems track to distinguish them from papers accepted to the regular track.

## Early Rejection Notifications

USENIX ATC '25 reviews will be conducted in multiple rounds. For papers that are rejected in an early round, early rejection notifications will be sent to the authors at least one month ahead of the date that all remaining notifications (for acceptances and additional rejections) will be sent.

## Authors' Response Period

USENIX ATC '25 will provide an opportunity for authors of papers that are not early rejected to respond to the reviews prior to the final consideration of the submissions at the program committee meeting according to the schedule detailed above.

## Confidentiality

All submissions will be treated as confidential prior to publication on the USENIX ATC '25 website. Rejected submissions will be permanently treated as confidential.

## On the Use of Generative AI

While we acknowledge that generative AI is seamlessly included in many editing packages, e.g., Grammarly, and thus often hard to detect, authors must not submit papers containing sections generated entirely by generative AI. In particular, for papers including sections generated entirely by generative AI, i.e., text, graphs, experiments, etc., the authorship is not clearly that of the authors and may be tantamount to plagiarism. To this end, authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper does not include sections completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP. For more detailed questions about the appropriate use of generative AI, please feel free to contact the ATC co-chairs at [atc25chairs@usenix.org](mailto:atc25chairs@usenix.org).

## Submission Guidelines

All submissions must be written in English. Papers should be submitted electronically, in a PDF format, through the EasyChair submission system, [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2025) , by selecting the “UMAP25 Full and Short Papers” track.

### Format

We encourage two types of submissions (reviewers will comment on whether the size is appropriate for each contribution), in the ACM two-column format:

*   **Long papers:** (8 pages at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) should report on substantial contributions of lasting value.
*   **Short papers:** (4 pages at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper.

We recommend that supplementary material is linked to an external source using an anonymized link.

### Anonymity

Submissions must be anonymous, given that ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from submissions, and avoid obvious identifying statements.

To release code and additional materials while preserving anonymity, we suggest using anonymous repositories such as [https://anonymous.4open.science](https://anonymous.4open.science).

### Templates

Following the ACM Publication Workflow, all authors should submit manuscripts for review in the ACM double-column format. Instructions for authors are given below:

*   **LaTeX:** Please use the latest version of the Primary Article Template – LaTeX to create your submission. Start the document with the `\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}` command to generate the output in a double-column format. Please see the LaTeX documentation and ACM’s LaTeX best practices guide for further instructions, ignoring the single-column instructions.
*   **Overleaf:** (use `\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}` for double-column). Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for [preparing your article with Overleaf](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/overleaf).
*   **Word:** Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for [preparing your article with Microsoft Word](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word), ignoring the single-column instructions and the single-column submission template. Please use the double-column Word template.

### Accessibility

Authors are strongly encouraged to provide “alt text” (alternative text) for floats (images, tables, etc.) in their content so that readers with disabilities can be given descriptive information for these floats that are important to the work. Additionally, authors should follow the [ACM Accessibility Recommendations for Publishing in Color](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/describing-figures) and SIG ACCESS guidelines on describing figures.

### Submission Policy

All submissions and reviews will be handled electronically. ACM UMAP has a no dual submission policy, which is why submitted manuscripts should not be currently under review at another publication venue.

## Review Process

ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from their submissions; they should also avoid obvious identifying statements. Submissions not abiding by anonymity requirements will be desk rejected.

The ACM Code of Ethics gives the ACM UMAP program committee the right to (desk-)reject papers that perpetuate harmful stereotypes, employ unethical research practices, or uncritically present outcomes/implications that disadvantage minority communities.

## Registration and Presentation Policy

Each accepted paper must be accompanied by a distinct full author registration, completed by the early registration date cut-off. Each accepted paper must be presented in person to be included in the conference proceedings, published by ACM, and available via the ACM Digital Library.

## Ethical & Human Subjects Considerations

ACM UMAP expects papers to include a discussion of the ethical considerations, as well as the impact of the presented work and/or its intended application, where appropriate. ACM UMAP further expects all authors to comply with ethical standards and regulatory guidelines associated with human subjects research, including research involving human participants and research using personally identifiable data.

## Special Submissions

### Replication

USENIX Security solicits submission of replication papers, which verify, refute, or refine prior technical results. We encourage submissions that not only replicate studies but also offer meta-analyses that assess the replicability of research. Papers with this specific purpose must be flagged accordingly in the HotCRP submission system.

### Systematization of Knowledge

USENIX Security solicits the submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which have been very valuable to help our community clarify and put into context complex research problems. Papers with this specific purpose must have their title prefixed with ""SoK: "".

## Bulk Submissions

Each author can submit at most seven papers per cycle to USENIX Security 2026. The chairs will only retain the seven papers with the lowest submission numbers.

## Submission Policies and Instructions

### Executive Summary

All papers must adhere to the following rules. Papers found in violation of any of these requirements will be desk-rejected without review.

*   All papers MUST be registered in the respective HotCRP instance one week before the submission deadline, including the full list of authors, the title, the (tentative, non-blank) abstract, and the topics of the paper.
*   All papers MUST have a discussion of research ethics. This MUST be in a separate appendix called ""Ethical Considerations.""
*   All papers MUST discuss Open Science. This MUST be in a separate appendix called ""Open Science"" that clearly lists where the artifacts necessary for evaluating the contributions of their submission are located. These artifacts must be available at the time of submission.
*   All papers MUST NOT reveal the identity of the authors (e.g., names, self-references with ""we"", funding acknowledgements, Github repositories).
*   All papers MUST comply with the unaltered USENIX Security LaTeX template. Any attempts to remove whitespace are strictly forbidden.
*   All authors MUST provide their ORCIDs through the profile page on HotCRP by the registration deadline.
*   All authors MUST acknowledge the submission terms on HotCRP by the submission deadline.
*   Authors MUST NOT submit more than seven papers per cycle.
*   At least one author of each accepted paper MUST register for and commit to attending the conference.

### Formatting Requirements & Page Limit

*   Papers can include up to 13 pages of body text.
*   Papers must include ""Ethical Considerations"" and ""Open Science"" appendices. These appendices must appear immediately following the main body, before the references/appendices and may each consume up to one page of text.
*   The initial submission can contain unlimited appendices and references.
*   Final camera-ready papers can contain a maximum of 20 total pages.

Submissions must be typeset on U.S. letter-sized pages in two-column format in 10-point Times Roman type on 12-point leading (single-spaced), in a text block 7"" x 9"" deep. The main body of the submission must not exceed 13 pages, immediately followed by the ""Ethical Considerations"" and ""Open Science"" appendices (each of which may consume up to one page). Authors must use the USENIX Security template and style files when preparing the paper for submission. Failure to adhere to the page limit and formatting requirements are grounds for rejection.

### Ethical Considerations

Reviewers will be asked to evaluate the ethics of all submissions. Authors are expected to complete a stakeholder-based ethics analysis or justify and complete an alternative approach to considering ethics. All submissions are hence required to have a dedicated appendix after the main body of the paper (but before any references) called ""Ethical Considerations"".

### Open Science Policy and Artifact Evaluation

In 2026, authors are required to openly share their research artifacts at submission time. This initiative is part of a broader commitment to foster open-science principles, emphasizing the sharing of artifacts such as datasets, scripts, binaries, and source code associated with research papers. All USENIX Security papers must make their compliance with the open-science policy explicit: the ""Open Science"" appendix must list all artifacts necessary to evaluate the contribution of the paper and make clear how the review committees can access each artifact. All artifacts must be available at the time of submission. Paper acceptance is conditional on public availability of these artifacts.

### Anonymous Submission

The review process will be anonymous. Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review:

*   The title page must not contain any author names or affiliations.
*   Authors should carefully review figures and appendices to ensure affiliations are not accidentally included.
*   When referring to your previous work, do so in the third person, as though it were written by someone else.
*   Authors may include links to websites that contain source code, tools, or other supplemental material. Neither the link in the paper nor the website itself may suggest the authors' identities.

## Conflicts of Interest

The program co-chairs require cooperation from both authors and program committee members to prevent submissions from being evaluated by reviewers who have a conflict of interest.

## Embargo Requests

Authors may request an embargo for their papers by the deadline dates listed below. All embargoed papers will be released on the first day of the conference, Wednesday, August 12, 2026.

*   Cycle 1 deadline for embargo requests: Thursday, February 12, 2026
*   Cycle 2 deadline for embargo requests: Thursday, July 9, 2026

## Contact Information

Specific questions about submissions may be sent to the program co-chairs at [sec26chairs@usenix.org](mailto:sec26chairs@usenix.org). Further questions can be directed to the USENIX office at [submissionspolicy@usenix.org](mailto:submissionspolicy@usenix.org).

## Submitting ML Work to USENIX Security

If you are using machine learning to solve a security or privacy problem, mark the paper’s primary field as the field of the problem you’re solving. If you are working on the security or privacy of machine learning, ensure that your work is relevant to the broader systems security community.

## Ethics Guidelines

All papers must contain an ethics section that details the authors’ stakeholder-based ethics analysis or justifies the use of an alternative approach to considering the ethics of their work. Authors are expected to read the USENIX Security's perspective on ethics and familiarize themselves with The Menlo Report and the 2023 USENIX Security paper, ""Ethical Frameworks and Computer Security Trolley Problems.""

The IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC) is the premier international forum for research on computing technologies for modeling, programming, communicating, and reasoning, which are easier to learn, use or understand by humans than the current state-of-the-art. The symposium is scheduled to take place in **October 2025 in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA**

## Scope and Topics

We solicit original, unpublished research papers on computing technologies for modeling, programming, communicating, and reasoning, which are easier to learn, use or understand by humans than the current state-of-the-art. Papers should focus on efforts to design, formalize, implement, or evaluate those technologies and languages.

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   Visual languages: Novel visual languages, Design, evaluation, and theory of visual languages and applications, Development of systems for manipulating and interacting with diagrammatic representations
*   Human aspects and psychology of software development and language design, such as supporting inclusion and diversity in programming
*   End-user development, adaptation and programming, Creation and evaluation of technologies and infrastructures for end-user development
*   Representations: Novel representations and user interfaces for expressing computation, Software, algorithm and data visualization
*   Modeling: Model-driven development, Domain-specific languages, including modeling languages, Visual modeling of human behavior and socio-technical systems
*   Thinking more deeply about code: Debugging, program comprehension, code review, Explainable ML/AI
*   Future of work with AI: Human-Centric AI-based tools, modeling end-user interactions with AI powered tools
*   Low-Code/No-Code paradigm: Approaches for creation and deployment of fully functional applications using visual abstractions and interfaces
*   Education and Computational thinking: using visual languages in education, teaching human-centric principals, educator and student perspectives

## Special Emphasis for 2025: Human-AI Collaboration

We seek research that highlights the situations in which human-AI interactions enhance, or degrade, the human experience in computing. Papers describing positive, negative and unclear impacts are all welcome.

## Paper Submissions

We invite two kinds of papers:

*   **full-length papers,** up to 10 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements
*   **short papers,** up to 5 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements

Papers must be submitted using the IEEE two-column conference paper format. Be sure to use the current IEEE conference paper format (which was updated in 2019), and to select the “US letter” template

Papers should be [submitted via the EasyChair system](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vlhcc2025).

To facilitate the assigning of papers to reviewers, we authors should submit paper abstracts via EasyChair at least 1 week prior to the paper submission deadline (see Important Dates below). The abstract must be no longer than 250 words.

## Double-Anonymous Reviewing

We follow a double-anonymous reviewing process. Authors should ensure that the submission can be evaluated without it being obvious who wrote the paper.

## Evaluation and Justification

Papers are expected to support their claims with appropriate evidence. For example, a paper that claims to improve programmer productivity is expected to demonstrate improved productivity; a paper that claims to be easier to use should demonstrate increased ease of use.

## Adhering to IEEE Guidelines

Please be sure that your submission follows the [IEEE requirements](https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/author-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-policies/).

Especially around Human Subject approvals and use of Generative AI:

*   Research on Human and Animal Subjects
*   Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text

IEEE VR 2026 seeks original, high-quality papers in all areas related to virtual reality (VR), including augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and 3D user interfaces (3DUIs).

This year there is again a SINGLE submission deadline for a unified review process for both the IEEE TVCG and the conference-only papers. The possible outcomes of this unified process are:

*   Accept as IEEE TVCG paper, with presentation at IEEE VR 2026
*   Accept as IEEE VR 2026 conference paper, with presentation at IEEE VR 2026
*   Reject

**Inquiries:** [program2026@ieeevr.org](mailto:program2026@ieeevr.org)

**New this year:** Papers will not have the option to be automatically accepted as IEEE VR Posters. Rather, authors of rejected papers will have to submit directly to the poster track.

**New this year:** All senior (PhD-holding) authors should familiarize themselves with the IEEE VR 2026 reviewing guidelines [LINK TO COME]. Unless serving IEEE VR 2026 in another capacity, ALL SENIOR AUTHORS are expected to volunteer as reviewers and perform their duties in a timely and responsive fashion. This supersedes the prior requirement that one author for each paper commit to reviewing; if a paper has multiple senior co-authors, all are expected to volunteer. Egregious violations of this policy may be considered Highly Irresponsible Conduct, which could result in penalties up to and including desk rejection of their submitted paper(s).

## Important Dates

Each deadline is 23:59:59 AoE (Anywhere on Earth) == GMT/UTC-12:00 on the stated day, no matter where the submitter is located. The submission deadlines will be strictly enforced. Requests for extensions will not be honored.

*   **September 05, 2025:** Abstracts due (REQUIRED)
*   **September 12, 2025:** Submissions due
*   **December 12, 2025:** Initial notifications
*   **January 16, 2026:** Revised submissions due
*   **January 23, 2026:** Final notifications
*   **January 30, 2026:** Camera-ready materials due

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions will be accepted through Precision Conference Solutions this year: [https://new.precisionconference.com/vr26a](https://new.precisionconference.com/vr26a)

**IMPORTANT:** IEEE VR 2026 uses a **DOUBLE-BLIND** review process. Failure to anonymize submissions will result in **DESK REJECTION**.

Each research paper should provide a contribution covering one or more of the following categories: methodological, technical, applications, and systems.

*   **Methodological papers:** describe advances in theories and methods of AR/VR/MR and 3DUI, such as ethical issues, theories on presence, or human factors.
*   **Technical papers:** describe advancements in algorithms or devices critical to AR/VR/MR and 3DUI development such as input, display, user interaction, or tracking.
*   **Application papers:** explain how the authors built upon existing ideas and applied them to solve an interesting problem in a novel way. Each paper should include an evaluation of the success of the use of AR/VR/MR and/or 3DUI in the given application domain.
*   **System papers:** indicate how the developers integrated techniques and technologies to produce an effective system, and convey any lessons learned in the process.

Each paper should include an evaluation of its contributions, such as user studies, benchmarking and/or comparison with existing systems/techniques/methods.

**Format:** Papers must be strictly formatted according to IEEE VGTC conference submission guidelines and submitted electronically as PDF documents.

All paper submissions must be formatted using the IEEE Computer Society VGTC conference format ([https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/](https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/)). See the visual examples below.

*   **MS Word template:** At the time of writing this CFP, the provided .docx file may not comply with the VR formatting guidelines. Please use the provided .dotx file and ensure that the final submission matches the formatting guidelines or the paper may be desk rejected. Check the provided sample pdf documents for correct formatting.
*   Papers should be **4-9 pages** of text, figures, and tables, but NOT including references. References should not exceed 2 pages in length. Note that the minimum length is 4 full pages of text. Appendices are included in the page count.
*   Supplementary materials should be provided in a separate file. Authors are encouraged to submit videos to aid the program committee in reviewing their submissions.
*   Accepted papers will have to be formatted by the authors according to the relevant camera-ready guidelines.

## Topics

IEEE VR 2026 seeks contributions in VR/AR/MR and 3DUI including, but not limited to, the following topics:

*   360° video
*   3D and volumetric display and projection technology
*   3D authoring
*   3D user interfaces
*   Accessibility of immersive interfaces
*   Audio interfaces and rendering
*   Collaborative interactions
*   Computer graphics techniques
*   Crowd simulation
*   Cybersickness
*   Diversity and gender issues
*   Embodied agents, virtual humans, and (self-)avatars
*   Ethical issues
*   Evaluation methods
*   Haptic interfaces and rendering
*   Human factors and ergonomics
*   Immersive analytics and visualization
*   Immersive applications and games
*   Input devices
*   Locomotion and navigation
*   Mediated and diminished reality
*   Mobile, desktop, or hybrid 3DUIs
*   Modeling and simulation
*   Multi-user and distributed systems
*   Multimodal capturing and reconstruction
*   Multimodal/cross-modal interaction and perception
*   Multisensory interfaces and rendering
*   Perception and cognition
*   Presence, body ownership, and agency
*   Redirection
*   Software architectures, toolkits, and engineering
*   Teleoperation and telepresence
*   Therapy and rehabilitation
*   Touch, tangible, and gesture interfaces
*   Tracking and sensing
*   User experience and usability
*   XR technology infrastructure

While no list can be exhaustive, papers should, as a rule of thumb, engage meaningfully with existing literature in VR/AR/MR/3DUI. If a submission contains few or no references to this literature (focusing entirely on, for example, computer vision or computer graphics), that submission might not be appropriate for IEEE VR and may be desk rejected.

## Review Process

The review process will have two cycles.

*   Review Cycle I (Submission to Initial Notification)
*   Review Cycle II (Initial notification to Final decision)

## Ethics and Responsibility

All submissions describing research experiments with human participants must follow the appropriate ethical guidelines required by the authors’ institution(s), and authors are required to secure and report their approval by the relevant ethics committee prior to collecting data.

## Participant Diversity

To support high-quality research, all submissions describing research with human participants should strive for participant diversity.

## Review Duties for Authors

For each submitted paper, each senior author will be required to register to review at least one paper through PCS at the time of submission.

## Presentation at the Conference

All accepted submissions must be presented orally at the conference. An in-person presentation is expected, and online presentations will be accommodated only in exceptional cases.

## Submission Language

All paper submissions must be in English.

## Previous Publication and Plagiarism

Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously published. Submissions will be checked for plagiarism using IEEE Crosscheck. Detection of significant plagiarism will lead to rejection.

## AI-generated Text

In accordance with IEEE guidelines, the use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section.

## Submission Anonymity

IEEE VR uses a DOUBLE-BLIND review process. Failure to adhere to the double-blind policy will result in desk rejection.

## Pre-dissemination through public online repositories

Uploading the submitted manuscript to an online repository (e.g., arXiv) before the end of the review process does not constitute a reason for rejecting the manuscript. However, the authors should be advised that doing so can compromise the anonymity of their manuscript and therefore bias its double-blind review.

## Videos

Videos must be submitted according to the instructions on the submission website. When submitted as supporting material, videos must be free of any identifying information prior to reviewing as per the double-blind submission policy.

## Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools for Authors

Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of a paper submitted to WAFR. The use of content generated by AI in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The AI system used must be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content should be specified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the manner in which the AI system was used to generate the content. The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. Even so, in this case, disclosure is still recommended as the lines between these uses can be difficult to distinguish.

## Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools for Reviewers

Information or content contained in or about a manuscript under review shall not be processed through an AI system. Doing so is considered a breach of confidentiality and as such is not permitted.
