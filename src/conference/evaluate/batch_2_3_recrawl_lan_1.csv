The conference focuses on real-world aspects of security and privacy, encouraging submissions with accessible and compelling results for general computer security researchers.","# Call for Papers

The 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2025) seeks paper submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of security and privacy. We seek articles presenting accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. Purely theoretical submissions (e.g., cryptography-focused, with no security/application connections) are not encouraged, nor are submissions focusing primarily on blockchains or machine learning.

Like in previous years, we will also be accepting “Systemisation of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. SoK submissions need to add the prefix **“SoK: ”** in the title. They will be accepted based on the value to the community. Survey papers without insights evaluating, systematizing, and contextualizing current knowledge will be rejected.

## Submission Instructions

Please read the instructions below before submitting your paper. Please get in touch with the PC chairs at [asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org](mailto:asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org) for any questions regarding the submissions.

[SUBMIT YOUR PAPER HERE](https://asiaccs2025b.hotcrp.com/)

## Paper Formatting

*   Technical papers submitted for ASIACCS must be written in English.
*   Papers must be in PDF format and at most **12 pages** double-column. We will allow up to 10 additional pages for the bibliography and well-marked appendices, but note that reviewers are not expected to read the appendices.
*   Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest [ACM Sigconf style conference template](https://www.acm.org/conference-conference-templates).
*   All fonts, images, tables, and figures must comply with common standards and not generate problems for reviewers.
*   Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:”
*   Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

## Conflicts of Interest (COI)

When submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include:

*   Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission.
*   Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past.
*   Anyone the author has collaborated with or published within the prior two years.

PC members, including chairs with a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure to declare COI or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a PC member with COI reviews a paper, it will be rejected.

## Anonymous Submissions

ASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used. The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the submission is made unless approved by the Program Chairs. Publishing the submission on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, is allowed, but authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results (e.g., social media, seminars, etc.) and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.

## Double and Concurrent Submissions

Submissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double submission will result in immediate rejection. We may report detected violations to other conference chairs and journal editors.

## Ethical Considerations

The authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence (beyond approval of the experiment by their institution) elaborating how they have thoroughly considered such issues. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns.

## Early Rejection and Appeals

There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification email. Authors’ appeals must clearly and explicitly identify substantial disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews that should be adjudicated by a particular arbitration reviewer who the PC chairs may recruit. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.

## Paper Revision and Resubmission

Rejected papers in Cycle 1 cannot be resubmitted in Cycle 2. A small number of Cycle 1 submissions may receive a “Revise” decision, rather than “Accept” or “Reject,” and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server. The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. We will request additional revisions only in exceptional circumstances.

## Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation

If a paper is accepted, the author list in the submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.

## Contact

For any questions related to paper submissions, please contact the PC chairs at [asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org](mailto:asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org).",

The IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) Conference series is the premier research forum for automated software engineering. Each year, it brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss foundations, techniques, and tools for automating the analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance of large software systems. ASE 2025 invites high-quality contributions describing significant, original, and unpublished results.

## New This Year

*   **PC Self-nomination:** We are inviting self-nominations to serve on our Program Committee. To contribute as a reviewer and help shape the technical program, please complete the PC self-nomination form: [https://forms.gle/uPZCVDeH4WzwvtmF6](https://forms.gle/uPZCVDeH4WzwvtmF6). We would greatly appreciate receiving your self-nomination by **January 10**.
*   **Major Revisions:** Instead of rejecting papers outright, reviewers have the opportunity to request changes that may require up to four weeks to accommodate. If a paper receives a 'Revision' outcome, reviewers will specify concrete and actionable revision criteria, agreeing to accept the paper in principle if these criteria are met. Authors will be notified about the outcome for their revision after it is checked by the discussion lead.
*   **Auto-bidding:** Leveraging the success at other conferences like ICSE 2025 and OOPSLA 2024, we will use the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) to streamline and automate the paper bidding and assignment process, reducing reviewer workload and increasing expertise per paper.
*   **Rapid Response Reviewers:** To handle unexpected unavailability of reviewers, we invite a small percentage of interested PC members to become Rapid Response Reviewers. They will initially review a smaller number of papers but commit to reviewing up to two additional papers within a shorter timeframe at the end of the reviewing period.

The ASSETS conference is the premier forum for presenting research on the **design, evaluation, use, and education** related to computing for people with disabilities and older adults. We invite high-quality original submissions on topics relevant to computing and **accessibility**.

Submissions should present significant contributions to design, systems, tools, scientific understanding, methodology, or social issues. Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) new enabling technologies, studies of how technologies are used by people with disabilities, explorations of barriers to access, and evaluations of accessibility education methods. We recommend that papers with a technical contribution be validated through research activities with representative users when possible. However, we acknowledge that many accessibility-focused projects may begin with deep formative work with representative users, or may be based on prior research with representative users, and as such key contributions of a single paper may be primarily technical.

## Submission Categories and Deadlines

All accepted papers and abstracts will be archived in the ACM Digital Library. At least one author of accepted submissions must register as the presenter by the early registration deadline.

The conference focuses on methods and solutions for software test automation, with a special theme on adapting test automation to the AI era, including sustainability and emerging challenges.","# The 6th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automation of Software Test (AST 2025) - Call for Papers

## Scope

Software pervasiveness in both industry and digital society, as well as the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, are continuously leading to emerging needs from both software producers and consumers. Infrastructures, software components, and applications aim to hide their increasing complexity to appear more human-centric. However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes and methods keep demanding the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA).

Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decades. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud.

The Automation of Software Test (AST) conference continues with a long record of international scientific forums on methods and solutions to automate software testing. In 2025, AST is in its 6th edition, having been formerly organized as workshops since 2006. The conference promotes high-quality research contributions on methods for software test automation and original case studies reporting practices in this field. We invite contributions that focus on:

i) lessons learned about experiments of automatic testing in practice;
ii) experiences of the adoption of testing tools, methods and techniques;
iii) best practices to follow in testing and their measurable consequences; and
iv) theoretical approaches that are applicable to the industry in the context of AST.

Our theme for this year is **“Adapting test automation to the AI era including sustainability and emerging challenges”** with special sessions on test automation for AI, sustainability, and AI testing education and training.

## Topics of Interest

## Scope and Expectations

The scope of ASPLOS 2025 covers all practical aspects related to computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems, as well as closely-related associated areas. ASPLOS construes systems broadly, and areas of interest include operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, and virtualization. We seek original, high-quality research submissions that improve and further the knowledge of applied computer systems, with emphasis on the intersection between the main ASPLOS disciplines. Research submissions may be applicable to computer systems of any scale. We embrace research that directly targets new problems in innovative ways, focusing on goals such as throughput, latency, energy, and security. Non-traditional topics are encouraged, and the review process will be sensitive to the challenges of multidisciplinary work in emerging areas. We welcome ""experience papers"" and submissions that further our understanding of existing systems. Submissions with clearly defined artifacts (traces, code, tools) are highly valued.

## Areas of Interest

Alphabetically sorted areas of interest related to practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems include but are not limited to:

*   Existing, emerging, and nontraditional compute platforms at all scales
