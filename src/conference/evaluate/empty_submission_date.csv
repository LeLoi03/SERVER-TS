The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM) is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). This is the nineteenth Symposium in the series, sponsored by Florida Atlantic University. The Symposium will be held **January 7-9, 2026**, in **Ft. Lauderdale, Florida**.

## About the Symposium

ISAIM seeks submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled lessons learned from the development of the application. Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day Symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions.

Work that will have been published as of January 2026 should not be submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the previously published work. However, the ISAIM website proceedings are not archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review elsewhere at the time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM.

Authors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in an archival special volume of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and unpublished to be considered for the special volume.

## Stream A: Decision making and public participation in environmental modelling

This stream through its various sessions seeks to bring together academic experts, action researchers and practitioners to explore recent developments in participatory decision making, modelling, design and research to solve complex problems of today. We will focus on questions related to the latest trends in participatory research, what role AI and Machine Learning can play in advancing participatory methods, how to organise, support and promote stakeholder participation, as well as how diversity among stakeholder groups can help and related areas.

### A1. Applications of integrated models to support participatory scenario processes in sustainability science
Objective of this session is to present and to discuss methods and case studies for the application of simulation models that integrate social and environmental components in participatory scenario processes. Focus is on research related to sustainability science. This may include questions of identifying the relevant scale level and domain of modelling, incorporation of stakeholder knowledge and qualitative scenario components into models in an iterative manner as well as communication of model results and inherent uncertainties.

### A2. Come to the table! Stakeholder engagement in modelling for agricultural transformation
We seek recent methods and applications of modelling/optimization approaches with strong stakeholder involvement that aim at solving real-world problems in agricultural landscapes. Submissions focused on applications are encouraged; they may be related to water and agri-environmental management, land use allocations, biodiversity protection, and the adoption of sustainable technology and management.

### A3. Connecting stakeholder engagement to governance processes and decision making for climate adaptation and sustainability
This session examines the policy, governance, and societal conditions that affect, and are affected by, participatory processes and stakeholder engagements. We are also interested in the approaches, knowledgebases, or tools that can provide greater transparency and accountability to science/policy governance and outcomes. We are particularly interested in presentations and case studies relating to climate adaptation and sustainability.

### A4. Tools and software for participatory modeling and decision support
We encourage submissions discussing advances in openly developed software and tooling for participatory modeling and decision support across various fields. These include environmental and climate policymaking, resource planning, and climate change adaptation. Recent issues around research reproducibility and transparency have led to a general preference for openly developed computational tools to address, or otherwise mitigate, concerns around the trifecta of reproducibility, reusability, and replicability.

### A5. How Data Science and Machine Learning can help Participatory Modeling
We invite papers that illuminate ways in which data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence can support the specific goals of participatory modeling. We also invite papers that address how PM could be used to contribute to the creation of more responsible AI models.

### A6. Improving participatory processes through analysis of narratives, knowledge sources, emotions, values, biases and schema
Our session will focus on methods that can be used to:
(1) Elicit and analyze narratives and their influence on decision-making and participatory processes.
(2) Identify benefits and pitfalls to participatory processes; and roles for narratives in improving facilitation.
(3) Create Records of Engagement and Decision-making (RoED) to improve facilitation, and for broader, longer-term, dissemination/use of the efforts and outcomes of participatory processes.

### A7. Education and capacity building for complex systems modelling
This session aims to promote a scholar-based approach for teaching complex systems modelling. We welcome theoretical and empirical studies from various fields of applications related to complex modelling (e.g. environment, health, business…etc).

### A8. Modelling with Stakeholders 2.0: more than a next-generation
This session aims to incite academic discussions, oral presentations, paper/workshop showcases, and symposiums that provoke the use of participatory modelling (or modelling with stakeholders) as key to tackling current challenges in different disciplines.
