The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC '25) will be held from **July 7–9, 2025**, at the **Sheraton Boston in Boston, MA, USA**. It is co-located with the **19th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI '25)**.

## Overview

The USENIX ATC '25 seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. Submissions are welcome for systems of all scales, from embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds. The scope covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including operating systems, runtime systems, parallel and distributed systems, storage, networking, security and privacy, virtualization, software-hardware interactions, performance evaluation, reliability, energy management, and bug-finding.

USENIX ATC '25 particularly encourages new ideas and approaches, and values submissions accompanied by clearly defined artifacts (traces, data, source code, tools) not previously available.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum.
*   Papers will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity. Flawed ideas or designs may lead to rejection.
*   **USENIX ATC '25 will employ double-blind reviewing.** Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   Papers need to be registered, and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract will be rejected.
*   An optional artifact evaluation process will be available for accepted papers.

## Submission Type: Full vs. Short

*   **Full submissions:** Must not exceed **12 pages** (excluding references and appendices).
*   **Short submissions:** Must not exceed **6 pages** (excluding references and appendices).
*   Both types are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in scope. Short papers present a complete idea that is properly evaluated.
*   Optionally, authors can include an appendix for material not central to the contributions (e.g., algorithm details, proofs, code snippets).
*   For further details, see the [submission instructions](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc25/submission-instructions).

## Deployed Systems Track

USENIX ATC '25 solicits papers describing the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with real-world deployment of systems and networks. These papers need not present new ideas but should convey practical insights. Note that submission and anonymization rules differ for this track.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract registrations due:** Tuesday, January 7, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Submissions due:** Tuesday, January 14, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC

*   Applications of cryptography
    *   Analysis of deployed cryptography and cryptographic protocols
    *   Cryptographic implementation analysis
    *   New cryptographic protocols with real-world applications
*   Blockchains and distributed ledger security
*   Meta-science in Security and Privacy
    *   Meta-science, or the study of scientific research itself, aims to enhance the efficiency, quality, and outcomes of research activities in our community. Submissions in this broad topic should focus on evaluations of research practices, replicability/reproducibility, ethics, research methodologies, data transparency, and peer-review processes.
    *   Contributions should extend beyond analysis, aiming to influence future research practices.
    *   **Replication and Reproduction:** Contributions to this sub-topic should primarily consist of studies that verify, refute, or refine prior technical results or widely-held beliefs. We encourage submissions that not only replicate studies but also offer meta-analyses that assess the replicability of research. Additionally, while replication studies often replicate original findings, we also value novel investigations into why certain studies fail to replicate. Papers that critically examine the conditions under which replication is feasible, or those that propose innovative methods to enhance the reliability of scientific findings, are especially welcome.
*   Systematization of Knowledge (SoK)
    *   SoK papers go beyond simply summarizing previous research; they include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, and offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area.
    *   SoK submissions should be prefixed with ""SoK:"".

## Research Ethics

Authors of all submissions must consider and discuss the ethics of their work. Papers must include a discussion of ethics and an argument for how their full research and publication process was ethical. Failure to do so may result in rejection.

## Open Science

Authors are expected to openly share their research artifacts by default. If artifacts cannot be shared, a detailed justification must be provided. Adherence to the open science policy needs to be explicitly discussed in the paper.

## Artifact Evaluation

Artifact evaluation will take place in two phases: availability after paper acceptance and before final papers are due; functionality and reproducibility after final papers are due. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to register their artifacts.

See the [Call for Artifacts](/conference/usenixsecurity25/call-for-artifacts) for more information.

## New Approach to Presentation of Papers

Accepted papers will be presented in various formats, including longer talks (tentatively 15 minutes), shorter presentations (tentatively 30 seconds to 1 minute), posters, and optional pre-recorded video presentations.

## Submission Policies and Instructions

See the [USENIX Security '25 Submission Policies and Instructions](/conference/usenixsecurity25/submission-policies-and-instructions) page for details.

The 2025 symposium is scheduled to take place from October 6 to October 10, 2025, in Raleigh, North Carolina, USA, at the Duke Energy Hall: James B. Hunt Jr. Library at North Carolina State University.","# Call for Research Papers

We solicit original, unpublished research papers on computing technologies for modeling, programming, communicating, and reasoning, which are easier to learn, use or understand by humans than the current state-of-the-art. Papers should focus on efforts to design, formalize, implement, or evaluate those technologies and languages. This includes technologies intended for general audiences (e.g., professional or novice programmers, or the public) or domain-specific audiences (e.g., people working in business administration, production environments, healthcare, urban design or scientific domains). Empirical papers that validate current proposed solutions with rigorous scientific means (i.e., empirical studies, controlled experiments, rigorous case studies, etc.) are also welcome.

## Scope and Topics

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   **Visual languages:** Novel visual languages, Design, evaluation, and theory of visual languages and applications, Development of systems for manipulating and interacting with diagrammatic representations
*   **Human aspects and psychology of software development and language design**, such as supporting inclusion and diversity in programming
*   **End-user development, adaptation and programming**, Creation and evaluation of technologies and infrastructures for end-user development
*   **Representations:** Novel representations and user interfaces for expressing computation, Software, algorithm and data visualization
*   **Modeling:** Model-driven development, Domain-specific languages, including modeling languages, Visual modeling of human behavior and socio-technical systems
*   **Thinking more deeply about code:** Debugging, program comprehension, code review, Explainable ML/AI
*   **Future of work with AI:** Human-Centric AI-based tools, modeling end-user interactions with AI powered tools
*   **Low-Code/No-Code paradigm:** Approaches for creation and deployment of fully functional applications using visual abstractions and interfaces
*   **Education and Computational thinking:** using visual languages in education, teaching human-centric principals, educator and student perspectives

If you are not sure if your paper is a good fit for VL/HCC, feel free to email the PC Co-chairs (see “Contact” below). We welcome those new to the VL/HCC community to submit!

## Special Emphasis for 2025: Human-AI Collaboration

We seek research that highlights the situations in which human-AI interactions enhance, or degrade, the human experience in computing. Papers describing positive, negative and unclear impacts are all welcome.

## Paper Submissions

We invite two kinds of papers:

*   **Full-length papers:** up to 10 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements
*   **Short papers:** up to 5 pages - plus unlimited additional pages containing only references and/or acknowledgements

All accepted papers, whether full or short, should be complete, self-contained, archival contributions. Contributions from full papers are more extensive than those from short papers. Papers do not have to reach the maximum page limit, but they should be of an appropriate length for the content. Note that some full paper submissions may be accepted as short papers if reviewers deem contributions to be comparable in size to a short paper.

Papers could be research findings, industry experience reports, replication studies, or vision papers. Please select the appropriate page length for the content of your paper.

Papers must be submitted using the IEEE two-column conference paper format. Be sure to use the current IEEE conference paper format (which was updated in 2019), and to select the “US letter” template.

Papers should be submitted via the EasyChair system: [https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vlhcc2025](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=vlhcc2025).

To facilitate the assigning of papers to reviewers, authors should submit paper abstracts via EasyChair at least 1 week prior to the paper submission deadline (see Important Dates below). The abstract must be no longer than 250 words.

All submissions will be reviewed by members of the Program Committee in a double-anonymous review process. Authors will then receive the reviews for their submissions and will be able to answer them in a rebuttal phase. Only after this step will the PC make a final decision about the acceptance of the submissions. Submissions and reviews for the technical program are managed with EasyChair. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for VL/HCC 2025 and present the paper at the conference. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference, including IEEE Xplore Digital Library, if the paper is not presented by the author at the conference.

The proceedings of IEEE VL/HCC are published in digital form by the IEEE Computer Science Society and archived in the IEEE Digital Library with an official ISBN number. Accepted papers will be available to conference attendees via the IEEE Open Preview program in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library).

## Double-Anonymous Reviewing

We follow a double-anonymous reviewing process. Both authors and reviewers are expected to make every effort to honor the double-anonymous reviewing process. In case of questions, please contact the Program Chairs. Authors should ensure that the submission can be evaluated without it being obvious who wrote the paper. This means leaving author names off the paper and using terms like “previous research” rather than “our previous research” when describing background. However, do not hide previous work – papers must still reference all relevant research using full (non-anonymized) citations, including the author’s own prior work, so that reviewers can evaluate novelty. Please reference your own prior work in the third-person just like you would do for any other related work (e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], … ” and instead write something like “As described by [10], …”). It is also important that authors specify all conflicts of interest with potential reviewers during the submission phase. Reviewers should not undertake any investigation that might lead to the revealing of authors’ identity. If identities are inadvertently revealed, please contact the Program Chairs. The Program Chairs will check all submissions for obvious signs of lack of anonymity and may ask authors to make changes and resubmit the paper within three days of the submission deadline. Only changes to resolve anonymity issues will be permitted.

## Evaluation and Justification

Papers are expected to support their claims with appropriate evidence. For example, a paper that claims to improve programmer productivity is expected to demonstrate improved productivity; a paper that claims to be easier to use should demonstrate increased ease of use.

However, not all claims necessarily need to be supported with empirical evidence or studies with people. For example, a paper that claims to make something feasible that was clearly infeasible might substantiate its claim through the existence of a functioning prototype.

Moreover, there are many alternatives to empirical evidence that may be appropriate for justifying claims, including analytical methods, formal arguments or case studies. Given this criterion, we encourage potential authors to think carefully about what claims their submission makes and what evidence would adequately support these claims.

Replication papers will be evaluated on their own merit in terms of methods used, findings discussed and comparison to original studies in terms of different context or use of different methods.

Vision papers should make a case for future needs and research directions in VL and/or HCC community interest areas within a timeline of the next 5 to 10 years.

Industrial experience reports with VL and/or HCC topics should describe context, lessons learned (positive or negative), and recommendations for research and practice as appropriate.

We expect short papers to have less comprehensive evaluation than full-length papers, and may have less technical detail, but sufficient to make the case for the contribution. New ideas and early research results would be expected to use a short paper format.

## Adhering to IEEE Guidelines

Please be sure that your submission follows the [IEEE requirements](https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/author-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-policies/)

Especially around Human Subject approvals and use of Generative AI:

### Research on Human and Animal Subjects

Authors of articles reporting on research involving human subjects or animals, including but extending beyond medical research, shall include a statement in the article that the research was performed under the oversight of an institutional review board or equivalent local/regional body, including the official name of the IRB/ethics committee, or include an explanation as to why such a review was not conducted. For research involving human subjects, authors shall also report that consent from the human subjects in the research was obtained or explain why consent was not obtained.

### Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text

The use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in a paper (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section of any paper submitted to an IEEE publication. The AI system used shall be identified, and specific sections of the paper that use AI-generated content shall be identified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the level at which the AI system was used to generate the content. The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. In this case, disclosure as noted above is recommended.
