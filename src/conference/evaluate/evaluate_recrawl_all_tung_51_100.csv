## Scope

**Knowledge Engineering (KE)** encompasses the technical, scientific, and social aspects of building, maintaining, and utilizing knowledge-based systems. It draws on AI, databases, expert systems, decision support systems, and software engineering, integrating insights from logic, cognitive science, and socio-cognitive engineering. Recent advancements, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Low-code/No-code Platforms, are expanding KE's reach by enabling automated ontology generation and greater accessibility.

**Ontology Development (OD)** focuses on creating reusable semantic structures like vocabularies, glossaries, and formal ontologies. These structures are essential in applications such as knowledge graphs, digital twins, explainable AI (XAI), cybersecurity, and IoT interoperability. Ontologies also play a crucial role in ensuring ethical AI development, mitigating bias, and enhancing transparency.

KEOD serves as a key venue for exploring traditional and cutting-edge topics like LLM-based Ontology Development, Ontology-driven Digital Twins, and Ontology-enhanced Low-code Platforms.

## About the Workshop

""Top Picks in VLSI Test and Reliability” (TPTR) is a workshop that collects and presents the most impactful publications, keynotes, and invited presentations in the past 6 years in the areas of VLSI test and reliability.

For this year’s edition, the workshop is organized in two tracks:

1.  **Impactful Publications:** The most impactful publications from the past six years in the areas of VLSI test and reliability.
2.  **Impactful Keynotes/Invited Presentations:** The most impactful keynotes and invited presentations from the past six years, without an associated publication, in the same areas.

All articles in conferences and journals published from **2018 until the submission deadline** are eligible for track 1. Keynotes or invited talks from an IEEE TTTC-sponsored conference from **2018 until the submission deadline** are eligible for track 2. The two submission categories will be evaluated separately.

## Submission Process

*   **Submission Type:** TPTR accepts self-nominations by authors in the form of a **one-page letter**.
    *   The authors should summarize and highlight the key ideas and contributions of the presentation or publication.
    *   Describe the influence on ongoing research in the field.
    *   State the potential to positively impact the microelectronics industry in the long term.
*   **Review:** Submitted abstracts will be reviewed by a committee of renowned experts in the field and will be shortlisted.
*   **Presentation:** An author of each shortlisted publication must attend the workshop **in person** for a presentation showcasing its influence and impact. The presentation should be more than just replicating the original one. Authors should ensure that **30-40%** of the allocated time is dedicated to highlighting its influence on ongoing research in the field and its potential to impact the microelectronics industry.
*   **Final Selection:** The same committee (or a subset of it) will also attend the workshop to select a final list of Top Picks, which will then be invited for submission to an IEEE Design & Test special issue. The submission should not repeat or reword the original publication or presentation; it should be an extended version with new material.

## New at RTCSA'25: Industry Session

RTCSA 2025 introduces a dedicated Industry Session, providing a platform for contributions that focus on industrial applications and practices. Submissions to this session will follow the same single-blind review process as regular papers, with the following additional criteria:

*   A paper is eligible for the Industry Session if:
    *   It describes industrial applications and/or practices;
    *   At least one co-author has an industrial affiliation.

Submissions to the Industry Session will be evaluated primarily on their practical significance.

## Submission Guidelines

Both research and industry papers are solicited. The submitted manuscript must describe original work not previously published and not concurrently submitted elsewhere. Abstract submission is a prerequisite for full paper submission.

We welcome high quality papers, adhering to the following two formats:

*   **Full Paper format:** technical content must fit within **10 pages**; references and acknowledgments can be arranged in 2 additional pages.
*   **Short Paper format:** technical content must fit within **6 pages**; references and acknowledgements can be arranged in 2 additional pages.

Both types of submission must be formatted according to the **IEEE conference proceedings format (two-columns, single-space, 10pt)**. Submitted papers are subject to single-blind reviews.

In some cases, the Program Committee may decide to accept a full paper submission as a short paper, in which case, the authors will be required to reduce its length for the final version.

By submitting a paper, authors implicitly agree that at least one author will register at the full registration rate to the conference and present the paper in person. RTCSA 2025 reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from the digital library and indexing services), if the paper is not presented at the conference.

## Publication

Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore. Selected papers will be invited to submit an extended version to the **Springer Real-Time Systems journal**.

The 46th IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS 2025) will take place in **Boston, MA, USA, from December 2–5, 2025**.

## Scope of the Conference

The IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the field of real-time systems, where researchers and practitioners showcase innovations covering all aspects of real-time systems, including theory, design, analysis, implementation, verification, evaluation, and experience.

RTSS’25, the 46th edition of the event, continues the tradition of embracing new and emerging areas of real-time systems research.

## Timing Requirements

To be in scope, **ALL submissions must explicitly address some form of real-time requirements / constraints**. Examples include deadlines, response-time bounds, thresholds on acceptable tail latencies, as well as statistical and stochastic notions of timeliness.

Submissions should provide a compelling justification if the problem requires nontrivial resource allocation, programming, scheduling, or design approach to satisfy timing-predictability requirements. Improving average-case performance without regard to other criteria is not considered addressing a real-time requirement, unless it simultaneously ensures worst-case latency or execution time variability is not worsened.

RTSS especially welcomes new and emerging topics such as machine learning techniques for real-time systems, system design for real-time machine learning, resource management in autonomous systems, and system-level solutions for real-time applications exploiting domain-specific accelerators.

## Surveys and User Studies

Empirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field is also welcome. This includes surveys, questionnaires, interviews, use-cases, or other empirical techniques to obtain information about the state of research, design, development, verification, validation, and deployment of real-time systems.

Literature surveys that solely classify, review, and summarize existing research papers are not considered empirical research and are not in scope.

## Proceedings and Awards

All accepted papers will appear in the main program and proceedings, provided they are presented at the conference. A selection of papers will receive recognition as outstanding papers. **Best paper**, **best student paper**, and **best presentation awards** will be presented at the conference. Submissions are eligible for the best student paper award if the first author is a student as of the submission deadline.

## Tracks

RTSS’25 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems theory and practice. Manuscripts may be submitted to either:

### Track 1: Real-Time Systems and Foundations
