Welcome to the ITiCSE 2025 Call for Papers. This page provides detailed information about paper submissions. Please read the general [Call for Participation](https://iticse.acm.org/2025/call-for-participation/) first. For questions, please [contact the program chairs](mailto:iticse2025papers@easychair.org).

## ITiCSE 2025 Paper Tracks

Papers submitted to ITiCSE address aspects of computing education. Submissions are divided into three tracks:

1.  **Computing Education Research:** Papers defining research questions, describing data gathering and methods, presenting results, and discussing contributions to knowledge in computing teaching and learning.
2.  **Experience Reports and Tools:** Papers describing computing education experiences, including tools developed for computing education, with sufficient detail for adoption. These should be motivated by literature, highlight novelty, and describe what worked and what didn't.
3.  **Position Papers and Proposals:** Papers articulating original and well-argued positions on computing education or proposals for early-stage work. These must offer value to the community, even if the work is not yet completed.

All papers must explicitly state motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and include an analysis of intervention effectiveness if applicable. **Initial submissions must be anonymous.**

## Submission Process

### Abstract Submission

*   A mandatory abstract submission is required for all papers.
*   Abstracts can be up to **250 words** and must be submitted as plain text.
*   **Deadline:** Sunday, January 12, 2025.
*   The abstract helps reviewers bid for papers they are qualified and interested in reviewing.

### Full Paper Submission

*   **Deadline:** Sunday, January 19, 2025.
*   **Anonymity Requirements:**
    *   The paper submitted for review **must be fully anonymous**.
    *   Remove all identifying references: author names, affiliations, any information in the body or headers that might identify authors or institutions (e.g., websites, publications, geographic locations).
    *   Omit acknowledgements that might identify authors.
    *   Self-citations should be worded to prevent reviewer identification (e.g., ""An early experiment in this area was carried out in 2018 [13]"" instead of ""We reported on our first experiment in 2018 [13]"").
    *   If presenting software, anonymize its name.
    *   Leave space for author names, affiliations, and ACM reference format, or ensure the paper is short of the page limit.
    *   **Do not include links to additional material** (e.g., software demonstrations) in the review version.
    *   Submissions to sites like arXiv should use a different title and abstract than the review version to maintain anonymity.

IWCIA 2025, the twenty-third International Workshop on Combinatorial Image Analysis, invites submissions of original research relevant to the workshop's scope. The workshop will be held in a **hybrid mode** with its base in **Szeged, Hungary, from September 24-26, 2025**.

The scientific program will consist of keynote talks and contributed papers. The conference proceedings are approved for publication by **Springer in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)**.

## Scope

Image analysis is a scientific discipline providing theoretical foundations and methods for solving problems appearing in a wide range of areas, as diverse as medicine, robotics, defense, and security. As a rule, the processed data are discrete; therefore, the “discrete approach” to image analysis appears to be a natural one and has an increasing importance. It is based on studying combinatorial properties of the considered digital data sets. Combinatorial image analysis often features various advantages (in terms of efficiency and accuracy) over the more traditional approaches based on continuous models requiring numeric computation.

The Workshop is a forum for current research on the following (or similar) research subjects which are directly or potentially applicable to image analysis:

*   Combinatorial problems in the discrete plane and space
*   Lattice polygons and polytopes
*   Digital/combinatorial geometry and topology
*   Digital manifolds
*   Geometry of digital curves and surfaces
*   Analysis and processing of digital surfaces with singularities (such as “pinched digital surfaces”)
*   Homotopy of digital manifolds; thinning algorithms and skeletons
*   Boundary tracking of digital solids; Geometric characteristics of object boundaries
*   Multigrid convergence analysis of metric-based descriptors
*   Tilings and patterns; Combinatorial pattern matching
*   Computational geometry and imaging sciences
*   Integer programming, linear programming, and graph theoretic models and approaches to problems of image analysis
*   Image representation, segmentation, grouping, and reconstruction
*   Processing “very large” digital pictures; Methods for image compression
*   Parallel architectures and algorithms
*   Fuzzy and stochastic image analysis
*   Discrete tomography
*   Grammars and models for image or scene analysis and recognition; cellular automata
*   Mathematical morphology and image analysis
*   Applications in medical imaging, biometrics, computer vision, image understanding, robotics, metrology, and others
*   AI and machine learning in imaging and image analysis

The symposium focuses on advances in biomedical imaging.","# Call for Academic Software Demos

We welcome proposals for in-person demos of academic, open, free, and non-commercial software. The software may or may not be directly associated with accepted ISBI 2025 papers and abstracts, but should still have relevance to accepted ISBI 2025 work. The academic demo sessions of ISBI 2025 will aim to showcase recent developments in the field, software used in ISBI 2025 papers, all relevant to the ISBI community. This will be an opportunity for presenters to perform live demos of their code/software while interacting with conference attendees face-to-face.

## Focus Areas

Demos should focus on **open science, reproducible research, clinically-translational work, and soft skills development**. Demos should provide material for all levels of expertise, including students, early career scientists, professionals, and clinical users. Demos should primarily focus on the (relatively mature) tools developed by the presenters rather than results.

## Demo Format

*   All accepted demos will be **in-person** in an assigned conference hall during the main conference.
*   Each demo will be provided with a **small table, power outlet, wireless (shared) Internet, and a monitor** during its assigned time slot.
*   Submissions should list all other supporting equipment that will be needed per demo, so the conference committee may do their best to arrange them.
*   Demo presenters are expected to bring their own laptops/PCs as needed for their demo.

## Demo Fee

*   There will be a **$140 fee** for the demo package (table, poster board, screen, power connection).
*   This fee must be paid upon registration by the presenter of the relevant paper the demo is attached to, who will be attending the conference, in addition to their conference attendee fee.

## Demo Proposal Requirements

Proposals should be **no more than one (1) page** in 12-point font submitted as a single PDF file. Demo proposals should contain the following sections:

*   **Title:** Must have the prefix ""Demo:"" (e.g., ""Demo:<Title>""). Include a brief topic overview and brief expected learning outcomes.
*   **Representative Image:** One ""representative image"".
*   **Relevance to ISBI community:** Emerging topics will be favorably considered if the link with the ISBI community is clearly established (the software is associated with an accepted ISBI 2025 paper or abstract).
*   **Software URLs:** List any GitHub or otherwise public software related URLs.
*   **Target Audience:** Describe from which areas potential participants are expected to visit the demo, what prior knowledge or skills are expected from the audience, and what software or programming languages might be involved.
