The Symposium on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) 2025 invites submissions on all aspects of human factors and usability in the context of security and privacy.

USEC '25 aims to bring together researchers already engaged in this interdisciplinary effort with other researchers in relevant areas, encouraging economics, HCI, AI, theoretical computer science, cryptography, psychology, and business studies researchers and practitioners to submit original research. Collaborative research from authors in multiple fields is particularly encouraged.

## Submission Tracks

USEC '25 will feature the following tracks:

*   **Research Track:** For mature, completed work. Papers must not be more than **12 pages** in length (excluding bibliography and appendices). Longer papers should scale length according to contributions.
*   **Meta-Science Track:** For mature work focused on research practices, replicability, and systematization of knowledge. Papers must not exceed **12 pages** (excluding bibliography and appendices). Supplementary appendices are encouraged.
*   **Vision Track:** For work in progress or concrete ideas for future work. Papers must be up to **5 pages** in length (excluding bibliography and appendices).

## Submission Guidelines

Early Bird registration is available until June 16, with a hotel discount deadline also on June 16 (extended to June 23).","# USENIX ATC '25 Call for Papers

The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC '25) will be held from **July 7–9, 2025**, at the **Sheraton Boston in Boston, MA, USA**. It is co-located with the **19th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI '25)**.

## Overview

The USENIX ATC '25 seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. Submissions are welcome for systems of all scales, from embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds. The scope covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including operating systems, runtime systems, parallel and distributed systems, storage, networking, security and privacy, virtualization, software-hardware interactions, performance evaluation, reliability, energy management, and bug-finding.

USENIX ATC '25 particularly encourages new ideas and approaches, and values submissions accompanied by clearly defined artifacts (traces, data, source code, tools) not previously available.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum.
*   Papers will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity. Flawed ideas or designs may lead to rejection.
*   **USENIX ATC '25 will employ double-blind reviewing.** Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   Papers need to be registered, and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract will be rejected.
*   An optional artifact evaluation process will be available for accepted papers.

## Submission Type: Full vs. Short

*   **Full submissions:** Must not exceed **12 pages** (excluding references and appendices).
*   **Short submissions:** Must not exceed **6 pages** (excluding references and appendices).
*   Both types are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in scope. Short papers present a complete idea that is properly evaluated.
*   Optionally, authors can include an appendix for material not central to the contributions (e.g., algorithm details, proofs, code snippets).
*   For further details, see the [submission instructions](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc25/submission-instructions).

## Deployed Systems Track

USENIX ATC '25 solicits papers describing the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with real-world deployment of systems and networks. These papers need not present new ideas but should convey practical insights. Note that submission and anonymization rules differ for this track.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract registrations due:** Tuesday, January 7, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Submissions due:** Tuesday, January 14, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Authors' response period:** Monday, April 7–Wednesday, April 9, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC

*   **Final papers due:** Tuesday, June 3, 2025

## On the Use of Generative AI

Authors must not submit papers containing sections generated entirely by generative AI. Authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper does not include sections completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP.

Initial recommendations: Conditionally accept as IEEE TVCG paper, Conditionally accept as conference paper, Recommend as a two-page poster, or Reject.
*   **Review Cycle II (Initial notification to Final decision):** Revision of conditionally accepted papers reviewed by the coordinator for final recommendation.

### Additional Guidelines

*   **Abstract Submission:** Abstract must be uploaded seven days prior to the paper submission deadline.
*   **Ethics and Responsibility:** All research experiments with human participants must follow institutional ethical guidelines and secure ethics committee approval. Approval details must be reported in the submission system.
*   **Participant Diversity:** Research with human participants should strive for participant diversity and report demographics. Submissions making general claims with imbalanced participant groups may be negatively impacted.
*   **Review Duties for Authors:** One author per submitted paper must register to review up to three papers through PCS.
*   **Presentation at the Conference:** All accepted submissions must be presented orally at the conference. In-person presentation is expected; online presentations are accommodated only in exceptional cases.
*   **Submission Language:** All submissions must be in English.
*   **Previous Publication and Plagiarism:** Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously published or simultaneously under consideration elsewhere. Builds upon prior work can be submitted with additional papers and an explanation letter (seen by primary reviewer). Plagiarism will be checked using IEEE Crosscheck and may lead to rejection.
*   **AI-generated Text:** Large-scale language models (LLMs) can only be used for grammar editing.
*   **Submission Anonymity:** IEEE VR uses a DOUBLE-BLIND review process. Submissions must not contain author identifying information. Citations to authors' previous work must be in the third person. Failure to adhere to the double-blind policy will result in desk rejection.
*   **Pre-dissemination:** Uploading manuscripts to online repositories before the review process does not constitute a reason for rejection but can compromise anonymity.
*   **Videos:** Videos must be submitted according to instructions, free of identifying information. Accepted videos for the video proceedings will require a revised version.

The Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR) is a biannual multi-disciplinary single-track meeting for international researchers presenting the latest advances on algorithmic problems in robotics. In 2024, we celebrate **30 years of WAFR** and are planning special events.

WAFR's focus is on the design and analysis of robot algorithms from both theoretical and practical angles. These algorithms process inputs from noisy sensors, build geometric and physical models of the world, plan high- and low-level actions, and execute them on actuators with limited precision. The design and analysis of robot algorithms draw from fields including control theory, computational and differential geometry, and computer science.

## Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools for Authors

*   Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of a paper submitted to WAFR.
*   The use of content generated by AI in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section.
*   The AI system used must be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content should be specified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the manner in which the AI system was used to generate the content.
*   The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. Even so, in this case, disclosure is still recommended as the lines between these uses can be difficult to distinguish.

## Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools for Reviewers

Information or content contained in or about a manuscript under review shall not be processed through an AI system. Doing so is considered a breach of confidentiality and as such is not permitted.
