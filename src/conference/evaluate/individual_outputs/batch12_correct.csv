Thank you for over 100 contributions on a big variety of S&G related topics. We are sure that together we will create an unforgettable conference.

## Theme: ""Shaping the Future"" through Simulation and Gaming

In a world where uncertainty looms large, simulation and gaming provide us with powerful tools to explore, experiment, and envision the future. Whether it is modelling the impact of climate change, predicting market trends, or designing urban landscapes, simulation and gaming empower us to shape a better tomorrow. Let’s discuss the opportunities and challenges of “shaping the future” through simulation and gaming.

### Content Focus:

Submissions on topics with the following focus are particularly welcome:

*   Artificial intelligence, big data and automation
*   Augmented and virtual reality

## Overview

ISMAR 2025 will host a single track for papers and include a revise and resubmit phase, strengthening the rebuttal opportunity. The conference will cover industry and research activities related to the full range of immersive technologies (AR, MR, and VR), including everything from interfaces in the real world to fully immersive experiences and beyond.

We invite contributions that advance all aspects of AR / MR / VR technology and user experiences.

## Paper Submissions

This year, there is one submission deadline for a unified review process for both the IEEE TVCG journal and the conference-only papers. The possible outcomes of this unified process are:

*   Accept as IEEE TVCG paper, with presentation at ISMAR 2025
*   Accept as IEEE ISMAR 2025 conference paper, with presentation at ISMAR 2025
*   Recommended as IEEE ISMAR 2025 poster.
*   Reject

Submissions accepted as journal papers will be directly published in a special issue of IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG). Submissions accepted as conference papers will be published in the conference proceedings of ISMAR 2025. All accepted papers will be archived in the IEEE Xplore digital library.

Submissions may be **4-9 pages** with an additional 2 pages of references. A paper abstract must be uploaded prior to the actual paper submission deadline. All paper submissions must be in English and left blind for review. Accepted papers will be granted an oral presentation and may have the opportunity to present as a demo.

## Review Process

The review process will have two cycles under a single submission deadline:

### Review Cycle I (Submission to Initial Notification)

Submissions will be assigned to two members of the ISMAR 2025 International Program Committee (IPC). Submissions that violate the submission guidelines will be desk rejected. Those that are not desk rejected will receive at least three full reviews.

Based on reviews and discussions, the Program Chairs will make one of the following initial recommendations:

*   **Revise and Resubmit:** These submissions will go through a second review cycle. A revise and resubmit recommendation does not guarantee acceptance.
*   **Reject:** Authors may resubmit rejected papers to the poster track.

### Review Cycle II (Revision with Rebuttal to Final Decision)

Authors will have time to revise their submissions and write a rebuttal. The revised submission and rebuttal will be reviewed, leading to a final recommendation by the committee.

## Topics of Interest

The goal of the International Foundation of Robotics Research (IFRR) is to promote the development of robotics as a scientific field, establishing the theoretical foundations and technology basis for its ever expanding applications, with emphasis on its potential role to benefit humans.

The Foundation was formally established in 1986 following the success of a series of pioneering symposia that were conceived to provide the emerging community with a forum entirely devoted to all areas of robotics research.

## Anonymizing Rules

Authors must anonymize their papers by:

1.  Removing authors' names and affiliations from the title page.
2.  Removing acknowledgements of identifying names and funding sources.
3.  Using care in naming files (source file names are often embedded).
4.  Referring to related work, particularly your own, in the third person. Avoid omitting references.
5.  If citing anonymous work, send deanonymized references to the PC chairs via email.
6.  Authors may use a non-anonymized version for other purposes but must not mention submission to ISSRE 2025.

Submissions violating formatting and anonymization rules will be desk rejected.

## Formatting Rules

*   Submissions must adhere to the IEEE Computer Society Format Guidelines using the provided LaTeX/Word templates.
*   Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file with embedded fonts.
*   The first page must include the title and a maximum 200-word abstract.
*   Figures and graphs should be readable in grayscale.
*   Symbols and labels in graphs should be readable when printed.
*   Limit file size to less than 15 MB.
*   Authors are encouraged to supply source code and raw data for reproducibility.

*   Submissions will be reviewed via a double-blind process. Papers with non-disclosure agreement forms will be rejected.
*   Changes in author numbers/order are not allowed after acceptance.
*   Submissions violating formatting and anonymization rules will be desk rejected without review.

## Review Process and Author Response

Reviews will be made available to authors before the PC/Board meeting for factual error correction. Responses should be concise and focus on reviewer concerns. The new ""Early Decisions"" system will categorize papers as ""Accept"", ""Reject"", or ""Response Recommended"" early on, reducing the need for responses in many cases.

## Awards

*   **Best Research Paper Award:** Awarded annually to the best paper in the Research Track.

## Conference Proceedings

The conference proceedings will be published by IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services (CPS), submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore and A&I partners.

## IEEE Policies

All submissions must adhere to IEEE Conference Publishing Policies and will be screened for plagiarism through the IEEE Cross Check portal.","sub: 9/10

The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) 2025 invites high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental research on software testing and analysis.

## Submission Types

ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions:

2.  **Experience Papers:** Describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools, with carefully identified and discussed lessons learned for the community.
3.  **Replicability Studies:** Encouraging the replication of results from previous papers, going beyond simple re-implementation. These studies should clearly describe their purpose and value beyond the original result, and will be evaluated based on depth and breadth of experiments, clarity of writing, appropriateness of conclusions, actionable insights, and availability of artefacts.

## Publication

**NEW THIS YEAR:** The conference proceedings will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Software Engineering (PACMSE), Issue: ISSTA 2025.
