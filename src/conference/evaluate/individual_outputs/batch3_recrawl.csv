Authors are encouraged to submit their artifacts for the Artifact Evaluation (AE) process, which begins after acceptance notification. The AE committee assesses how artifacts support the paper's claims.

*   **Badge Types:**
    *   **Red badge (Artifact Usable):** Awarded based on usability and robustness (Light-red or Dark-red).
    *   **Blue badge (Results Reproduced):** Awarded if main paper results can be reproduced with the artifact.

The conference features two review cycles and includes various calls for participation, such as for Doctoral Symposium, Posters/Demos, Artifacts, Workshops, and Sponsors.","# ACM CCS 2025: Call for Papers

The 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy.

CCS has **two review cycles** in 2025.

## Review Decisions

*   **Accept:** Papers will be accepted for publication and presentation, possibly after minor changes overseen by a shepherd.
*   **Minor revision:** Promising papers needing minor work (e.g., experiments, proofs) may be resubmitted with revisions for re-evaluation.
*   **Reject:** Papers declined for inclusion. Papers rejected from the first cycle may not be submitted to the second cycle.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper in-person, if possible.

## Paper Submission Information

*   Submissions must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the corresponding deadline.
*   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers published or accepted elsewhere, or currently under submission to another journal or conference.
*   All submissions must be properly **anonymized**. Avoid revealing authors' identities and cite previous work by yourself in the third person, or blind the reference itself. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   Authors may submit up to a maximum of 7 papers for Cycle B.
*   Papers will be evaluated based on their importance to practical aspects of computer and communications security and privacy, novelty, quality of execution, and presentation.
*   For papers raising ethical concerns, authors must convince reviewers that proper procedures have been followed.
*   Submissions may be rejected for being out of scope.
*   No modifications to the author list are allowed after submission.

## Mandatory Reviewing

Authors submitting 3 or more papers may be required to review other papers. Failure to provide requested information may lead to desk rejection.

## Withdrawing Policy

A paper can be withdrawn at any point before reviews are sent to authors. After reviews are sent, withdrawal is not permitted.

## Paper Format

*   Submissions must be a **PDF file** in double-column ACM format using the ""sigconf"" style.
*   Maximum length: **12 pages**, excluding bibliography, appendices, and supplementary material.
*   Reviewers are not required to read appendices or supplementary material.
*   Do not change the font or margins of the ACM format.

*   Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.

## Providing Artifacts at Submission Time

Submissions claiming contributions based on artifacts (code, models, data sets) should make them accessible to reviewers unless there are valid reasons not to. An anonymous web link is acceptable if the contents are also anonymized.

## Optional Artifact Evaluation (AE)

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to submit artifacts for AE. A separate call for artifacts will follow.

## Overview

The Annual Symposium on Computer-Human Interaction in Play (CHI PLAY) is the premier international and interdisciplinary conference for researchers and professionals across all areas of play, games, and human-computer interaction (HCI), focusing on **player-computer interaction**. CHI PLAY 2025 will be held from **October 13-16, 2025, in Pittsburgh, USA**. The conference aims to highlight and foster discussion of high-quality research in games and HCI, blending academic research papers with interactive play demos, masterclasses, and industry insights.

All accepted submissions will be distributed in the CHI PLAY Conference Proceedings and will be available in the **ACM Digital Library**.

## Full Papers (GAMES Track)

The GAMES track of PACMHCI (CHI PLAY) welcomes research on player-computer interactions, including understanding player experience, contributions on novel designs or implementations, and theoretical advancements. The track also considers research on the effects of technologies, software, or algorithms on player experiences.

## Topics of Interest

We invite authors to submit their best research on all topics relevant to player-computer interactions and digital play. Submission should present original and mature research work. High-quality, elaborated case studies and practice reports with generalizable findings will also be considered. Topics include, but are not limited to:

*   Novel input or output technologies for games and play
*   Studies that contribute to our understanding of player experience of digital play
*   Innovative game mechanics and playful interactions
*   Theoretical contributions on digital play and games
*   Accessible and inclusive design of player-computer interactions
*   Esports, live streaming, and spectator experiences
*   Advances in digital game user research, game evaluation methods, and methods for conducting games research
*   Psychology and typologies of digital games and players
*   Studies of applied, serious, and persuasive digital games (e.g., games and play for health, well-being, and learning)
*   Gamification and motivational design
*   Virtual and augmented reality in games and play
*   New tools for digital game creation and co-creation that directly affect player experience and/or player-computer interactions
*   Game analytics and novel visualizations of player-computer interactions
*   Developer experiences and studies of developers of digital games
*   Applications of human-centered game AI with implications for HCI games research
*   Critical and reflexive approaches to digital games & play design and experience
*   Gaming industry case studies

**Note:** Technical contributions without impact on players or other relevant people in the game community, or systems without a gameful or playful component, are generally out of scope.

## Other Submission Types

CHI PLAY also invites submissions for:

*   Companion Submission Overview & Guidelines
*   Work-in-Progress
*   Perspectives on Play
*   Student Game Design Competition
