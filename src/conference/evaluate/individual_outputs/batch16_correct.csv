We are pleased to announce the 21st edition of the “Robotics: Science and Systems” (RSS) conference, to be held at the **University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA, from June 21 - 25, 2025**.

RSS is a **single-track conference** that connects researchers working on all aspects of robotics, including scientific foundations, mechanisms, algorithms, applications, and analysis of robotic systems. The single-track format allows attendees to learn about state-of-the-art research across all robotics domains. The conference will feature oral and poster presentations of accepted papers, demonstrations, invited talks, and panels.

## Announcement 1: LA Wildfire Support

In response to recent wildfires in Los Angeles, adjustments have been made to the RSS 2025 submission timeline. The abstract/title submission (January 17) and initial paper submission (January 24) deadlines remain unchanged. However, authors can update the PDF of their paper until **January 31, 2025**, which is also the supplementary material deadline. For more details, read the [full announcement](/updates/la-wildfires/).

## Announcement 2: Double Submissions

Submitting an abstract (by January 17) or a semi-complete paper (by January 24) that is currently under submission to another conference (e.g., ICRA, ICLR, CVPR) is considered a double submission and is forbidden by RSS rules. However, if a paper contains substantial innovation compared to the paper under review (qualifying it as a different and novel paper), it may be submitted to RSS.

## Submission Types

*   **Paper Contributions:** We invite submissions of high-quality research papers that introduce new ideas and stimulate future trends in robotics.
*   **Demo Contributions:** Submissions for demos are possible and will include a Demo Track during the main conference. These single-blind submissions can range from early research demos to mature production-ready systems. Open-source and open-access systems or interactive systems accessible to the community are especially encouraged. Demos can relate to hardware or software contributions, their integration, critical system components, and useful tools for the community.

The 31st IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS) is a top-tier conference with a focus on systems with timing requirements. RTAS’25 welcomes papers describing applications, case studies, methodologies, tools, algorithms, operating systems, middleware, or hardware innovations that contribute to the state of the art in the design, implementation, validation, verification, and evolution of systems with timing requirements.

RTAS’25 will be part of the [CPS-IoT Week](https://cps-iot-week2025.ics.uci.edu/) in **Irvine, USA, May 6-9, 2025**.

## Tracks

RTAS’25 consists of two tracks:

*   **Track 1: Systems and Applications**
*   **Track 2: Applied Methodologies and Foundations**

## Scope and Guidelines

To be in scope, papers must explicitly consider at least one of the following:

*   Some kind of timing requirements;
*   Improvements or innovations that directly support the fundamental properties of systems with timing requirements.

### Timing Requirements

The timing requirements of interest are broadly defined and include not only classical hard real-time constraints, but also soft real-time, probabilistic, quality-of-service (QoS), throughput or latency requirements. The authors should specifically state the types of timing-related properties addressed by the contribution(s) presented in their paper.

### Improvements or Innovations to Support Fundamental Properties

Work that supports the design, implementation, validation, or evaluation of deterministic, predictable, dependable, efficient, or next-generation systems with timing requirements are welcome. The authors should specifically state how their work can be used or built upon to ultimately achieve systems with timing requirements beyond the state of the arts.

Application areas can include, but are not limited to: resource-constrained embedded systems, distributed cyber-physical systems (CPS), cloud/edge/fog computing systems, cloud data centers, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile computing, robotics, smart grid, and smart cities, as well as middleware and frameworks, machine learning and signal processing algorithms.

## Peer Review Process

RTAS’25 follows a **double-anonymous peer reviewing process**: author identities and affiliations will not be revealed to reviewers. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a response to reviews before acceptance decisions are made, solely to provide clarifications and correct misconceptions. The response will not allow authors to introduce new material beyond the original submission or promise such material for the camera-ready version.

There will be an **optional artifact evaluation process** for accepted papers that assesses the reproducibility of the work.

## Submission Portal

[Submission Portal](https://rtas25.hotcrp.com/)

## Track 1: Systems and Applications

This track focuses on research of an empirical nature pertaining to (system- or component-) level analysis, optimization, and verification, as well as applications, runtime software, and hardware architectures for systems with timing requirements. Topics relevant to this track include, but are not limited to:

*   Applications with timing requirements
*   Real-time and embedded operating systems
*   Hypervisors and runtime frameworks
*   Hardware architectures, memory hierarchies, FPGAs, GPUs and accelerators
*   Networks with timing requirements
*   CPS/IoT infrastructure
*   Microservice technologies, cloud and edge computing
*   Real-time artificial intelligence and machine learning
*   Application profiling, WCET analysis, compilers, tools, benchmarks and case studies

Papers discussing design and implementation experiences on real industrial systems are especially encouraged. Papers submitted to this track should focus on specific systems and implementations. Authors must include a section with experimental results performed on a real implementation or demonstrate applicability to an industrial case study or working system. The experiment or case study discussions must highlight the key lessons learned. Simulation-based results are acceptable for architectural simulation, or other cases where authors clearly motivate why it is not feasible to develop and evaluate a real system.

Empirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field is also welcome in this track.

## Track 2: Applied Methodologies and Foundations

This track focuses on fundamental models and analysis techniques/methods applicable to systems with timing requirements to solve problems. The track welcomes knowledge-based models, models built from data, as well as a combination, and different types of analysis methods, including analytical, statistical, or probabilistic methods. Topics relevant to this track include, but are not limited to:

*   Modelling languages, modelling methods, model learning, model validation and calibration
*   Scheduling and resource allocation
*   System-level optimization and co-design techniques
*   Design space exploration
*   Verification and validation methodologies

Papers must describe the main context or use case for the proposed methods giving clear motivating examples based on real systems. The system models and any assumptions used in the derivation of the methods must be applicable to real systems and reflect actual needs. Papers must include a section on experimental results, preferably including a case study based on information from a real system. The use of synthetic workloads and models is acceptable if appropriately motivated and used to provide a systematic evaluation.

## Important Dates

(All times are UTC-12, or “anywhere on earth,” unless otherwise stated.)

## Objectives and Scope

Runtime verification is concerned with the monitoring and analysis of the runtime behavior of software and hardware systems. Runtime verification techniques are crucial for system correctness, reliability, and robustness. They provide an additional level of rigor and effectiveness compared to conventional testing and are generally more practical than exhaustive formal verification.

Runtime verification can be used prior to deployment for testing, verification, and debugging purposes, and after deployment for ensuring reliability, safety, and security, and for providing fault containment and recovery as well as online system repair.

## Topics of Interest

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:

*   Specification languages for monitoring
*   Monitor construction techniques
*   Program instrumentation
*   Logging, recording, and replay
*   Combination of static and dynamic analysis
*   Specification mining and machine learning over runtime traces
*   Monitoring techniques for concurrent and distributed systems
*   Runtime checking of privacy and security policies
*   Metrics and statistical information gathering
*   Program/system execution visualization
*   Fault localization, containment, resilience, recovery, and repair
*   Monitoring systems with learning-enabled components
*   Dynamic type checking
*   Runtime verification for autonomy and runtime assurance
*   Runtime verification for assurance cases
*   Out-of-distribution and anomaly detection in ML-based systems
*   Safe reinforcement learning
