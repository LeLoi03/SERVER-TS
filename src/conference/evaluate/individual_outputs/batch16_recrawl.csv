The IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the field of real-time systems, where researchers and practitioners showcase innovations covering all aspects of real-time systems, including theory, design, analysis, implementation, verification, evaluation, and experience.

## Scope of the Conference

RTSS’25, the 46th edition of the event, continues the tradition of embracing new and emerging areas of real-time systems research. It is an expansive and inclusive event.

## Tracks

RTSS’25 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems theory and practice. Manuscripts may be submitted to either of the following tracks:

### Track 1: Real-Time Systems and Foundations

This track focuses on the practical and theoretical foundations that enable predictable timing in computing systems. This includes core real-time operating systems components, schedulability analysis, scheduling algorithms, theoretical foundations, and verification methods. Topics of interest also cover timing analysis (e.g., WCET analysis), real-time and time-sensitive networking, timing-predictable hardware architectures, modeling and analysis of stochastic real-time systems, fault tolerance, security in relation to timing guarantees, compiler techniques, system synthesis, model-driven engineering, and applied formal methods.

**Artificial Intelligence for Real-Time Systems Foundations:** RTSS invites contributions on the use of AI and machine learning techniques to advance real-time scheduling, timing analysis, resource management, and system optimization under timing constraints.

### Track 2: Design and Applications

This track focuses on real-time systems in a broader systems context, emphasizing novel research on designs, implementations, and applications where real-time requirements are integral. It explores how tools and techniques are adapted and applied to specific application domains.

*   **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS):** Applications in transportation, healthcare, industrial control, etc., that interact closely with the physical world. Topics include enabling technologies, application-specific solutions, design methodologies, tool chains, CPS architectures, secure CPS, performance analysis, robustness, safety, certification, and hardware/software co-design.
*   **Real-Time System Design for Artificial Intelligence:** Practical implementation of AI components in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. Focuses on designing real-time systems to deploy AI under real-time constraints, including system design, frameworks, resource management, hardware acceleration, and AI safety in CPS.
*   **HW-SW Integration and System-Level Design:** Design methodologies and tools for hardware/software integration and co-design in embedded systems. Topics include architecture description languages, hardware architectures, design space exploration, synthesis, optimization, SoC design, FPGA-based simulation, emerging trends like RISC-V, and AI/ML hardware accelerators.
