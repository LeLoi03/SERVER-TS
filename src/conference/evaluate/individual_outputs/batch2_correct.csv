## Reviewing Process

APLAS uses a **light double-blind reviewing process**, with a rebuttal phase, to address factual errors and minor misunderstandings. Reviewers will not see author names until they submit a review. Therefore, the authors must adhere to the following rules:

*   Omit your names and institutions.
*   Refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others.
*   Omit the acknowledgments.

## Publication

*   The proceedings will be published as a volume in [Springer’s LNCS series](https://link.springer.com/conference/aplas).
*   Authors interested in making their contributions Open Access, please refer to [Springer’s webpage](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/open-access-publishing-in-computer-proceedings) for additional information, or contact the organizers.

## Best Paper Award

APLAS continues the tradition of the best paper award. The award will be announced on the website, and printed certificates will be issued to the authors at the conference.

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions, in PDF, should start with a title page containing the title of the paper, each author’s name, affiliation, and e-mail address, and a 1-2 paragraph abstract summarizing the paper’s contributions. The title page should be followed by a technical exposition on single-spaced, single-column pages, letter-size paper, using page numbers, at least 1-inch margins all around, and at least 11-point font. The first 10 pages, following the title page, should contain a clear presentation of the main technical and conceptual ideas underlying the results, including the motivation behind the paper and a clear comparison with related work (not including the references). The submission should be accessible to a wide variety of researchers in theoretical computer science and discrete mathematics. There is no page limit, but any material beyond the title page and the following 10 pages will be read at the sole discretion of the program committee.

Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal, or which will be published before the end of the conference, will not be considered for acceptance. Simultaneous submission of the same (or an overlapping) paper to RANDOM/APPROX and to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed.

This conference is the 36th edition of the AofA series and the second one held in Canada.

## About Analysis of Algorithms (AofA)

Analysis of Algorithms (AofA) is a field at the boundary of computer science and mathematics. Its goal is to obtain a precise understanding of the asymptotic, average-case characteristics of algorithms and data structures, employing a unifying theme of probabilistic, combinatorial, and analytic methods. The objects studied include random branching processes, graphs, permutations, trees, and strings.

## Topics of Interest

The conference aims to study discrete objects that appear as data structures or algorithms using mathematical methods, particularly probabilistic, combinatorial, and asymptotic methods. Topics include, but are not limited to:

*   Properties of large random data structures
*   Probabilistic methods for the analysis of algorithms
*   Combinatorial methods for the analysis of algorithms

## 11th International Conference on Algebra and Coalgebra in Computer Science (CALCO 2025)

**Dates:** June 16-18, 2025
**Location:** University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK
**Co-located with:** MFPS XLI

CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in foundational aspects, and both traditional and emerging uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science. It is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS (the International Workshop on Coalgebraic Methods in Computer Science) and WADT (the Workshop on Algebraic Development Techniques).

## Invited Speakers

*   Ugo dal Lago (University of Bologna) (joint special session on Quantitative Semantics)
*   Gordon Plotkin (University of Edinburgh) (joint keynote speaker)
*   Elena di Lavore (University of Oxford)
*   Alexander Kurz (Chapman University)

## Scope

Algebraic and coalgebraic methods and tools are a mainstay of computer science. From data types to development techniques and specification formalisms, both theoreticians and practitioners have benefited from the large body of research proposed and implemented since the pioneering works of the 1960s. CALCO aims to bring together researchers and practitioners with interests in both foundational and applicative uses of algebra and coalgebra in computer science, traditional as well as emerging ones. CALCO is a high-level, bi-annual conference formed by joining the forces and reputations of CMCS and WADT. This edition is planned as a physical, in-person event. It is expected that at least one author of each accepted paper will attend and give the presentation in person; exceptions can be made in case of unexpected travel/visa problems.

## Submission Categories

CALCO invites papers relating to all aspects of algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications, and distinguishes between four categories of submissions:

1.  **Regular papers:** These papers should report on theoretical foundations, novel methods and techniques for software development, or experiences with technology transfer to industry.
2.  **(Co)Algebraic Pearls papers:** These papers present possibly known material in a novel and enlightening way, illustrating an idea in a beautiful or didactically clever way, perhaps by developing an application. Pearls are typically short and concise.
3.  **Early ideas abstracts:** These submissions lead to presentations of work in progress, or proposals for original venues of research.
4.  **Tool presentation papers:** These papers report on the features and uses of algebraic/coalgebraic tools.

## Topics of Interest

All topics relating to algebraic and coalgebraic theory and applications are of interest for CALCO, including but not limited to:

*   Models and logics
*   Automata and languages
*   Graph transformations and term rewriting
*   Modal logics

The **37th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE'25)** will be held in **Vienna, Austria**, from **June 16-20, 2025**.

## Theme: Bridging Silos

Engineering real-world information systems requires a coherent design encompassing human, organizational, economic, societal, and technological aspects. Information systems are applied in diverse contexts such as business process management, geographical information systems, and digital twins. The discipline continually evolves with trends in data science, machine learning, process mining, blockchain, mobile computing, sustainability, new regulations, cyber warfare, and military conflicts, all influencing its development. Each application context and emerging trend can lead to specializations within information systems engineering, necessitating various research traditions and needs. While beneficial, these specializations risk creating silos. Thus, the CAiSE conference, the premier event for this discipline, aims to prevent such fragmentation.

Therefore, the theme for this year’s CAiSE conference is **""Bridging Silos.""** We encourage submissions that consider information systems engineering as a cohesive design involving multiple aspects. Submissions focused on specific specializations should explicitly position their results within the broader context to engage researchers across different areas and avoid silo formation.
