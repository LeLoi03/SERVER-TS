## Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) 2025

The 16th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) conference will take place **in person** at **Columbia University** from **January 7 - January 10, 2025**.

ITCS seeks to promote research with innovative or bold agendas, which could be conceptual, technical, or methodological, and whose message will advance and inspire the greater theory community. The program committee welcomes papers introducing a new concept, model or understanding; opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas; introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies, or new applications of known techniques; putting forth a bold, even if preliminary, vision or line of attack; or unearthing novel or surprising connections between different topics.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract submission deadline:** September 3, 2024
*   **Submission deadline:** September 5, 2024
*   **Notification to authors:** November 2, 2024
*   **Conference dates:** January 7-January 10, 2025

## Submission Instructions

Authors should register and submit their paper via the [hotcrp submission site](https://itcs2025.hotcrp.com/) by the strict deadlines.

*   The font size should be at least 11 point and the paper should be single column.
*   Beyond these, there are no specific formatting requirements.
*   Authors are required to submit a COI (Conflict of Interest) declaration upon submission.

## Review Process

The conference will employ a **lightweight double-blind reviewing process**.

*   Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.
*   This process is intended to help PC members and external reviewers come to a judgment without unconscious bias.
*   Important references should not be omitted or anonymized.
*   Authors are encouraged to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would, including posting papers to arXiv/ECCC/IACR.

## Paper Content & Style

*   Authors should strive to make their paper accessible not only to experts in their subarea, but also to the theory community at large.
*   The submission should include clear proofs of all central claims.
*   It is strongly recommended that the paper contain, within the first 10 pages, a concise and clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its significance, innovations, and place within (or outside) of our field's scope and literature.
*   The committee will put a premium on writing that conveys clearly, in as simple and straightforward a manner as possible, what the paper accomplishes.

## PC Member Submissions

Submissions authored by program committee members (with the exception of the PC chair) are allowed. Utmost care will be taken to avoid COIs with PC submissions, ensuring that such submissions receive no unfair advantage, and that the reviews and discussion remain confidential from the authors.

## Confidentiality

All submissions will be treated as confidential and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. The program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.

## Prior, Simultaneous, and Subsequent Submissions

*   Results published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS.
*   Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed.
*   Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences.

## Online Posting

Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the arXiv, the ECCC, or the Cryptology ePrint archive. It is generally expected that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers, with proofs, available before the conference begins.

## Conference Presentation

*   All talks are expected to be in person.
*   Talks in the conference will not be recorded. Instead, authors of each paper will be asked to upload a 20-25 minute talk, which will be posted online.

## Graduating Bits

Participants nearing graduation (on either side) will be given an opportunity to present (in 2-3 minutes) their results, research, plans, personality, and so on during the ""Graduating bits"" session. Details on how to participate will be provided closer to the conference date.

## Awards

The committee may award a ""best student paper"" award.

## Code of Conduct

ITCS is committed to an inclusive conference experience, respectful of all participants, and free from any discrimination or harassment. All ITCS attendees are expected to behave accordingly. If you experience or witness discrimination, harassment, or other unethical behavior at the conference, we encourage you to seek advice by contacting SafeToC advocates (http://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/).

## Proceedings

The accepted papers will be published by LIPIcs in the electronic proceedings of the conference. Authors of accepted papers can ask the PC chair to have only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the PDF of the full paper on an online archive."

## Paper Categories and Submission

We welcome **regular papers** and **short papers**.

### Submission Process

Submission for both categories is **lightweight double-blind**. This means that:

1.  Author names and institutions must be omitted using the `anonymous` option of the document class.
2.  References to authors’ own related work should be in the third person.
3.  The identity of authors will be revealed to reviewers once they have submitted a first draft of their review.

*Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing it more difficult. Important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. Authors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as usual.* 

### Regular Papers

*   Must be no more than **16 pages** in length excluding bibliographic references.
*   Must not include an appendix.
*   Must be in LIPIcs format.

### Short Papers

*   Can be used to describe interesting work that is still ongoing and not fully mature.
*   Accepted short papers will be published in the main proceedings and will be presented as short talks.
*   Must be no more than **6 pages** in length excluding bibliographic references and may consist of an extended abstract.
*   Must have the phrase ""Short paper"" as a subtitle.
*   Must not include an appendix.
*   Must be in LIPIcs format.

## Formatting and Submission Platform

Both categories of papers must be prepared in LaTeX using the [lipics-v2021 style](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author) (v2021.1.3) and must be submitted electronically as pdf files through [HotCRP](https://itp25.hotcrp.com).

## Supplementary Material

All submissions are expected to be accompanied by supplementary material containing verifiable evidence of a suitable implementation, such as the source files of a formalization for the proof assistant used.

*   **Anonymous supplementary material** is made available to the reviewers before they submit their first-draft reviews.
*   **Non-anonymous supplementary material** is made available to the reviewers after they have submitted their first-draft reviews and have learned the identity of the authors.

We strongly encourage anonymous supplementary material whenever possible.

## Publication

The conference proceedings will be published in Dagstuhl Publishing's Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series in **Gold Open Access** under the CC-BY-4.0 license.

## Registration and Participation

*   Remote attendance of the conference will be possible for a low or no fee.
*   For all accepted papers, at least one author must pay a **full registration fee**.
*   For presenters, physical participation is strongly encouraged.
*   Remote talks are only possible if agreed with the organizers by the registration deadline, but still one author must pay the full registration fee.

LCTES aims to bridge the gap between researchers and developers in programming languages and embedded systems engineering, fostering interaction and addressing common challenges.","# LCTES 2025: Call for Papers

Programming languages, compilers, and tools are crucial interfaces between embedded systems and emerging real-world applications, including deep neural networks, large language models, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare. These applications present challenges that often conflict with conventional design requirements and increase the complexity of embedded system designs. They also leverage new hardware paradigms like multicores (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs) and distributed systems. Consequently, programming languages, compilers, and tools are increasingly vital for addressing productivity, validation, verification, maintainability, safety, and reliability, while meeting performance goals and resource constraints.

The 26th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, Tools and Theory of Embedded Systems (LCTES 2025) invites original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that address these challenges. Both research papers on innovative techniques and experience papers on real-world system experimentation are welcome.
