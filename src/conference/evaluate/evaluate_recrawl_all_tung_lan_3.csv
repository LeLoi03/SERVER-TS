## Submissions

ATVA welcomes submissions in the following two categories:

*   Regular research papers (18 pages, excluding references, must be anonymized)
*   Tool papers (10 pages, excluding references, not anonymized)

Submissions in both categories must be in Springer’s LNCS format. Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting can be found at the Springer website [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs). Adding line numbers (LaTeX package `lineno`) is highly recommended.

Submissions authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed and encouraged.

An artifact evaluation will be undertaken, which will be optional for regular papers and mandatory for tool papers.

Papers must be submitted through EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atva2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atva2025)

Accepted papers in both categories will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A few outstanding papers will be selected for a distinguished paper award. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference.

### Regular papers

Regular papers should not exceed 18 pages in Springer’s LNCS format, not counting references and appendices. Additional material may be placed in an appendix, to be read at the discretion of the reviewers, and to be omitted in the final version.

Regular papers at ATVA 2025 will follow a full double-blind review process, which means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, the reference should be made in the third person. These are firm submission requirements, and any regular paper that does not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Authors of accepted regular papers will be invited (but are not required) to submit a relevant artifact for evaluation by the artifact evaluation committee. The submission deadline for this artifact evaluation will be soon after the paper acceptance notification.

Independent of the artifact evaluation process, research paper authors are encouraged to include a URL to a repository in their original submission, if such a repository is available and is pertinent to the paper. This repository could contain code, datasets, results, etc. This would be for the consideration of the PC reviewers of the submission, at their discretion. If such a URL is included in the submission, the contents of the repository should adhere to the guidelines of a double blind review process.

### Tool papers

Tool papers should not exceed 10 pages in Springer’s LNCS format, not counting references. Tool papers will follow a single-blind review process. They do NOT need to be anonymized.

Each tool paper submission must be followed by a separate artifact submission via EasyChair. Please see the Artifact Evaluation track instructions in the conference web site for more information.

Papers describing tools that have already been presented (in any conference) will be accepted only if significant and clear enhancements to the tool are reported and implemented.","thiếu dấu ngoặt phân biệt ngày, thiếu 3 subDate"

## Paper types

Papers submitted to CGO can be standard research papers, tools papers or practical experience papers. All must be written in the IEEE conference format (use the conference mode), and may have up to 10 pages, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 10 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. In other words, papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

Please be mindful of the [IEEE publishing policies](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplorehelp/author-center/publishing-policies) when preparing and submitting your article.

### Tool papers

Tool papers must give a clear account of a new tool’s functionality. They must describe the problem that the tool helps to solve, how the tool works and provide an evaluation of the tool. There does not have to be novel research in the way the tool works, but it does have to solve a novel problem or in a novel (and better) way compared to existing tools.

Tools paper authors should prepend their paper title with ‘Tool:’ to provide clarity that this is a tools paper during the review process (this can be removed for the final camera-ready paper).

The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper. Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.

### Practical experience papers

Practical experience papers should summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies. They must make it clear where the novelty in the work comes from, which could be from applying known techniques to a new system (with novel features), from finding new ways to implement existing analyses or transformations in a unique way, or from applying established schemes to draw new conclusions about them.

Practical experience paper authors should prepend their paper title with ‘Practical:’ to provide clarity that this is a practical experience paper during the review process (this can be removed for the final camera-ready paper).

Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.

## Geographic Diversity and Inclusion

Authors of papers accepted for CGO 2026 are encouraged to present their work in person. However, to foster the participation of students and professionals from everywhere, CGO 2026 will allow the remote presentation of papers, if their authors are unable to travel to the conference venue for reasons beyond their control (e.g. visa issues). Additionally, the conference organization will try to make attendance of CGO 2026 affordable for as many people as possible, with a specific focus on students from universities located in under-represented countries who are paper authors.

## Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings.

## Distinguished Paper Awards

Up to 10% of papers accepted at CGO 2026 will be designated as Distinguished Papers, following the ACM policy. This award is open to both regular and tool papers.

## Submission Information

### Submission Site

Papers can be submitted at [https://cgo26-first-round.hotcrp.com/](https://cgo26-first-round.hotcrp.com/).

### Submission Guidelines

Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements before it is submitted:

*   The paper must be original material that has not been previously published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under review by another conference or journal.
*   Your submission is limited to ten (10) letter-size (8.5″x11″), single-spaced, double-column pages, using 10pt or larger font, not including references.
*   Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 10 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.
*   Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper.
*   Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and not color printers.
*   Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without the aid of a magnifying glass.
*   Please number the pages.
*   To ease reviewing, please add line numbers to your submission. In LaTeX you can use the lineno package, with the ‘switch’ option.
*   The paper must be written in English.
*   The paper must be submitted in PDF.

### Conflicts of Interest

Please read these guidelines on conflicts of interest carefully before submission.

The workshop seeks submissions for papers, posters, and live demonstrations.","# HotMobile 2025: Call for Papers and Demos

The Twenty-sixth International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (ACM HotMobile 2025) will be held **February 26-27, 2025** in **Palm Springs, CA**.

ACM HotMobile 2025 continues the series of highly selective, interactive workshops focused on mobile applications, systems, and environments, as well as their underlying state-of-the-art technologies. HotMobile's small workshop format makes it ideal for presenting and discussing new directions or controversial approaches.

## Call for Posters and Demos

HotMobile seeks proposals for posters and live demonstrations describing novel work on mobile systems, applications, and services. Posters and demonstrations will be presented during a reception at the workshop.

The poster/demo session is meant to introduce new or ongoing work and provide opportunities for authors to interact directly with workshop attendees. Posters are well suited to controversial work that can generate discussion or promising new ideas that have not been thoroughly evaluated. Live demos provide an opportunity to demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of your research.

Accepted posters and demos will be published in the proceedings. This year's poster/demo session will feature a Best Poster/Demo award.

### Submission Guidelines for Posters and Demos

Submissions must include an extended abstract no longer than one 8.5x11-inch page, including all figures and references. The poster/demo should be uploaded to [https://hotmobile25-posterdemo.hotcrp.com/](https://hotmobile25-posterdemo.hotcrp.com/).

Please set up your page to be US letter size, 8.5x11 inches, two columns, using 10-pt font size for the text body, with at least one-inch margin on all sides. Submissions must be in Adobe PDF format. Please include the title of the poster/demo and the author list, including affiliations in both the PDF file and in the body of the email. Prefix your title with “Poster:” for a poster submission and “Demo:” for a demo submission. Please do not anonymize your submissions. The accepted posters and demos will need to submit a one-page version using 9-pt font size, which will provide more space for authors to accommodate reviewer feedback.

For demo submissions, we encourage the submission of an optional companion video that illustrates the demo. The companion video should highlight the technical contributions of the demo and should be no more than one minute in length. Include the YouTube URL of the companion video in the extended abstract.

### Important Dates for Posters and Demos

Submission deadline (extended): **January 20th, 2025 – AOE**

Notification of acceptance: **January 22nd, 2025**

Camera-ready deadline: **January 24th, 2025**

## Call for Papers

We solicit submissions of papers that (1) focus primarily on systems and applications and (2) propose new directions of research, advocate non-traditional approaches to old (or new) ideas, or generate controversy and discussion. We especially encourage papers that identify fundamental open questions, advocate a new approach, offer a constructive critique of the state-of-the-art, debunk existing assumptions, report unexpected early results, report on promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Novel ideas need not be supported by full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations suffice.

We take a broad view of Mobile Systems research. This includes:

*   Novel applications, environments, and devices supporting mobility.
*   Operating system and distributed system support for mobile computing.
*   Wearable computing, internet of things, edge computing, sensing, and context-awareness.
*   HCI issues related to mobile computing.
*   Security and privacy of mobile computing.
*   Management, configuration, and deployment of systems supporting mobility.
*   Wireless technology, as it pertains to mobile systems and applications.
*   Social issues related to mobile computing.
*   System and application support for the use of ML and AI on mobile platforms.

### Submission Guidelines for Papers

Submissions should contain 6 or fewer U.S. letter pages in PDF format, including all references, figures and tables. The submissions should not be anonymous. The submissions must meet the following formatting requirements:

*   Font size no smaller than 10pt.
*   Font size of the bibliography no smaller than 9pt.
*   Double column format with each column having dimensions 9.25 inches x 3.33 inches, a space of 0.33 inches between the two columns, and with no more than 55 lines of text per column.
*   Fit properly on US letter-sized paper (8.5 inches x 11 inches).

We recommend the use of the ""sigconf"" ACM proceedings template, available at: [http://www.acm.org/](http://www.acm.org/), with the font size of the main body amended to 10pt. An example Tex document can be found [here](http://hotmobile.org/2018/downloads/sample-sigconf.tex).

Please note that it is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that the submissions are meeting all formatting requirements.

Submit your papers at the HotMobile 2025 submission server.

### Important Dates for Papers

Hard deadline for submissions: **October 11th, 2024, 11:59pm AoE**

Acceptance notification: **December 16th, 2024**

Presenting at HotMobile is a good way to get early feedback on research ideas at least one year away from a full-fledged conference submission to ACM MobiSys or other high-quality conferences. A full-length paper on the same topic submitted to a conference in less than a year is unlikely to include sufficient new material and mature ideas to warrant publication.

As is customary, papers must not have been published elsewhere and may not be simultaneously under submission at another venue. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms are not acceptable and will be returned to the author(s) unread. As customary with the scientific peer review process, submissions will be handled as confidential material during the review.",

## Topics

Original research contributions are solicited in all areas related to Computational Creativity research and practice, including, but not limited to:

*   Applications of Computational Creativity: computational applications of creativity in areas such as music, language (e.g., narrative, poetry, humor), games, visual arts, design (e.g., graphic, product), architecture, entertainment, education, mathematical invention, scientific discovery, programming.
*   Human-Machine Co-Creativity: systems, studies, frameworks, or methodologies related to co-creativity between humans and AI, with emphasis on systems in which the machine acts as a creative partner.
*   Computational Creativity Evaluation: metrics, frameworks, formalisms and methodologies for the evaluation of creativity in computational systems, or for the evaluation of how such systems are perceived/accepted in society.
*   Social Models: computational models of social aspects of creativity, including: social creativity, the diffusion of ideas, collaboration, team dynamics, and creativity in social settings.
*   Computational Paradigms: computational approaches for modelling cognitive aspects of creativity, such as heuristic search, analogical and meta-level reasoning, cognitive architectures, and re-representation.
*   Interdisciplinary Perspectives: perspectives on computational creativity which draw from philosophical and/or sociological studies in the context of creative AI systems.
*   Data and Creativity: data science approaches to computational creativity: resource development and data gathering/knowledge curation for creative AI. There is a need for datasets and resources that are scalable, extensible and freely available/open-source.
*   Societal Impact: ethical considerations in the design, deployment or testing of creative AI systems, as well as studies that explore the societal impact of computational creativity and generative AI.
*   Psychological Factors: computational models of psychological factors that enhance creativity, including emotion, surprise (unexpectedness), reflection, conflict, diversity, motivation, knowledge, intuition, reward structures. Additionally, social or experiential factors related to novelty and originality, such as innovation, improvisation, and virtuosity.
*   Provocations: raising new issues not on this list that bring the foundations of the discipline into question or throw new light on seemingly settled debates.

## Paper Types

We welcome the submission of five different types of full papers. During your submission, please indicate the category in which your paper best fits:

*   **Technical papers:** these are papers posing and addressing hypotheses about aspects of creative behaviour in computational systems. The emphasis here is on using solid experimentation, computational models, formal proof, and/or argumentation that clearly demonstrates advancement in the state of the art or current thinking in CC research. Strong evaluation of approaches through comparative, statistical, social, or other means is essential.
*   **System or Resource description papers:** these are papers describing the building and deployment of a creative system or resource to produce artefacts of potential cultural value in one or more domains. The emphasis here is on presenting engineering achievement, technical difficulties encountered and overcome, techniques employed, reusable resources built, and general findings about how to get computational systems to produce valuable results. Presentation of results from the system or resource is expected. While full evaluation of the approaches employed is not essential if the technical achievement is very high, some evaluation is expected to show the contribution to CC of this work.
*   **Study papers:** these are papers which draw on allied fields such as psychology, philosophy, cognitive science, mathematics, humanities, the arts, and so on; or which appeal to broader areas of AI and Computer Science in general; or which appeal to studies of the field of CC as a whole. The emphasis here is on presenting enlightening novel perspectives related to the building, assessment, or deployment of systems ranging from autonomously creative systems to creativity support tools. Such perspectives can be presented through a variety of approaches including ethnographic studies, thought experiments, comparisons with studies of human creativity, and surveys. The contribution of the paper to CC should be made clear in every case.
*   **Cultural application papers:** these are papers presenting the use of creative software in a cultural setting, for example via art exhibitions/books, concerts/recordings/scores, poetry or story readings/anthologies, cookery nights/books, results for scientific journals or scientific practice, released games/game jam entries, and so on. The emphasis here is on a clear description of the role of the system in the given context, the results of the system in the setting, technical details of inclusion of the system, and evaluative feedback from the experience garnered from public audiences, critics, experts, stakeholders, and other interested parties.
*   **Position papers:** these are papers presenting an opinion on some aspect of the culture of CC research, including discussions of future directions, speculative explorations of the impact of state-of-the-art approaches, past triumphs or mistakes, and current issues. The emphasis here is on carefully arguing a position; highlighting or exposing previously hidden or misunderstood issues or ideas; and providing thought leadership for the field, either in a general fashion or in a specific setting. While opinions need not be substantiated through formalization or experimentation, any justification of a point of view will need to draw on a thorough knowledge of the field of CC and of overlapping areas, and provide relevant motivations and arguments.

## Manuscript and Submission Guidelines

*   Abstracts of no more than **300 words** must be submitted by the abstract submission deadline. The title and abstract submitted by this deadline should have sufficient detail and not just be a placeholder. Authors are strongly advised to submit their papers with the final list of authors, as changes may not be feasible at later stages.
*   Submitted manuscripts should be structured as technical papers and the full papers may not exceed **ten (10)** single-spaced double-column pages using **10-point size font** on **8.5×11 inch pages** (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and references. All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process, so the submitted paper should NOT list any authors or their affiliations. The author list at the time of submission is considered final – no co-authors can be added or removed after the submission deadline or upon acceptance (no exceptions). The author affiliation and order can be changed with notice to the PC chair before the camera-ready deadline if the paper is accepted.
*   The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download. See the latest versions [here](https://www.hipc.org/papers/). Electronic submissions must be in the form of a readable PDF file.
*   Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other conference or journal. Papers not following these guidelines will be rejected without review and further action may be taken, including (but not limited to) notifications sent to the heads of the institutions of the authors and sponsors of the conference. Submissions received after the due date, exceeding the length limit, or not appropriately structured may also not be considered. Papers must be submitted under one of the technical tracks listed. The topics listed under each track are representative, but not exhaustive. A published proceeding will be available at the conference. At the time of publishing, authors of accepted papers may buy up to two pages in addition to the page limits specified above for their manuscript. Authors may contact the Program Chair at the email address above for further information or clarification.
*   **No Show Policy:** At least one author of each paper must be registered for the conference in order for the paper to be published in the proceedings. Accepted full papers will be presented in technical sessions and selected papers will be presented in a separate poster session. Presentation of an accepted paper is a requirement for publication in the proceedings. Any paper not meeting requirements will not be included in the conference proceedings under IEEE Xplore.

## Submission Link

Submit your paper: [https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/HiPC/](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/HiPC/)

## High-Quality Submission Guidelines

A high-quality submission should articulate its contributions in multiple aspects:

*   **Motivation.** Clearly state the objective of the paper and provide strong support to motivate the specific problem the submission is solving.
*   **Limitations of state-of-art approaches.** Unambiguously discuss and distinguish from the most relevant and most recent prior works.
*   **Key insights and contributions.** Clearly articulate the major insights that enable the described approach or make it effective. Clearly specify the novelty of these insights and how they advance state-of-the-art. Provide a list of key contributions including flagship theoretical or experimental results and improvement over the prior art, as applicable.
*   **Methodology.** Clearly specify the key theoretical or experimental methodological details, as applicable. Support the chosen methodological choices (e.g., cite that most relevant and most recent prior works have evaluated their ideas using similar methodology). If new methodology is adopted or theoretical assumptions different from prior art are made, a detailed justification should be provided.
*   **Limitations of the proposed approach.** As applicable, articulate all the major limitations of the proposed approach and identify conclusions that are sensitive to specific assumptions made in the paper.

The Program Committee will be encouraged to assess the submissions in the above aspects. Therefore, the authors should consider making these aspects clear and easily identifiable, as much as possible, when articulating their contributions. We hope this will help improve both the review quality (author experience) and reviewing experience.

## Use of AI-assisted text

HiPC will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you use these services merely for language rectification. The authors should verify whether the results are accurate before submission.

As required by IEEE, the use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.

If you use AI tools, you should include an acknowledgment section to disclose the AI assistance with appropriate references to the sections in the paper, but this acknowledgment section should still abide by the double-blind submission guideline (i.e., any funding or author-related information should not be included).

## ArXiv Submission Policy

Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to HiPC 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).

## Inclusive Description of Research Contributions

Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

## Review Process

All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.

The initial decision for the submission may be Accept, Reject or Shepherd. Papers that are recommended for shepherding will have to address the comments from the reviewers, and submit a revised article along with a summary of changes. The revised manuscript will be reviewed by the shepherd and the final decision will be communicated.",

## Paper Submission:

**Conference submission site:** [https://ppopp26.hotcrp.com](https://ppopp26.hotcrp.com)

All submissions must be made electronically through the conference website and include an abstract (100–400 words), author contact information, the full list of authors and their affiliations. Full paper submissions must be in PDF format printable on both A4 and US letter-size paper.

All papers must be prepared in two-column ACM Conference Format, specifically the acmart document class (available here: [https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/)) with the sigplan option and 10-point font size. We recommend preparing your submission in Latex starting with the following template: [https://ppopp26.sigplan.org/getImage/orig/ppopp-acmart-sigplanproc-template.tex](https://ppopp26.sigplan.org/getImage/orig/ppopp-acmart-sigplanproc-template.tex) . This template ensures that there are no line numbers and headers in the margins to avoid triggering HotCRP’s format checker. Refrain from squeezing additional space by tweaking the template above, e.g., by manipulating vertical space, reducing margins, line spacing, heading space, column separation, etc. Ensure that caption fonts are at least 9 pt and all fonts in figures and tables are at least 8 pt. Program chairs will inspect submissions using format checking tools and reserve the right to reject submissions that violate the formatting rules. If you would like to use Word or other Latex template, please ensure that your submission follows all the formatting guidelines. You may want to consult the official ACM information on the Master Article Template and related tools.

Papers should contain a maximum of 10 pages of text and figures, but NOT INCLUDING references. There is no page limit for references, and they must include the names of all authors (not et al.) and spell out the publication year and venue (and not simply point to the doi link). Appendices are not allowed, but the authors may submit supplementary material, such as proofs or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.

Submission is double-blind, and authors will need to identify any potential conflicts of interest with PC and Extended Review Committee members, as defined here: [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/) (ACM SIGPLAN policy).

## Double-Blind Reviewing

PPoPP 2026 will employ a double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this process, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).

To facilitate fair and unbiased reviews for all submissions, PPoPP 2026 may utilize the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) to assign papers to reviewers. From the authors’ perspective, this decision means that the submissions may be uploaded to TPMS.

## Artifact Evaluation

To allow reproducibility, we encourage authors of accepted papers to submit their papers for Artifact Evaluation (AE). The AE process begins after the acceptance notification and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact evaluation is voluntary and will not affect paper acceptance but will be taken into consideration when selecting papers for awards. Papers that go through the AE process successfully will receive at least one ACM reproducibility badge, printed on the published version. More information will be posted on the AE website.

Deadlines expire at midnight anywhere on Earth.

## NEW from RE’25: RE Open Data Initiative

RE’25 launches the RE Open Data Initiative. This initiative aims to collect data from practitioners and researchers, which can be used by authors of all the tracks, including the Research Track, as evaluation data for their studies. 

Data will be released between December 2024 and the beginning of January 2025. For more information, click [here](https://conf.researchr.org/track/RE-2025/RE-2025-re-open-data-initiative).

## Open Science Policy

The RE 2025 Research Track has an open science policy with the steering principle that all research results should be accessible to the public and, if possible, empirical studies should be reproducible. In particular, we actively support the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability. Note that sharing research data is not mandatory for submission or acceptance. However, sharing is expected to be the default, and non-sharing needs to be justified.

## Formatting Instructions

The format of your paper must strictly adhere to the **IEEEtran Proceedings Format**. LaTeX users: please use the LaTeX class file IEEEtran v1.8 and the following configuration (without option ‘compsoc’ or ‘compsocconf’): `\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}`.

Word users: please use [this Word template](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/conferences/conference-template-letter.docx).

## Submission Instructions

Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the [RE’25 EasyChair system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=re25). Select the RE’25 Research Track for your submission.

In order to guide the reviewing process, all authors who intend to submit a paper must first submit the title and abstract. Abstracts should describe explicit coverage of context, objectives, methods, and results and conclusions, and should not exceed 200 words.

Papers must not exceed **10 pages** for the main body and up to 2 additional pages for the references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the [IEEE formatting instructions](https://conf.researchr.org/track/RE-2025/RE-2025-Research-Papers#Formatting-Instructions). Submissions must be double-blinded in conformance with the instructions below.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract submission:** March 3, 2025
*   **Full Paper Submission:** March 10, 2025
*   **Notification:** May 23, 2025
*   **Camera Ready:** June 23, 2025

## Instructions for the Double-Blind Review Process

*   Omit all names and affiliations of authors from the title page, but keep sufficient space to re-introduce them in the final version should the paper be accepted.
*   Do not include any acknowledgements that might disclose your identity. Leave space in your submission to add such acknowledgements when the paper has been accepted.
*   Refer to your own work in the third person, as you would normally do with the work of others. You should not change the names of your own tools, approaches, or systems, since this would clearly compromise the review process; it would also violate the constraint that “no change is made to any technical details of the work”. Instead, refer to the authorship or provenance of tools, approaches, or systems in the third person, so that it is credible that another author could have written your paper. In particular, never blind references.
*   When providing supplementary material (e.g., tools, data repositories, source code, study protocols), do this via a website that does not disclose your identity. Please refer to the [Open Science Policy in the Call for Papers](https://conf.researchr.org/track/RE-2025/RE-2025-Research-Papers#Call-for-Papers) with guidelines on how to anonymize such content.
*   Adhere to instruction 3 when citing previously published own work.
*   Remove identification metadata from the PDF file before submission (in Adobe Acrobat Reader, you can check their presence with File Properties, or Ctrl-D).",

## Review Process

The review process will have two cycles.

### Review Cycle I (Submission to Initial notification)

Submissions will be assigned to two members of the VR 2026 International Program Committee (IPC): a coordinator (primary) and a secondary reviewer. Submissions that violate the submission guidelines or that receive low review scores from the coordinator and the secondary reviewer will be early rejected. This stage of the review process will be double blind. We will strive to have all other submissions receive a total of at least three reviews. Based on the reviews and in consultation with a subset of the IPC, the Program Chairs will make one of the following initial recommendations for each submission:

*   Conditionally accept as IEEE TVCG paper. Continuing our cooperation with the IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG), the top submissions will be considered for publication in a special issue of IEEE TVCG.
*   Conditionally accept as conference paper. These submissions will be considered for inclusion in the Proceedings of IEEE VR, archived in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.
*   Recommend as a two-page poster. Authors of a submission receiving this recommendation have the option of condensing their submission into a two-page poster, including references. Subject to a final approval by the Posters chairs, accepted posters will be included in the IEEE VR Abstracts and Workshops proceedings and will be archived in the IEEE Digital Library. Note that IEEE VR does not consider posters as a final disclosure of research results. Thus, work accepted as an IEEE VR poster might be eligible for inclusion in future publications.
*   Reject.

### Review Cycle II (Initial notification to Final decision)

The revision of each conditionally accepted paper will be reviewed by its coordinator, who will make a final recommendation regarding acceptance. Should the conditions for acceptance not be met, the paper will be rejected.

## Additional Guidelines

*   **Abstract Submission:** A paper abstract must be uploaded seven days prior to the actual paper submission deadline.
*   **Ethics and Responsibility:** All submissions describing research experiments with human participants must follow the appropriate ethical guidelines required by the authors’ institution(s), and authors are required to secure and report their approval by the relevant ethics committee prior to collecting data.
*   **Participant Diversity:** All submissions describing research with human participants should strive for participant diversity.
*   **Review Duties for Authors:** For each submitted paper, one author will be required to register to review up to three papers through PCS at the time of submission.
*   **Presentation at the Conference:** All accepted submissions must be presented orally at the conference.
*   **Submission Language:** All paper submissions must be in English.
*   **Previous Publication and Plagiarism:** Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously published.
*   **AI-generated Text:** The use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section.
*   **Submission Anonymity:** IEEE VR uses a DOUBLE-BLIND review process.
*   **Pre-dissemination through public online repositories:** Uploading the submitted manuscript to an online repository (e.g., arXiv) before the end of the review process does not constitute a reason for rejecting the manuscript. However, the authors should be advised that doing so can compromise the anonymity of their manuscript and therefore bias its double-blind review.
*   **Videos:** Videos must be submitted according to the instructions on the submission website. Videos submitted with papers will automatically be considered for possible inclusion in the video proceedings (video submissions may also be made independently, as described in the separate Call for Videos).

## Submission

Please use the Precision Conferences System (PCS) to submit your work. After clicking the link below, please choose “SIGCHI” from the “Society” drop-down list, then “VRST 2025” from the “Conference/Journal” drop-down list.

[https://new.precisionconference.com/vrst2025](https://new.precisionconference.com/vrst2025)

## Submission Guidelines

All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library in the VRST collection.

### Format

Paper submissions must be anonymous for a double-blind review process.

All submissions should be prepared using the Word or LaTeX templates from the official ACM Master article template packages and TAPS (see [https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow)).

*   For LaTeX authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format using `\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}`.
*   For Word submissions, please use the linked single-column template.
*   Authors should prepare their materials using numbered citations and references. See the TAPS webpage for guidance on how content length corresponds to the page limits for the final version.

### Submission Lengths

*   Latex: 4 to 9 pages, double column, excluding references
*   Word: approx. 8,000 words including space for figures, tables, etc.

### Anonymity Guidelines

For initial Paper submissions, authors are asked to remove all author and institution information and remove any clues that would directly identify any of the authors (such as the name of the data collecting institution, ethical board/IRB institution names, or acknowledgments). Please anonymize all PDF files. Note that PDF creator programs may automatically include author information in the file metadata. Citations of the authors’ own published work (including online) must be in the third person, in a manner that is not traceable to the identity of the authors. For example, the wording “in [3], Mountain and River proposed…” is acceptable, whereas “in [3], we proposed…” is not. Here, reference [3] is listed explicitly as “Mountain, A. and River, A., Detecting Mountains and Rivers, In Proc. XYZ ’16, 721-741.” We welcome authors to extend their own existing non- or semi-archivable, as well as not-yet-peer-reviewed publications, such as extended abstracts. To avoid accusations of (self)plagiarism in these cases, we ask the authors to upload their work in a special field in PCS. These works can only be viewed by the submission coordinator.

Please note that failure to comply with any of the above requirements and guidelines will result in an automatic desk rejection of the paper!

## Contribution Types

We invite many types of research contributions, including interactive systems. However, evaluating systems that are built using existing techniques can be difficult. For example, a system can be built using a known machine-learning technique but it can enable entirely new functionality. In this case, reviewers will need to judge the novelty of the new functionality that the system enables without penalizing the work for leveraging an existing technique.

For reference, here’s a paper about evaluating interactive systems that reviewers and authors should both be familiar with:

James Fogarty (2017): Code and Contribution in Interactive Systems Research

We further accept studies that replicate known findings systematically to confirm or contradict previously found results.

## Supplementary Materials

Submissions may be (optionally) accompanied by additional materials such as images, videos, or electronic documents. These materials do not form a part of the official submission. They will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers. All content should be in a portable format that is unlikely to require the user to download additional programs. For example, you may prefer PDF or HTML for documents, PNG or JPEG for images, and QuickTime or MPEG for videos. The total file size for supplementary materials should not exceed a total of 50MB. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the additional material providing supplementary information or confirmation of results. It is, however, appropriate to refer to video footage in the paper.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

When designing and presenting user evaluations, please consider the following: User evaluations using non-representative or homogeneous participant populations can introduce biases in the results and conclusions. We recommend that researchers strive to use samples that are representative of the population for which the technology is being designed. If representative samples are not possible to collect, we recommend that the limitations of the population studied should be discussed within the paper and care must be taken when making claims about the findings. We recommend that participant demographic information should be reported for user evaluations so that future researchers understand the results based on the population studied.

## Accessibility

We ask authors to try to be as inclusive as possible when preparing a submission. For instance, please provide alt-text for figures and tables and make supplemental videos accessible with subtitles to enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. We recommend that authors read the SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission, as well as the SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos (especially the section “What accessibility considerations should I pay attention to when recording my video?”), which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning. If authors have difficulties with making their submissions accessible, they are encouraged to contact the VRST 2025 Accessibility Chairs by emailing [accessibility@vrst2025.org](mailto:accessibility@vrst2025.org).

## Policies

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference, and present their work in person at the conference. As the conference is in-person only, there will not be any opportunity to present remotely. Besides, it’s just so much better to meet your fellow XR enthusiasts in person!

All standing ACM policies apply to ACM VRST 2025.

*   [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) (which also contains statements regarding the use of generative AI)
*   [ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions)

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently committed to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

AUTHOR’S TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)

## Submission Guidelines

*   All submissions must be written in English.
*   Papers should be submitted electronically, in a PDF format, through the EasyChair submission system: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2025), by selecting the “UMAP25 Full and Short Papers” track.

### Format

Two types of submissions are encouraged (reviewers will comment on whether the size is appropriate for each contribution), in the ACM two-column format:

*   **Long papers:** (8 pages at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) should report on substantial contributions of lasting value.
*   **Short papers:** (4 pages at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper.

It is recommended that supplementary material is linked to an external source using an anonymized link.

### Anonymity

*   Submissions must be anonymous, given that ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process.
*   Authors must omit their names and affiliations from submissions, and avoid obvious identifying statements.
*   Citations to the authors’ prior work should be made in the third person.
*   Failure to anonymize your submission could result in desk rejection.

### Templates

Following the ACM Publication Workflow, all authors should submit manuscripts for review in the ACM double-column format. Instructions for authors are given below:

*   **LaTeX:** Please use the latest version of the Primary Article Template – LaTeX to create your submission. Start the document with the `\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}` command to generate the output in a double-column format.
*   **Overleaf:** (use `\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}` for double-column). Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for [preparing your article with Overleaf](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/overleaf).
*   **Word:** Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for [preparing your article with Microsoft Word](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word), ignoring the single-column instructions and the single-column submission template. Please use the double-column Word template.

### Accessibility

Authors are strongly encouraged to provide “alt text” (alternative text) for floats (images, tables, etc.) in their content so that readers with disabilities can be given descriptive information for these floats that are important to the work. Moreover, authors should follow the [ACM Accessibility Recommendations for Publishing in Color](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/describing-figures) and SIG ACCESS guidelines on describing figures.

### Submission Policy

All submissions and reviews will be handled electronically. ACM UMAP has a no dual submission policy. Please consider the ACM’s publication policies regarding research involving human participants and subjects, and obtaining an ORCID ID.

## Review Process

*   ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process.
*   Authors must omit their names and affiliations from their submissions; they should also avoid obvious identifying statements.
*   Submissions not abiding by anonymity requirements will be desk rejected.
*   Reviewers will evaluate papers based on their significance, originality, rigor, and contribution to the field.
*   ACM UMAP 2025 will introduce a new rebuttal stage during evaluation.
*   The ACM Code of Ethics gives the ACM UMAP program committee the right to (desk-)reject papers that perpetuate harmful stereotypes, employ unethical research practices, or uncritically present outcomes/implications that disadvantage minority communities. Furthermore, reviewers will be explicitly asked to consider whether the research was conducted in compliance with professional ethical standards and applicable regulatory guidelines. Failure to do so could lead to a (desk-)rejection.

## Registration and Presentation Policy

*   Each accepted paper must be accompanied by a distinct full author registration, completed by the early registration date cut-off.
*   Each accepted paper must be presented in person to be included in the conference proceedings, published by ACM, and available via the ACM Digital Library. The official publication date is when the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library.

## Camera-ready Submission

Accepted papers will be subject to further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. We strongly recommend the usage of LaTeX/Overleaf for the camera-ready papers to minimize the extent of reformatting.

## Ethical & Human Subjects Considerations

ACM UMAP expects papers to include a discussion of the ethical considerations, as well as the impact of the presented work and/or its intended application, where appropriate. ACM UMAP further expects all authors to comply with ethical standards and regulatory guidelines associated with human subjects research, including research involving human participants and research using personally identifiable data. Papers reporting on such human subjects research must include a statement identifying any regulatory review the research is subject to (and identifying the form of approval provided), or explaining the lack of required review.
