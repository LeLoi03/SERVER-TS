The conference is currently being planned as an **in-person event only**. Still, the organization is continuously monitoring travel and health restrictions and may reassess the possibility for virtual or hybrid options.

In addition to the peer-reviewed accepted papers, the conference program will also include keynote presentations, posters, and demos, among other tracks. The conference will also have a co-located doctoral school. The technical program will be complemented by several social events to facilitate informal discussions and networking among the conference attendees and invited guests.

## Areas/Topics of Interest

Submissions are solicited in, but not limited to, the following areas:

*   Anti-malware techniques: detection, analysis, and prevention
*   Cyber attack (e.g., APTs, botnets, DDoS) prevention, detection, investigation, and response
*   Cyber-crime defense and forensics (e.g., anti-phishing, anti-blackmailing, anti-fraud techniques)
*   Integrating security in network protocols (e.g., routing, naming, and management)
*   Mobile and wireless network security
*   Network security policy implementation, deployment, and management
*   Privacy and anonymity in networks and distributed systems
*   Public key infrastructures, key management, certification, and revocation
*   Security and privacy for blockchains and cryptocurrencies
*   Security and privacy of mobile/smartphone platforms
*   Security and privacy of operating systems, hypervisors, and virtual machines
*   Security and privacy of systems based on machine learning, federated learning, AI, and large language models
*   Security for cloud/edge computing
*   Security for cyber-physical systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, industrial control systems)
*   Security for emerging networks (e.g., smart homes, IoT, body-area networks, VANETs)
*   Security for future Internet architectures and designs (e.g., Software-Defined Networking, Intent-Based Networking)
*   Security for large-scale, critical infrastructures (e.g., electronic voting, smart grid)
*   Security of web-based applications and services (e.g., social networking, crowd-sourcing, fake news/disinformation), web security and privacy
*   Software/firmware/hardware security analysis, customization, and extensions
*   Special problems and case studies: e.g., tradeoffs between security and efficiency, usability, cost, and ethics
*   Trustworthy computing software and hardware to secure networks and systems
*   Usable security and privacy
*   Systematization of knowledge (SoK-papers) are also within scope, provided they offer new insights and compelling evidence.

## Topic Fit

Submissions must have a clear relation to real systems, networks, and their applications. Papers with questionable fit, such as those focused solely on theoretical cryptography without implementation, mathematical proofs without evaluation, or contributions primarily in other fields (e.g., AI, ML) without a security/privacy contribution, may be desk-rejected.

## Review Goals

Reviews aim to provide concrete steps for improving work, distinguish reviewer opinion from demonstrable technical weaknesses, and offer clear citations for novelty claims.

## Paper Formatting

*   **Length:** Not exceeding **13 pages**, excluding the ""Ethics Considerations"" section, references, or appendices.
*   **Size:** US letter size (not A4).
*   **Layout:** Two-column layout.
*   **Font:** Times, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line spacing.
*   **Templates:** Use the [NDSS templates](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2025/submissions/templates/) (2025 templates provided, 2026 templates to be published).
*   **Format:** Must be Portable Document Format (.pdf).
*   **Ethics Considerations:** An optional section can be included immediately preceding the reference section.

## Double and Concurrent Submissions

Technical papers must not substantially overlap with papers published or simultaneously submitted to other venues. Double submissions will lead to immediate rejection.

## Ethical Considerations

Authors may optionally include an ""Ethics Considerations"" section to discuss potential ethical risks and mitigation steps. If a paper involves human subjects, data derived from humans, or might pose risks, authors should discuss ethical and legal concerns, and whether an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval) was conducted. Responsible disclosure plans for high-impact vulnerabilities are encouraged.

## Anonymous Submissions

NDSS Symposium uses a **double-blind reviewing process**. Author names and affiliations must not appear in the paper. Authors should avoid revealing their identities in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data. Prior work must be referenced in the third person or blinded. Submissions violating anonymity will be rejected without review. Advertising results broadly is disallowed.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors and Program Committee members must declare any conflicts of interest (e.g., advisors/advisees, institutional relationships, recent collaborations). PC members with conflicts will be excluded from evaluating the relevant papers. ""Fake conflicts"" are disallowed.

## Use of Generative AI

Generative AI is permitted for paper preparation provided it does not plagiarize or misrepresent content, and authors accept responsibility for veracity. Disclosure is required, commensurate with usage. Specific tools, versions, and prompts should be documented for significant use.",Main link chính xác hơn: https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2026/,88.89

The conference invites submissions for long and short papers, industry track papers, system demonstrations, and tutorials, among other calls. NAACL 2025 utilizes the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system for paper submissions and reviewing, with a commitment deadline for NAACL 2025.","# NAACL 2025: Call for Main Conference Papers

NAACL 2025 invites the submission of **long and short papers** featuring substantial, original, and unpublished research in all aspects of Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing.

The conference aims for a diverse technical program, welcoming contributions such as traditional research results, negative findings, surveys, new resource announcements, position arguments, novel linguistic insights, and reproductions.

## Submission Process

NAACL 2025 will use **ACL Rolling Review (ARR)** for paper submissions and reviewing. The process is two-stage:

1.  **Submission to ARR:** Authors submit articles to ARR via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2024/October).
2.  **Commitment to NAACL:** Reviewed articles can be committed to NAACL 2025 via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/NAACL/2025/Conference).

## Reviewing Workload

Authors are required to specify which co-authors are committing to cover reviewing during the ARR submission process. Please refer to the [ARR policy](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#paper-submission-information) for details.

## Submission Topics

Relevant topics include, but are not limited to:

*   Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics
*   Dialogue and Interactive Systems
*   Discourse and Pragmatics
*   Efficient/Low-resource Methods for NLP
*   Ethics, Bias, and Fairness
*   Generation
*   Human-centered NLP
*   Information Extraction

## Special Theme Track: NLP in a Multicultural World

This track focuses on work supporting the vibrant multicultural world we live in, welcoming papers on:

*   Cultural localization of language models.
*   New NLP applications to support people from diverse cultures.
*   Revitalization or refunctionalization of endangered or sleeping languages.
*   Analysis of cultural biases in language models.
*   Historical considerations and diachronic analysis.

## Reviewing Process

The reviewing process will be **double-blind**. Reviewers will not see authors, nor will authors see reviewers. ARR reviews will not be publicly visible, but authors may opt to make their anonymized submissions publicly visible.
