## Overview

NSDI focuses on the design principles, implementation, and practical evaluation of networked and distributed systems. Our goal is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community to foster a broad approach to addressing overlapping research challenges. NSDI provides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further the knowledge and understanding of the networked systems community as a whole, continue a significant research dialog, or push the architectural boundaries of network services.

## Topics

NSDI invites any innovative solution for a significant problem involving networked systems, including topics from within the following list:

*   Highly available and reliable networked systems
*   Security and privacy of networked systems
*   Distributed storage, caching, and query processing systems
*   Sustainable, low-energy, and low-carbon networked systems
*   Cloud/multi-tenant systems
*   Mobile and embedded/sensor applications and systems
*   Systems aspects of networking hardware and physical layer communication technologies
*   Network and workload measurement systems
*   Self-organizing, autonomous, and federated networked systems
*   Managing, debugging, and diagnosing problems in networked systems
*   Virtualization and resource management for networked systems
*   Experience with deployed networked systems
*   Networked systems for big data
*   Testing and/or verification applied to networked systems
*   Networked systems for machine learning (ML) and ML for networked systems

Papers with no clear contributions to the design of systems or the networking stack will be considered out of scope.

### Excluded Topics

The NSDI Steering Committee has identified a list of topics that are explicitly excluded from upcoming NSDI symposia. Papers whose core contributions are on the following topics are likely to be rejected for reasons of scope:

*   Physical layer contributions: beamforming, modulation techniques, communication through unconventional mediums (capacitative, inductive, acoustic)
*   Sensing and localization contributions: gesture sensing, environment mapping, remote sensing
*   Architecture contributions: voltage scaling, GPU resource scheduling, hardware level fault tolerance
*   User interface contributions

## Submission Process & One-Shot Revision

*   **Two Deadlines**: NSDI '26 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines (Spring and Fall).
*   **One-Shot Revision**: Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. Such a revision decision includes a summary of the paper's merits and a list of necessary changes. Authors may then submit a version addressing all revision instructions during the subsequent deadline. This revised paper will be reviewed primarily to judge if it addresses the requested changes. Papers revised and resubmitted following a one-shot-revision decision can only receive a decision of accept or reject, not revise.
*   **Concurrent Submission**: Papers must not be submitted concurrently to other venues. USENIX prohibits simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues.
*   **Resubmission Policy**: Papers rejected from one deadline cannot be submitted to the immediate next deadline.
*   **Workshop Paper Extensions**: Work extending a previous workshop paper is welcome but must acknowledge prior publication anonymously and explain the differences.

## Operational Systems Track

NSDI '26 also solicits papers describing the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with large-scale, operational systems and networks. These papers need not present new ideas but should validate techniques at scale or in new environments.

*   **Reviewing**: Papers in this track will be reviewed in a more limited double-blind process. Authors' names should be withheld, but company names, links, and real system names can be kept as appropriate.
*   **Indication**: Authors should indicate on the title page and submission form that they are submitting to this track.

## What to Submit

*   **Double-blind review**: Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize papers by removing authors' names and affiliations, acknowledgments of funding sources, and avoiding self-identifying references. Care should be taken with file names.
*   **Page Limit**: Submissions must be no longer than **12 pages**, including footnotes, figures, and tables. Additional pages are allowed for references and supplementary material in appendices.
*   **Format**: Two-column format, 10-point type on 12-point leading, text block 7"" wide x 9"" deep, .33"" inter-column space, formatted for 8.5"" x 11"" paper.
*   **Submission Method**: All papers must be submitted via the submission form: [https://nsdi26spring.usenix.hotcrp.com/](https://nsdi26spring.usenix.hotcrp.com/)

## On the Use of Generative AI

Authors must not submit papers generated entirely by generative AI. A statement attesting that their paper is not completely created by generative AI must be submitted as part of the submission process.

## Policies

*   **Simultaneous Submissions**: Prohibited.
*   **Extensions on Workshop Papers**: Acceptable if the NSDI submission includes substantial new material. Must acknowledge prior publication anonymously and explain differences.
*   **Online Technical Reports**: Allowed if authors use a different title and system name than the technical report to avoid reviewer bias.

## Conflicts

At submission time, authors must provide information about conflicts with PC members based on Institution, Advisor, or Collaboration within the past two years.

## Ethical Considerations

Papers describing experiments with users or user data must follow ethical research principles (beneﬁcence, minimal risk, voluntary consent, respect for privacy, limited deception). Authors are encouraged to include a subsection on these issues and must attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their institution(s).

## Processes for Accepted Papers

*   **Visa Invitation Letters**: Contact [conference@usenix.org](mailto:conference@usenix.org) for assistance.
*   **Shepherding**: Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process.

## Submission Guidelines

### Submission Evaluation and Scope

Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process. OSDI '25 will have a deliberate focus on selecting papers that offer significant contributions to computer systems research and align with community interests. Reviewers will evaluate submissions based on topic relevance to computer systems and their potential to impact future research and practices. Submissions must demonstrate relevance and offer unique insights to capture the interest of a substantial portion of OSDI attendees.

### Confidentiality and Simultaneous Submission

*   Papers will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered.
*   Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud and is prohibited. See the [USENIX Conference Submissions Policy](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/submissions-policy).
*   Submitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted as long as authors have substantially addressed the previous reviewers' comments. Information regarding the previous submission and revisions must be provided.
*   Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in OSDI. Authors must provide a copy of the workshop paper and explain new material.
*   Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts (e.g., arXiv.org, technical reports) is permitted, but submissions must use an anonymized project or system name.

### Paper Formatting and Length

*   **Length:** Maximum 12 single-spaced 8.5"" x 11"" pages, including figures and tables. Additional pages are allowed for references only.
*   **Typeface:** 10-point type on 12-point leading.
*   **Layout:** Two-column format.
*   **Margins:** Text block 7"" wide x 9"" deep.
*   **Accepted Papers:** Allowed 14 pages in proceedings, plus references.
*   **Requirements:** Papers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review. Figures and tables should be legible in black and white. Short papers may not receive full consideration.

### Supplementary Material

Authors may upload supplementary material in separate files. PC members are not required to read supplementary material; the paper must stand alone without it.

### Identity Blinding

The paper review process is **double-blind**. Authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions, refraining from identifying themselves or their institutions either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or acknowledgments). Submissions violating these rules will be rejected without review. Contact the program co-chairs well in advance for anonymization assistance.

### Abstract Registration

Abstract registration is an essential part of the paper-reviewing process. Abstracts must provide sufficient information to understand the topic and contribution. Insufficient abstracts will be rejected, precluding paper submission.

### Conflicts

Authors must provide information about conflicts with PC members (institution, advisor, collaboration, personal) when registering abstracts. Extraneous conflicts are not permitted. Chairs will review conflicts and may reject abstracts or papers based on conflict information.

### Submission System

All papers must be submitted via the [submission system](https://osdi25.usenix.hotcrp.com/).

### Author Response Period

Authors will have an opportunity to respond to reviews prior to the program committee meeting. Responses should be limited to correcting factual errors or directly addressing reviewer questions. New experiments or promises of future work are not allowed. Responses are optional, up to 2000 words.

### Revise and Resubmit

OSDI '25 will continue the option to revise and resubmit for some of the rejected papers.

OOPSLA 2025 is part of the SPLASH conference and is dedicated to investigations of programming systems, languages, and environments.","# OOPSLA 2025: Call for Papers

## Introduction

The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming systems, languages, and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.

OOPSLA 2025 will have two rounds of reviewing, with the Round 1 submission deadline **October 15, 2024** and Round 2 submission deadline **March 25, 2025 (AoE)**. All deadlines are firm. New papers may be submitted to either round. Papers accepted in either round will be published in the 2025 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to present at the SPLASH conference in 2025.

## What’s New

There are two new things in this year’s Call that you should be sure to pay attention to:

*   **Reserve Reviewer Policy**
*   **Data-Availability Statement**

## Contact

You can reach the two RC Chairs (Shriram and Sukyoung) through this email: [oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com).

Please use this address, not their personal email addresses, unless you think they are not getting your messages. Please allow 1–2 working days for a response before assuming they didn’t see your message, and longer right around deadlines.

In your email, please mention the number of the paper you are writing about (if you have one). That makes it easier to track the context (and avoids ambiguity).

## Review Process

PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing. Each paper will typically receive three or more reviews. You will get an opportunity to respond to these reviews before decisions are finalized.

At the end of each round, each paper will receive one of the following decisions:

*   **Accept:** Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).
*   **Reject:** Your paper will not appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). In addition, a resubmission in less than a year from the original submission is not guaranteed a review. A paper is considered a resubmission if, in the judgment of the Chairs, it is substantially similar to the original submission.
*   **Conditional Accept:** While the Review Committee likes the work, it would like to see some specific changes made. You will receive a list of specific required revisions.
*   **Minor Revision:** While the Review Committee likes the direction of the work, it has several concerns that it would like to see revised. These concerns go beyond what can be enumerated in a list. Thus, you may receive some specific required revisions, but can also expect to receive broader comments.
*   **Major Revision:** While the Review Committee thinks the direction of the work has promise, it has significant concerns that it would like to see revised. You may receive some specific required revisions, but will also receive broader comments that may take significantly longer to execute.

If you receive one of the latter three decisions, please note:

*   Unlike in some previous years, there is no restriction on when you can submit your revision. The decision does not imply a duration.
*   If you choose to submit a revised paper, you must also submit both (a) a clear explanation of how your revision addresses these comments, and (b) unless impossible, a diff of the PDFs. Independent of the decision, you can submit at the next deadline (either the opening deadline of the next round or the revision deadline of the current round). To the extent possible, your submission will be reviewed by the same reviewers.
*   Unless you explicitly withdraw your paper, it is considered under review. Therefore, it would violate policy to submit it elsewhere. If you choose to withdraw the paper (e.g., to submit elsewhere), the next time you submit it, it will be treated as a fresh paper: you may get entirely different reviewers, previous reviews and comments will not be available, etc.
*   Until your paper is accepted or rejected, you should maintain the anonymity of your submission. If you believe you need to violate it to respond to the reviews, please first discuss this with the Chairs.
*   If the Artifact Evaluation submission deadline occurs before the decision date, Conditionally Accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts. However, acceptance of artifacts has no impact on the acceptance of the revised papers.
*   Only Accepted and Conditionally Accepted papers can submit artifacts for evaluation. The reason for this is that often, Minor and Major revisions end up affecting the artifacts, sometimes substantially. It is not reasonable to ask the AEC to review the artifacts twice; nor does it make sense to review artifacts that are likely to change. For this reason, artifact evaluation will only happen once the paper reaches (near-)final form. Thus, for instance, a paper accepted after revisions in R1 can submit to the AEC for R2, and get its badges then.

## Reserve Reviewer Policy

To prepare for the possibility of a higher volume of submissions, we are implementing a new review policy: for each paper, at least one senior author must — unless exempt under the criteria below — register as a reserve reviewer. They must list their information on the submission form, and they must register themselves on TPMS.

Instructions: Log into TPMS with the same email address as for your HotCRP account. The system will ask you to upload (or provide URLs for) 5-10 of your previous papers, to base your matching on. Uploading papers/URLs is pretty straightforward; here’s also a step-by-step video. You get to choose which papers you want to upload; these determine what papers you are most likely to be asked to review. So please go for both depth and breadth. In particular, please provide papers on topics for which you are a relatively rare expert.

The goal of this policy is to uphold the high standard of reviews within the SIGPLAN community. To achieve this, we must ensure manageable review loads, prevent burnout, and encourage reviewers to stay engaged for future rounds. High-quality reviews are one of the community’s greatest assets, playing a crucial role in elevating the quality of research for everyone.

Our hope is that these reserve reviewers won’t be needed at all! They will only be called upon as ad hoc reviewers if our projections fall significantly short. Even in that case, their review load will be far lighter than that of RC members, and we will do our best to assign papers that closely match expertise (hence the need for TPMS registration).

We define “senior” authors as those who completed their PhD five or more years ago. A paper is exempt from the reserve reviewer policy if:

*   The paper has no senior authors.
*   At least one senior author is already in the RC for this conference.
*   Every senior author of the paper satisfies one or more of these criteria:
    *   is new to SIGPLAN (has never published in it before);
    *   is chairing a SIGPLAN conference with 150 or more submissions last year, this year, or next year;
    *   has some other exceptional circumstance that didn’t prevent writing the paper but prevents doing any reviewing. This must be cleared at least three days before submission with the RC Chairs.

It is okay for one person to serve as the reserve reviewer for more than one paper. Please enter their information for each such paper (preferably identically).

## Submissions

### Template

SPLASH’s PACMPL templates and instructions are on the [SIGPLAN author information page](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/). Please use:

```latex
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review]{acmart}
```

### Page Limit

Initial submissions must be at most **23 pages** using the template. This page limit does not include required statements, references, or supplementary material (such as appendices). However, papers must be self-contained; reviewers are under no obligation to read the supplementary material.

Revisions can correspondingly go up to a maximum of **25 pages**. This includes papers given a minor or major revision in 2024, as well as the final, camera-ready papers. For fairness, there will not be an option to purchase additional pages. For the final paper, we ask you to stick as closely as possible to the final version accepted by reviewers, and only add material that reviewers requested or that you promised.

### Anonymity

PACMPL uses **double-blind reviewing**. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Your papers must:

*   omit author names and institutions,
*   use the third person when referencing your work,
*   anonymize supplementary material.

Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.

### Novelty

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Re-Publication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship.

### Data-Availability Statement

To help readers understand the state of the intended artifact, we ask you to add a section just before references titled **Data-Availability Statement** in the initial submission. This will not count towards the page limit, but please limit it to at most a few paragraphs (usually one paragraph suffices).

In it, indicate whether an artifact exists, its nature and limitations, and whether it will be submitted for Artifact Evaluation. This section should ideally also include links to preliminary versions of (anonymized) artifacts, datasets, and so on that reviewers may find useful (but are not obliged to follow). The statement is not meant to be a detailed description of how to use the artifact; that should accompany the artifact itself.

It is understood that some papers have no artifacts but, given the broad range of what constitutes an artifact, it would be helpful to readers to explain why the paper has none.

Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact after promising one will be asked to explain why they did not do so.

Artifact Evaluation submission will closely follow paper notification, so make sure you check the Artifact Call as soon as you submit your paper.

### Procedure

Please submit using [HotCRP](https://oopsla2425.hotcrp.com/).

### Publication

PACMPL is a **Gold Open Access** journal. All papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge (USD 400), but payment is not required.

The official publication date is the date the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library. The journal issue and associated papers accepted in Round 1 (OOPSLA1) will be published no earlier than April 1, 2025, while those accepted in Round 2 (OOPSLA2) will be published no earlier than October 1, 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## ACM Policies

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID iD, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and has made a [commitment to collecting ORCID iDs from all of our published authors](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs).

The ACM Publications Board has recently updated the ACM Authorship Policy in several ways:

*   Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications process
*   Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of authors
*   Defining prohibited behaviour, such as gift, ghost, or purchased authorship
*   Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing additional details

You can find the [updated policy here](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship).

## FAQ

### What are reviewers looking for?

We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:

*   **Novelty:** The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.
*   **Importance:** The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.
*   **Evidence:** The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, user studies, case studies, and anecdotes.
*   **Clarity:** The paper presents its contributions, methodology, and results clearly.

### How are papers from previous years handled?

We follow the same timeline as the other papers with the following two differences: (1) we try to assign the same reviewers you had in the previous year’s OOPSLA; (2) we strongly discourage reviewers from giving another “major revision” decision.

### Are artifacts required?

No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. However, if the nature of the paper’s content and claims suggest there ought to be an artifact, authors must explain why they will not be providing one. The absence of such an explanation can be cause for rejection.

### Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?

Yes. Sometimes artifacts are rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the research results (e.g., packaging issues).

### What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?

Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity completely undiscoverable (e.g., if a reviewer does a Web search for the text of your paper) but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without knowing who you are. This includes omitting your names from your title page, and referring to your own work in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004]”, you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. It is best to suppress acknowledgments entirely until camera-ready.

### Should I change the name of my system?

No. However, if it is not a new system and is likely to be known to others, you should refer to it as if it were created by a third party, rather than as your own creation.

### My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?

Cite the code in your paper, but replace the URL with text like “link removed for double-blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.

### I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper. Should I anonymize reference to that work?

Yes, you should treat it like any other anonymization. But you should also change the title of the paper to break a direct link between the two.

### Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv, send it to colleagues, give a talk about it, mention it on social media, …?

We want to help you navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that are likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs. When in doubt about any of these guidelines, please first check in with the Review Committee Chairs: better safe than sorry. (If the Chairs give you permission, they can then also address any subsequent complaints about those actions from reviewers.)

Things you may do:

*   Put your submission on your home page, arXiv, or other pre-publication sites.
*   Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict.
*   Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc.
*   Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on a pre-publication site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc.

Things you should not do:

*   Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be.
*   Publicize your work on social media in an identifiable way with broad settings. For example, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post with paper details to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine.
*   Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them.

## Submission Guidelines

### Submission Types

PAM welcomes both short and long submissions. This includes early-stage contributions with exciting promise, high-level visions, challenging future directions, validation of important results, or new ideas challenging existing assumptions.

Submissions should describe original research that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue.

### Formatting Requirements

*   Submissions must follow **Springer LNCS format**.
*   **Short papers:** Up to 11 pages for technical content (up to 5 pages for appendices and references).
*   **Long papers:** Up to 24 pages for technical content (up to 5 pages for appendices and references).
*   *Note: Reviewers are not required to read appendices. Everything essential must be within the first 11 pages for short papers and 24 pages for long papers.*.

### Anonymization

Reviewing will be **double-blind**.

*   Do not include names or affiliations of authors in the submission.
*   Refer to your prior work in the third person.
*   Make a best effort to anonymize system names that would identify you.
*   Contact the PC chairs if you have concerns about anonymizing your paper while maintaining its integrity.

### Submission Portal

Please submit your paper via HotCRP: [https://hotcrp.dacs.utwente.nl/pam2025/](https://hotcrp.dacs.utwente.nl/pam2025/)

## Ethical Considerations

Ethics will be considered during the review process. Each paper must include a statement detailing the ethical considerations of the work. If no ethical concerns are raised, this must be clearly stated.

> Papers describing experiments with users or sensitive user data must follow basic precepts of ethical research and subscribe to community norms. These include: respect for privacy, secure storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent if users are placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential, beneficence, and risk mitigation.

Authors may consult the [Menlo Report](https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance) for further ethical information and the [Allman/Paxson IMC 2007 paper](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2007/papers/imc80.pdf) for guidance on ethical data sharing.

Submitting research for approval by an institutional ethics review body is necessary but not sufficient. The PC will consider the ethical soundness and justification of any paper.

If work has been submitted to an IRB or ethics committee, the ethical considerations section or appendix should clearly indicate this and include the reference number of the approval if available.

## Awards

*   **Best Paper Award:** Recognizes the paper with the highest merit.
*   **Community Contribution Award:** Given to the best paper that makes relevant datasets, source code, or platforms available to the public by the camera-ready deadline, sufficiently documented for replication.

## Publication

*   **Publisher:** IARIA Press (operated by Xpert Publishing Services)
*   **Archived:** Open Access IARIA ThinkMind Digital Library
*   **Prints:** Available at Curran Associates, Inc.

It focuses on new ideas, paradigms, and reflections on programming and software, welcoming radical and visionary concepts with a degree of validation.","# Onward! Papers: Call for Papers

Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software, including processes, methods, languages, communities, and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.

## The Character of Onward! Papers

Onward! Papers seeks **grand visions and new paradigms** that could significantly impact future software development. Unlike conferences like OOPSLA, which require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

## Selection Process

Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a **double-blind manner**. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation. A two-phase review process is employed, allowing for revisions to promising papers.

## Instructions for Authors

*   Submissions must conform to the formatting instructions.
*   Violations may lead to rejection without review.
*   Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person, though remote participation options will be available.

The 13th Workshop on Programming Languages and Operating Systems (PLOS 2025) will be held on **October 13, 2025**, in **Seoul, Republic of Korea**.

This workshop is held in conjunction with the [31st ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP '25)](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/sosp/2025/).

## Rationale and Overview

Historically, operating system (OS) development and programming language (PL) development went hand-in-hand, with cross-fertilization being the norm. Today, modern PL ideas continue to spark innovations in OS design and construction, while the systems field provides challenging problems and practical results that should drive advances in PLs, software designs, and idioms.

This workshop will bring together researchers and developers from the PL and OS domains to discuss recent work at the intersection of these fields. It will serve as a venue for discussing new visions, challenges, experiences, problems, and solutions arising from the application of advanced programming and software engineering concepts to OS construction, and vice versa.

## Suggested Paper Topics

Suggested paper topics include, but are not restricted to:

*   Domain-specific and type-safe languages for the OS;
*   The design of language-specific unikernels;
*   Language-based approaches to crosscutting system concerns, such as security and run-time performance;
*   PL support for system verification, testing, and debugging;
*   Synthesis of OS code;
*   Static/dynamic OS configuration and specialization;
*   PL support for OS integration of modern hardware (NVM, HBM, FPGAs, accelerators, RDMA, etc.);
*   The use of OS abstractions and techniques in language runtimes;
*   Verification and static analysis of OS components;
*   Critical evaluations of new programming language ideas in support of OS construction; and
*   Experience reports on applying new language techniques in commercial OS settings.

## Agenda

The workshop will be a highly interactive event designed to promote focused and lively discussions, including paper presentations. PLOS welcomes research, experience, and position papers; papers describing industrial experience are particularly encouraged. Accepted papers will be made available to registered attendees in advance.

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Language:** All papers must be written in English.
*   **Formatting:** Papers should be formatted in the two-column ACM article style using the options `sigplan,anonymous,10pt`. CCS Concepts, Keywords, and ACM Reference Format sections are not required in submissions.
*   **Double-Blind Review:** Submissions must not include author names and affiliations.
*   **Page Limit:** Submissions must not be more than **six (6) pages** in length, using 10-point font. The bibliography does not count towards the page limit. This limit will be strictly enforced.
*   **Submission Website:** [http://plos25.hotcrp.com/](http://plos25.hotcrp.com/)
*   **Review Criteria:** Papers will be evaluated based on technical quality, originality, relevance, and presentation.
*   **Publication:** Accepted papers will be published electronically in the ACM Digital Library. Authors of accepted papers must sign ACM copyright release forms. Publication in the PLOS workshop proceedings is not intended to replace future conference publication.

## Important Dates (tentative)

*   **Paper submission deadline:** July 25, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)
*   **Notification of acceptance:** August 25, 2025
*   **Final papers due:** September 19, 2025
