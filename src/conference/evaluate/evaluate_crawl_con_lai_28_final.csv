LaTeX authors: Use the template at [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions), and insert the acmsmall call.

Overleaf authors: Use the template at [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf), and use the acmsmall call.

Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be desk rejected. 

### Tiered Review Process

Each submission after the Assisted DR phase will be reviewed by a Senior Program Committee member (SPC), a Program Committee member (PC), and two external reviewers.

Similar to CSCW 2025, anyone who submits must make themselves available as a reviewer for this CSCW cycle.

## Policies

### Policy on Use of Large Language Models in Writing Papers

Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text.

### Policy on Irresponsible Reviews

LLMs are NOT allowed to be used for writing the reviews nor the meta-reviews at any step.

## Submission

All manuscripts (max 10 pages, including all references) must follow Springer’s LNCS style (Latex or Word). All papers are submitted via EasyChair in pdf format, and will be reviewed by at least two anonymous reviewers. Accepted papers will be published in Springer’s LNCS series, providing that at least one author will register to the workshop and present the paper.

*   Visit [Easychair.org](Easychair.org)

## Camera-Ready Submission

Camera-ready versions of the accepted papers are due on **July 15, 2026.** This is a strict deadline. The papers should be in LNCS format and should abide by the strict page limit of 10 pages, including references. Do not abuse the LNCS format by modifying the page size parameters, line spacing or font size. Ensure that the figures and their labelling are clear and readable.

## Scope

The main focus of EOMAS is on the role, importance, and application of modeling and simulation within the extended organizational and enterprise context. This context implies that systems and software applications are designed to enable certain business processes, and to facilitate interaction of the actors, the system, and the environment. Thus, application of modeling and simulation in this extended context involves several number of socio-technical aspects (Information Systems (IS), Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), Software Systems, and Business Systems, Business Processes, Human Interaction, etc.), as well as technical challenges such as security, big data, and approaches to develop these artifacts such as Agile methods and frameworks etc.

## Suggested Topics

*   Enterprise Modeling and Simulation
*   Information Systems Modeling and Simulation
*   Business Processes Modeling and Simulation
*   Organizational Modeling and Simulation
*   Ontological and Conceptual  Modeling
*   Domain-specific Modeling and Languages
*   Business Rules and Constrain Modeling
*   Modeling and Simulation Methods, Techniques, and Tools
*   Modeling and Simulation Tools Demonstration
*   Modeling and Simulation Guidelines for Practitioners
*   Case Studies on Modeling and Simulation
*   Simulations for Model Verification and implementations of Simulation Models
*   Requirements Modeling and Simulation
*   Usage of graph and network models and other new concepts
*   Declarative methods for creating models and applications
*   Model-Driven Engineering and transformation between different types of models, for example: ontological, conceptual, process, business, relational, network, implementational, etc
*   New theories in modeling. New types of models. Combinations of different types of diagrams and their mutual interrelationships
*   Educational Methods in Enterprise Modeling and Simulation. How they are taught in different universities. Inverted curriculum concept of teaching of software engineering
*   Human and Cognitive Aspects of Modeling
*   The use of AI (e.g. language models like Chat GPT) in software engineering and modeling and how to use these new ideas and tools
*   Modeling and simulation applied to support Agile methods and frameworks
*   Information modeling as a support for Digital Twins
*   Usage of information modeling and simulation in new areas and their application in fields other than software engineering or informational technologies

> It is possible to accept articles that do not directly fit the above topics if judged attractive. We support new and not yet-popular ideas – because we want to be a platform or incubator and motivate the professional public, our colleagues and doctoral students. But we will only take such papers if there is some innovation in the text.

## Paper Formats

*   **Standard papers:** max. 15 pages long presenting mature research results
*   **Short papers:** max. 8 pages long presenting preliminary research results and case studies
*   **Flash talks** (5-10 mins) “Show us your project”

Authors may indicate to submit their papers into one of the categories by themselves, or chairs may decide, based on the reviews, to accept a standard paper as a short paper or a flash talk.

Both standard and short papers will be published in the Springer volume proceedings and indexed.

Papers should be submitted in PDF format. Submissions must conform to Springer‚ LNCS format and should not exceed 15 pages, including all text, figures, references, and appendices. Submissions not conforming to the LNCS format, exceeding 15 pages, or being obviously out of the workshop’s scope will be rejected without review. See the guidelines here: [https://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html](https://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html).
