*   **Originality:** Submissions must represent new and original work. Concurrent submissions to other venues are not allowed. Previously published or currently under review work is prohibited. However, submissions available on preprint servers (e.g., Arxiv) or presented at non-peer-reviewed venues are allowed, provided anonymity is maintained in the submitted paper. Prior work must be appropriately cited.
*   **Format:**
    *   Manuscripts must be submitted in PDF according to the new ACM format guidelines (use `documentclass [sigconf,anonymous,review]{acmart}`).
    *   Submissions should not exceed **9 pages** including diagrams, tables, and appendices, plus unrestricted space for references and an ethical consideration section.

    *   All non-standard fonts must be embedded. Submissions must be self-contained and in English.
*   **Supplementary Material & Reproducibility:** Authors may include references to external repositories for resources, proofs, experimental setup, etc., but only if author anonymity can be strictly maintained. Reviewers are not obligated to examine supplementary material. Authors are encouraged to share experimental results, data, and code.
*   **Authorship:** Manuscripts must adhere to the [ACM authorship policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship). A limit of **10 manuscript submissions per author** is enforced.
*   **Placeholder titles/abstracts will be desk-rejected.**

## Review Process

Each manuscript will be reviewed by at least three PC members and a senior PC member. Decisions will consider novelty, technical depth, elegance, impact, and presentation. WSDM 2026 will use a combination of single-blind and double-blind reviewing. Manuscripts will be double-blind to regular and Senior PC members, but metadata will be available to Associate Chairs for conflict of interest checks. Papers not related to the conference theme may be desk-rejected.

## Ethical Considerations

Submitted manuscripts should include a section on the ethical implications of the proposed research. This section will not count towards the page limit and should discuss potential negative societal impacts (e.g., fairness, privacy, security, misuse) and appropriate mitigation strategies.

## Acceptance and Presentation

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference (in-person) to present the paper. Each paper requires a paper presentation fee. WSDM 2026 is an in-person conference with no remote presentation options. Papers not presented will be removed from the proceedings.

## Publication and Open Access Policy

ACM will transition to 100% Open Access starting January 1, 2026. Authors can publish via the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs). Most papers will not require APCs if the author's institution participates in ACM Open. For authors from non-participating institutions, APCs may apply, subject to waivers and discounts. A temporary subsidy for 2026 is available: **$250 APC for ACM/SIG members** and **$350 for non-members**.

## Program Committee (PC) Membership

Interested individuals with at least 5 years of research experience and prior reviewer experience for WSDM or related conferences are welcome to reach out to pcchairs-wsdm2026@easychair.org. Self-nomination for Senior PC is not accepted.",,
