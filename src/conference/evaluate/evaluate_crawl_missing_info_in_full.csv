The International Conference on Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development (KEOD) aims to be a major meeting point for researchers and practitioners interested in methodologies and technologies related to Knowledge Engineering and Ontology Development. It encourages the exploration of cutting-edge topics such as LLM-based Ontology Development, Ontology-driven Digital Twins, and Ontology-enhanced Low-code Platforms, fostering dialogue and innovation across academic and industrial spheres.

## Scope

Knowledge Engineering (KE) refers to the technical, scientific, and social aspects involved in building, maintaining, and utilizing knowledge-based systems. As a multidisciplinary field, KE draws upon methodologies from artificial intelligence (AI), databases, expert systems, decision support systems, and information systems, with strong ties to software engineering principles.

KE also intersects with disciplines like logic, cognitive science, and socio-cognitive engineering. In recent years, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new pathways in ontology development, enabling automated extraction, refinement, and evolution of ontologies. Additionally, the rise of Low-code and No-code Platforms empowers non-experts to participate in ontology engineering, broadening accessibility and fostering innovation.

Ontology Development (OD) focuses on building reusable semantic structures such as vocabularies, glossaries, and formal ontologies that specify types of entities and relationships within a domain. These semantic structures are increasingly central to applications like knowledge graphs, digital twins, explainable AI (XAI), and cybersecurity frameworks, where ontologies enhance data integration, decision-making, and system transparency.

Current applications of KE and OD include sustainable AI solutions, semantic interoperability in IoT, natural language processing (NLP), and enterprise engineering. Ontologies now play a crucial role in ensuring ethical AI development by mitigating bias and enhancing transparency.

## Abstract Submission

All full papers are required to submit an abstract and basic details about the paper a week before the paper submission deadline. Papers that did not submit the abstract on time will not be accepted.

The abstract, title, and list of authors’ information that is submitted at that time must be complete. Submissions for which it is obvious that the information submitted by the abstract deadline is merely a placeholder or incomplete will be deleted.

## Format and Submission

Full papers are up to **eight camera-ready pages**, including figures, but excluding references. Submissions longer than eight pages of content excluding references will be desk rejected and not reviewed.

All papers for the conference must be submitted in PDF format and conform to IEEE Proceedings specifications. Templates are available at this [link](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) (use US letter format). In addition, the IEEE has partnered with Overleaf, so you can start writing using [this link](https://www.overleaf.com/) directly.

## Tracks

The HRI 2026 full paper submissions will have five tracks:

*   **Theory and Methods**
*   **Design**
*   **Technical**
*   **Systems**
*   **User Studies**

Authors are strongly encouraged to read through the track’s descriptions at the end of this page.

You will need to indicate your choice of track (and optionally your second choice) when you submit your abstract. During the initial paper check stage, the Program Committee may suggest a track change that they deem more appropriate. However, the final track choice remains a decision by the authors to be confirmed by the full paper deadline.

## ACMs New Open Access Publishing Model

Starting January 1, 2026, ACM will fully transition to Open Access. Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs).

Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC to publish their papers, unless they qualify for a financial or discretionary waiver. To find out whether an APC applies to your article, please consult the list of participating institutions in ACM Open and review the [APC Waivers and Discounts Policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/openaccess/waivers). 

ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more time for institutions to join ACM Open. The subsidy will offer:

*   **$250 APC for ACM/SIG members**
*   **$350 for non-members**

This temporary subsidized pricing will apply to all conferences scheduled for 2026, including HRI.

## New ACM Publication Policies

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.

## Accessibility

Make sure to read and follow the accessibility requirements, which we will provide soon.

## Anonymization

The HRI 2026 full papers review process is double-blind; every aspect of all submissions must be properly anonymized. For full details on how to do anonymization, see the anonymization guidelines (coming soon).

## Supplementary Materials

Authors have the opportunity to upload up to three supplemental files in conjunction with their full paper submission. These materials may be submitted via the “Supporting File 1,” “Supporting File 2,” and “Supporting File 3” sections within the full papers submission form in the submission system. It is important that any supplemental materials that are uploaded are also properly anonymized.

In general, there are three main types of supplemental materials that may be submitted: videos, appendices, and artifacts (e.g., software, hardware, data sets, etc.).

### Video Guidelines

Authors may submit a 1-minute video (up to 100 MB) as a supplement to their full paper. Videos are not mandatory but may be helpful to visibly showcase a working system, experimental conditions, environment context, results, etc. Only MPG, MPEG or MP4 video formats can be used. Ensure that videos are properly anonymized prior to submission (more information coming soon).

Accepted full papers with a video in supplementary material will be considered for Demo Fast Track. More details coming soon.

### Artifact Guidelines

Across all full paper tracks, we encourage submissions that introduce a novel “artifact” as an enabler to reproducibility, replicability, and recreation of HRI research, and/or to support new lines of HRI research.

Authors submitting artifacts must include with it a text file providing relevant details regarding any aspects related to artifact clearance and release (e.g., obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) clearance for releasing data collected by human participants, organizational clearances for the release of software/hardware, etc.). Ensure that artifacts are properly anonymized prior to submission.

### Appendix Guidelines

Authors may upload an appendix directly or provide a link to supporting appendix material hosted anonymously online. Appendices are only for supplementary materials that would interrupt the flow of the text if presented in the main document.

Appendices may not be used to get around the 8-page limit for full paper submissions. Any submissions that attempt to use appendices or supplementary materials in general in a manner that violates the page limits will be desk rejected.

## Studies with Human Participants

To support building a strong evidence base in HRI, and encourage future reproducibility of published work, all submissions involving studies with human participants clearly outline their methodology regardless of the theme they are submitted to, including:

*   Participant demographics and sampling approach, e.g. gender, ethnicity, etc.
*   Data collection and analysis methods
*   Study environment and context
*   If a Wizard-of-Oz paradigm was used, a detailed description of the robot, wizard, user, etc.
*   If a robot was used, a detailed description of the platform, its level of autonomy, capabilities, etc.

Studies that involve human participants need to include an ethical approval statement.

## Policy on Use of ChatGPT or Similar Models

Text, images or any material generated from foundation models (LLMs, VLMs etc.), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text. The LaTeX template will default to hiding the Acknowledgements section while in review mode – please make sure that any LLM disclosure is available in your submitted version for review.

## Desk rejects

The main reasons for a desk rejections include:

*   Scope: clearly out of scope for conference (e.g., no relevance to robots or to human-robot interaction).
*   Anonymization: any violation of the rules detailed in the anonymization guidelines
*   Incomplete submissions: missing submission information (including an obviously placeholder title or abstract, etc.).
*   Formatting issues:
    *   paper is breaking the full paper limit (eight pages excluding references);
    *   using an incorrect submission format.
*   Other obvious issues, such as paper clearly unfinished, obvious use of foundation models for generating the contents, not written in English, etc.

## Descriptions of Full Paper Tracks

### Theory and Methods

The primary contribution for the Theory and Methods track is to further the conceptual foundations of HRI. This work helps us to expand upon the ways we think about human-robot interaction (theory) and upon the ways we engage in doing human-robot interaction research (methods).

We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the theory and methods track:

*   To the extent that methods papers might pertain to new metrics or methods of evaluation, they might include studies; however, the focus of the paper would be on evaluating the novelty and contribution of the concepts and methods, rather than in generalizable knowledge, which is typical of User Studies contributions.
*   Theory papers are not expected to have user studies.
*   Methods for generating design belong in the Design track; methods for measuring or studying HRI belong in the Theory and Methods track. Technical methods or tools belong to the Technical track.
*   If the contribution is a clarification or improvement of an existing theory or method, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution.

### Design

The Design track brings together design-centric research contributions to human-robot interaction (HRI). This includes novel design approaches, new robot morphologies, behavior paradigms, interaction techniques, and the exploration of new contexts for interaction that yield unique or improved interaction experiences with or capabilities for robots.

We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the Design track:

*   While there are often studies in the Design track papers, the focus of these studies lies in evaluating novel aspects and features of the design and resulting response or behavior, rather than in generalizable knowledge, which is typical of User Studies contributions.
*   If the main contribution lies in some aspect of the software or hardware capabilities, and less in how the context or use matches the hardware or software, the paper might belong in the Systems track.
*   If the contribution is an implementation or improvement of an existing design, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution.

### Technical

The primary knowledge contribution of papers submitted to the technical track is expected to be a novel algorithm (formalized through pseudocode), mathematical model (formalized through a set of equations), tool, hardware element, or human-robot interface, and should provide enough detail to allow reproducibility.

We provide the following guidelines to authors about expectations for papers submitted to the technical track:

*   If a submitted paper contains a user study to empirically evaluate or demonstrate the primary knowledge contribution, authors should be clear in the paper why this paper is indeed a “technical” contribution rather than a “studies” contribution.
*   If the novelty or main contribution of a paper lies in the integration of disparate hardware or software capabilities, the paper likely belongs in the Systems track; however, if the novelty or main contribution lies in a novel individual component of a possibly integrated system, then the paper is appropriate for the Technical track.
*   If the novelty or main contribution of a paper lies in the development of a code-based implementation of an existing technical contribution, rather than the algorithm or model itself, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution.

Authors of submitted papers whose evaluation does not support the paper’s claims (e.g., strong claims of an algorithm’s effect backed up only by a proof-of-concept demonstration or an underpowered user study) might be asked to revise their claims.

### Systems

Because HRI is by its nature an integrative discipline, the Systems track focuses on contributions which consist of a synthesis of underlying techniques and/or technologies to achieve system-level HRI behavior.

Please note that:

*   If the primary contribution of a paper is an algorithm or a mathematical model, or is best measured via component-level testing rather than a systems-level evaluation, then the paper likely belongs to the Technical track;
*   If the paper’s contribution is about presenting a study to better understanding human behavior or preferences rather than system-level behavior based on integration, the paper may belong to the User Studies track;
*   If the contribution is limited to a description of a system design or dataset, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution.

### User Studies

The studies track welcomes submissions that provide new knowledge about human-robot interactions based on studies involving people.

Because the primary knowledge contribution in this track is expected to be knowledge from a study with humans:

*   If a submitted paper contains evaluation of an implemented system, it should be clear why the insights from the study with humans are the primary knowledge contribution rather than the system itself, and thus, why the paper belongs in the Studies rather than Technical or Systems track.
*   If the paper’s main contribution is the creation of a new survey measure or other scientific tools, the paper likely belongs in the Theory and Methods track.
*   If the paper’s main contribution is a design process, or the description of a series of design steps used to design a robotic system, then the paper likely belongs in the Design track. For example, if an author performs a series of co-design workshops, the resulting paper would belong in the User Studies track if the contribution of the paper focused on the scientific insights gleaned from the analysis of those workshops, but would belong in the Design track if the contribution of the paper focused on the quality of the design process itself.
*   If the paper’s main contribution is the dataset rather than the experimental results themselves, the paper should likely be a Short Contribution.

To help the community navigate the wide range of topics in this large track, we encourage authors to select at least one subtheme that aligns with their submission. These subthemes guide reviewers and ensure appropriate expertise during evaluation.

*   Interpersonal Constructs: Focuses on emotional, social, behavioural, and interpersonal aspects of HRI, including affect recognition, social signaling, empathy, and engagement.
*   Special Populations: Examines how robots support learning, therapy, care, or personal growth across the lifespan, in different subsets of the population (e.g. older adults, children, neurodivergent individuals, etc.)
*   Teams, Collaboration & Communication: Explores task-based interaction and teamwork with robots, including coordination, shared goals, and communication.

## Submission Guidelines

All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library in the VRST collection.

### Format

*   Paper submissions must be anonymous for a double-blind review process.
*   All submissions should be prepared using the Word or LaTeX templates from the official ACM Master article template packages and TAPS (see [https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow)).
*   For LaTeX authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format using `\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}`.
*   For Word submissions, please use the linked single-column template.
*   Authors should prepare their materials using numbered citations and references. See the TAPS webpage for guidance on how content length corresponds to the page limits for the final version.

### Submission Lengths

*   Latex: 4 to 9 pages, double column, excluding references
*   Word: approx. 8,000 words including space for figures, tables, etc.

### Anonymity Guidelines

For initial Paper submissions, authors are asked to remove all author and institution information and remove any clues that would directly identify any of the authors (such as the name of the data collecting institution, ethical board/IRB institution names, or acknowledgments). Please anonymize all PDF files. Note that PDF creator programs may automatically include author information in the file metadata. Citations of the authors’ own published work (including online) must be in the third person, in a manner that is not traceable to the identity of the authors. For example, the wording “in [3], Mountain and River proposed…” is acceptable, whereas “in [3], we proposed…” is not.

To avoid accusations of (self)plagiarism in these cases, we ask the authors to upload their work in a special field in PCS. These works can only be viewed by the submission coordinator.

**Please note that failure to comply with any of the above requirements and guidelines will result in an automatic desk rejection of the paper!**

## Contribution Types

We invite many types of research contributions, including interactive systems.

## Supplementary Materials

Submissions may be (optionally) accompanied by additional materials such as images, videos, or electronic documents. These materials do not form a part of the official submission. They will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers. All content should be in a portable format that is unlikely to require the user to download additional programs. For example, you may prefer PDF or HTML for documents, PNG or JPEG for images, and QuickTime or MPEG for videos. The total file size for supplementary materials should not exceed a total of 50MB.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

When designing and presenting user evaluations, please consider the following: User evaluations using non-representative or homogeneous participant populations can introduce biases in the results and conclusions. We recommend that researchers strive to use samples that are representative of the population for which the technology is being designed.

## Accessibility

We ask authors to try to be as inclusive as possible when preparing a submission. For instance, please provide alt-text for figures and tables and make supplemental videos accessible with subtitles to enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. We recommend that authors read the SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission, as well as the SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos (especially the section “What accessibility considerations should I pay attention to when recording my video?”), which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning. If authors have difficulties with making their submissions accessible, they are encouraged to contact the VRST 2025 Accessibility Chairs by emailing [accessibility@vrst2025.org](mailto:accessibility@vrst2025.org).

## Policies

*   At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present their work in person at the conference. As the conference is in-person only, there will not be any opportunity to present remotely.
*   All standing ACM policies apply to ACM VRST 2025.
    *   [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) (which also contains statements regarding the use of generative AI)
    *   [ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions)

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.

**AUTHOR’S TAKE NOTE:** The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

The 20th International Symposium on Parameterized and Exact Computation (IPEC 2025) invites papers presenting original research in the area of parameterized and exact algorithms and complexity. The conference will be part of [ALGO 2025](http://algo-conference.org/2025), planned as an in-person conference.

Submissions via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ipec2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ipec2025)

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract submission / paper registration:** June 27th (23:59 AoE)
*   **Submission deadline:** June 30th (23:59 AoE)
*   **Notification:** August 7th
*   **IPEC dates:** Sept. 17—19 (Wed-Fri)
*   **Camera-ready version:** October 10th (23:59 AoE)

## Invited Talks

The IPEC 2025 invited tutorial will be given by [Martin Koutecky](https://research.koutecky.name/) (Charles University, Prague). There will also be an invited talk by (one of) the 2025 EATCS-IPEC Nerode Prize winner(s) — to be announced.

## Topics

The topics include but are not limited to:

*   new techniques for the design and analysis of parameterized and exact algorithms;
*   fixed-parameter tractability and kernelization results;
*   parameterized complexity theory;
*   parameterized (in)approximability results;
*   relationships between parameterized complexity and traditional complexity classifications;
*   applications of parameterized and exact computation;
*   engineering and experimentation of exact, parameterized, and kernelization algorithms.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Each submission is required to be in the [LIPIcs format](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/series/LIPIcs#author); no changes to font size, page margins, etc., are permitted. Line numbers must be activated.
*   We welcome submissions of the full version of the paper. Regardless, the first 12 pages of the submission (excluding the title page) should be enough to assess the paper and contain a summary of the main results, their motivation and importance, and evidence of their correctness. In particular, PC members and potential subreviewers may treat the first 12 pages as the short version (the rest being read at their discretion).
*   Results previously published in conference proceedings or a journal (or scheduled for publication prior to IPEC) or under simultaneous submission will not be considered.
*   PC members (outside the PC chairs) are allowed to author or coauthor submissions.
*   **Double-blind reviewing:** IPEC 2025 employs a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors are responsible for declaring conflicts of interest with any of the PC members. You have a conflict of interest with:

*   family members and close friends;
*   Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years;
*   people with the same affiliation;
*   involved in an alleged incident of harassment (it is not required that the incident be reported);
*   reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter); and
*   frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.

## Conference and Paper Publication

Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the symposium, and to incorporate the comments from the program committee. The conference proceedings will be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series after the conference (post-proceedings).

The final submission will be made in LIPIcs format, with a higher page limit of 15 pages plus bibliography (no appendix). More details will follow from LIPIcs upon acceptance. The submissions will be published as post-proceedings.

## Awards

A best paper award and a best student paper award may be conferred. All submissions are eligible for the best paper award, except submissions co-authored by PC members. Submissions of which all authors are students at the time of submission are also eligible for the best student paper award. Papers meeting the requirement for the best student paper award should indicate this during submission.

Besides the best paper and best student paper award, during the IPEC conference, the [IPEC Nerode Prize](https://eatcs.org/index.php/nerode-prize) will be conferred. The winner(s) will be chosen by a separate award committee; please refer to the webpage for details.

## Publication Fees

For all accepted papers, regardless of conference attendance, at least one author must register for the ACM ISS 2026 conference in the corresponding author category and pay a registration fee for the work to be published in PACM HCI.

## Submissions

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has made a [commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs).

Submissions to PACM HCI ISS should present original and mature research work. High-quality, elaborated case studies and practice reports with generalizable findings will also be considered. Papers should be written using the template provided by PACM HCI, available at [https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates).

Submissions should be anonymized.

## Length

No minimum or maximum length is imposed on papers. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length when making decisions about acceptance and revisions. Shorter, more focused papers will be reviewed with the expectation of a small, focused contribution. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be rejected.

We recommend a page length in the new format of between 5-15 pages + any additional pages for references. Typical papers are under 8,500 words.

## Formatting and Language

ACM authoring templates and detailed instructions on formatting can be found at [https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates).

Authors should submit manuscripts for review in a single column format, which is available for Word and LaTeX. Manuscripts should be converted to PDF before submission.

LaTeX authors: On Overleaf authors can use the provided ACM templates. Authors can use the settings \documentclass[manuscript, review, anonymous]{acmart} to remove author information and add line numbers for the review process.

Please use inclusive language throughout your papers. Some commonly-used charged terminology and alternative suggestions can be found at: [https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter](https://www.acm.org/diversity-inclusion/words-matter). Please avoid using gendered language, ableist language, and racialized terminology.

You are asked to provide alt-text descriptions for all figures in your submission. Writing good descriptive text is important, so please look at [http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/describing-figures/](http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/describing-figures/) for guidance and examples.

## Revisions

PACM HCI ISS will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, after the first review cycle of this submission round:

*   **Accept:** Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes.
*   **Minor revision:** Submissions that receive this decision will require some revisions before being accepted for publication during this submission round.
*   **Major revision:** Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone before acceptance is possible.
*   **Reject:** Submissions that receive this decision will have been determined to be not acceptable in their current form and also not able to complete the needed revisions for presentation at ISS 2026.
*   **Desk / Quick Reject:** Authors should only submit completed work of publishable quality and within the scope of ISS. 

To still be considered for presentation at ISS 2026, the revised submission must be submitted in the PACM HCI ISS second round. Authors should submit their revised manuscript to PCS and clearly indicate the submission ID, title, and previous PACM HCI ISS round of the original submission. They also should include an anonymized letter explaining how they addressed the reviewers’ comments and incorporated changes in the revision.

## Open and Transparent Science

Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. Authors are encouraged to submit links to preregistrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors are also encouraged to use open access repositories and make their data and other material FAIR when appropriate for their work.

The 26th International Conference on Principles and Practice of Multi-Agent Systems (**PRIMA 2025**) will be held in **Modena, Italy, from 16 - 19th, Dec 2025**.

**PRIMA 2025** invites submissions of original, unpublished work strongly relevant to Multi-Agent Systems. Apart from theoretical work, we encourage the submission of reports on the development of applications or prototypes of deployed agent systems, and of experiments that demonstrate novel agent system capabilities. In addition to this, we also encourage the submission of position and review papers that are of particular relevance to the multi-agent community.

## Scope & Background

Software systems are rapidly becoming more intelligent in the functionality they offer to users. They are also becoming more decentralized, with components that act autonomously and must communicate among themselves or with human users, to achieve their goals. A multi-agent perspective is crucial to the proper conceptualization, deployment, and governance of such systems. Rooted in solid computational and software engineering foundations, this perspective offers abstractions such as intelligent agents, protocols, norms, organizations, trust and incentives, among others.

## Information for Authors

The papers submitted can be up to 16 pages in length, plus references, in the LNCS format. All submitted papers must be in a form suitable for double-blind review. Specifically, in order to make blind reviewing possible, authors must omit their names and affiliations from the paper. Also, while the references should include all published literature relevant to the paper, including previous work of the authors, it should not include unpublished works. When referring to one's own work, use the third person rather than the first person. For example, say ""Previously, Foo and Bar [2] have shown that…"", rather than ""In our previous work [2], we have shown that…"". Such identifying information can be added back to the final camera-ready version of accepted papers.

The papers can be submitted via [CMT](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/PRIMA2025/Submission/Index).

All papers will be reviewed by at least 2-3 experts in the area following a detailed review form that will assess the paper based on the significance and novelty of the idea, the technical description of the proposal, clarity and organization, the evaluation methodology, and any ethical considerations.

All accepted papers will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series (LNCS/LNAI).

The [Microsoft CMT service](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/) was used for managing the peer-reviewing process for this conference. This service was provided for free by Microsoft and they bore all expenses, including costs for Azure cloud services as well as for software development and support.

SEAMS 2026 will use a single-round submission system for the Research Track, with firm deadlines in October 2025, with the possibility of submitting a revised version.

## Author Responses

Authors of papers that receive “Revision” decisions will have the opportunity to submit a revised version of their papers. The authors are required to provide a response letter that (1) explains how the comments have been tackled, (2) provides answers to the questions posed by reviewers.

## Paper Submission

All submissions must be in PDF format and conform, at time of submission, to the official “ACM Primary Article Template”, which can be obtained from the [ACM Proceedings Template Page](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow). LaTeX users should use the sigconf option, as well as the review (to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers) and anonymous (omitting author names) options. To that end, the following LaTeX code can be placed at the start of the LaTeX document:

```latex
\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}
```

All submissions must not exceed the specified page limits. The purchase of additional pages in the proceedings is not allowed.

Submissions must strictly conform to the ACM conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above. Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review.

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2026. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

Starting 2026, all articles published by ACM will be made Open Access. This is greatly beneficial to the advancement of computer science and leads to increased usage and citation of research. Most authors will be covered by ACM OPEN agreements by that point and will not have to pay Article Processing Charges (APC). Check if your institution participates in ACM OPEN. Authors not covered by ACM OPEN agreements may have to pay APC; however, ACM is offering several automated and discretionary APC Waivers and Discounts.

The SEAMS 2026 Research Track will use a lightweight double- anonymous review process. No submission may reveal its authors’ identities. In particular:

*   Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission.
*   All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person.
*   While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to SEAMS 2026.
*   During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. They should thus use a different paper title for any pre-print in ArXiV or similar websites.
*   Additional material published online should be anonymized and should not provide references to the paper’s authors.
*   All communication with the program committee must go through the program committee chairs. Do not contact individual program committee members regarding your submission.

By submitting to SEAMS, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. Submissions must follow the latest policies from IEEE and ACM (“IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policy” and “ACM Policy on Authorship”, with associated FAQ), which includes a policy specific to the use of generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT.

If the research involves human participants/subjects, the authors must adhere to the [ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM and IEEE have been involved in ORCID and may collect ORCID IDs from all published authors. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

## Types of Papers

We solicit the following four types of papers:

*   **Full research papers:** 10 pages of content + 2 pages of references
*   **Short papers:** 4 pages of content + 1 page of references
*   **( New ) Extended Abstract:** 4 pages of content + 1 page of references
*   **( New ) Future of SAS papers:** 8 pages of content + 2 pages of references

## Review Criteria

*   **Full research papers:** Novelty, Relevance, Soundness, Presentation, Verifiability
*   **Short papers & Extended Abstract:** Novelty, Soundness of the research plan, Presentation
*   **(New) Future of SAS papers:** Novelty and ambition, Potential for discussion, Presentation

## Software and Data Artifact Availability

Authors of accepted papers will have the opportunity to increase the visibility of their artifacts (software and data) and to obtain an artifact badge.

## Submission Guidelines

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper of at most 10 pages, excluding the title page, references, and an optional appendix. The submission should be typeset using a 10-point or larger font in a single-column format and 2cm margins all around on A4-size paper. The appendix must contain all omitted proofs or, alternatively, a full version of the paper. The appendix will be read by the program committee at their discretion but is not going to be published in the proceedings. The central part of the submission should, therefore, contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.

Results previously published (or scheduled for publication) in another conference proceedings or journal will not be accepted. Simultaneous submission to journals or other conferences with published proceedings is not permitted. By submitting a paper, the authors acknowledge that in case of acceptance, at least one of the authors must register at ALGO 2025, attend the conference onsite and present the paper. The program committee may award a Best Paper Award to one of the accepted papers.

### Double-blind Reviewing

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person.

### COI with PC members

At submission, authors will be asked to indicate a Conflict of Interest (COI) with members of the program committee. A COI is limited to the following categories:

*   A family member or close friend.
*   Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years.
*   A person with the same affiliation.
*   A person involved in an alleged incident of harassment.
*   A PC member who owes the author a favor.
*   A frequent or recent collaborator (within the last 5 years) who you believe cannot objectively review your work.
