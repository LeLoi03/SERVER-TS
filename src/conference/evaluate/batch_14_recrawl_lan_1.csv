*   Cyber attack (e.g., APTs, botnets, DDoS) prevention, detection, investigation, and response
*   Cyber-crime defense and forensics (e.g., anti-phishing, anti-blackmailing, anti-fraud techniques)
*   Integrating security in network protocols (e.g., routing, naming, and management)
*   Mobile and wireless network security
*   Network security policy implementation, deployment, and management
*   Privacy and anonymity in networks and distributed systems
*   Public key infrastructures, key management, certification, and revocation
*   Security and privacy for blockchains and cryptocurrencies
*   Security and privacy of mobile/smartphone platforms
*   Security and privacy of operating systems, hypervisors, and virtual machines
*   Security and privacy of systems based on machine learning, federated learning, AI, and large language models
*   Security for cloud/edge computing
*   Security for cyber-physical systems (e.g., autonomous vehicles, industrial control systems)
*   Security for emerging networks (e.g., smart homes, IoT, body-area networks, VANETs)
*   Security for future Internet architectures and designs (e.g., Software-Defined Networking, Intent-Based Networking)
*   Security for large-scale, critical infrastructures (e.g., electronic voting, smart grid)

*   Trustworthy computing software and hardware to secure networks and systems
*   Usable security and privacy
*   Systematization of knowledge (SoK-papers) are also within scope, provided they offer new insights and compelling evidence.

## Topic Fit

Submissions must have a clear relation to real systems, networks, and their applications. Papers with questionable fit, such as those focused solely on theoretical cryptography without implementation, mathematical proofs without evaluation, or contributions primarily in other fields (e.g., AI, ML) without a security/privacy contribution, may be desk-rejected.

## Review Goals

Reviews aim to provide concrete steps for improving work, distinguish reviewer opinion from demonstrable technical weaknesses, and offer clear citations for novelty claims.

## Paper Formatting

*   **Length:** Not exceeding **13 pages**, excluding the ""Ethics Considerations"" section, references, or appendices.
*   **Size:** US letter size (not A4).
*   **Layout:** Two-column layout.
*   **Font:** Times, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line spacing.
*   **Templates:** Use the [NDSS templates](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2025/submissions/templates/) (2025 templates provided, 2026 templates to be published).
*   **Format:** Must be Portable Document Format (.pdf).
*   **Ethics Considerations:** An optional section can be included immediately preceding the reference section.

## Double and Concurrent Submissions

Technical papers must not substantially overlap with papers published or simultaneously submitted to other venues. Double submissions will lead to immediate rejection.

## Ethical Considerations

Authors may optionally include an ""Ethics Considerations"" section to discuss potential ethical risks and mitigation steps. If a paper involves human subjects, data derived from humans, or might pose risks, authors should discuss ethical and legal concerns, and whether an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval) was conducted. Responsible disclosure plans for high-impact vulnerabilities are encouraged.

## Anonymous Submissions

NDSS Symposium uses a **double-blind reviewing process**. Author names and affiliations must not appear in the paper. Authors should avoid revealing their identities in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data. Prior work must be referenced in the third person or blinded. Submissions violating anonymity will be rejected without review. Advertising results broadly is disallowed.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors and Program Committee members must declare any conflicts of interest (e.g., advisors/advisees, institutional relationships, recent collaborations). PC members with conflicts will be excluded from evaluating the relevant papers. ""Fake conflicts"" are disallowed.

## Use of Generative AI

Generative AI is permitted for paper preparation provided it does not plagiarize or misrepresent content, and authors accept responsibility for veracity. Disclosure is required, commensurate with usage. Specific tools, versions, and prompts should be documented for significant use.",Main link chính xác hơn: https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2026/,88.89

## ""Sustainable and secure networks for distributed AI and compute""

The **11th IEEE International Conference on Network Softwarization (IEEE NetSoft 2025)** will be held from **June 23 to June 27, 2025**, in **Budapest, Hungary**.

NetSoft 2025 addresses advanced research challenges and opportunities in network ""softwarization,"" the transition from legacy network infrastructures and functionalities provided via hardware appliances to new ones provided via software. This is enabled by technologies such as network function virtualization, software-defined networking, and service function chaining.

The conference will feature technical paper presentations, keynotes, panels, tutorials, workshops, demos, posters, and PhD symposiums.
