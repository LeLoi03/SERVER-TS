The 27th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages (COORDINATION 2025) is part of [DisCoTec 2025](https://www.discotec.org/2025).

Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today’s software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, in that they provide abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, therefore increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and ultimately enhancing software development.

## Main Topics

Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) coordination related aspects of:

*   Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: component composition, concurrency, distribution, mobility; dynamic, spatial and probabilistic aspects of coordination; logic, types, semantics.
*   Coordination of multi-agent and collective systems: models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour.
*   Coordination and modern distributed computing: web services, microservices, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing, reversible computing.
*   Session-based programming: models, languages, behavioural types, and tools.
*   Models, languages, verification techniques and tools for interacting smart contracts and (blockchain-based) decentralised applications.
*   Languages, methodologies and tools for secure coordination.
*   Cybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to cybersecurity.
*   Nature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination.
*   Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties, including performance and security aspects.
*   Dynamic software architectures: distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, parallel, high-performance and cloud computing.
*   Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application domains, like IoT, fog- and edge-computing.
*   Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the development and verification of coordinated applications, including DevOps approaches.
*   Coordination in business process management: coordination models for business process management, process mining techniques and tools for coordination models.
*   Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and coordination models, industry-driven efforts in coordination and case studies.
*   Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination.

## Submission Categories

*   **Regular papers** (12-18 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission.
*   **Survey papers** (16-25 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing important results and success stories related to the topics of COORDINATION.
*   **Tool papers** (4-15 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. Tool papers should provide a clear account of the tool’s functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities possibly with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle, and,when applicable, report on realistic case studies (possibly providing a rigorous experimental evaluation). Tool papers may also provide an account of the theoretical foundations, including relevant citations, and present design and implementation concerns, possibly including software architecture and core data structures. Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly describe the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool, possibly providing data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. In addition, the tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation. Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted. The artefact will be evaluated by a dedicated committee. Papers may contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes length.

## Artefact Submission Instructions

We invite you to also submit an associated artefact for evaluation (AE). Artefacts such as ancillary data, tools, and software will be assessed for availability, functionality, and reusability badges.

Instructions on how to upload artefacts can be found [here](/2025/COORDINATION_Artefact_Evaluation_Guidelines.pdf).

As advertised in the call for papers, artefact submissions are mandatory for tool papers and optional for regular papers. Tool papers must submit an artefact that, at least, satisfies the requirements for the Functional badge. Papers not meeting this clause are rejected. Moreover, the acceptance of artefacts is conditional on the tool paper being accepted.

### Submission Process

CSCW 2026 uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: [https://new.precisionconference.com](https://new.precisionconference.com).

Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the SIGCHI Submission and Review Policy.

Authors should adhere to the new ACM policy in authorship, available at [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship).

### Paper Guidelines Regarding Scope

In general, contributions must have a focus on social aspects of technology mediation and be properly contextualized in the CSCW literature.

Authors must make sure that their submission is within the scope of the conference. During the submission, authors will be asked to write a short paragraph explaining how this is the case. Contributions out of scope will be desk rejected.

### Anonymous Review Policy

Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors' names and affiliations removed.

CSCW does not have a policy against uploading preprints to SSRN or arXiv before they are submitted for review at the conference. Nevertheless, to ensure the integrity of the peer review process, we ask that no authors publicize the work until the review process is complete.

### Formatting and Length

*   Word authors: Use the old interim ACM Small template, ONLY available at [https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates)
*   LaTeX authors: Use the template at [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions), and insert the acmsmall call.
*   Overleaf authors: Use the template at [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-journals-new-master-template/vgtfrcvmrvxf), and use the acmsmall call.

Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. If a paper is shorter than 5000 words or exceeds 12,000 words, it will be submitted to additional scrutiny. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be desk rejected.

### Tiered Review Process

CSCW 2026 adopts a tiered review process.

### Reviewer Responsibility

Similar to CSCW 2025, anyone who submits must make themselves available as a reviewer for this CSCW cycle. Authors must volunteer to complete at least 3 reviews for each paper submitted.

### Policy on Use of Large Language Models in Writing Papers

Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) before you use these tools.

### Policy on Irresponsible Reviews

LLMs are NOT allowed to be used for writing the reviews nor the meta-reviews at any step. You cannot use an LLM to write your review.

### Decisions and Deadlines

CSCW will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, roughly 2-4 months from the initial submission (depending on the decision).

### Resubmission of Rejected and Withdrawn Papers

Authors of rejected papers from previous CSCW cycles are allowed to resubmit their papers to the CSCW May 2025 cycle.

### Primary Research Paradigm

When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be asked to indicate the primary research paradigm of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment.

### Open and Transparent Science

Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods.

### Video Figures

Authors may consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission (no more than three minutes long).

### Presenting at the Conference

Accepted papers are invited to present at the corresponding conference, and authors can choose whether or not they wish to present.

This includes the following points related to the use of Generative AI:
    *   “Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work. For example, the authors could include the following statement in the Acknowledgements section of the Work: ChatGPT was utilized to generate sections of this Work, including text, tables, graphs, code, data, citations, etc.). If you are uncertain about the need to disclose the use of a particular tool, err on the side of caution, and include a disclosure in the acknowledgements section of the Work.” - ACM
    *   “The use of artificial intelligence (AI)–generated text in an article shall be disclosed in the acknowledgements section of any paper submitted to an IEEE Conference or Periodical. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.” - IEEE
    *   “If you are using generative AI software tools to edit and improve the quality of your existing text in much the same way you would use a typing assistant like Grammarly to improve spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement or to use a basic word processing system to correct spelling or grammar, it is not necessary to disclose such usage of these tools in your Work.” - ACM

A MICCAI 2025 Workshop

Jointly organized with the [SynthRAD2025 Challenge](https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/)

In conjunction with [MICCAI 2025](https://conferences.miccai.org/2025/en/)

The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) community needs data with known ground truth to develop, evaluate, and validate computerized image analytic tools, as well as to facilitate clinical training. Synthetic data are ideally suited for this purpose. Another motivation to generate synthetic data is to improve the generalizability of deep learning and machine learning algorithms that are affected by domain shift issues.

To generate synthetic data, a full range of models underpinning image simulation and synthesis, also referred to as image translation, cross-modality synthesis, image completion, domain adaptation, etc. have been developed over the years:

*   deep learning methods including fully-supervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, unsupervised, transfer, and multi-task learning
*   deep learning model architectures including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), Flows, Transformers, and etc
*   machine learning methods using hand-crafted features
*   detailed mechanistic models (top–down), which incorporate priors on the geometry and physics of image acquisition and formation processes
*   complex spatio-temporal computational models of anatomical variability, organ physiology, and morphological changes in tissues or disease progression
*   applications of synthetic images including improving image quality, segmentation, tracking, detection, registration, and etc

The goal of the Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging (SASHIMI) workshop is to bring together all those interested in such problems in order to engage in invigorating research, discuss current approaches, and stimulate new ideas and scientific directions in this field. The objectives are to:

*   bring together experts on image synthesis to raise the state of the art
*   hear from invited speakers outside of the MICCAI community, for example in the areas of transfer learning, generative adversarial networks, or variational autoencoders, to cross-fertilize these fields
*   identify challenges and opportunities for further research

We also want to identify the suitable approaches to evaluate the plausibility of synthetic data and to collect benchmark data that could help with the development of future algorithms.

**Keynote Speaker**

Can Zhao, senior research scientist at NVIDIA.

*Keynote title:* MAISI: A Foundation Model for Accelerated, Anatomy-Aware High-Resolution 3D CT Synthesis
