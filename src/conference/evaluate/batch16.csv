We are pleased to announce the 21st edition of the “Robotics: Science and Systems” (RSS) conference, to be held at the **University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA, from June 21 - 25, 2025**.

RSS is a **single-track conference** that connects researchers working on all aspects of robotics, including scientific foundations, mechanisms, algorithms, applications, and analysis of robotic systems. The single-track format allows attendees to learn about state-of-the-art research across all robotics domains. The conference will feature oral and poster presentations of accepted papers, demonstrations, invited talks, and panels.

## Announcement 1: LA Wildfire Support

In response to recent wildfires in Los Angeles, adjustments have been made to the RSS 2025 submission timeline. The abstract/title submission (January 17) and initial paper submission (January 24) deadlines remain unchanged. However, authors can update the PDF of their paper until **January 31, 2025**, which is also the supplementary material deadline. For more details, read the [full announcement](/updates/la-wildfires/).

## Announcement 2: Double Submissions

Submitting an abstract (by January 17) or a semi-complete paper (by January 24) that is currently under submission to another conference (e.g., ICRA, ICLR, CVPR) is considered a double submission and is forbidden by RSS rules. However, if a paper contains substantial innovation compared to the paper under review (qualifying it as a different and novel paper), it may be submitted to RSS.

## Submission Types

*   **Paper Contributions:** We invite submissions of high-quality research papers that introduce new ideas and stimulate future trends in robotics.
*   **Demo Contributions:** Submissions for demos are possible and will include a Demo Track during the main conference. These single-blind submissions can range from early research demos to mature production-ready systems. Open-source and open-access systems or interactive systems accessible to the community are especially encouraged. Demos can relate to hardware or software contributions, their integration, critical system components, and useful tools for the community.

The 31st IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS) is a top-tier conference with a focus on systems with timing requirements. RTAS’25 welcomes papers describing applications, case studies, methodologies, tools, algorithms, operating systems, middleware, or hardware innovations that contribute to the state of the art in the design, implementation, validation, verification, and evolution of systems with timing requirements.

RTAS’25 will be part of the [CPS-IoT Week](https://cps-iot-week2025.ics.uci.edu/) in **Irvine, USA, May 6-9, 2025**.

## Tracks

RTAS’25 consists of two tracks:

*   **Track 1: Systems and Applications**
*   **Track 2: Applied Methodologies and Foundations**

## Scope and Guidelines

To be in scope, papers must explicitly consider at least one of the following:

*   Some kind of timing requirements;
*   Improvements or innovations that directly support the fundamental properties of systems with timing requirements.

### Timing Requirements

The timing requirements of interest are broadly defined and include not only classical hard real-time constraints, but also soft real-time, probabilistic, quality-of-service (QoS), throughput or latency requirements. The authors should specifically state the types of timing-related properties addressed by the contribution(s) presented in their paper.

### Improvements or Innovations to Support Fundamental Properties

Work that supports the design, implementation, validation, or evaluation of deterministic, predictable, dependable, efficient, or next-generation systems with timing requirements are welcome. The authors should specifically state how their work can be used or built upon to ultimately achieve systems with timing requirements beyond the state of the arts.

Application areas can include, but are not limited to: resource-constrained embedded systems, distributed cyber-physical systems (CPS), cloud/edge/fog computing systems, cloud data centers, Internet of Things (IoT), mobile computing, robotics, smart grid, and smart cities, as well as middleware and frameworks, machine learning and signal processing algorithms.

## Peer Review Process

RTAS’25 follows a **double-anonymous peer reviewing process**: author identities and affiliations will not be revealed to reviewers. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a response to reviews before acceptance decisions are made, solely to provide clarifications and correct misconceptions. The response will not allow authors to introduce new material beyond the original submission or promise such material for the camera-ready version.

There will be an **optional artifact evaluation process** for accepted papers that assesses the reproducibility of the work.

## Submission Portal

[Submission Portal](https://rtas25.hotcrp.com/)

## Track 1: Systems and Applications

This track focuses on research of an empirical nature pertaining to (system- or component-) level analysis, optimization, and verification, as well as applications, runtime software, and hardware architectures for systems with timing requirements. Topics relevant to this track include, but are not limited to:

*   Applications with timing requirements
*   Real-time and embedded operating systems
*   Hypervisors and runtime frameworks
*   Hardware architectures, memory hierarchies, FPGAs, GPUs and accelerators
*   Networks with timing requirements
*   CPS/IoT infrastructure
*   Microservice technologies, cloud and edge computing
*   Real-time artificial intelligence and machine learning
*   Application profiling, WCET analysis, compilers, tools, benchmarks and case studies

Papers discussing design and implementation experiences on real industrial systems are especially encouraged. Papers submitted to this track should focus on specific systems and implementations. Authors must include a section with experimental results performed on a real implementation or demonstrate applicability to an industrial case study or working system. The experiment or case study discussions must highlight the key lessons learned. Simulation-based results are acceptable for architectural simulation, or other cases where authors clearly motivate why it is not feasible to develop and evaluate a real system.

Empirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field is also welcome in this track.

## Track 2: Applied Methodologies and Foundations

This track focuses on fundamental models and analysis techniques/methods applicable to systems with timing requirements to solve problems. The track welcomes knowledge-based models, models built from data, as well as a combination, and different types of analysis methods, including analytical, statistical, or probabilistic methods. Topics relevant to this track include, but are not limited to:

*   Modelling languages, modelling methods, model learning, model validation and calibration
*   Scheduling and resource allocation
*   System-level optimization and co-design techniques
*   Design space exploration
*   Verification and validation methodologies

Papers must describe the main context or use case for the proposed methods giving clear motivating examples based on real systems. The system models and any assumptions used in the derivation of the methods must be applicable to real systems and reflect actual needs. Papers must include a section on experimental results, preferably including a case study based on information from a real system. The use of synthetic workloads and models is acceptable if appropriately motivated and used to provide a systematic evaluation.

The IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the field of real-time systems, where researchers and practitioners showcase innovations covering all aspects of real-time systems, including theory, design, analysis, implementation, verification, evaluation, and experience.

## Scope of the Conference

RTSS’25, the 46th edition of the event, continues the tradition of embracing new and emerging areas of real-time systems research. It is an expansive and inclusive event.

## Tracks

RTSS’25 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems theory and practice. Manuscripts may be submitted to either of the following tracks:

### Track 1: Real-Time Systems and Foundations

This track focuses on the practical and theoretical foundations that enable predictable timing in computing systems. This includes core real-time operating systems components, schedulability analysis, scheduling algorithms, theoretical foundations, and verification methods. Topics of interest also cover timing analysis (e.g., WCET analysis), real-time and time-sensitive networking, timing-predictable hardware architectures, modeling and analysis of stochastic real-time systems, fault tolerance, security in relation to timing guarantees, compiler techniques, system synthesis, model-driven engineering, and applied formal methods.

**Artificial Intelligence for Real-Time Systems Foundations:** RTSS invites contributions on the use of AI and machine learning techniques to advance real-time scheduling, timing analysis, resource management, and system optimization under timing constraints.

### Track 2: Design and Applications

This track focuses on real-time systems in a broader systems context, emphasizing novel research on designs, implementations, and applications where real-time requirements are integral. It explores how tools and techniques are adapted and applied to specific application domains.

*   **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS):** Applications in transportation, healthcare, industrial control, etc., that interact closely with the physical world. Topics include enabling technologies, application-specific solutions, design methodologies, tool chains, CPS architectures, secure CPS, performance analysis, robustness, safety, certification, and hardware/software co-design.
*   **Real-Time System Design for Artificial Intelligence:** Practical implementation of AI components in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. Focuses on designing real-time systems to deploy AI under real-time constraints, including system design, frameworks, resource management, hardware acceleration, and AI safety in CPS.
*   **HW-SW Integration and System-Level Design:** Design methodologies and tools for hardware/software integration and co-design in embedded systems. Topics include architecture description languages, hardware architectures, design space exploration, synthesis, optimization, SoC design, FPGA-based simulation, emerging trends like RISC-V, and AI/ML hardware accelerators.
*   **Internet of Things (IoT):** Addressing challenges in IoT with resource constraints, scalability demands, and dynamic environments. Topics include real-time capabilities in IoT, distributed sensing and control, low-latency processing, edge computing, fog computing, and AI-at-the-edge. Emerging areas like 5G/6G for URLLC and in-network computing are also of interest.

## Timing Requirements

To be in scope, ALL submissions must explicitly address some form of real-time requirements / constraints (e.g., deadlines, response-time bounds, tail latencies, statistical notions of timeliness). Submissions must provide a compelling justification if timing-predicability requirements necessitate a nontrivial resource allocation, programming, scheduling, or design approach.

## Surveys and User Studies

Empirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field, using surveys, questionnaires, interviews, use-cases, or other empirical techniques, is also welcome. Literature surveys that solely classify, review, and summarize existing research papers are not in scope.

## Proceedings and Awards

All accepted papers will appear in the main program and proceedings if presented at the conference. Outstanding papers will be recognized. Best paper, best student paper (first author is a student), and best presentation awards will be presented.

## Important Dates

*   **Submission Deadline (firm):** May 22, 2025 (anywhere on Earth)
*   **Author Response Period:** July 14-17, 2025
*   **Author Notification:** July 25, 2025
*   **Camera-Ready Deadline:** September 16, 2025 (tentative)

We are pleased to invite you to submit papers for the **25th International Conference on Runtime Verification (RV25)**, which will take place in **Graz, Austria** from **September 15 to September 19, 2025**.

## Important Dates

*   Paper submission: **June 6, 2025** (updates possible until June 10)
*   Tutorial proposal submission: **June 6, 2025**
*   Notification: **11 July, 2025**
*   Camera-ready: **27 July, 2025**
*   Workshops: **15 September, 2025**
*   Conference: **16-19 September, 2025**

*All deadlines are anywhere on Earth (AoE).* 

## Objectives and Scope

Runtime verification is concerned with the monitoring and analysis of the runtime behavior of software and hardware systems. Runtime verification techniques are crucial for system correctness, reliability, and robustness. They provide an additional level of rigor and effectiveness compared to conventional testing and are generally more practical than exhaustive formal verification.

Runtime verification can be used prior to deployment for testing, verification, and debugging purposes, and after deployment for ensuring reliability, safety, and security, and for providing fault containment and recovery as well as online system repair.

## Topics of Interest

The topics of the conference include, but are not limited to:

*   Specification languages for monitoring
*   Monitor construction techniques
*   Program instrumentation
*   Logging, recording, and replay
*   Combination of static and dynamic analysis
*   Specification mining and machine learning over runtime traces
*   Monitoring techniques for concurrent and distributed systems
*   Runtime checking of privacy and security policies
*   Metrics and statistical information gathering
*   Program/system execution visualization
*   Fault localization, containment, resilience, recovery, and repair
*   Monitoring systems with learning-enabled components
*   Dynamic type checking
*   Runtime verification for autonomy and runtime assurance
*   Runtime verification for assurance cases
*   Out-of-distribution and anomaly detection in ML-based systems
*   Safe reinforcement learning

## Paper Categories

There are four categories of papers that can be submitted:

### Regular Papers

*   **Page Limit:** Up to 16 pages (excluding references).
*   **Content:** Should present original unpublished results. We welcome theoretical papers, system papers, papers describing domain-specific variants of RV, and case studies on runtime verification.
*   The Program Committee of RV 2025 will give a Springer-sponsored **Best Paper Award** to one eligible regular paper.

### Short Papers

*   **Page Limit:** Up to 8 pages (excluding references).
*   **Content:** May present novel but not necessarily thoroughly worked out ideas, for example emerging runtime verification techniques and applications, or techniques and applications that establish relationships between runtime verification and other domains.

### Tool Demonstration Papers

*   **Page Limit:** Up to 8 pages (excluding references).
*   **Content:** Should present a new tool, a new tool component, or novel extensions to existing tools supporting runtime verification.
*   The paper must include information on tool availability, maturity, and selected experimental results, and it should provide a link to a website containing the theoretical background and user guide.
