We encourage papers that bridge research in different communities. We also welcome experience papers that clearly articulate lessons learnt.

## Types of Submissions Solicited

We invite full papers for submission that present novel and mature research results. Full papers are limited to **20 pages** in Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and appendices.

Papers that do not follow these formatting guidelines may be rejected without review.

While we do not accept short papers, we encourage authors to submit a poster instead, presenting original, still ongoing work that has not yet reached the maturity required for a full paper. For more information, please refer to the Call for Posters.

## Submission Guidelines

DIMVA 2025 will adopt a **double-blind reviewing process**. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations must be excluded from the paper. Furthermore, authors should avoid obvious self-references, and should cite their own previous work in third person, whenever necessary. Papers that are not properly anonymized risk being rejected without review.

Submissions must be original work and may not be under submission to another venue at the time of review. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to physically present the submitted work at the conference, for the paper to be included in the proceedings.

Authors are encouraged to submit code appropriately anonymized, using, e.g., [https://anonymous.4open.science/](https://anonymous.4open.science/).

## Ethical Considerations

Submissions that report experiments with data gathered from human subjects should disclose whether the research received approval from an institutional ethics review board (IRB), if applicable, and what measures were adopted to minimize risks to privacy.

Submissions that describe experiments related to vulnerabilities in software or systems should discuss the steps taken to avoid negatively affecting any third-parties (e.g., in case of probing of network devices), and how the authors plan to responsibly disclose the vulnerabilities to the appropriate software or system vendors or owners before publication.

If you have any questions, please contact the program chairs at [pc-chairs@dimva.org](mailto:pc-chairs@dimva.org).

The 18th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL 2024) invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research on Natural Language Processing (NLP). EACL 2024 was held in Malta on **March 17th-22nd, 2024**, with online attendance possible.

## Submission

Papers must be submitted via ARR at this link: [https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2023/October](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2023/October)

If you have already submitted to one of the earlier ARR deadlines, those submissions are also eligible, and you do not need to resubmit.

For paper commitment, we accept commitments from papers submitted and reviewed via ARR in the October 2023 cycle or earlier. If you opt to commit the papers to EACL 2024, please submit via the [link](https://openreview.net/group?id=eacl.org/EACL/2024/Conference).

## Important Dates

For paper submission EACL 2024 will use the [ACL Rolling Review (ARR)](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) system only. This is the case for all *ACL conferences in 2024. ARR works on a two-monthly review cycle, beginning on the 15th of every other month. The “paper submission deadline” shown below is the latest date that new papers can be submitted to ARR and be reviewed in time to be considered by EACL 2024; however, papers submitted in previous ARR rounds can of course also be considered. The “paper commitment deadline” is the date by which authors must choose, based on the reviews so far, whether to “commit” their ARR papers to be considered by EACL 2024. Papers that are committed but not accepted for EACL 2024 are not lost - they remain available in the standard ARR cycle for revision and resubmission and/or commitment to other future conferences as before.

The authors should contact ARR with any questions about the review process etc., on editors@aclrollingreview.org.

As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be for papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.

*   Anonymity period begins: Friday, 15 September 2023
*   Paper submission deadline (via ARR): Sunday, 15 October 2023
*   Author discussion period: Thursday-Tuesday, 23-28 November 2023
*   Paper commitment deadline: Wednesday, 20 December 2023
*   Notification of acceptance (long & short papers): Wednesday, 17 January 2024
*   Withdrawal deadline (long & short papers): Monday, 22 January 2024
*   Camera-ready papers due (long & short papers): Friday, 2 February 2024
*   Workshops & Tutorials: Sunday; Thu-Fri, 17 & 21-22 March 2024
*   Main Conference: Monday-Wed, 18-20 March 2024
*   All deadlines are 11.59 pm UTC -12h (“anywhere on Earth”).

### Long Papers

Long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Long papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references and appendices. Upon acceptance, long papers will be given one additional page of content (i.e. up to 9 pages) in the proceedings so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.

### Short Papers

Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead, short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Short papers may consist of up to 4 pages of content, plus unlimited references and appendices. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given one additional page of content (i.e. up to 5 pages) in the proceedings so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.

### Findings of the ACL

Papers submitted to EACL 2024, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics. Acceptance notifications for the main track and Findings will come out simultaneously.

### Presentation Mode

Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters, as determined by the program committee based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and as posters. Papers accepted to the Findings of the ACL may present a poster.

### Presentation Requirements

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference—either online or in-person—in order to appear in the proceedings. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at EACL 2024 must notify the program chairs by the withdrawal deadline if they wish to withdraw the paper. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for EACL 2024 by the early registration deadline.

### Paper Submission and Anonymity

Following standard ACL and ARR policy, submitted papers must be prepared for two-way anonymized review, and no deanonymized preprint may be posted in the month prior to submission. Please see the [ARR CfP](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) for more detail.

### Policies on Authorship, Citation and Ethics

EACL 2024 follows the ARR policies on authorship, citation and comparison and ethics - please see the [ARR CfP](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp).

### Multiple Submission Policy

EACL 2024 follows the ARR policy on multiple submission: we will not consider any paper that is under review in a journal or another conference at the time of submission, and submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere during the review period. See the [ARR CfP](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) for more detail. Please note that the EACL 2024 submission deadline is currently timed to come after EMNLP 2023 decisions have been announced, and that EACL 2024 acceptance decisions will be announced before the likely submission deadline for ACL 2024, although after that for NAACL 2024.

### Mandatory Discussion of Limitations

We believe that it is also important to discuss the limitations of your work, in addition to its strengths. Following EACL 2023, EACL 2024 requires all papers to have a clear discussion of limitations, in a dedicated section titled “Limitations”. This section will appear at the end of the paper, after the discussion/conclusions section and before the references, and will not count towards the page limit. Papers without a limitations section will be automatically rejected without review. Papers resubmitted from previous ARR review rounds that did not include a limitations section must ensure that such a section is included in the EACL 2024 version.

While we are open to different types of limitations, just mentioning that a set of results have been shown for English only probably does not reflect what we expect. Mentioning that the method works mostly for languages with limited morphology, like English, is a much better alternative. In addition, limitations such as low scalability to long text, the requirement of large GPU resources, or other things that inspire further investigation are welcome.

The 45th International Conference on Formal Techniques for Distributed Objects, Components, and Systems (FORTE 2025) is a forum for fundamental research on theory, models, tools, and applications for distributed systems. It is one of the three conferences of DisCoTec 2025, the 20th International Federated Conference on Distributed Computing Techniques.

FORTE 2025 invites submissions focused on foundational aspects of distributed software systems, presenting approaches or tools to formally model, soundly implement, and rigorously validate these systems.

## Topics of Interest

The main topics of interest include:

*   Language concepts for concurrency and distribution, supported by rigorous semantics, well-supported pragmatics, and/or expressive illustrative use-cases.
*   Analyses techniques, methodologies, and/or algorithms, using testing and/or verification, to validate (aspects of) the soundness of various types of concurrent and distributed systems, including communication and network protocols, service-oriented systems, adaptive distributed systems, cyber-physical systems and sensor networks.
*   Principles for qualitative and quantitative security analysis of distributed systems.
*   Applications of formal methods and techniques for studying the quality, reliability, availability, and safety of concrete distributed systems. We are specially interested in “real-life” case studies and industrial applications involving real distributed systems.
*   Emerging challenges and hot topics in distributed systems (broadly construed), such as software-defined networks, distributed ledgers, smart contracts, and blockchain technologies, etc.

## Submission Categories

*   **Regular papers** (7-15 pages, not counting references): Describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission.
*   **Tool papers** (7-15 pages, not counting references): Describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of FORTE. The paper should present the underlying theory of the tool, a clear account of the tool’s functionality and limitations, and include case studies (with rigorous experimental evaluation). In addition, the tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation. Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted. The artefact will be evaluated by a dedicated committee. The paper must contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes, to be submitted until a week after the paper submission deadline.
*   **Short papers** (up to 6 pages, not counting references): Describing innovative and promising ideas, possibly in an early form, or demonstrating new tools (components), or presenting (i) calls to action, or (ii) substantiated reflections on current and/or future research perspectives related to FORTE, or a summary of a published journal paper clarifying why the presentation would enrich the program of FORTE.

## Artefact Submission

We invite you to also submit an associated artefact for evaluation (AE). Artefacts such as ancillary data, tools, and software will be assessed for availability, functionality, and reusability badges.

Instructions on how to upload artefacts can be found [here](/2025/FORTE_Artefact_Evaluation_Guidelines.pdf).

Artefact submissions are mandatory for tool papers and optional for regular papers. Tool papers must submit an artefact that, at least, satisfies the requirements for the Functional badge. Papers not meeting this clause are rejected. Moreover, the acceptance of artefacts is conditional on the tool paper being accepted.

Choose the “FORTE 2025 Artefact Evaluation” track in EasyChair when submitting your artefact.

## Publication

The FORTE proceedings will be published by Springer as LNCS-IFIP volume 15732 and will comprise accepted submissions from all categories.

## Special Issue

Selected papers will be invited to a special issue of Logical Methods in Computer Science.

## Instructions for Authors

*   Submissions must be at most **30 pages** excluding any auxiliary supporting material, and using the **Springer LNCS format** (do not modify the LNCS default font sizes or margins). Details on the Springer LNCS format can be obtained [here](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).
*   Submissions should be processed in LaTeX.
*   All submissions must have page numbers (e.g., using LaTeX command `\pagestyle{plain}`).
*   Submissions must be submitted electronically in PDF format.
*   All submissions will be blind-refereed and thus must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references.
*   Submissions should begin with a title, a short abstract, and a list of keywords, followed by an introduction, a main body, an appendix (if any), and references, within 30 pages. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at the level understandable for a non-expert reader.
*   Optionally, authors can append a clearly-marked auxiliary supporting material to the submission. The auxiliary supporting material has no prescribed form or page limit and might be used, for instance, to provide program code, additional experimental data, etc. Alternatively, the auxiliary supporting material can be submitted as a separate file from the submission. The reviewers are not required to read the auxiliary supporting material and submissions should be intelligible without it. The final published version of an accepted paper is expected to closely match the submitted 30 pages.
*   Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

For papers that are accepted, the length of the proceedings version will be at most 30 pages using Springer’s standard fonts, font sizes, and margins.

The proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series and will be available at the conference. Authors of accepted papers must complete the IACR copyright assignment form for their work to be published in the proceedings. Moreover, authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference and agree that the presentations will be video recorded during the event. The camera-ready version of the accepted articles will be automatically uploaded to the IACR ePrint server.

Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere or has submitted in parallel to a journal or any other conference/workshop that has proceedings. Accepted submissions may not appear in any other conference or workshop that has proceedings. IACR reserves the right to share information about submissions with other program committees to detect parallel submissions and the [IACR policy on irregular submissions](https://iacr.org/docs/irregular.pdf) will be strictly enforced.

Articles will not be reviewed by reviewers who have a conflict of interest with at least one author of the submission. Submissions must adhere to the IACR Policy on Conflicts of Interest.

The Program Committee may select a paper for the best paper award.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors, program committee members, and reviewers must follow the [IACR Policy on Conflicts of Interest](https://www.iacr.org/docs/).

In particular, the authors of each submission are asked during the submission process to identify all members of the Program Committee who have an automatic conflict of interest (COI) with the submission. A reviewer1 has an automatic COI with an author if:

*   one is or was the thesis advisor to the other, no matter how long ago;
*   they shared an institutional affiliation within the prior two years2;
*   they published two or more jointly authored works in the last three years3; or
*   they are immediate family members4

A reviewer has an automatic COI with a submission if:

*   the reviewer has an automatic COI with any of its authors;
*   the reviewer is authoring a paper (in submission5 or in preparation) whose content substantially overlaps with that of the submission;
*   the reviewer has made a contribution to the submission (i.e. the submission is the result of a collaboration that did not result in the reviewer's authorship)

Any further COIs of importance should be separately disclosed. It is the responsibility of all authors to ensure correct reporting of COI information. Submissions with incorrect or incomplete COI information may be rejected without consideration of their merits.

COIs are not restricted to automatic ones, others being possible. COIs beyond automatic COIs could involve financial, intellectual, or personal interests. Examples include closely related technical work, cooperation in the form of joint projects or grant applications, business relationships, close personal friendships, instances of personal enmity. Full transparency is of utmost importance, authors and reviewers must disclose to the chairs or editor any circumstances that they think may create bias, even if it does not raise to the level of a COI. The editor or program chairs will decide if such circumstances should be treated as a COI."

The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM) is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). ISAIM 2026 will be the nineteenth symposium in the series, sponsored by Florida Atlantic University, and held **January 7-9, 2026 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida**.

We seek submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled lessons learned from the development of the application. Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day Symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions.

Work that will have been published as of January 2026 should not be submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the previously published work. However, the ISAIM website proceedings are not archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review elsewhere at the time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM.

Authors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in an archival special volume of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and unpublished to be considered for the special volume.

## Submission Format, Length, and Platform

We adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow.

Please prepare your submission for review in a single column format, using the latest templates: [Word Submission Template](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx), or the [LaTeX template](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-latex) using  `\documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart}`

Papers are of variable length. Paper length must be proportional to its contribution. We encourage authors to stay within a 10,000 word limit. Authors of papers exceeding 12,000 words should add a note at the end of their manuscript explaining how the length of the paper is commensurate with the contribution of the work.

All materials must be submitted electronically to the Precision Conference Submission (PCS) Portal (<https://new.precisionconference.com/>).

In PCS, first click “Submissions” at the top of the page, from the dropdown menus for Society, Conference, and Track, please select “SIGCHI”, “IUI 2026”, and “IUI 2026 Papers”, respectively, and then press “Go”.

## Publication and Open Access

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library.

Starting January 1, 2026, ACM will fully transition to Open Access. All ACM publications, including those from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be 100% Open Access. Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs).

To find out whether an APC applies to your article, please consult the list of participating institutions in ACM Open and review the APC Waivers and Discounts Policy. 

Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC to publish their papers, unless they qualify for a financial or discretionary waiver. ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more time for institutions to join ACM Open. The subsidy will offer:

*   $250 APC for ACM/SIG members
*   $350 for non-members

PLDI is the premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research, covering design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance.","# PLDI 2025: Call for Papers

PACMPL Issue PLDI 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages research, broadly construed, including design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance. Authors of papers published in PACMPL Issue PLDI 2025 will be invited – but not required – to present their work in the PLDI conference in June 2025, which is sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN.

## Scope

PLDI is a premier forum for programming language research, broadly construed. Outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing is welcome. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all in scope for PLDI.

## Evaluation Criteria and Process

Reviewers will evaluate submissions for accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. Submissions should be organized to communicate clearly to a broad programming-language audience as well as experts on the paper’s topics. Papers should identify what has been accomplished and how it relates to previous work. Authors of empirical papers are encouraged to consider the seven categories of the SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines when preparing submissions.

The selection of papers will be made in two rounds of reviewing. In the first round, reviewers will assess the papers according to the quality criteria listed above. Authors will be given several days to compose a written response to the reviews received in the first round – e.g., to correct errors and clarify technical concerns. At the end of the first round, the Review Committee will conditionally accept a subset of the submissions and all other submissions will be rejected. In the second round, authors of conditionally-accepted papers will be given an opportunity to improve specific aspects of the research and the paper, as identified by the reviewers. Authors will have sufficient time to perform the required revisions and re-submit the paper. The same reviewers as in the first round will then assess how the revision requests have been acted upon by the authors. Revisions that fail to adequately address the reviewers’ original concerns will result in rejection.

The Review Committee will make final decisions regarding (conditional) acceptance and rejection, although reviews for a given paper will typically be performed by a subset of the committee. During the review period, authors must not contact Review Committee members – all questions must be addressed to the Associate Editor (who is doing the job that we would have called “Program Chair” before PLDI joined PACMPL). Contacting Review Committee members about submitted paper(s) is an ethical violation and may be grounds for summary rejection.

Deadlines and formatting requirements, detailed below, will be strictly enforced, with extremely rare extenuating circumstances considered at the discretion of the Associate Editor.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

Author names and affiliations must be omitted from submissions. If a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. These are firm submission requirements. The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing.

The [FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2025-papers#FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing) clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios.

## Submission Site Information

The submission site will be at [https://pldi2025.hotcrp.com](https://pldi25.hotcrp.com).

Authors can submit multiple times prior to the (firm!) deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no deadline for submitting abstracts. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Associate Editor (as this kind of change potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts during paper assignment).

The submission deadline is **11:59PM on Thursday November 14, 2024 anywhere on earth:**

## Declaring Conflicts

When submitting a paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).

## Formatting Requirements

Each paper should have no more than **20 pages of text**, excluding bibliography, using the ACM Proceedings format. This format is chosen for compatibility with PACMPL. It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent PLDI page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall. Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection. PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the [SIGPLAN author information page](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/). Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option. We also strongly encourage use of the review and screen options as well.

Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers may use either the author-year or numeric format for citations. Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Please take care to ensure that figures and tables are legible, even when the paper is printed in gray-scale. Papers that exceed the length requirement, deviate from the expected format, or are submitted late will be rejected.

## Supplementary Material

Authors are welcome to provide supplementary material if that material supports the claims in the paper. Such material may include proofs, experimental results, and/or data sets. This material should be uploaded at the same time as the submission. Reviewers are not required to examine the supplementary material but may refer to it if they would like to find further evidence supporting the claims in the paper.

Supplemental material cannot be included in the main submission text. All appendices must be submitted as supplemental material, not as part of the main submission PDF.

## Plagiarism and Concurrent Work

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere, as described by the [SIGPLAN Republication Policy](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/) and [ACM Policy on Plagiarism](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism). Concurrent submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar venues of publication are disallowed. Prior work must, as always, be cited and referred to in the third person even if it is the authors’ own work, so as to preserve author anonymity. If you have further questions, please contact the Associate Editor.

## Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. At artifact submission time, authors will be asked to provide an artifact availability statement that details the expected behavior of the artifact, and how it pertains to the results of the paper. Artifact submission is voluntary but encouraged and will not influence the final decision regarding the papers.

Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a badge printed on the papers themselves, and include the artifact availability statement (which will not count agains the page limit). Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their artifacts publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.

## Open Access and Copyright

As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support liberal open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license, which grants readers (re-)use rights.

Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide an ORCID for each co-author and choose one of the following publication rights:

*   Author licenses the work with a Creative Commons license, retains copyright, and (implicitly) grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice).
*   Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license.
*   Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license.
*   Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.

These choices follow from ACM Copyright Policy and ACM Author Rights, corresponding to ACM’s “author pays” option. While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication. PACMPL and SIGPLAN continue to explore the best models for funding open access, focusing on approaches that are sustainable in the long-term while reducing short-term risk.

## Publication Date

All papers will be archived by the ACM Digital Library. Authors will have the option of including supplementary material with their paper. The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library or the first day of the conference, which ever is sooner. Note that the date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## Presentations

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work at PLDI. Authors who need financial assistance for travel to the conferences should apply for a grant from the [SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (PAC) program](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/PAC/). We welcome all authors, regardless of nationality. If authors are not able to obtain visas to travel to the conference despite making reasonable effort, we will make arrangements to facilitate remote participation or presentation by another attendee on behalf of the authors.

## Distinguished Paper Awards

Up to 10% of the accepted papers may be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee believes should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity. The set of distinguished papers will be chosen through a rigorous review process of the final papers, carried out by a subset of the Review Committee.

## Code of Conduct

PLDI follows the [ACM Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment). Please familiarize yourself with the policy and guide for reporting unacceptable behavior.

We welcome submissions addressing topics across the full spectrum of Agile software development, broadly on Agile, and on issues of concern to researchers or practitioners (or both).

**Submit here:** [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=xp2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=xp2025)

## Formatting

All submissions must be formatted according to the Springer LNCS/LNBIP conference proceedings template (for LaTeX and Word), available [here](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

## Review Criteria

The XP 2025 main conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP) as Open Access. Submissions will be screened on rigor and relevance and then evaluated by at least three program committee members based on soundness, significance, novelty, verifiability, and presentation quality.

XP 2025 adopts a Single-Blind Review process: authors are unaware of the reviewers’ identities, while reviewers know the authors. This means that you don’t need to anonymize the authors and affiliations in the paper.

## Note: Open Access Pricing – Article Processing Charges (APCs)

ACM has migrated their publication process to an open access licensing structure. SIG members that are affiliated with, and publishing under the support of an Open ACM Member Institution can do so free of charge. Note, abstracts, which are ACM formatted documents up to 2 pages, have no publishing fee. If your institution is not part of the OpenACM program and your submission is more than 2 pages when formatted there will be a publishing fee:

### From ACM regarding Open Access Pricing (APC Fees)

The pricing below is valid for all hybrid and gold open access publications for conferences scheduled in 2026:

*   **ACM Proceedings Article**
    *   List Price: $350*
    *   ACM/ SIG Member Price: $250*
    *   Open ACM Member Institution: FREE
*   **ACM Proceedings “Abstract” (up to 2 pages)**
    *   FREE
    *   FREE
    *   FREE

### Important update on ACMs new open access publishing model for 2026 ACM Conferences!

Starting January 1, 2026, ACM will fully transition to Open Access. All ACM publications, including those from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be 100% Open Access. Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs). With over 1,800 institutions already part of ACM Open, the majority of ACM-sponsored conference papers will not require APCs from authors or conferences (currently, around 70-75%).

Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC to publish their papers, unless they qualify for a financial or discretionary waiver. To find out whether an APC applies to your article, please consult the list of participating institutions in ACM Open and review the APC Waivers and Discounts Policy. Keep in mind that waivers are rare and are granted based on specific criteria set by ACM.

Understanding that this change could present financial challenges, ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more time for institutions to join ACM Open. The subsidy will offer:

*   $250 APC for ACM/SIG members
*   $350 for non-members

This represents a 65% discount, funded directly by ACM. Authors are encouraged to help advocate for their institutions to join ACM Open during this transition period."
