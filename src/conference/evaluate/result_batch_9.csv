## Double Blind Reviewing

Submissions will be double blind. Having papers on arXiv is allowed.

ICLR uses [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2025/Conference) to host papers and allow for public discussions.

Authors can revise their paper as many times as needed up to the paper submission deadline. Changes to the paper will not be allowed while the paper is being reviewed. During the discussion phase, edits will again be allowed; a `pdfdiff` will be done against the submission at the paper submission deadline. Area chairs and reviewers reserve the right to ignore changes that are significant from the original scope of the paper.

## Submission Instructions

Authors must submit paper abstracts by the **abstract submission deadline of September 27, 2024**. No changes on the authors and their orders can be made after the abstract submission deadline. Also, please make sure that all authors have an OpenReview profile with the latest information. Abstracts submitted by the abstract submission deadline must be genuine; placeholder or duplicate abstracts will be removed.

The full paper submission deadline is **October 1, 2024 11:59pm AOE**. Abstracts and papers must be submitted using the conference submission system at: [https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2025/Conference). The submission site will be open on September 13, 2024. Supplementary material is due at the same time as the main paper.

## Paper Length

The main text must be between 6 and 10 pages (inclusive). This limit will be strictly enforced. Papers with main text on the 11th page will be desk rejected. The page limit applies to both the initial and final camera ready version.

The list of references does not count towards the page limit, and unlimited additional pages are allowed for the bibliography/references.

Authors may use as many pages of appendices (after the bibliography) as they wish, but reviewers are not required to read the appendix.

## Style Files and Templates

To prepare your submission to ICLR 2025, please use the LaTeX style files provided at: [https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2025.zip](https://github.com/ICLR/Master-Template/raw/master/iclr2025.zip)

## Reviewing Process

Submissions to ICLR are uploaded on OpenReview, which enables public discussion. Official reviews are anonymous and publicly visible. 

Full reviews are posted by Nov 12.

## Reciprocal Reviewing Requirement

All authors who are on 3 or more papers must serve as a reviewer for at least 6 papers. Authors in this category that fail to finish reviews by rebuttal stage may have their paper submissions desk rejected. Authors are exempt from the reviewing requirement if they are serving as an AC, SAC, or another organizing chair for ICLR 2025.

All submissions must have at least one author who is registered to review at least 3 papers.

All authors will be notified to register as reviewers after the abstract deadline. If none of the authors are registered as a reviewer, it will result in desk rejection for the paper. The program chairs may grant exceptions on a case-by-case basis.

## Code of Conduct & Ethics

All ICLR participants, including authors, are required to adhere to the ICLR code of conduct ([https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfConduct](https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfConduct)) and the ICLR Code of Ethics ([https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfEthics](https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfEthics)).

## Dual Submission Policy

Submissions that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to this or other conferences or journals, are not allowed.
Submission of the paper to archival repositories such as arXiv is allowed during the review period.

## The Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)

The use of LLMs is allowed as a general-purpose assist tool. Authors and reviewers should understand that they take full responsibility for the contents written under their name, including content generated by LLMs that could be construed as plagiarism or scientific misconduct. LLMs are not eligible for authorship.

## Withdrawal Policy

Authors have the right to withdraw papers from consideration at any time until paper notification. Before the paper submission deadline, if an author withdraws the paper it will be deleted from the OpenReview hosting site. However, note that after the paper submission deadline, if an author chooses to withdraw a submission, it will remain hosted by OpenReview in a publicly visible ""withdrawn papers"" section. Withdrawn papers will be de-anonymized immediately."

Traditionally, ICRA covers all areas of robotics research. Check the ICRA keywords [here](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.ieee-ras.org/conferences-workshops/fully-sponsored/icra/keywords__;!!DZ3fjg!7azbR7XjKgBx1OmbmUmGwkG3z6zbDHJ876mSfMlOPccKdT3cFaAZeq220xtwP0cSJY1etMJWNQidY1-Qr5gjfxYup1CLBw$) to see if your paper fits the conference.

## FAQ

*   The ICRA review process is double-anonymous (both reviewers and authors stay anonymous).
*   The allowed paper length is 6+2, meaning 6 pages for the paper content, plus two additional pages for the references. Any supplementary material must fit within the 6 regular pages. A video attachment is possible.
*   There is no plan to extend the paper submission deadline.
*   You can include URLs (not links embedded in the pdf), but you should not expect that reviewers will look at those links, or that they will influence the review process. Beyond the submitted paper and the (optional) supplementary video, reviewers are not required to look at any other material when writing their reviews.
*   IEEE supports the evolutionary publication paradigm. Therefore, papers, which previously have been published at a workshop without formal/peer reviewed proceedings, can be submitted to ICRA.
*   If you want to transfer an accepted paper from one of the journals T-ASE, T-FR, or RA-P to ICRA, the paper should be submitted in paperplaza in the relevant submission category of ICRA. Do not submit it as a regular ICRA paper! For the paper upload, you will need to enter a code, which can be obtained from the Editor-In-Chief of the journal."

## Open Science Principles

ICSA encourages authors to follow the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. Accepted research papers are expected to be accompanied by an artifact that will be evaluated in the [Artifacts Evaluation track](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icsa-2026/icsaartifacts+evaluation+track2026).

For submission of research papers, authors are expected to submit an anonymized draft of the artifact. If authors are unable to submit an artifact draft, they are asked to comment in their submitted paper on why this is not possible, practical, or desirable.

## Submission

We solicit the submission of technical research papers that describe original and significant results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, or experimental work in software architecture.

*   Submissions must conform to the IEEE paper formatting and submission instructions.
*   Submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two additional pages containing only references are permitted.
*   Submissions must conform to the [IEEE author instructions](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) as well as to the [IEEE Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Text](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/#maincontent).
*   ICSA 2026 will pursue a double-blind review process for technical research papers only, therefore all technical research paper submissions have to fulfill the double-blind reviewing requirements.
*   All papers are to be submitted electronically via the [EasyChair submission system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsa2026) by the submission deadline and must not have been published before or be submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration at ICSA.

## Publication

All accepted technical research papers will be published in the ICSA 2026 main proceedings and appear in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library.

The authors of submissions that are rejected as technical research papers may be invited to submit a short paper (up to 8 pages including references) or a poster (poster presented at the conference + up to 4 pages (including references) describing their research. Short papers and poster summaries (up to 4 pages) will be published in the ICSA 2026 companion proceedings.

Note that at least one author of an accepted contribution is required to register and present the work at the conference. An in-person presentation is required.

*   Helpful information for paper formatting for MS Word can be found [here](Helpful information for paper formatting for MS Word can be found here.).
*   There is a community provided LaTeX template: the CTAN package iaria (with full IARIA formatting rules, including IARIA citation style, but for providing citation style it is tightly bound to pdflatex+biblatex+biber). In addition, there is also iaria-lite (not bound to pdflatex+biblatex+biber, but compatible with any TeX stack; thus, it cannot provide the IARIA citation formattings, but only the titlepage and content-related IARIA formatting rules). Based on the iaria package, there is a minimal working example as Overleaf template. When you are using the LaTeX templates, please still adhere to the additional editorial rules.
*   Slides-based contributions can use the corporate/university format and style.
*   Your paper should also comply with the additional editorial rules.

## Publication

Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions to one of the IARIA Journals.

ICSME 2025 will use a double anonymous reviewing process. Submitted papers must adhere to the following rules:

*   Author names and affiliations must be omitted. (The track co-chairs will check compliance before reviewing begins.)
*   References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person. (For example, instead of “We build on our previous work…”, use “We build on the work of…”).
*   The title of the submission must be different from the authors’ preprints on arXiv or similar sites. Authors must not publicly use the submission title during the review period.
*   Please see more information regarding the double-anonymous review: [https://icsme.github.io/faq_double_blind.html](https://icsme.github.io/faq_double_blind.html)

### Formatting Guidelines

*   Papers must strictly adhere to the two-column IEEE conference proceedings format. Please use the templates available here. LaTeX users should use the following configuration: `\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}`. Microsoft Word users should use the US Letter format template.
*   Papers must not exceed 10 pages (including figures and appendices) plus up to 2 pages that contain ONLY references.
*   All submissions must be in PDF and must be submitted online by the deadline via the ICSME 2025 EasyChair link.
*   All authors, reviewers, and organizers are expected to uphold the IEEE Code of Conduct.

## Special Issue

Authors of select papers from the research track will be invited to submit extended versions of their work to a special issue of the Springer International Journal of Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE). Invited papers will be expected to comply with the standard guidelines when publishing an extended version of a paper, including the addition of about 30% new material.

## Author Response Period

As in 2024, ICSME 2025 will offer an author response period. During this period, the authors will have the opportunity to inspect the reviews and answer specific questions raised by the program committee. This period is scheduled after all reviews have been completed and discussed, to inform the subsequent decision-making process. Authors will be able to see the full reviews, including the reviewer scores as part of the author response process.

### Early Decisions

As in 2024, ICSME 2025 will make early decisions: If reviewers already decide that a paper can be accepted in its current state without requiring any further input from the authors, the authors will receive an “Accept” decision at the beginning of the author response period and will not be required to submit a response. Conversely, if the paper is perceived to be in a highly deficient state by the reviewers, leading them to conclude that the authors’ response is unlikely to alter their evaluation significantly, the authors will receive a “Reject” decision at the beginning of the author response period and will not be asked to submit a response. All other papers will receive a “Response Recommended” notification at the beginning of the author response period. However, as customary, it is still up to the authors to decide if they want to submit an author response.

This approach ensures that author responses are primarily reserved for cases with some controversy or where the reviewers have specific and pertinent inquiries to be addressed.

## Publication and Presentation

Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings and submitted for inclusion in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper at the conference. Failure of at least one author to register by the early registration date will result in the paper being withdrawn from the conference proceedings.

## Open Science Policy

ICSME encourages open science. Sharing of data sets, replication packages, or preprints is expected to be the default, and non-sharing needs to be justified, for example, in the case of industry data subject to confidentiality issues or legal requirements.

Authors of papers accepted into ICSME 2025 will be invited to submit their artifacts to the Artifact Evaluation Track.

**The submission deadline has been extended by one week.**

ICSOC, the International Conference on Service-Oriented Computing, is the premier international forum for academics, industry researchers, developers, and practitioners to report and share groundbreaking work in service-oriented computing. ICSOC fosters cross-community scientific excellence by gathering experts from various disciplines, such as services science, data science, management science, business-process management, distributed systems, wireless and mobile computing, cloud and edge computing, cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things (IoT), scientific workflows, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and services and software engineering.

ICSOC provides a premier international forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further our knowledge and understanding of the various aspects (e.g., application and system aspects) related to Service Computing and identify research challenges in new research areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, IoT, and emerging technologies including quantum computing.

ICSOC 2025, the 23rd event in this series, will take place in **Shenzhen, China, from 1 to 4 December 2025**.

## Submissions / Review Model

*   **Early submissions:** Authors are invited to consider early submissions (deadline **May 9, 2025**). In the early submission round, only papers submitted as full/regular papers will be considered, and they will go through a full peer-review process. An early submitted paper that is accepted will be included in the proceedings. An early submitted paper that is rejected can be still revised and submitted to the normal submission round by the given deadline. If the authors of an early submitted paper that is rejected decide to resubmit their paper to the normal submission round, they will have to include an appendix (maximum 2 pages) describing how they have addressed the comments received by the reviewers from the early submission.
*   **Regular submissions:** Authors are welcome to submit papers to the regular submission round by the given deadline. To do so, they need to submit an abstract by **July 14, 2025** (MANDATORY). After the regular submission deadline, the papers resubmitted from the early submission round and those submitted only to the regular submission round will undergo the same review process as other submissions. The decisions made from this regular review procedure will be final, and no resubmission will be permitted afterwards.
*   **Industrial papers:** We also invite submissions from industry practitioners and from researchers engaged in industry-relevant applications. Industrial papers should clearly highlight practical applications, insights, and real-world experiences. They will be reviewed with an emphasis on relevance, innovation, and applicability.
*   **Anonymous submissions:** ICSOC implements a double-blind reviewing process. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper. Authors' prior work should be referred to in the third person. Submissions that violate these requirements will be desk rejected without review. The list of authors cannot be changed after the acceptance decision is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.

It should be noted that unformatted papers and papers beyond the page limit will be desk rejected without reviewing.

The submission procedure is initiated through the following URL: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsoc2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icsoc2025)

## Important dates

*   **Early paper submissions due:** May 9, 2025
*   **Regular paper abstract submissions due:** July 14, 2025 (MANDATORY)
*   **Regular and industrial paper submissions due:** July 21, 2025
*   **Final notification to authors:** September 15, 2025

No papers would be accepted unless they clearly illustrate the contribution to the ICSOC areas of interest. Failure to provide such information can result in desk rejection.

## Reproducibility Certification

Research reproducibility is essential for scientific integrity and further scientific discovery. At ICSOC, we promote rigorous evaluation and sharing of data, code, and methodologies to enhance the credibility and impact of scientific contributions. Authors are urged to publicly share all research artifacts such as datasets, source code, and supplementary materials as part of their submission. To encourage reproducibility, ICSOC incorporates formal verification into its review process and introduces the respective badges. During paper submission, authors are requested to provide the Artifact Availability and Reproducibility Statement, which will be taken into account by the reviewers. Moreover, all accepted papers will be invited to be considered under the Artifact Evaluation track, to undergo a rigorous formal process of verifying the reproducibility of the results. Participating papers that successfully pass this process will get either Open Artifacts or Verified Artifacts badge.

## Paper Submission

Papers should be formatted according to Springer's LNCS Formatting Guidelines. Submissions must be in English and must not exceed 15 pages. All papers must be submitted electronically to the Conference Submission System. Each paper must be submitted on or before the provided deadlines. Authors are kindly invited to respect the abstract submission deadline, which is set one week before the paper submission. The limit length of accepted papers should be 15 pages (including abstract, figures and references). The final submission should be formatted according to Springer's LNCS Camera-ready instructions.

For each accepted paper, at least one author must attend the conference and present the paper. The deadline for identifying and registering this individual author is together with the camera-ready submission.

All accepted papers will be included in the Conference Proceedings published by Springer Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series."

By submitting to ICSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ. In particular, papers submitted to ICSR 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for ICSR 2025. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases. To check for double submission and plagiarism issues, the chairs reserve the right to (1) share the list of submissions with the PC Chairs of other conferences with overlapping review periods and (2) use external plagiarism detection software, under contract to the ACM or IEEE, to detect violations of these policies.

Accepted papers will be published in the ICSE 2025 Co-located Event Proceedings and included in the IEEE and ACM Digital Libraries. Authors of accepted papers are required to register and present their accepted paper at the conference in order for the paper to be included in the proceedings and the Digital Libraries.

Authors of rejected long papers may receive an acceptance as a short paper if the PC chairs and reviewers agree that it better meets the criteria for short papers. In this case, authors may decide to accept or reject the invitation if they would rather submit as a long paper to a different venue.

The conference program will reflect the multidisciplinary nature of ICTD research and diverse publishing traditions within this field, with anticipated contributions from disciplines including (but not limited to) anthropology, communication, computer science, economics, electrical engineering, data science, design, geography, human-computer interaction, information systems, political science, public health, sociology, and various methodological approaches.

## Call for Full Papers

To be considered Full Papers, contributions should be more than six pages long (single column ACM template, as specified in the “Submission Instructions” section below). There is no hard page limit, but papers with length incommensurate to contributions will be rejected. Previous papers (if converted to the ACM single-column format) would have run 14-18 pages in length.

Accepted papers typically represent a major advance for the field of ICTD and will be presented as oral presentations.

Full Papers will be evaluated via double-blind peer review by a multidisciplinary panel of at least three readers, one of whom will come from outside the paper’s disciplinary domain in order to ensure broad readability.

Full Papers will be evaluated according to their novel research contribution, methodological soundness, theoretical framing and reference to related work, quality of analysis, quality of writing and presentation, and relevance to a broad audience of researchers.

All acceptance will be conditional, the final version of the paper will be checked by reviewers before final acceptance.

All accepted Full Papers will be archived in the ACM Digital Library. A subset of the Full Papers will also appear in a special issue of the Information Technologies & International Development journal.

## Submission Instructions

Submission should be done via the link: [https://ictd2024.hotcrp.com/](https://ictd2024.hotcrp.com/)

*   Only original, unpublished, research papers in English will be considered.
*   Full Papers must use the ACM templates and reference formatting (LaTex and Word available). Please, note: As described in the page linked above, manuscripts for review should be submitted in a single column format. Manuscripts submitted for review should use the “Submission Template” (Microsoft Word) or “Primary Article Template” (Latex -documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart} ) as described at the link.

Please direct all questions about the new model to icps-info@acm.org.

## Human Subjects and Ethical Considerations

Authors are strongly encouraged to read and follow the community-defined [minimum ethical standards for ICTD research](https://ictdethics.files.wordpress.com/2018/12/Minimum-Ethical-Standards-for-ICTD_ICT4D-Version-2.0.pdf).

In addition, submissions that describe experiments with human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects, or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:

*   Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable.
*   Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect.

If a paper raises significant ethical concerns, it might be rejected based on these concerns.
