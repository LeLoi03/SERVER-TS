The workshop emphasizes interactive discussions, with each paper receiving 45-60 minutes of presentation and discussion. Accepted papers are published in the ACM Digital Library after revision incorporating workshop feedback.","# NSPW 2025: Call for Papers

NSPW 2025 invites three types of submissions:

1.  **Regular submissions:** Present a new approach (paradigm) to a security problem or critique existing approaches. While regular submissions may present research results, the change in approach should be the focus.
2.  **Theme Submissions:** Focused on “**Trusting**” and should explain the connection with the theme in the justification statement. They follow the format of a regular submission.
3.  **Implementation Submissions:** Explore implementing previous NSPW submissions. These submissions should clearly cite which previous work(s) is being referenced and how the current submission extends beyond the original scope.

The theme for NSPW 2025 is **Trusting**.

## Relevant Topics for the Theme ""Trusting""

*   Novel paradigms for conceptualising trust and trusting in computer security
*   Trust decisions in a world of deepfakes and misinformation
*   Detection of breach of trust, intrusion and misinformation
*   Trust boundaries and threat modeling
*   Trust in changing threat landscapes and technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence
*   Trust evaluation
*   Social configuration of trust and mistrust in organisations
*   Trust and mistrust as methodological problems in studies of computer security
*   The consequences of not trusting
*   Audits and certifications
*   Authentication and authorization
*   Reputation systems and reviewer/recommender systems
*   Anomaly detection
*   Formal verification and testing
*   Privacy
*   Decentralized trust
*   Zero trust architectures
*   Human, social and organisational understandings of trust in technologies

*Other interpretations of trusting are welcome.*

## Submission Instructions

*   **Confidentiality:** All submissions are treated as confidential.
*   **Prior Publication:** NSPW does not accept previously published or concurrently submitted papers.
*   **Due Date:** **April 25, 2025, 11:59 PM AoE**
*   **Response Date:** May 30, 2025
*   **Format:** PDF format, **6-15 pages**, ACM “sigconf” formatting.
*   **Submission System:** Submit through EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025)

### Special Submission Instructions

Each paper requires two separate EasyChair submissions:

1.  **Cover page:** with authors’ names, affiliation, and the participation statement.
2.  **Anonymous PDF paper:** with a justification statement.

The **participation statement** must specify which author(s) will attend upon acceptance/invitation, that all authors will engage in good faith with the feedback given in the review and revision periods, and that all authors will abide by the NSPW code of conduct.

The **justification statement** (clearly marked as part of the PDF submission) briefly explains why the submission is appropriate for NSPW and the chosen submission category. The justification statement will not appear in the final publication.

To support double-blind reviewing, the cover page should not be part of the PDF submission but will be submitted separately on EasyChair. Submissions that do not include both statements risk rejection without review. In addition, submissions should blind author identity where possible (e.g., using the LaTeX `anonymous=true` option and avoiding self-referencing).

Organizers and Program Committee members are allowed to submit papers, but will not be involved in evaluating their papers.

## Publication

NSPW'25 papers will be published in the International Conference Proceedings Series of the ACM Digital Library. Note: ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance).

## Social Contract and Code of Conduct

*   Acceptance to the workshop is conditional on engagement with the revision, presentation, and discussion process.
*   All participants must commit to a “social contract”: no one arrives late, no one leaves early, no electronic distractions (including laptops, tablets, and mobile devices), attend all sessions of the 2.5-day program, share meals in a group setting, and comply with the code of conduct.
*   The workshop is preceded by an evening reception.
*   NSPW is making arrangements for (some) child care during the event. If interested, please email [general-chairs@nspw.org](mailto:general-chairs@nspw.org) for planning purposes.

SPLASH 2025, co-located with ICFP/SPLASH 2025, will be held from **Sun 12 - Sat 18 October 2025** in **Singapore**.

## About Onward!

Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.

## The Character of Onward! Papers

Onward! Papers is looking for **grand visions and new paradigms** that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. It is not looking for research-as-usual papers that require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as **compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples**. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

## Selection Process

Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a **double blind manner**. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the **potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation**.

Onward! Papers follows a **two-phase review process**. At the end of the first phase, papers will be either: accepted normally; asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. Authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete them. The program committee may assign a shepherd or provide concrete revision goals. The second phase is to elevate promising papers, not to require additional work on papers already deemed up-to-standard.

Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference, but remote participation is available.

## Instructions for Authors

### Submission Site

[https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/](https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/)

### Concurrent Submissions

### Policy on Double Blind Review

Onward! 2025 uses a double-blind submission process. Authors must remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc.) from the author block and refer to their own work in the third person where possible. Acknowledgements should also be removed. The camera-ready copy must not be blinded.

### Policy on Authorship Changes

Any addition of authors after initial submission must be cleared with the PC chair, who has the authority to reject any requested change.

### Format

*   Submissions should use ACM SIGPLAN Conference `acmart` Format, `sigplan` sub-format, and 10 point font.
*   All submissions should be in PDF format.
*   Include page numbers in your submission.

### Page Limit

The 22nd USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI '25) will be held on **April 28–30, 2025**, in **Philadelphia, PA, USA**.

NSDI focuses on the design principles, implementation, and practical evaluation of networked and distributed systems. Our goal is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community to foster a broad approach to addressing overlapping research challenges. NSDI provides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further the knowledge and understanding of the networked systems community as a whole, continue a significant research dialog, or push the architectural boundaries of network services.

## Topics

NSDI invites any innovative solution for a significant problem involving networked systems, including topics from within the following list:

*   Highly available and reliable networked systems
*   Security and privacy of networked systems
*   Distributed storage, caching, and query processing systems
*   Sustainable, low-energy, and low-carbon networked systems
*   Cloud/multi-tenant systems
*   Mobile and embedded/sensor applications and systems
*   Systems aspects of networking hardware and physical layer communication technologies*
*   Network and workload measurement systems
*   Self-organizing, autonomous, and federated networked systems
*   Managing, debugging, and diagnosing problems in networked systems
*   Virtualization and resource management for networked systems
*   Experience with deployed networked systems
*   Networked systems for big data
*   Testing and/or verification applied to networked systems
*   Networked systems for machine learning (ML) and ML for networked systems

*Physical and physical-sensing papers with no clear contributions to the design of systems or the networking stack will be considered out of scope.

The preceding list is not exhaustive. That said, the program committee can reject any papers that they consider to be not in scope and relevant to the NSDI community during the review process. Please contact the PC chairs if you have questions about whether your paper would be in scope.

## Important Dates

NSDI '25 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines.

### Spring Deadline

*   Paper titles and abstracts due: **Tuesday, April 30, 2024**
*   Full paper submissions due: **Tuesday, May 7, 2024**
*   Notification to authors: **Wednesday, July 24, 2024**
*   Final paper files due: **Tuesday, October 15, 2024**

### Fall Deadline

*   Paper titles and abstracts due: **Thursday, September 12, 2024**
*   Full paper submissions due: **Thursday, September 19, 2024**
*   Notification to authors: **Tuesday, December 10, 2024**
*   Final paper files due: **Thursday, March 6, 2025**

## Submission Guidelines

### Anonymization

NSDI '25 is double-blind, meaning that authors should make a good faith effort to anonymize papers. Authors' names should be withheld, as usual. However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left de-anonymized if important for a reviewer to evaluate the work. Specific steps include:

*   Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page.
*   Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources.
*   Do not provide links to your own online content; use the submission form for uploads or contact PC chairs.
*   Use care in naming files.
*   Reference past work in the third person, citing anonymously.
*   Reference other submissions as ""[24] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing.""

*Note:* Operational track papers have different rules; content may be de-anonymized as appropriate for the paper.

### Length and Format

*   Submissions—as well as final papers—must be no longer than **12 pages**, including footnotes, figures, and tables. Additional pages are allowed for references and supplementary material.
*   Papers must be in two-column format, using 10-point type on 12-point leading, formatted for 8.5"" x 11"" paper.
*   Pages should be numbered, and figures and tables should be legible when printed without magnification. Color figures are allowed but should be readable in black and white.
*   A template for LaTeX is available on the href=""/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates"" - conference paper templates page .

Papers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review.

### Submission Method

All papers must be submitted via the href=""https://nsdi25fall.usenix.hotcrp.com/"" - submission form . Do not email submissions.

### Generative AI

Authors must not submit papers generated entirely by generative AI. Authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper is not completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP.

## Review Process

### One-Shot Revision

Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. A revision decision includes necessary changes for acceptance. Authors may resubmit a version addressing instructions during the subsequent deadline. This revised paper is reviewed to judge if instructions were met, and on its independent merits. Revised papers can only be accepted or rejected, not revised again. Failure to address revision instructions or introduction of new concerns may lead to rejection.

### Resubmissions

Papers rejected from one deadline cannot be submitted to the immediate next deadline. Papers with one-shot-revision decisions from a prior year can be submitted to the following year's conference, but must provide the previous paper ID. Papers submitted to arXiv or other online repositories must change their title and system name for review to prevent bias.

## Policies

*   **Simultaneous submissions:** Prohibited. Previously published work or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty.
*   **Extensions on workshop papers:** Allowed if the submission includes substantial new material, acknowledges previous work anonymously, and explains differences.
*   **Nondisclosure agreement:** Papers accompanied by NDAs will not be considered.

## Ethical Considerations

Papers describing experiments with users or user data must follow basic principles of ethical research (beneficence, minimal risk, voluntary consent, respect for privacy, limited deception). Authors are encouraged to include a subsection on ethical issues and must attest that their work complies with applicable ethical standards of their institutions.

## Processes for Accepted Papers

*   Invitation letters for visa applications are available upon request.
*   Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process.
*   At least one author must attend the conference to present the paper.
*   Awards will be given for the best paper(s) and a ""Community Award"" for papers with publicly available code and/or datasets.",Có link 2026: https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi26,Yes

## Double-blind Review Policy

We will use **double-blind peer review**. All submissions must be anonymous. The purpose of anonymous submissions is to give reviewers the chance to read the paper without being biased by knowing the authors. Authors are permitted to share their submissions through arXiv and other online repositories and give presentations on their work as usual. However, they should make sure not to mention their name or affiliation in the submission, and should not include obvious references that reveal their identity. A reviewer who has not previously seen the paper should be able to read it without accidentally learning the identity of the authors. Moreover, reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for the identity of authors.

*   **VisNotes paper track:** IEEE VGTC conference format with up to 6 pages (including references).

Papers should include full-color figures throughout and we encourage authors to showcase their work with annotated, well described, large, and detailed graphics. We also encourage the placement of a teaser image at the top of the very first page to showcase your work visually. Reviewers appreciate high-quality submissions with correct English spelling and grammar: non-native English speakers may wish to enlist an English language editing service.

## Anonymization

IEEE PacificVis allows both double-blind (anonymized) and single-blind (not anonymized) submissions. Double-blind submissions are intended for those authors who want to submit their work anonymously. Double-blind submissions should NOT include author names or institutions on the cover page of the initial submission, and authors should make an effort to ensure that there is no identity-revealing information (or formulations) in the text. If it is not possible to anonymize without compromising scientific clarity, authors are free to reveal their identities upon submission.

## Originality & Reuse of Text

All submissions must be novel contributions by the authors. This means that they must be original work by the authors that has not been published previously in or submitted concurrently to any conference proceeding, magazine or journal, or the like, in any language, in any form, in whole or in part, by any combination of authors.

A paper is considered published if it has appeared in a peer-reviewed and archived journal, in conference proceedings, or the like, making it available to non-attendees in the form of archives (including digital).

Concurrent submissions (i.e., having the same or a similar paper concurrently under review at another conference or journal/magazine) are strictly forbidden. If it is determined that an identical or substantially similar manuscript is simultaneously under consideration at another publication venue or forum (e.g., conference, journal, edited book), the manuscript will be rejected at an early stage in the review process. Further consequences are possible as well.

Previously published text may not be reused verbatim in a paper submission. Although similarities may be inevitable in discussing background or previous work, the reuse of text can infringe copyright, and is therefore prohibited. Images from published work may only be reused if they are properly cited and the authors have obtained the rights to re-publish the images.

One exception to these prohibitions is non-published preprints (e.g., on arXiv), which do not require citation to preprints. Another exception is theses, which should be cited. The last exception is that preliminary work described in posters, contest entries, or workshops, if not archival, may be resubmitted provided the submission includes substantial additional new material and the previous work is cited.

## Plagiarism Policy

Plagiarism of the work of others is at all times unacceptable and will lead to the submission being removed from the review process. For more information, please see the IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual.

All authors will therefore be required to certify on the submission form that the submitted work is the authors’ own work. All submissions are checked for plagiarism and potential cases inspected in detail by the paper chairs.

## Supplemental Material

We encourage the use of digital video to enhance a submission, particularly if part or all of the work addresses interactive techniques. Submission of code, data, evaluation protocols, empirical results, additional figures, or other supplemental material to improve the scientific review of the work is encouraged. Authors are urged to make available salient parameter settings of pertinent algorithms and ideally obtain results using open source data. If specific datasets are employed, we ask that a version of these be made available where possible. Information or pointers to information that can be changed after the submission deadline should not be used as supplemental material.

While most reviewers will take supplemental material into account when conducting their reviews, the authors should ensure that their submission will stand on its own even without this extra material.

## Resubmissions and Reviewer Continuity

Excellent work sometimes requires addressing issues that preclude acceptance within the scope of a single review cycle. For this reason, IEEE PacificVis welcomes revised, resubmitted papers. In particular, given the consecutive timeline of the three tracks, authors are encouraged to resubmit a revised version of a paper that was rejected to one track to the next track. In doing so, the authors can choose to maintain reviewer continuity if desired, in which case one or more of the original reviewers will be engaged for the new review process.

Authors who are submitting papers that have been rejected from earlier PacificVis cycles, or from other visualization conferences, are given the opportunity to include past reviews and a response letter as supplemental material when they submit the revised version. This is not required, but can add continuity and memory to the process so that authors can demonstrate improvement over time even if reviewers change from cycle to cycle.

Note that it is not acceptable to submit a previously rejected paper without addressing the previous review comments.

Reviewers are instructed to not penalize resubmitted papers for past rejections, but instead view the trajectory of a resubmission based on past reviews and author response. However, as with supplemental material, reviewers are not required to take past reviews and response letters into account when conducting their review. Resubmissions should be submitted with information pertaining to the original submission as supplemental material (PDF format):

*   Past submission - previous version of the paper.
*   Previous reviews - complete reviews from the last submission.
*   Cover letter - responses to past reviews (often as summary plus details).

Authors are responsible for the content of the response letter, but effective letters tend to summarize the main points of criticism in the past reviews and explain how the new version of the paper addresses these points.

## Accessibility

We highly encourage accessible final submissions so that your contribution is readable by broader audiences. There are several resources for how to achieve this:

*   [IEEE VIS 2024 - Making PDF submissions accessible](https://ieeevis.org/year/2024/info/call-participation/make-pdf-accessible)
*   [ACM SIGACCESS - Creating an accessible ACM submission using Microsoft Word](https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/acm-submission-with-ms-word/)
*   [ACM SIGCHI - Guide to an Accessible Submission](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/accessibility/)
*   ACM SIGACCESS - Resources for Accessibility

## Generative AI Policy

You are permitted to use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT or Gemini in preparing your manuscript. However, AI tools cannot serve as authors and the human authors bear full responsibility for any writing produced by such tools. In particular, authors are responsible that there is no plagiarism, misrepresentation, or falsification arising from using these tools. Furthermore, the work itself should be a representation of the human authors' intellectual contributions and not the generative AI.

If you do use generative AI beyond merely editing or improving text or generating small passages, you should disclose its use in the paper (such as the acknowledgments or image captions).

## Open Access Policy

Visualization research is better communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, all paper authors are encouraged to share their accepted paper in an open access repository before the print deadline in accordance with IEEE copyright regulations. Additionally, funding agencies and research organizations may have specific rules such as Plan S compliance and it is the authors’ responsibility to check and comply with their respective organizational rules.

## Ethics Guidelines

IEEE PacificVis adheres to the IEEE VGTC ethics guidelines for reviewers. In all aspects of the paper handling process, any possible violation of these guidelines is taken seriously and may be reported to the paper chairs for further handling within the IEEE PacificVis organization. Special attention is paid to the identification and reporting of plagiarism; possibly unethical paper content is also monitored carefully in the review process. Investigation and processing of reported cases may lead to an escalation to IEEE.","Đúng link chính, không lấy được các loại ngày",Yes

Authors must select a track (Learning, Measurement & Applied Modelling, Systems, Theory) when submitting their paper. A second track can optionally be selected for inter-disciplinary papers.

### Anonymity Guidelines

Follow standard double-blind review practices: remove names, affiliations, and acknowledgments. Use care in file naming and referencing own work (third person).

### Ethical Considerations

Papers describing experiments with users or user data should adhere to ethical research principles, including beneficence, minimal risk, voluntary consent, respect for privacy, and limited deception. Authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues and must attest that their work complies with applicable ethical standards.

### Diversity & Inclusiveness

Guidelines are provided to promote inclusivity in technical writing, including using gender-neutral language, diverse names, and avoiding assumptions about binary gender or traditional family structures.

The 13th Workshop on Programming Languages and Operating Systems (PLOS 2025) will be held on **October 13, 2025**, in **Seoul, Republic of Korea**, in conjunction with the **31st ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP '25)**.

## Rationale

Historically, operating system (OS) development and programming language (PL) development went hand-in-hand, fostering cross-fertilization. Challenges in one area were often approached using ideas or techniques developed in the other, and advances in one enabled new capabilities in both. Today, although the systems community at large retains an iron grip on C, modern PL ideas continue to spark innovations in OS design and construction. Conversely, the systems field continues to provide a wealth of challenging problems and practical results that should spark advances in PLs, software designs, and idioms.

This workshop will bring together researchers and developers from the PL and OS domains to discuss recent work at the intersection of these fields. It will be a venue for discussing new visions, challenges, experiences, problems, and solutions arising from the application of advanced programming and software engineering concepts to OSes construction, and vice versa.

## Overview

Welcome to the home page of the 46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 2025)!

PLDI is the premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research, covering the areas of design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance.

PLDI 2025 will be held in-person at the Westin Josun Seoul in Seoul, South Korea.

The main PLDI conference will be held **Wednesday, 18 June through Friday, 20 June**. Workshops and tutorials were held on **Monday, 16 June and Tuesday, 17 June**.

## Scope

PLDI is a premier forum for programming language research, broadly construed. Outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing is welcome. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all in scope for PLDI.

## Submission Process

### Deadlines

All deadlines are **Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12h)**:

*   **Submission Deadline:** **Thursday, November 14, 2024**
*   **Author Response Period:** **Tuesday, 18 - Saturday, 22 February 2025**
*   **Notification to Authors:** **Thursday, 6 March 2025**
*   **Camera-Ready Deadline:** **Thursday, 10 April 2025**

### Submission Site

The submission site will be at [https://pldi25.hotcrp.com/](https://pldi25.hotcrp.com/).

Authors can submit multiple times prior to the (firm!) deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no deadline for submitting abstracts. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Associate Editor.

### Declaring Conflicts

When submitting a paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).

Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to subvert the normal peer-review process by excluding potential reviewers. Listing spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about whether or not a given relationship constitutes a conflict, please consult the Associate Editor.

## Formatting Requirements

### Page Limits and Layout

Each paper should have no more than **20 pages of text**, excluding bibliography, using the ACM Proceedings format. This format is chosen for compatibility with PACMPL. It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent PLDI page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall.

Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection.

### Templates

PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the [SIGPLAN author information page](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/). Authors using LaTeX should use the `sample-acmsmall-conf.tex` file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the `acmsmall` option. We also strongly encourage use of the `review` and `screen` options as well, e.g.:

```latex
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous,nonacm]{acmart}
```

### Citations

Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers may use either the author-year or numeric format for citations.

### File Format

Submissions should be in **PDF** and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Please take care to ensure that figures and tables are legible, even when the paper is printed in gray-scale.

### Late/Incorrect Submissions

Papers that exceed the length requirement, deviate from the expected format, or are submitted late will be rejected.

## Review Process

### Evaluation Criteria

Reviewers will evaluate submissions for accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. Submissions should be organized to communicate clearly to a broad programming-language audience as well as experts on the paper’s topics. Papers should identify what has been accomplished and how it relates to previous work. Authors of empirical papers are encouraged to consider the seven categories of the SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines when preparing submissions.

### Double-Blind Reviewing

Author names and affiliations must be omitted from submissions. If a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. These are firm submission requirements. The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing.

The [FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/faq/FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing) clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Associate Editor than to risk summary rejection.

### Author Response

Authors will be given several days to compose a written response to the reviews received in the first round – e.g., to correct errors and clarify technical concerns. In the second round, authors of conditionally-accepted papers will be given an opportunity to improve specific aspects of the research and the paper, as identified by the reviewers.

### Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their artifacts publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.

## Supplementary Material

Authors are welcome to provide supplementary material if that material supports the claims in the paper. Such material may include proofs, experimental results, and/or data sets. This material should be uploaded at the same time as the submission. Reviewers are not required to examine the supplementary material but may refer to it if they would like to find further evidence supporting the claims in the paper.

Supplemental material cannot be included in the main submission text. All appendices must be submitted as supplemental material, not as part of the main submission PDF.

## Plagiarism and Concurrent Work

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere, as described by the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar venues of publication are disallowed. Prior work must, as always, be cited and referred to in the third person even if it is the authors’ own work, so as to preserve author anonymity.

## Open Access and Copyright

As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support liberal open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license, which grants readers (re-)use rights.

Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide an ORCID for each co-author and choose one of the following publication rights: (1) Author licenses the work with a Creative Commons license, retains copyright, and grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice); (2) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license; (3) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license; (4) Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.

While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication.

## Presentations and Awards

### Presentations

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work at PLDI. Authors who need financial assistance for travel to the conferences should apply for a grant from the SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (PAC) program. If authors are not able to obtain visas to travel to the conference despite making reasonable effort, we will make arrangements to facilitate remote participation or presentation by another attendee on behalf of the authors.

### Distinguished Paper Awards

Up to 10% of the accepted papers may be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee believes should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity.

## Code of Conduct

PLDI follows the ACM Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities. Please familiarize yourself with the policy and guide for reporting unacceptable behavior.

If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, please contact SIGPLAN’s Committee to Aid REporting (CARES) by contacting one of the listed persons, such as Steve Blackburn (steve.blackburn@anu.edu.au).

## Paper Submission

A submitted paper should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A submission should strive to be accessible to a broad audience, as well as having sufficient details for experts in the area.

### Regular Papers

A regular paper must report on original research that has not been previously published. It is not permitted to submit the same material concurrently to journals or conferences with proceedings. Format and length requirements for submissions are stated below. All ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in a paper, including full proofs and experimental results, where applicable, should be included in the submission.

### Brief Announcements

A brief announcement may describe work in progress or work presented elsewhere. A brief announcement may also report on original research results that can be fully presented in the limited space available. The title of a brief announcement must begin with `Brief Announcement: `.

## Submission Format

All submissions should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper.

Alternatively, papers can also be submitted by using the official ACM Master article LaTeX template `acmart.cls`, version 1.80 or greater, using the following documentclass instruction:

```latex
\documentclass[acmsmall,nonacm,anonymous]{acmart}
```

The template is available at [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

The following instructions equally apply in both cases.

Regular submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information (see paragraph on double-blind reviewing below), and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper’s contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the “full version” of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial 10 pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. Each submission must contain full proofs of all claims in the paper. Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first 10 pages will be read at the committee’s discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission.

Brief announcement submissions must have a length of at most 5 pages including title, abstract, and the references.

Submissions not conforming to the rules stated in this call, as well as papers outside the scope of the conference, may be rejected without consideration.

## Best practices for citations

Alphabetical orderings of authors can lead to biases. Therefore, authors are encouraged to avoid “et al.” in citations, and instead mention all author names.

## Double-blind reviewing

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear anywhere in the submission. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC chair by email.

## Conflict of Interest

Indications of conflicts of interest will be required in the submission form. A conflict of interest is limited to the following:

*   A family member or close friend.
*   A Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years.
*   A person with the same affiliation.
*   A person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.)
*   Frequent collaborators, or collaborators who have jointly published papers within the last two years.

If you feel that you have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, contact the PC chair or one of the Theory of Computing Advocates affiliated with this conference (Faith Ellen and Idit Keidar). The PC chair may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for a conflict of interest.

## Publication

Accepted regular papers of up to 10 pages and brief announcements of up to 3 pages in two-column ACM proceedings format will be included in the conference proceedings. They must be formatted with the ACM Master templates using `\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}`.

If more space than available in the proceedings for an accepted paper is needed, a full version must be available publicly, e.g. on arXiv, by the due date for the proceedings version, and the proceedings version must refer to this.

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

It is expected that papers that are published at PODC 2025 are presented by one of the authors in person at the conference. In exceptional circumstances (e.g., because of visa issues), a limited number of exceptions can be approved by the PC chair. A paid conference registration by one of the authors of each accepted paper will be required in any case.

Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of the journal Distributed Computing. Up to two selected papers will be considered for publication in the Journal of the ACM.

POPL 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical.

## Scope

Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.

## Evaluation Criteria

The Review Committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each submission as well as its accessibility to both experts and the general POPL audience. All papers will be judged on significance, originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Each paper must explain its scientific contribution in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

POPL 2025 will use a **full double-blind reviewing process**. This means that identities of authors will not be visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made. Authors must omit their names and institutions from their paper submissions and refer to their own prior work in the third person. Supplementary material must also be fully anonymized. Authors should not reveal their identity when responding to reviews.

## Submission Format

*   **Important:** The submission format for PODS 2025 is different from that of previous years, for compatibility with the PACMMOD format of the PODS publications.
*   **LaTex users** must format their submission using the standard ACM ""acmsmall"" proceedings stylesheet: [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)
*   Class declaration: `\documentclass[acmsmall,review,anonymous]{acmart}`
*   A submission can be up to **15 pages**, not including references, plus unlimited space for references.
*   **Appendix:** Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, of unlimited length, that should be incorporated at submission time. However, an appendix will be read at the discretion of the program committee.
*   Papers that are longer than 15 pages or do not cohere with the required format style risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
*   The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere.
*   Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms, and accepted papers will be published in a PODS 2025 issue of the **PACMMOD** (https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod) journal.

## Double-anonymous reviewing

PODS 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous reviewing process. Submissions must adhere to the following:

*   Author names and institutions must be omitted.
*   References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person.
*   Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed.

Authors are encouraged to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would.

## Merit-based acceptance

Paper selection will be merit-based, judged on originality, quality, clarity of presentation, relevance to the field, and technical depth. There is no a priori limit on the number of accepted papers.
