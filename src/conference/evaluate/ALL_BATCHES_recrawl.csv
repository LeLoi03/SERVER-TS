The conference focuses on real-world aspects of security and privacy, encouraging submissions with accessible and compelling results for general computer security researchers.","# Call for Papers

The 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2025) seeks paper submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of security and privacy. We seek articles presenting accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. Purely theoretical submissions (e.g., cryptography-focused, with no security/application connections) are not encouraged, nor are submissions focusing primarily on blockchains or machine learning.

Like in previous years, we will also be accepting “Systemisation of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. SoK submissions need to add the prefix **“SoK: ”** in the title. They will be accepted based on the value to the community. Survey papers without insights evaluating, systematizing, and contextualizing current knowledge will be rejected.

## Submission Instructions

Please read the instructions below before submitting your paper. Please get in touch with the PC chairs at [asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org](mailto:asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org) for any questions regarding the submissions.

[SUBMIT YOUR PAPER HERE](https://asiaccs2025b.hotcrp.com/)

## Paper Formatting

*   Technical papers submitted for ASIACCS must be written in English.
*   Papers must be in PDF format and at most **12 pages** double-column. We will allow up to 10 additional pages for the bibliography and well-marked appendices, but note that reviewers are not expected to read the appendices.
*   Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest [ACM Sigconf style conference template](https://www.acm.org/conference-conference-templates).
*   All fonts, images, tables, and figures must comply with common standards and not generate problems for reviewers.
*   Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:”
*   Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

## Conflicts of Interest (COI)

When submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include:

*   Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission.
*   Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past.
*   Anyone the author has collaborated with or published within the prior two years.

PC members, including chairs with a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure to declare COI or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a PC member with COI reviews a paper, it will be rejected.

## Anonymous Submissions

ASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used. The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the submission is made unless approved by the Program Chairs. Publishing the submission on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, is allowed, but authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results (e.g., social media, seminars, etc.) and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.

## Double and Concurrent Submissions

Submissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double submission will result in immediate rejection. We may report detected violations to other conference chairs and journal editors.

## Ethical Considerations

The authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence (beyond approval of the experiment by their institution) elaborating how they have thoroughly considered such issues. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns.

## Early Rejection and Appeals

There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification email. Authors’ appeals must clearly and explicitly identify substantial disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews that should be adjudicated by a particular arbitration reviewer who the PC chairs may recruit. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.

## Paper Revision and Resubmission

Rejected papers in Cycle 1 cannot be resubmitted in Cycle 2. A small number of Cycle 1 submissions may receive a “Revise” decision, rather than “Accept” or “Reject,” and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server. The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. We will request additional revisions only in exceptional circumstances.

## Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation

If a paper is accepted, the author list in the submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.

## Contact

For any questions related to paper submissions, please contact the PC chairs at [asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org](mailto:asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org).",

The IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) Conference series is the premier research forum for automated software engineering. Each year, it brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss foundations, techniques, and tools for automating the analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance of large software systems. ASE 2025 invites high-quality contributions describing significant, original, and unpublished results.

## New This Year

*   **PC Self-nomination:** We are inviting self-nominations to serve on our Program Committee. To contribute as a reviewer and help shape the technical program, please complete the PC self-nomination form: [https://forms.gle/uPZCVDeH4WzwvtmF6](https://forms.gle/uPZCVDeH4WzwvtmF6). We would greatly appreciate receiving your self-nomination by **January 10**.
*   **Major Revisions:** Instead of rejecting papers outright, reviewers have the opportunity to request changes that may require up to four weeks to accommodate. If a paper receives a 'Revision' outcome, reviewers will specify concrete and actionable revision criteria, agreeing to accept the paper in principle if these criteria are met. Authors will be notified about the outcome for their revision after it is checked by the discussion lead.
*   **Auto-bidding:** Leveraging the success at other conferences like ICSE 2025 and OOPSLA 2024, we will use the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) to streamline and automate the paper bidding and assignment process, reducing reviewer workload and increasing expertise per paper.
*   **Rapid Response Reviewers:** To handle unexpected unavailability of reviewers, we invite a small percentage of interested PC members to become Rapid Response Reviewers. They will initially review a smaller number of papers but commit to reviewing up to two additional papers within a shorter timeframe at the end of the reviewing period.

The ASSETS conference is the premier forum for presenting research on the **design, evaluation, use, and education** related to computing for people with disabilities and older adults. We invite high-quality original submissions on topics relevant to computing and **accessibility**.

Submissions should present significant contributions to design, systems, tools, scientific understanding, methodology, or social issues. Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) new enabling technologies, studies of how technologies are used by people with disabilities, explorations of barriers to access, and evaluations of accessibility education methods. We recommend that papers with a technical contribution be validated through research activities with representative users when possible. However, we acknowledge that many accessibility-focused projects may begin with deep formative work with representative users, or may be based on prior research with representative users, and as such key contributions of a single paper may be primarily technical.

## Submission Categories and Deadlines

All accepted papers and abstracts will be archived in the ACM Digital Library. At least one author of accepted submissions must register as the presenter by the early registration deadline.

The conference focuses on methods and solutions for software test automation, with a special theme on adapting test automation to the AI era, including sustainability and emerging challenges.","# The 6th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automation of Software Test (AST 2025) - Call for Papers

## Scope

Software pervasiveness in both industry and digital society, as well as the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, are continuously leading to emerging needs from both software producers and consumers. Infrastructures, software components, and applications aim to hide their increasing complexity to appear more human-centric. However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes and methods keep demanding the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA).

Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decades. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud.

The Automation of Software Test (AST) conference continues with a long record of international scientific forums on methods and solutions to automate software testing. In 2025, AST is in its 6th edition, having been formerly organized as workshops since 2006. The conference promotes high-quality research contributions on methods for software test automation and original case studies reporting practices in this field. We invite contributions that focus on:

i) lessons learned about experiments of automatic testing in practice;
ii) experiences of the adoption of testing tools, methods and techniques;
iii) best practices to follow in testing and their measurable consequences; and
iv) theoretical approaches that are applicable to the industry in the context of AST.

Our theme for this year is **“Adapting test automation to the AI era including sustainability and emerging challenges”** with special sessions on test automation for AI, sustainability, and AI testing education and training.

## Topics of Interest

The conference features two review cycles and includes various calls for participation, such as for Doctoral Symposium, Posters/Demos, Artifacts, Workshops, and Sponsors.","# ACM CCS 2025: Call for Papers

The 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy.

CCS has **two review cycles** in 2025.

## Review Decisions

*   **Accept:** Papers will be accepted for publication and presentation, possibly after minor changes overseen by a shepherd.
*   **Minor revision:** Promising papers needing minor work (e.g., experiments, proofs) may be resubmitted with revisions for re-evaluation.
*   **Reject:** Papers declined for inclusion. Papers rejected from the first cycle may not be submitted to the second cycle.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper in-person, if possible.

## Paper Submission Information

*   Submissions must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the corresponding deadline.
*   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers published or accepted elsewhere, or currently under submission to another journal or conference.
*   All submissions must be properly **anonymized**. Avoid revealing authors' identities and cite previous work by yourself in the third person, or blind the reference itself. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   Authors may submit up to a maximum of 7 papers for Cycle B.
*   Papers will be evaluated based on their importance to practical aspects of computer and communications security and privacy, novelty, quality of execution, and presentation.
*   For papers raising ethical concerns, authors must convince reviewers that proper procedures have been followed.
*   Submissions may be rejected for being out of scope.
*   No modifications to the author list are allowed after submission.

## Mandatory Reviewing

Authors submitting 3 or more papers may be required to review other papers. Failure to provide requested information may lead to desk rejection.

## Withdrawing Policy

A paper can be withdrawn at any point before reviews are sent to authors. After reviews are sent, withdrawal is not permitted.

## Paper Format

*   Submissions must be a **PDF file** in double-column ACM format using the ""sigconf"" style.
*   Maximum length: **12 pages**, excluding bibliography, appendices, and supplementary material.
*   Reviewers are not required to read appendices or supplementary material.
*   Do not change the font or margins of the ACM format.
*   Refer to the [sample-sigconf.tex](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/authors/tex-template/sample-sigconf.tex) and [sample-sigconf.pdf](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/authors/tex-template/sample-sigconf.pdf) in the ACM package.
*   Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.

## Providing Artifacts at Submission Time

Submissions claiming contributions based on artifacts (code, models, data sets) should make them accessible to reviewers unless there are valid reasons not to. An anonymous web link is acceptable if the contents are also anonymized.

## Optional Artifact Evaluation (AE)

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to submit artifacts for AE. A separate call for artifacts will follow.

## Conference Tracks

The conference features a multi-track format. Authors must select the most relevant track during submission.

The workshop aims to bring together researchers in computer networks and systems to discuss innovative ideas and debate future research agendas in networking.","# HotNets 2025: Call for Papers

The 24th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets 2025) will bring together researchers to engage in a lively debate on the theory and practice of computer networking and networked systems. HotNets provides a venue to discuss innovative ideas and debate future research agendas for the field.

## Overview

We invite researchers and practitioners to submit short position papers. We encourage submissions that identify fundamental open questions, advocate for new approaches, offer constructive critiques of the state of networking research, re-frame or debunk existing work, report unexpected early results from a deployment, report promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Authors need not support their ideas with full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations are sufficient support for the possibility of the paper's claims in HotNets.

We seek interesting ideas over incremental, well-baked systems. An ideal submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry for the networking and adjacent communities. We strongly discourage ""conference papers in the miniature."" The program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion, ideally benefiting the networking community broadly, over incremental work that is ready for publication at a conference.

HotNets takes a broad view of networking research. The scope includes (but is not limited to) new ideas that relate to mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks and that use a variety of link technologies (e.g. wired, wireless, optical, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks and network architecture. HotNets encompasses all aspects of networks, which include (but is not limited to) packet-processing and transmission hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, provisioning and resource management, performance, energy consumption, sustainability, topology, robustness, measurement, diagnosis, verification, privacy, security, economics and evolution, theory, usability, machine learning, and interactions with applications.

This year, the program committee will do an initial fast round of reviewing that will provide early rejection or advancement to later rounds of more traditional, thorough reviewing. The program committee will select papers based on originality, likelihood to stimulate insightful discussion, and technical merit. Accepted papers will be posted online prior to the workshop and will be published in the ACM Digital Library to facilitate wide dissemination of the ideas discussed at the workshop.

## Important Dates

*   **Paper submission deadline:** July 9, 2025 (23:59 AoE)
*   **Author notification:** September 19, 2025

## Submission and Formatting

*   Papers should be formatted according to the **two-column ACM proceedings format**.
*   Each paper should have no more than **6 pages**, excluding references, in **10 point font**. There is no limit on the page count for references, however appendices are not allowed.
*   Papers must contain novel ideas and must differ significantly in content from previously published papers.
*   All submissions must be **blind**: they must not indicate the names or affiliations of the authors in the paper.
*   Only electronic submissions in **PDF** will be accepted.
*   Submissions must be written in English, render without error using standard tools (e.g., Acrobat Reader), and print on US Letter paper.
*   Each reference must list all authors of the paper (i.e., do not use ""et al.""). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52].
*   Please ensure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale.
*   Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected.

A LaTeX class file that follows the prescribed submission format is available: [hotnets25-template.zip](https://hotnets.acm.org/2025/docs/hotnets25-template.zip)

For the LaTeX template, the first two lines should be:
```latex
\documentclass[sigconf, 10pt, anonymous, nonacm]{acmart}
       \settopmatter{printfolios=true, printccs=false, printacmref=false}
```

Submit papers on the [HotCRP](https://hotnets25.hotcrp.com/).

## Policies

### Policy on Concurrent Submissions

Concurrent submissions to HotNets 2025 and any other peer-reviewed venue that cover the same work (differences in the degree of detail given the two venues' length limits notwithstanding) are prohibited, and will result in the immediate rejection of the HotNets submission in question. ""Concurrent"" means any other peer-reviewed venue whose reviewing period (i.e., between submission and notification) overlaps with that of HotNets. The ""same work"" means, for example, a submission overlapping significantly in content with a conference submission. However, a position paper submitted to HotNets (e.g., that reflects broadly on the state of some aspect of the field, adopts a position as to how the field should move forward, or articulates a broad avenue of future work) will not be considered the ""same work"" as a conference-length paper on a specific system that addresses a point under the broad umbrella covered by the position paper. Authors with questions about this policy should contact the PC co-chairs before submitting.

### Ethical Concerns

As part of the submission process, authors must attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient – in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and authors agree to be available at any time during the review process to rapidly respond to queries from the PC chairs regarding ethical standards.

## Workshop Participation

HotNets attendance is limited to roughly 90 people in person to facilitate a lively discussion (potentially with additional virtual participants). In-person invitations will be allocated first to one author of each paper, HotNets organizers and committee members, and conference sponsors. We require the paper presentations to be in-person (if authors have any concerns about this, they are welcome to contact the PC chairs). To promote an inclusive workshop, HotNets will also make a limited number of open registration slots for in-person attendance available to the community.

At least one author of each paper must be registered for the conference in order for the paper to be published in the proceedings. Accepted full papers will be presented in technical sessions and selected papers will be presented in a separate poster session. Presentation of an accepted paper is a requirement for publication in the proceedings. Any paper not meeting requirements will not be included in the conference proceedings under IEEE Xplore.

## Submission Link

Submit your paper: [https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/HiPC/](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/HiPC/)

## AI-Assisted Text Usage

HiPC will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you use these services merely for language rectification. The authors should verify whether the results are accurate before submission.

As required by IEEE, the use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.

If you use AI tools, you should include an acknowledgment section to disclose the AI assistance with appropriate references to the sections in the paper, but this acknowledgment section should still abide by the double-blind submission guideline (i.e., any funding or author-related information should not be included).

## ArXiv Submission Policy

Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to HiPC 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).

## Inclusive Description of Research Contributions

Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

## Review Process

All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.

The initial decision for the submission may be Accept, Reject or Shepherd. Papers that are recommended for shepherding will have to address the comments from the reviewers, and submit a revised article along with a summary of changes. The revised manuscript will be reviewed by the shepherd and the final decision will be communicated.

*   Accepted papers will have the flexibility to use an additional page in the camera-ready to incorporate feedback from the reviewers.
*   Papers should be formatted in the ACM Proceedings Style (using `sigconf` from [ACM Proceedings Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)).
*   Submitted papers must be original work that has not appeared in and is not under consideration for another conference or a journal.

## Anonymizing Submissions

HPDC uses **dual-anonymous reviewing**. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or acknowledgments).

*   The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of author names.
*   Reference your past work in the third person, as you would any other piece of related work.
*   If your submission extends a previous workshop paper or relates to a submission under review, cite the other work anonymously and email the deanonymized work to the PC chairs.
*   If your submission reports on experiences with a system at your institution, refer to the system anonymously but describe the properties needed for evaluation.
*   Tool/data papers should also adhere to the double-blind submission policy.

## arXiv Submission Policy

Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit submission to HPDC. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and do not count as prior work. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission and do not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period).

## Author List After Acceptance

The author list cannot be changed after acceptance.

## Conflict of Interest Declaration

At the time of submission, all authors must indicate their conflict of interest with PC members (institutional, collaborative, or personal).

## HPDC Policy on the use of AI

*   HPDC permits the use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly) for language rectification. Authors are responsible for the accuracy of the content.
*   AI tools are not eligible for authorship.
*   The use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section, citing the AI system used. The acknowledgment section must still follow dual-anonymous submission guidelines.

## ACM Policy on Authorship

Refer to the [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/frequently-asked-questions) for all other guidelines, including policies on the use of generative AI tools.

## Suggestions for Document Preparation for Authors

HPDC authors are encouraged to structure their introduction section as follows:

*   **Motivation:** State the objective and provide quantitative support.
*   **Limitation of state-of-art approaches:** Review prior works and articulate limitations.
*   **Key insights and contributions:** Specify novelty and contributions.
*   **Experimental methodology and artifact availability:** Specify infrastructure and methodology, indicate artifact availability.
*   **Limitations of the proposed approach:** Articulate limitations and conclusions sensitive to assumptions.

This format is a suggestion and not a requirement.

## Ethical Considerations

If your research describes a new security-related attack, please consider adding information about responsible disclosure. The paper should follow ethical principles and not alter security/privacy/equality expectations of users.

## Inclusive Description of Research Contributions

Consider using gender-neutral pronouns, diverse examples, engaging users from diverse backgrounds, and making the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.",

Ensure that the metadata included in the PDF does not give away the authors. Refer to prior work in the third person and include a full citation for the work in the bibliography.

## Authorship Guidelines

IEEE guidelines dictate that authorship should be based on a substantial intellectual contribution. All authors must have met specific conditions related to intellectual contribution, drafting/revising the article, and approving the final version.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site. Conflicts include advisor-advisee relationships, family members, collaborations within the last 4 years, people from the same institution within the last 4 years, funding relationships, and members of the same research center where unpublished work is regularly discussed. 

*Scenarios that do NOT constitute a conflict include: authors of previously-published, closely related work; service collaborations; co-authoring community-wide tools; people working on similar topics; and people under the same umbrella funding award without close collaboration.*

## ArXiv Submissions

Authors may submit their work to HPCA 2025 even if it appears on Arxiv. However, authors are encouraged to reduce the possibility of their name being disclosed to avoid issues with the double-blind review process.

## Concurrent Submissions

The purpose of the International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence (ICAART) is to bring together researchers, engineers, and practitioners interested in the theory and applications in the areas of Agents and Artificial Intelligence, covering both applications and current (advanced) research work. The scientific goal is to stimulate them in developing new ideas for further progress. ICAART focuses on Agents, Multi-Agent Systems, Software Platforms, and Distributed Problem Solving. It also focuses on Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation, Planning, Learning, Scheduling, and Perception. Applications are in both areas, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Legal Technologies, and Quantum Computing.

Papers describing original work are invited. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of ICAART with an ISBN. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance, and originality. Both full research reports and work-in-progress reports are welcome. There will be both oral and poster sessions.

Special sessions, dedicated to case-studies and commercial presentations, as well as tutorials dedicated to technical/scientific topics are also envisaged.

*   Whether the paper is long or short must be indicated at submission time.
*   Over-length papers will be rejected without review.
*   All papers that satisfy length and formatting requirements will be reviewed against standard criteria such as relevance, originality, significance, clarity, and soundness.
*   Submissions are expected to meet the high standards of publication expected by ICAPS. Please refer to the for further details and reviewing guidelines.
*   The review process has three possible outcomes: (1) acceptance for oral presentation and inclusion in the archival proceedings; (2) acceptance for poster presentation and non-archival extended abstract; (3) rejection.
*   Papers submitted to ICAPS 2025 may not be submitted to other conferences or journals during the ICAPS 2025 review period, nor may they be already under review, accepted, or published in other conferences or journals.
*   Authors making multiple submissions must ensure that each submission has significant, unique content. Papers sharing co-authors and substantial overlap will be rejected.
*   The format of ICAPS 2025 will be **in-person**. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present their work in person, unless exceptional circumstances prevent this.

## Use of Generative AI

*   Papers that include text generated from an LLM are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as part of the paper’s experimental analysis.
*   This policy DOES NOT prohibit authors from using these technologies for editing or polishing author-written text.
*   No AI system satisfies the criteria for authorship of papers published by AAAI Press (ICAPS’ publisher) and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in such papers.
*   Authors assume full responsibility for the content of submitted work, including checking for plagiarism and authenticity of all text.

## Ethical / Societal Impact

Authors are encouraged to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences.

The 16th International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC’25) will be held in **Campinas, Brazil**, from **June 23rd to June 27th, 2025**. ICCC is the sole scientific conference dedicated to computational creativity, covering all its facets, from theoretical frameworks to practical applications.

Computational creativity is defined as the art, science, philosophy, and engineering of computational systems which, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviours that unbiased observers would deem to be creative. The field is thriving with advancements in formalizing machine creativity and exciting applications across sciences, arts, literature, and gaming.

## Themes and Topics

Original research contributions are solicited in all areas related to Computational Creativity research and practice, including but not limited to:

*   **Applications of Computational Creativity:** in music, language, games, visual arts, design, architecture, entertainment, education, mathematical invention, scientific discovery, programming.
*   **Human-Machine Co-Creativity:** systems, studies, frameworks, or methodologies related to co-creativity between humans and AI, emphasizing machine as a creative partner.
*   **Computational Creativity Evaluation:** metrics, frameworks, formalisms, and methodologies for evaluating creativity in computational systems or their societal perception.
*   **Social Models:** computational models of social aspects of creativity, including social creativity, diffusion of ideas, collaboration, team dynamics, and creativity in social settings.
*   **Computational Paradigms:** computational approaches for modelling cognitive aspects of creativity, such as heuristic search, analogical and meta-level reasoning, cognitive architectures, and re-representation.
*   **Interdisciplinary Perspectives:** drawing from philosophy and/or sociology in the context of creative AI systems.
*   **Data and Creativity:** data science approaches, resource development, and data gathering/knowledge curation for creative AI, with a focus on scalable, extensible, and open-source datasets.
*   **Societal Impact:** ethical considerations in the design, deployment, or testing of creative AI systems, and studies on the societal impact of computational creativity and generative AI.
*   **Psychological Factors:** computational models of psychological factors enhancing creativity (emotion, surprise, reflection, motivation, etc.), as well as social or experiential factors related to novelty and originality.
*   **Provocations:** raising new issues that question the foundations of the discipline or shed new light on debates.

A note on generative AI models: While welcomed, applications must be properly situated in the CC literature and evaluated according to field standards.

## Paper Types

We welcome five types of full papers:

*   **Technical papers:** Focus on hypotheses about creative behaviour in computational systems, requiring solid experimentation, models, proof, or argumentation, with strong evaluation.
*   **System or Resource description papers:** Describe the building and deployment of a creative system or resource, emphasizing engineering achievement, technical challenges, reusable resources, and some evaluation.
*   **Study papers:** Draw on allied fields (psychology, philosophy, etc.) or appeal to broader AI/CS areas, providing novel perspectives on CC systems or their evaluation.
*   **Cultural application papers:** Present the use of creative software in a cultural setting (art exhibitions, concerts, literature, games, etc.), detailing the system's role, results, and feedback.
*   **Position papers:** Present opinions on CC research, future directions, speculative explorations, or current issues, requiring careful argumentation and thorough knowledge of the field.

The 20th International Symposium on Parameterized and Exact Computation (IPEC 2025) invites papers presenting original research in the area of parameterized and exact algorithms and complexity.

Papers can be submitted via Easychair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ipec2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ipec2025) (please see submission and coi guidelines below).

## Topics

The topics include but are not limited to:

*   new techniques for the design and analysis of parameterized and exact algorithms;
*   fixed-parameter tractability and kernelization results;
*   parameterized complexity theory;
*   parameterized (in)approximability results;
*   relationships between parameterized complexity and traditional complexity classifications;
*   applications of parameterized and exact computation;
*   engineering and experimentation of exact, parameterized, and kernelization algorithms.

## Important Dates

*   Abstract submission / paper registration: **June 27th** (23:59 AoE)
*   Submission deadline: **June 30th** (23:59 AoE)
*   Notification: **August 7th**
*   IPEC dates: **Sept. 17—19** (Wed-Fri)
*   Camera-ready version: **October 10th** (23:59 AoE)
*   *AoE=Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12)*

## Submission Guidelines

*   Each submission is required to be in the `LIPIcs` format; no changes to font size, page margins, etc., are permitted. Line numbers must be activated.
*   We welcome submissions of the full version of the paper. Regardless, the first **12 pages** of the submission (excluding the title page) should be enough to assess the paper and contain a summary of the main results, their motivation and importance, and evidence of their correctness. In particular, PC members and potential subreviewers may treat the first 12 pages as the short version (the rest being read at their discretion).
*   Results previously published in conference proceedings or a journal (or scheduled for publication prior to IPEC) or under simultaneous submission will not be considered.
*   PC members (outside the PC chairs) are allowed to author or coauthor submissions.
*   **Double-blind reviewing:** As in previous years, IPEC 2025 employs a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. In case there exist publicly available versions of the submission online, the authors might mention this in their submission (without providing references/links), and briefly explain the differences if any. Alternatively, they might communicate the details to the chairs, who will keep them confidential unless revealing them to the PC is needed for a fair judgement. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC chairs.

## Conflicts of Interest

IPEC takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, seriously. Authors are responsible for declaring conflicts of interest with any of the PC members.

You have a conflict of interest with:

*   family members and close friends;
*   Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years;
*   people with the same affiliation;
*   involved in an alleged incident of harassment (it is not required that the incident be reported);
*   reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter); and
*   frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.

## Conference and Paper Publication

Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the symposium, and to incorporate the comments from the program committee.

The conference proceedings will be published in the **Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs)** series after the conference (post-proceedings).

The final submission will be made in LIPIcs format, with a higher page limit of **15 pages** plus bibliography (no appendix). More details will follow from LIPIcs upon acceptance. The submissions will be published as post-proceedings.

## Awards

A **best paper award** and a **best student paper award** may be conferred. All submissions are eligible for the best paper award, except submissions co-authored by PC members. Submissions of which all authors are students at the time of submission are also eligible for the best student paper award. Papers meeting the requirement for the best student paper award should indicate this during submission.

Besides the best paper and best student paper award, during the IPEC conference, the [IPEC Nerode Prize](https://eatcs.org/index.php/nerode-prize) will be conferred. The winner(s) will be chosen by a separate award committee; please refer to the webpage for details.",sub: 2/3

## Update

**2025-03-06:** One week submission extension, submissions now due **2025-03-18 (AoE UTC-12h)**.

## Expanded Scope

Continuing from ISMM 2024, we are excited to announce the continued expanded scope of ISMM this year to encourage submissions and participation from related fields such as **computer architecture** and **computer systems** in addition to our core PL community!

## Solicitation

The 2025 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2025) is soliciting full-length submissions covering new work on all memory management related topics in both software and hardware (and their cooperation), as well as papers presenting confirmations or refutations of important prior results.

In addition to regular papers, traditionally submitted to ISMM, we also invite submissions of the following kinds:

*   **Surveys and comparative analyses** that shed new light on previously published techniques.
*   **Practitioner reports**, describing experience with memory management in production. Such papers are not expected to provide novel research contributions, but they should not have been previously published.
*   **Intellectual abstracts**, where researchers share designs, algorithms, or theory that may be interesting to the memory management community, but not yet evaluated.

Please indicate whether the paper is a regular paper, a survey, a practitioner report, or an intellectual abstract, by using a subtitle. For example, for a regular paper, include on of the following on the line below the title line:

`\subtitle{This submission is a regular paper},
\subtitle{This submission is a survey},
\subtitle{This submission is a practitioner report},
\subtitle{This submission is an intellectual abstract}.`

ISMM 2025 will be colocated with [PLDI 2025](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/).

## Areas of Interest

Areas of interest include but are not limited to (in no particular order):

*   Garbage collection algorithms and implementations
*   Memory allocation and de-allocation
*   Memory system design and analysis (both software and hardware)
*   Hardware support for memory management
*   Memory management for large-scale data-intensive systems
*   Memory management at datacenter and cloud scales
*   Formal analysis and verification of memory management algorithms
*   Compiler analyses to aid memory management
*   Tools to analyze memory usage and characteristics of programs
*   Empirical analysis of memory intensive programs
*   Formal analysis and verification of memory intensive programs
*   Memory management for machine learning systems
*   Programming and management of emerging or persistent memories
*   Caches, memory controllers, memory hierarchies and their management
*   Cache coherence and memory consistency
*   Processing in memory (including processing near and using memory)
*   Memory technology and architecture (SRAM, DRAM, flash, NVM, emerging technologies)
*   Security and privacy of memory systems
*   Robustness of memory systems
*   Low-latency and low-energy memory systems

The symposium welcomes industry practitioners presenting their recent practice and findings in memory management related to real-world deployments.

## Submission Link

## Formatting Instructions

*   All papers must be submitted on-line in **Portable Document Format (PDF)**.
*   Papers should be formatted according to the **two-column ACM proceedings format**. Each paper should have no more than **12 pages**, excluding bibliography, in **10pt font**.
*   There is no limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al).
*   The citations should be in **numeric style**, e.g., `[52]`.
*   Submissions should be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper.
*   Make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale.
*   Appendices should not be part of the paper, but should be submitted as supplementary material. Supplementary material should also be anonymized, as described below.
*   As explained in more detail at [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author), authors should use the `sigplan` subformat of the `acmart` format. Please note the following:
    ```latex
    \documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart}
    \settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}
    ```
*   The default citation style is numeric.
*   Do not mess with the class file or settings to try to sneak in additional space.
*   Do not use the PACMPL files or format; ISMM is not using them.

Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

ISMM uses **double-blind reviewing**. This means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. These are firm submission requirements. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized.

An earlier FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs – [FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2023-pldi#FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing). If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, or any cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ, please contact the Program Chairs. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Program Chairs than to risk summary rejection.

## Declaring Conflicts

When submitting the paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).

Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.

## Publication Date

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## Author Response

The author response process will occur in **April 2025**, and will give the authors an opportunity to respond to factual errors in reviews before the Program Committee meets to make its decisions.

## Important Dates (AoE - UTC-12h)

*   **Paper submission:** Tue 18 Mar 2025
*   **Author response period:** Wed 23 - Fri 25 Apr 2025
*   **Author notification:** Sat 3 May 2025
*   **Camera-ready papers due:** Thu 15 May 2025

For questions, please [contact the program chairs](mailto:iticse2025papers@easychair.org).

## ITiCSE 2025 Paper Tracks

Papers submitted to ITiCSE address aspects of computing education. Submissions are divided into three tracks:

1.  **Computing Education Research:** Papers defining research questions, describing data gathering and methods, presenting results, and discussing contributions to knowledge in computing teaching and learning.
2.  **Experience Reports and Tools:** Papers describing computing education experiences, including tools developed for computing education, with sufficient detail for adoption. These should be motivated by literature, highlight novelty, and describe what worked and what didn't.
3.  **Position Papers and Proposals:** Papers articulating original and well-argued positions on computing education or proposals for early-stage work. These must offer value to the community, even if the work is not yet completed.

All papers must explicitly state motivating questions, relate to relevant literature, and include an analysis of intervention effectiveness if applicable. **Initial submissions must be anonymous.**

## Scope

Image analysis is a scientific discipline providing theoretical foundations and methods for solving problems appearing in a wide range of areas, as diverse as medicine, robotics, defense, and security. As a rule, the processed data are discrete; therefore, the “discrete approach” to image analysis appears to be a natural one and has an increasing importance. It is based on studying combinatorial properties of the considered digital data sets. Combinatorial image analysis often features various advantages (in terms of efficiency and accuracy) over the more traditional approaches based on continuous models requiring numeric computation.

The Workshop is a forum for current research on the following (or similar) research subjects which are directly or potentially applicable to image analysis:

*   Combinatorial problems in the discrete plane and space
*   Lattice polygons and polytopes
*   Digital/combinatorial geometry and topology
*   Digital manifolds
*   Geometry of digital curves and surfaces
*   Analysis and processing of digital surfaces with singularities (such as “pinched digital surfaces”)
*   Homotopy of digital manifolds; thinning algorithms and skeletons
*   Boundary tracking of digital solids; Geometric characteristics of object boundaries
*   Multigrid convergence analysis of metric-based descriptors
*   Tilings and patterns; Combinatorial pattern matching
*   Computational geometry and imaging sciences
*   Integer programming, linear programming, and graph theoretic models and approaches to problems of image analysis
*   Image representation, segmentation, grouping, and reconstruction
*   Processing “very large” digital pictures; Methods for image compression
*   Parallel architectures and algorithms
*   Fuzzy and stochastic image analysis
*   Discrete tomography
*   Grammars and models for image or scene analysis and recognition; cellular automata
*   Mathematical morphology and image analysis
*   Applications in medical imaging, biometrics, computer vision, image understanding, robotics, metrology, and others
*   AI and machine learning in imaging and image analysis

The symposium focuses on advances in biomedical imaging.","# Call for Academic Software Demos

We welcome proposals for in-person demos of academic, open, free, and non-commercial software. The software may or may not be directly associated with accepted ISBI 2025 papers and abstracts, but should still have relevance to accepted ISBI 2025 work. The academic demo sessions of ISBI 2025 will aim to showcase recent developments in the field, software used in ISBI 2025 papers, all relevant to the ISBI community. This will be an opportunity for presenters to perform live demos of their code/software while interacting with conference attendees face-to-face.

## Focus Areas

Demos should focus on **open science, reproducible research, clinically-translational work, and soft skills development**. Demos should provide material for all levels of expertise, including students, early career scientists, professionals, and clinical users. Demos should primarily focus on the (relatively mature) tools developed by the presenters rather than results.

## Demo Format

*   All accepted demos will be **in-person** in an assigned conference hall during the main conference.
*   Each demo will be provided with a **small table, power outlet, wireless (shared) Internet, and a monitor** during its assigned time slot.
*   Submissions should list all other supporting equipment that will be needed per demo, so the conference committee may do their best to arrange them.
*   Demo presenters are expected to bring their own laptops/PCs as needed for their demo.

## Demo Fee

*   There will be a **$140 fee** for the demo package (table, poster board, screen, power connection).
*   This fee must be paid upon registration by the presenter of the relevant paper the demo is attached to, who will be attending the conference, in addition to their conference attendee fee.

## Demo Proposal Requirements

Proposals should be **no more than one (1) page** in 12-point font submitted as a single PDF file. Demo proposals should contain the following sections:

*   **Title:** Must have the prefix ""Demo:"" (e.g., ""Demo:<Title>""). Include a brief topic overview and brief expected learning outcomes.
*   **Representative Image:** One ""representative image"".
*   **Relevance to ISBI community:** Emerging topics will be favorably considered if the link with the ISBI community is clearly established (the software is associated with an accepted ISBI 2025 paper or abstract).
*   **Software URLs:** List any GitHub or otherwise public software related URLs.
*   **Target Audience:** Describe from which areas potential participants are expected to visit the demo, what prior knowledge or skills are expected from the audience, and what software or programming languages might be involved.
*   **Presenter Information:** (Not included in page limit) Please provide names, affiliations, positions, and email addresses for each demo-presenter.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are 11:59pm USA (PST).

*   **Demo proposals due:** **February 24, 2025**
*   **Accept/Reject notification:** **February 28, 2025**
*   **Deadline to submit any update on requested materials needed:** **March 7, 2025**

The IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the field of real-time systems, where researchers and practitioners showcase innovations covering all aspects of real-time systems, including theory, design, analysis, implementation, verification, evaluation, and experience.

## Scope of the Conference

RTSS’25, the 46th edition of the event, continues the tradition of embracing new and emerging areas of real-time systems research. It is an expansive and inclusive event.

## Tracks

RTSS’25 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems theory and practice. Manuscripts may be submitted to either of the following tracks:

### Track 1: Real-Time Systems and Foundations

This track focuses on the practical and theoretical foundations that enable predictable timing in computing systems. This includes core real-time operating systems components, schedulability analysis, scheduling algorithms, theoretical foundations, and verification methods. Topics of interest also cover timing analysis (e.g., WCET analysis), real-time and time-sensitive networking, timing-predictable hardware architectures, modeling and analysis of stochastic real-time systems, fault tolerance, security in relation to timing guarantees, compiler techniques, system synthesis, model-driven engineering, and applied formal methods.

**Artificial Intelligence for Real-Time Systems Foundations:** RTSS invites contributions on the use of AI and machine learning techniques to advance real-time scheduling, timing analysis, resource management, and system optimization under timing constraints.

### Track 2: Design and Applications

This track focuses on real-time systems in a broader systems context, emphasizing novel research on designs, implementations, and applications where real-time requirements are integral. It explores how tools and techniques are adapted and applied to specific application domains.

*   **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS):** Applications in transportation, healthcare, industrial control, etc., that interact closely with the physical world. Topics include enabling technologies, application-specific solutions, design methodologies, tool chains, CPS architectures, secure CPS, performance analysis, robustness, safety, certification, and hardware/software co-design.
*   **Real-Time System Design for Artificial Intelligence:** Practical implementation of AI components in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. Focuses on designing real-time systems to deploy AI under real-time constraints, including system design, frameworks, resource management, hardware acceleration, and AI safety in CPS.
*   **HW-SW Integration and System-Level Design:** Design methodologies and tools for hardware/software integration and co-design in embedded systems. Topics include architecture description languages, hardware architectures, design space exploration, synthesis, optimization, SoC design, FPGA-based simulation, emerging trends like RISC-V, and AI/ML hardware accelerators.
*   **Internet of Things (IoT):** Addressing challenges in IoT with resource constraints, scalability demands, and dynamic environments. Topics include real-time capabilities in IoT, distributed sensing and control, low-latency processing, edge computing, fog computing, and AI-at-the-edge. Emerging areas like 5G/6G for URLLC and in-network computing are also of interest.

## Timing Requirements

To be in scope, ALL submissions must explicitly address some form of real-time requirements / constraints (e.g., deadlines, response-time bounds, tail latencies, statistical notions of timeliness). Submissions must provide a compelling justification if timing-predicability requirements necessitate a nontrivial resource allocation, programming, scheduling, or design approach.

## Surveys and User Studies

Empirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field, using surveys, questionnaires, interviews, use-cases, or other empirical techniques, is also welcome. Literature surveys that solely classify, review, and summarize existing research papers are not in scope.

The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC '25) will be held from **July 7–9, 2025**, at the **Sheraton Boston in Boston, MA, USA**. It is co-located with the **19th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI '25)**.

## Overview

The USENIX ATC '25 seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. Submissions are welcome for systems of all scales, from embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds. The scope covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including operating systems, runtime systems, parallel and distributed systems, storage, networking, security and privacy, virtualization, software-hardware interactions, performance evaluation, reliability, energy management, and bug-finding.

USENIX ATC '25 particularly encourages new ideas and approaches, and values submissions accompanied by clearly defined artifacts (traces, data, source code, tools) not previously available.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum.
*   Papers will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity. Flawed ideas or designs may lead to rejection.
*   **USENIX ATC '25 will employ double-blind reviewing.** Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   Papers need to be registered, and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract will be rejected.
*   An optional artifact evaluation process will be available for accepted papers.

## Submission Type: Full vs. Short

*   **Full submissions:** Must not exceed **12 pages** (excluding references and appendices).
*   **Short submissions:** Must not exceed **6 pages** (excluding references and appendices).
*   Both types are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in scope. Short papers present a complete idea that is properly evaluated.
*   Optionally, authors can include an appendix for material not central to the contributions (e.g., algorithm details, proofs, code snippets).
*   For further details, see the [submission instructions](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc25/submission-instructions).

## Deployed Systems Track

USENIX ATC '25 solicits papers describing the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with real-world deployment of systems and networks. These papers need not present new ideas but should convey practical insights. Note that submission and anonymization rules differ for this track.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract registrations due:** Tuesday, January 7, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Submissions due:** Tuesday, January 14, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC

## Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools for Authors

*   Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of a paper submitted to WAFR.
*   The use of content generated by AI in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section.
*   The AI system used must be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content should be specified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the manner in which the AI system was used to generate the content.
*   The use of AI systems for editing and grammar enhancement is common practice and, as such, is generally outside the intent of the above policy. Even so, in this case, disclosure is still recommended as the lines between these uses can be difficult to distinguish.

## Guidelines Regarding the Use and Disclosure of AI Tools for Reviewers

Information or content contained in or about a manuscript under review shall not be processed through an AI system. Doing so is considered a breach of confidentiality and as such is not permitted.

ISSRE (International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering) is the leading conference on software reliability, focusing on approaches, techniques, and tools for assessing, predicting, and improving the reliability, safety, and security of software systems.

## ISSRE 2025 Key Features

*   **Early Decisions:** ISSRE 2025 introduces an early decision system. Authors will be notified of an ""Accept"", ""Reject"", or ""Response Recommended"" outcome at the beginning of the author response period, reserving author responses for cases with specific reviewer inquiries.
*   **Transparency and Reproducibility:** Authors are encouraged to disclose data and submit artifacts to the Artifact Evaluation (AE) track to enhance reproducibility and quality, potentially earning credibility badges.
*   **Physical Presentation Requirement:** At least one author of every accepted paper is required to make a full author registration and present at the conference physically in São Paulo.
*   **Special Issue Invitation:** Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to a special issue of the Empirical Software Engineering (EMSE) journal.

## Submission Categories

ISSRE 2025 invites high-quality submissions in the following categories:

1.  **Full research regular (REG) papers:** Describing a novel contribution to the reliability of software systems, with clear evidence and validation.
2.  **Practical experience reports (PER) papers:** Exposition of practical experiences, lessons learned, or empirical studies, including negative results.
3.  **Tools and artefacts (TAR) papers:** Presenting new tools or substantial extensions to existing tools, or software and experimental data sets.

## Important Dates (AoE)

*   **Abstract submission deadline:** April 28, 2025 / May 5, 2025
*   **Paper submission deadline:** May 5, 2025 / May 12, 2025
*   **Early decisions:** June 30, 2025
*   **Author rebuttal period:** June 30th - July 6th, 2025
*   **Notification to authors:** July 18, 2025
*   **Camera ready papers:** August 19, 2025

## Paper Categories and Lengths

*   **REG papers:** 12 pages (including references).
*   **PER papers:** 12 pages (including references).
*   **TAR papers:** 6 - 10 pages (including references).

Papers exceeding the page limits will be rejected without review.

## Topics of Interest

Topics include development, analysis methods and models throughout the software development lifecycle, and are not limited to:

*   Dependability attributes (i.e., security, safety, maintainability, survivability, resilience, robustness) impacting software reliability
*   Reliability threats, i.e. faults (defects, bugs, etc.), errors, failures
*   Reliability means (fault prevention, fault removal, fault tolerance, fault forecasting)
*   Software testing and formal methods
*   Software fault localization, debugging, root-cause analysis
*   Metrics, measurements and threat estimation for reliability prediction and the interplay with safety/security
*   Reliability of autonomous systems and (self-)adaptive systems
*   Reliability of AI-based systems, AI for Reliability Engineering
*   Reliability of Large Language/Foundational Model (LLM) and LLM for software reliability
*   Reliability of software services and Software as a Service (SaaS)
*   Reliability of model-based and auto-generated software
*   Reliability of open-source software
*   Reliability of software dealing with Big Data
*   Reliability of green and sustainable systems
*   Reliability of mobile systems
*   Reliability of software within specific technological spaces (e.g., Internet of Things, Cloud, Semantic Web/Web 3.0, Virtualization, Blockchain, networks softwarization, 5G/6G, edge-to-cloud computing)
*   Normative/regulatory/ethical spaces about software reliability
*   Societal aspects of software reliability

## Anonymizing Rules

Authors must anonymize their papers by:

1.  Removing authors' names and affiliations from the title page.
2.  Removing acknowledgements of identifying names and funding sources.
3.  Using care in naming files (source file names are often embedded).
4.  Referring to related work, particularly your own, in the third person. Avoid omitting references.
5.  If citing anonymous work, send deanonymized references to the PC chairs via email.
6.  Authors may use a non-anonymized version for other purposes but must not mention submission to ISSRE 2025.

Submissions violating formatting and anonymization rules will be desk rejected.

## Formatting Rules

*   Submissions must adhere to the IEEE Computer Society Format Guidelines using the provided LaTeX/Word templates.
*   Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file with embedded fonts.
*   The first page must include the title and a maximum 200-word abstract.
*   Figures and graphs should be readable in grayscale.
*   Symbols and labels in graphs should be readable when printed.
*   Limit file size to less than 15 MB.
*   Authors are encouraged to supply source code and raw data for reproducibility.

## Paper Submission

*   Papers are submitted via Easychair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=issre2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=issre2025)
*   Submissions will be reviewed via a double-blind process. Papers with non-disclosure agreement forms will be rejected.
*   Changes in author numbers/order are not allowed after acceptance.
*   Submissions violating formatting and anonymization rules will be desk rejected without review.

## Review Process and Author Response

Reviews will be made available to authors before the PC/Board meeting for factual error correction. Responses should be concise and focus on reviewer concerns. The new ""Early Decisions"" system will categorize papers as ""Accept"", ""Reject"", or ""Response Recommended"" early on, reducing the need for responses in many cases.

## Awards

*   **Best Research Paper Award:** Awarded annually to the best paper in the Research Track.

## Conference Proceedings

The conference proceedings will be published by IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services (CPS), submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore and A&I partners.

## IEEE Policies

All submissions must adhere to IEEE Conference Publishing Policies and will be screened for plagiarism through the IEEE Cross Check portal.","sub: 9/10
