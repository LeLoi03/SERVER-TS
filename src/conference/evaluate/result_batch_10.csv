The 20th International Conference on Integrated Formal Methods (iFM 2025) will take place on **19–21 November 2025** at **Inria Paris, France**, with co-located workshops scheduled for **17-18 November 2025**.

The iFM conference series is a forum for discussing recent research advances in the development of integrated approaches to formal modelling and analysis. The conference covers all aspects of the design of integrated techniques, including language design, verification and validation, automated tool support and the use of such techniques in software engineering practice. To credit the effort of tool developers, we use EAPLS artifact badging.

## Objectives and Scope

In the last decades, we have witnessed a proliferation of approaches that integrate several modelling, verification and simulation techniques, facilitating more versatile and efficient analysis of software-intensive systems. These approaches provide powerful support for the analysis of different functional and non-functional properties of the systems, complex interaction of components of different nature as well as validation of diverse aspects of system behaviour.

Areas of interest include (but are not limited to):

*   Formal and semi-formal modelling notations
*   Combining formal methods with different performance, simulation and system analysis techniques
*   Program verification, model checking, and static analysis
*   Theorem proving, decision procedures and SAT/SMT solving
*   Runtime analysis, monitoring and testing
*   Program synthesis
*   Modelling, analysis and synthesis of cyber-physical, hybrid, embedded, probabilistic, distributed or concurrent systems
*   Abstraction and refinement
*   Model learning and inference
*   Approaches to integrating formal methods into software engineering practice or industry
*   Approaches to integrating formal methods into standardisation or certification processes
*   Formal methods for artificial intelligence, including machine learning and data-based techniques
*   Tools and case studies supporting the integration of formal methods

## Paper Categories

iFM 2025 solicits high-quality papers reporting research results and/or experience reports related to the overall theme of formal methods integration. We solicit papers in the following categories:

1.  Regular papers (limit **16 pages**) presenting original scientific research results, tools, their foundation and evaluations, applications of formal methods, including rigorous evaluations and case studies.
2.  Short papers (limit **6 pages**) describing any work in the area of formal methods, including work-in-progress and preliminary results that are sufficiently interesting for the iFM community.

All page limits exclude the references. Appendices may be included, but they will only be read by a reviewer at their discretion.

Regular and short papers must be original, unpublished, and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers will undergo a thorough review process. Submissions will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity.

The submissions will be reviewed and selected for publication based on the above-mentioned criteria as well as suitability to the conference’s technical program. The review process is single blind.

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions for all categories should be made using the iFM 2025 EasyChair site:

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ifm2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ifm2025)

Submissions must be in PDF format, using the Springer LNCS style files.

Springer requires that authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, either for LaTeX or for Word, for the preparation of their papers. Springer encourages authors to include their ORCIDs in their papers. After a paper is accepted, the corresponding author of each paper, acting on behalf of all of the authors of that paper, must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form. The corresponding author signing the copyright form should match the corresponding author marked on the paper. Once the files have been sent to Springer, changes relating to the authorship of the papers cannot be made.

The conference proceedings will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A special issue of the Formal Aspects of Computing journal is planned for extended versions of selected papers from iFM 2025. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper must register to the conference by the early registration date.

## EAPLS Artifact Badging

Reproducibility of experiments is crucial to foster an atmosphere of open, reusable and trustworthy research. To improve and reward reproducibility and to give more visibility and credit to the effort of tool developers in our community, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit possible artifacts associated with their paper for evaluation, and based on the level of reproducibility they will be awarded one or more badges. See [https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/](https://eapls.org/pages/artifact_badges/).

Artifact submission is optional and the result of the artifact evaluation will not alter the paper’s acceptance decision.

## Best Paper

iFM 2025 will honor the best paper selected with respect to reviews, program committee discussions and conference presentations with an award.

The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a highly selective venue for the presentation of measurement-based research in data communications. IMC 2025 will focus on advancing the state of the art in the collection, usage, analysis, and sharing of network measurements for the research community. A key emphasis will be on the willingness of authors to share their data and make their work reproducible.

## Key Points

*   Authors will be required to make a declaration on artifact availability (full, partial, or no availability).
*   Papers will be assessed based on whether the contributions warrant acceptance despite the lack of artifact availability. Authors must explain the reasons for non-availability.
*   All papers accepted to the program will be shepherded to ensure that the artifacts promised have been made available.

## Topics of Interest

IMC takes a broad view of contributions that are considered in scope for improving the practice of network measurement, including, but not limited to:

*   Collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about network structure and network performance (e.g., traffic, topology, routing, energy utilization, performance).
*   Collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about application and end-user behavior (e.g., economics, privacy, security, application interaction with protocols).
*   Measurement-based modeling (e.g., workloads, scaling behavior, assessment of performance bottlenecks, causality).
*   Methods and tools to monitor and visualize network-based phenomena.
*   Systems and algorithms that build on measurement-based findings.
*   Theoretical analysis and modeling of networked-systems and measurement techniques.
*   Novel methods for data collection, analysis, and storage (e.g., anonymization, querying, sharing).
*   Reappraisal of previous empirical network measurements and measurement-based conclusions.
*   Descriptions of challenges and future directions the measurement community should pursue.

Networks of interest include:

*   Internet transit networks
*   Edge networks, including home networks, broadband access networks (e.g., cable, fiber), and cellular networks
*   Data center networks and cloud computing infrastructure
*   Peer-to-peer, overlay, and content distribution networks
*   Software-defined networks
*   Online social networks
*   Online services, platforms, and content providers
*   Experimental networks, prototype networks, and future internetworks

## Replicability Track

IMC 2025 will continue the Replicability Track for submissions that aim to reproduce or replicate Internet measurement results that have been previously published at IMC or other top-tier venues. Submissions to this track are two-phase.

### Phase 1: Expression of Interest (EoI)

Prospective authors are invited to submit an Expression of Interest (EoI) via the [submission system](https://imc2025-repro.hotcrp.com/) in the form of a 1-page abstract, which must explain:

*   Which paper the authors aim to replicate
*   Whether the paper will be replicated or reproduced
*   What the IMC community stands to learn from the replication or reproduction
*   The chosen approach, and why it will lead to new insights

### Phase 2: Full Submission

Authors of strong abstracts will receive an invitation to a full submission, which will then be assessed by the TPC and must conform to the same criteria and rules as full submissions on the main track.

## Review Process and Criteria

IMC 2025 invites two forms of submissions:

*   **Full papers:** Up to 13 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix.
*   **Short papers:** Up to 6 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references and appendix.

Authors should submit only original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue.

## Important Novelties for 2025

This is the first edition of IMC with **two deadlines per year (Nov 21st, 2024 and May 15th, 2025)** and an **optional one-shot-revision process across deadlines**.

Key goals:

*   Enhance the quality and timeliness of published papers.
*   Provide more flexibility in submission timing.
*   Allow exciting but not-yet-ready papers to receive a one-shot-revision decision in lieu of rejection (allowed only for one round).

**Decisions:**

*   **Accept:** Accepted papers will be presented at the IMC conference and appear as part of the proceedings.
*   **One-Shot-Revision:** Papers marked with this outcome will be given specific action points and can be resubmitted during the next deadline. During this revision period, the paper is still considered under review to IMC and therefore cannot be submitted to other conferences unless the authors first withdraw it from consideration.
*   **Reject:** Rejected papers cannot be resubmitted at the next deadline. Approximately 12 months must pass since the last IMC deadline they were submitted to.

## Awards

IMC 2025 will bestow three awards on paper submissions:

1.  Best Paper award
2.  Best Student Paper award (limited to papers whose main author is a student at the time of submission)
3.  Community Contribution award (for papers with an outstanding contribution to the community in the form of a new dataset, source code distribution, open platform, or other noteworthy service)

## Length and Format

*   Format: All submissions need to follow ACM single-column format. Papers not in the correct format after the revised submission are likely to be rejected.
*   LaTeX OR Overleaf: Please note that the default template is set for 2-column and needs to be manually changed to 1-column for initial review using \documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart}
*   [Word](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx) - Please note that the Microsoft Word Template contains invisible meta-tags related to the paper format and structure. While writing the paper authors are requested to add their content without altering any format and structure of the template.
*   Paper Length: India HCI 2025 does not have a strict page limit. However, authors are encouraged to submit a paper of length proportional to its contribution. The average length of papers can be approximately 7,000–8,000 words excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Specifically, submissions above 12,000 words (two standard deviations above the average) will be desk rejected, except in circumstances where the authors are able to provide a strong justification.
*   Originality: Your submission must be original; it cannot be published or under concurrent review elsewhere. If you make multiple submissions to India HCI 2025 Papers, they must be distinct from each other.
*   Anonymity: Your submission must be anonymized; please ensure that your submission conforms to the [Anonymization Policy](https://chi2025.acm.org/submission-guides/chi-anonymization-policy/).

Although papers must stand on their own, submitted videos will be available to reviewers as supporting material. Authors should note that no specific guidelines are given for developing a video. Videos are viewed only as supporting material, and authors of accepted papers will have the opportunity to prepare a more polished final video presentation for inclusion in the proceedings and as supplemental material in the ACM Digital Library. Authors should note that videos too need to maintain anonymity for the review process. Authors are free to update the video once their submission is accepted, if they wish to disclose themselves in the videos.
*   When submitting your video for review, please encode your video in a format that works across as many platforms as possible without the installation of additional codecs. Please note that the total aggregate size for a submission must not exceed 100 MBytes (including all documents and additional material).

## Reviewing process

*   Each paper will be subjected to rigorous review by two Associate Chairs (from the program committee) and two external reviewers (experts in the area that are not on the committee).
*   Contact authors will be sent the initial reviews for their papers by August 1.
*   Authors will have an opportunity to submit a 500-word rebuttal to answer questions or clarify misunderstandings of reviewers by August 11.
*   The final decision for accepting or rejecting a paper will be done in a PC meeting, after which the authors will be notified of the decisions.
*   All acceptances will be conditional pending changes that the papers committee may suggest or require for the final camera-ready draft of the paper. The primary author of each accepted paper will receive detailed instructions on how to submit a final, publication-ready version of the paper. The paper will not be formally accepted to India HCI until authors revise it and submit a final draft for approval by the programme committee. Some submissions may be asked to undergo a more intense shepherding process in order to bring them to the standard required for India HCI. The deadline for submitting the “camera ready” version after all changes will be September 10. Additionally, at least one author of each paper needs to register for the conference by this date."

The topics include but are not limited to:

*   new techniques for the design and analysis of parameterized and exact algorithms;
*   fixed-parameter tractability and kernelization results;
*   parameterized complexity theory;
*   parameterized (in)approximability results;
*   relationships between parameterized complexity and traditional complexity classifications;
*   applications of parameterized and exact computation;
*   engineering and experimentation of exact, parameterized, and kernelization algorithms.

## Submission Guidelines

Each submission is required to be in the [LIPIcs format](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/series/LIPIcs#author); no changes to font size, page margins, etc., are permitted. Line numbers must be activated. We welcome submissions of the full version of the paper. Regardless, the first 12 pages of the submission (excluding the title page) should be enough to assess the paper and contain a summary of the main results, their motivation and importance, and evidence of their correctness. In particular, PC members and potential subreviewers may treat the first 12 pages as the short version (the rest being read at their discretion).

Results previously published in conference proceedings or a journal (or scheduled for publication prior to IPEC) or under simultaneous submission will not be considered.

PC members (outside the PC chairs) are allowed to author or coauthor submissions.

### Double-blind reviewing:

As in previous years, IPEC 2025 employs a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. In case there exist publicly available versions of the submission online, the authors might mention this in their submission (without providing references/links), and briefly explain the differences if any. Alternatively, they might communicate the details to the chairs, who will keep them confidential unless revealing them to the PC is needed for a fair judgement. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC chairs.

### Conflicts of Interest

IPEC takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, seriously. Authors are responsible for declaring conflicts of interest with any of the PC members. You have a conflict of interest with:

*   family members and close friends;
*   Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years;
*   people with the same affiliation;
*   involved in an alleged incident of harassment (it is not required that the incident be reported);
*   reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter); and
*   frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.

## Conference and Paper Publication

Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the symposium, and to incorporate the comments from the program committee. The conference proceedings will be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series after the conference (post-proceedings).

The final submission will be made in LIPIcs format, with a higher page limit of 15 pages plus bibliography (no appendix). More details will follow from LIPIcs upon acceptance. The submissions will be published as post-proceedings.

## Awards

A best paper award and a best student paper award may be conferred. All submissions are eligible for the best paper award, except submissions co-authored by PC members. Submissions of which all authors are students at the time of submission are also eligible for the best student paper award. Papers meeting the requirement for the best student paper award should indicate this during submission.

Besides the best paper and best student paper award, during the IPEC conference, the [IPEC Nerode Prize](https://eatcs.org/index.php/nerode-prize) will be conferred. The winner(s) will be chosen by a separate award committee; please refer to the webpage for details.
