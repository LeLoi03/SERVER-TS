*   Research papers must not exceed **12 pages** not including the references. No appendix is allowed.
*   Only electronic submissions in **PDF format** will be considered.
*   A paper submitted to ICDE 2025 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire time it is considered for ICDE 2025. It must be substantially different from any previously published work. If an ICDE 2025 submission has overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication.
*   Any author of ICDE 2025 should not be a co-author of more than **10 submitted research papers** across the two submission rounds.
*   Submissions will be reviewed in a **single-blind manner**. Submissions that are rejected in the first round are not eligible for re-submission to the second round.
*   The best papers will be selected for submission as an extended version to be published in the **IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)**.
*   IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution if none of the authors attend the conference to present their paper.

## Desk Rejection Policy

Submissions that don’t meet the following requirements may be rejected without review:

*   Following the guidelines and length requirements specified in the ICDE 2025 Call for Papers.
*   Being in scope of ICDE 2025 (aligning with at least one of the topic areas and relating to data management aspects).
*   Correctly declaring all conflicts of interest (COI) with members of the program committee. Both not reporting COIs as well as frivolously defining COIs count as a violation.

## Conflict of Interest (COI)

Authors must correctly declare all conflicts of interest with members of the program committee. The submission site will request information about COIs. Each author must create a CMT profile and complete it with domain and individual conflicts. Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information may be desk-rejected.

A paper submitted to ICDE 2025 must present original work not described in any prior publication that is more than 4 double-column pages in length. A prior publication is a paper that has been accepted for presentation at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings; or an article that has been accepted for publication in a refereed journal. If an ICDE 2025 submission has overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication, along with all other relevant published work.

The definition of a COI includes co-authorship in the past three years, co-working in the same company or university within the past three years, collaborators within the past three years, thesis advisor relationships, and being a relative or close personal friend. A searchable spreadsheet of COIs is provided for convenience.

## Reviewing Process

Papers will be stringently reviewed with at least 3 reviews per paper, coordinated by a meta-reviewer. Papers may be invited to submit a revised version if the PC believes they can reasonably be improved within the allocated revision time frame. Revisions will go through an additional round of reviews before a final decision.

## Inclusions and Diversity in Writing

We value Diversity and Inclusion. Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Paper should be submitted using the Conference Management Tool: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICDE2025](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICDE2025).
*   Manuscripts must be prepared in accordance with the IEEE format available at [https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
*   Research papers must not exceed **12 pages** not including the references. No appendix is allowed.
*   Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered.
*   A paper submitted to ICDE 2025 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire time it is considered for ICDE 2025, and it must be substantially different from any previously published work.
*   Any author of ICDE 2025 should not be a co-author of more than 10 submitted research papers across the two submission rounds.
*   Submissions will be reviewed in a **single-blind manner**.
*   Submissions that were desk rejected in Round 1 due to COI violations, failure to follow length and formatting instructions, or being out of scope for ICDE may be resubmitted in Round 2. The responsibility rests with the authors to ensure their paper meets all submission requirements.

## Desk Rejection Policy

ICDE research track submissions that don’t meet the following requirements may be rejected without review:

*   Submissions must follow the aforementioned guidelines and length requirements specified in the ICDE 2025 Call for Papers.
*   Submissions must be in scope of ICDE 2025, aligning with at least one of the topic areas and situating itself within the state of the art of current and past research in the database community.
*   Authors must correctly declare all conflicts of interest (COI) with members of the program committee. Both, not reporting COIs as well as frivolously defining COIs, count as a violation of this requirement.

## Conflict of Interest (COI)

An author X of an ICDE 2025 research paper has a COI with a PC member or Area Chair Y if and only if one or more of the following conditions hold:

*   X is a co-author of another ICDE 2025 submission together with Y.
*   X has been a co-author of Y in a publication in the past three years.
*   X has been a co-author of Y for 4 (or more) publications in the last 10 years.
*   X has been a co-worker of Y in the same company or university within the past three years.
*   X has been a collaborator of Y within the past three years (e.g., held a joint grant).
*   X is or was Y’s primary thesis advisor or vice versa, no matter how long ago.
*   X is a relative or a close personal friend of Y (or vice versa).

The onus for correctly declaring COIs rests with the authors who must submit their complete set of COIs for a submission to be considered for review.

## Reviewing Process

*   ICDE 2025 papers will be stringently reviewed with at least 3 reviews per paper.
*   Papers may be invited to submit a revised version if the PC believes the papers can reasonably be improved within the allocated revision time frame (authors will have five weeks to prepare revisions).
