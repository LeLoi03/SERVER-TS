All full papers will be subject to a careful reviewing process where every paper will be assigned at least three independent expert reviewers.

The presentations of accepted full papers will be 30 minutes long.

### (2) Short Presentations

Submissions of extended abstracts of up to 5 pages plus references are also welcome and will be subject to reviewing. The accepted submissions will be made available at the conference, and the authors will have the opportunity to give short presentations (of up to 15 minutes) on them.

At least one author of each accepted paper or short presentation must register for and attend the conference.
