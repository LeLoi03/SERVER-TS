## Manuscript and Submission Guidelines

*   Abstracts of no more than 300 words must be submitted by the abstract submission deadline. The title and abstract submitted by this deadline should have sufficient detail and not just be a placeholder.
*   Authors are strongly advised to submit their papers with the final list of authors, as changes may not be feasible at later stages.
*   Submitted manuscripts should be structured as technical papers and the full papers may not exceed **ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages** using 10-point size font on 8.5×11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and references.
*   All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a **double-blind review process**, so the submitted paper should NOT list any authors or their affiliations.
*   The author list at the time of submission is considered final – no co-authors can be added or removed after the submission deadline or upon acceptance (no exceptions). The author affiliation and order can be changed with notice to the PC chair before the camera-ready deadline if the paper is accepted.
*   The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download here: [https://template-selector.ieee.org/instance/credential/index](https://template-loc.ieee.org/instance/credential/index).
*   Electronic submissions must be in the form of a readable PDF file.
*   Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other conference or journal. Papers not following these guidelines will be rejected without review and further action may be taken, including (but not limited to) notifications sent to the heads of the institutions of the authors and sponsors of the conference.
*   Submissions received after the due date, exceeding the length limit, or not appropriately structured may also not be considered.
*   Papers must be submitted under one of the technical tracks listed. The topics listed under each track are representative, but not exhaustive.
*   At the time of publishing, authors of accepted papers may buy up to two pages in addition to the page limits specified above for their manuscript.

## No Show Policy

At least one author of each paper must be registered for the conference in order for the paper to be published in the proceedings. Accepted full papers will be presented in technical sessions and selected papers will be presented in a separate poster session. Presentation of an accepted paper is a requirement for publication in the proceedings. Any paper not meeting requirements will not be included in the conference proceedings under IEEE Xplore.

## Submission Link

Submit your paper: [https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/HiPC/](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/HiPC/)

## AI-Assisted Text Usage

HiPC will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you use these services merely for language rectification. The authors should verify whether the results are accurate before submission.

As required by IEEE, the use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.

If you use AI tools, you should include an acknowledgment section to disclose the AI assistance with appropriate references to the sections in the paper, but this acknowledgment section should still abide by the double-blind submission guideline (i.e., any funding or author-related information should not be included).

## ArXiv Submission Policy

Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to HiPC 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).

## Inclusive Description of Research Contributions

Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

## Review Process

All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.

The initial decision for the submission may be Accept, Reject or Shepherd. Papers that are recommended for shepherding will have to address the comments from the reviewers, and submit a revised article along with a summary of changes. The revised manuscript will be reviewed by the shepherd and the final decision will be communicated.

The IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the field of real-time systems, where researchers and practitioners showcase innovations covering all aspects of real-time systems, including theory, design, analysis, implementation, verification, evaluation, and experience.

## Scope of the Conference

RTSS’25, the 46th edition of the event, continues the tradition of embracing new and emerging areas of real-time systems research. It is an expansive and inclusive event.

## Tracks

RTSS’25 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems theory and practice. Manuscripts may be submitted to either of the following tracks:

### Track 1: Real-Time Systems and Foundations

This track focuses on the practical and theoretical foundations that enable predictable timing in computing systems. This includes core real-time operating systems components, schedulability analysis, scheduling algorithms, theoretical foundations, and verification methods. Topics of interest also cover timing analysis (e.g., WCET analysis), real-time and time-sensitive networking, timing-predictable hardware architectures, modeling and analysis of stochastic real-time systems, fault tolerance, security in relation to timing guarantees, compiler techniques, system synthesis, model-driven engineering, and applied formal methods.

**Artificial Intelligence for Real-Time Systems Foundations:** RTSS invites contributions on the use of AI and machine learning techniques to advance real-time scheduling, timing analysis, resource management, and system optimization under timing constraints.

### Track 2: Design and Applications

This track focuses on real-time systems in a broader systems context, emphasizing novel research on designs, implementations, and applications where real-time requirements are integral. It explores how tools and techniques are adapted and applied to specific application domains.

*   **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS):** Applications in transportation, healthcare, industrial control, etc., that interact closely with the physical world. Topics include enabling technologies, application-specific solutions, design methodologies, tool chains, CPS architectures, secure CPS, performance analysis, robustness, safety, certification, and hardware/software co-design.
*   **Real-Time System Design for Artificial Intelligence:** Practical implementation of AI components in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. Focuses on designing real-time systems to deploy AI under real-time constraints, including system design, frameworks, resource management, hardware acceleration, and AI safety in CPS.
*   **HW-SW Integration and System-Level Design:** Design methodologies and tools for hardware/software integration and co-design in embedded systems. Topics include architecture description languages, hardware architectures, design space exploration, synthesis, optimization, SoC design, FPGA-based simulation, emerging trends like RISC-V, and AI/ML hardware accelerators.
*   **Internet of Things (IoT):** Addressing challenges in IoT with resource constraints, scalability demands, and dynamic environments. Topics include real-time capabilities in IoT, distributed sensing and control, low-latency processing, edge computing, fog computing, and AI-at-the-edge. Emerging areas like 5G/6G for URLLC and in-network computing are also of interest.

## Timing Requirements

To be in scope, ALL submissions must explicitly address some form of real-time requirements / constraints (e.g., deadlines, response-time bounds, tail latencies, statistical notions of timeliness). Submissions must provide a compelling justification if timing-predicability requirements necessitate a nontrivial resource allocation, programming, scheduling, or design approach.

## Surveys and User Studies

Empirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field, using surveys, questionnaires, interviews, use-cases, or other empirical techniques, is also welcome. Literature surveys that solely classify, review, and summarize existing research papers are not in scope.

## Proceedings and Awards

All accepted papers will appear in the main program and proceedings if presented at the conference. Outstanding papers will be recognized. Best paper, best student paper (first author is a student), and best presentation awards will be presented.

## Submission Guidelines

All submissions must be written in English. Papers should be submitted electronically, in a PDF format, through the EasyChair submission system:

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=umap2025) by selecting the “UMAP25 Full and Short Papers” track.

### Format

We encourage two types of submissions in the ACM two-column format:

*   **Long papers:** (8 pages at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) should report on substantial contributions of lasting value.
*   **Short papers:** (4 pages at most plus additional pages for references; figures, tables, proofs, appendixes, acknowledgments, and any other content count toward the page limit) typically discuss exciting new work that is not yet mature enough for a long paper.

We recommend that supplementary material is linked to an external source using an anonymized link.

### Anonymity

Submissions must be anonymous, given that ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process. Authors must omit their names and affiliations from submissions, and avoid obvious identifying statements. Failure to anonymize your submission could result in desk rejection.

### Templates

Following the ACM Publication Workflow, all authors should submit manuscripts for review in the ACM double-column format. Instructions for authors are given below:

*   **LaTeX:** Please use the latest version of the [Primary Article Template – LaTeX](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) to create your submission. Start the document with the `\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}` command to generate the output in a double-column format.
*   **Overleaf:** (use `\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}` for double-column). Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for [preparing your article with Overleaf](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/overleaf).
*   **Word:** Please carefully follow the ACM’s instructions for [preparing your article with Microsoft Word](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word), ignoring the single-column instructions and the single-column submission template. Please use the double-column Word template.

### Accessibility

Authors are strongly encouraged to provide “alt text” (alternative text) for floats (images, tables, etc.) in their content so that readers with disabilities can be given descriptive information for these floats that are important to the work. Additionally, authors should follow the [ACM Accessibility Recommendations for Publishing in Color](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/describing-figures) and SIG ACCESS guidelines on describing figures.

### Submission Policy

All submissions and reviews will be handled electronically. ACM UMAP has a no dual submission policy. Please consider the following ACM’s publication policies:

*   [ACM’s Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects)
*   Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID.

## Review Process

ACM UMAP uses a double-blind review process. Reviewers will evaluate papers based on their significance, originality, rigor, and contribution to the field.

The ACM Code of Ethics gives the ACM UMAP program committee the right to (desk-)reject papers that perpetuate harmful stereotypes, employ unethical research practices, or uncritically present outcomes/implications that disadvantage minority communities.

## Registration and Presentation Policy

Each accepted paper must be accompanied by a distinct full author registration, completed by the early registration date cut-off. Each accepted paper must be presented in person to be included in the conference proceedings, published by ACM, and available via the ACM Digital Library.

## Camera-ready Submission

Accepted papers will be subject to further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. Instructions for preparing the camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be provided after acceptance.

## Ethical & Human Subjects Considerations

ACM UMAP expects papers to include a discussion of the ethical considerations, as well as the impact of the presented work and/or its intended application, where appropriate.

## Papers

Papers are the main medium for conveying new research results at UIST and must describe original, unpublished work. For questions, please email the program chairs at [program2025@uist.org](mailto:program2025@uist.org).

### Submission Information

*   **Submission Platform:** All required materials must be submitted electronically to PCS.
*   **Submission Format and Length:**
    *   Required Paper PDF and source files
    *   We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow.
    *   For LaTeX authors, submissions are strongly recommended to be in the double-column format ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) using \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}. (please use the downloadable LaTex template or the Overleaf template ).
    *   For Word authors, submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) or the single-column template ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.pdf) ).
    *   UIST papers are of variable length.
    *   **Short Papers** submissions of 5,000 words or less.
    *   **Standard Length Papers** submissions between 5,000 and 12,000 words.
    *   References and appendices are excluded from the word count.
    *   Size: < 20 MB (compressed PDF files are encouraged during submission)
*   **Accompanying Video:**
    *   Optional, but highly encouraged
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   No more than 5 minutes long
    *   Size: < 250 MB
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
*   **Anonymity:** Anonymous, i.e. authors must remove their names and affiliations throughout all submission materials (paper, videos, supplementary material) ( [anonymity policy](https://uist.acm.org/2025/author-guide/#anonymity) )
*   **Selection Process:** Refereed, i.e. the program committee and two external reviewers will review submitted papers
*   **Publication:** Archival, i.e. accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed in digital form to conference attendees
*   **Quick rejection / Desk rejection policy:** Papers, where the length is incommensurate with contribution or the stated length of the submission (i.e., short paper vs. standard length papers), will be desk rejected. Submissions of more than 5,000 words for short papers or 12,000 words for standard papers will be desk rejected if their length is not justified. In very exceptional cases, such submissions may be considered for full review, but authors must provide clear and strong justification for why submissions are required to be longer than the word limit.
*   **Anonymization Policy:** Authors are expected to anonymize their identities in the body of the paper but leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. Authors are required to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], …” and use instead “As described by Chetty et al. [10], …”. Papers that violate the anonymization policy by explicitly and unequivocally identifying the authors (i.e., beyond allowing the reviewers to simply ""guess""), including within the supplemental materials or external links to datasets, code repositories, etc., will be desk rejected. Any supplementary material (including the video) should also adhere to the anonymity rule.
*   Your submission must be original; it cannot be published or under concurrent review elsewhere. If you have any concurrent submissions to UIST or other venues that are closely related – i.e., are based on the same study, artifact, or dataset – you must include an anonymized version of that submission to the concurrent submissions field. Failure to do so will result in desk rejection. Please see [ACM guide on prior and simultaneous submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions) .
*   Research Quality and Lack of Relevant Context: Papers must include sufficient detail for reviewers to evaluate research quality according to the norms and expectations of the UIST community. Papers should demonstrate clear connections to existing research literature in HCI and related fields, showing how the work builds upon or relates to prior work. Papers that lack adequate methodological details for proper evaluation, or that fail to engage with relevant prior research, may be desk rejected.
*   Your paper must be stand alone. Authors are encouraged to provide supplementary materials to support practices around research reproducibility as much as possible, however all important information to understand the contributions of your work must be in the main paper PDF. Heavy reliance on appendices and/or supplementary materials can be a ground for rejection including desk rejection.
*   Please ensure that you use the correct template and correct formatting of references. We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format, but will accept papers for review in either 1- or 2-column paper format if you are authoring in Word. Use of other templates or formats, including different citation styles, may result in desk rejection.
*   **Final Publication Format:**
    *   For LaTeX authors, your source files will be used to auto-generate (1) a double-column PDF ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ), and (2) an accessible and responsive webpage (example HTML ) that will be placed in the Digital Library.
    *   For Word authors, you will need to submit your paper in single-column format to correctly auto-generate (1) a double-column PDF ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ), and (2) an accessible and responsive webpage (example HTML ) in the Digital Library.
*   **Presentation Format:** Talk at the conference delivered by one or more authors of the paper
*   **Video Preview:**
    *   Video previews are mandatory.
    *   Recommended resolution: 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   Length: 30 seconds
    *   Size: < 150 MB
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
    *   Please see the [video guide](https://uist.acm.org/2025/video-guide) for more information on producing a video preview.
    *   We strongly recommend that authors make their videos accessible through following the guidelines under [Making Video Figures Accessible](https://uist.acm.org/2025/accessibility) .
*   **Demo Fast Track:** Authors of accepted papers will be invited to participate in the UIST demo session. Details about this special/fast track of demos will be found on the demo page.
    *   Please note that a DOI will not be provided for invited demo papers. Authors interested in having a DOI for their demo paper should consider submitting to the regular demo track.
*   **Additional Notes:**
    *   Accessibility: Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. To this end, we allow 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline to provide alt-text for all figures and tables and upload video subtitles to make your optional video accessible. Allowing additional time for your paper and video submissions to be accessible will help increase the quality of the conference overall and enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. If the authors have difficulties with making their submission materials accessible, they are encouraged to contact the UIST 2025 Accessibility Chairs by emailing [accessibility2025@uist.org](mailto:accessibility2025@uist.org) and volunteers with questions or for assistance to ensure that all accessible materials are submitted by the deadline. We strongly recommend that authors read the [SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission](https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/) which describes the process to make a paper submission accessible, as well as the [SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/videos/), which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning.
    *   The author list must be complete by the abstract submission deadline. Late author changes (i.e., additions or changes of order) require approval from program chairs and may be declined or might require paper withdrawal. Ensure all authors are listed in the correct order by the abstract deadline.
    *   We will continue to put the papers up publicly on the ACM DL a week in advance of the conference.
    *   Authors may submit a rebuttal after the reviews are released. Though the ACs may indicate if the rebuttal is likely to help the paper being accepted (based on reviews and internal discussions), any author may choose to respond. A rebuttal response by Associate Chairs and external reviewers will be enforced by the Program Chairs as much as possible.
    *   The video has traditionally been due the same day as paper submissions and this has always been stressful. We will allow for 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline for uploading your optional video.
    *   Open source: Our community welcomes open source and encourages the practice of creating software/hardware and sharing it through open-source and public repositories. However, open source is not a requirement or prerequisite for acceptance. Open source, as well as many other types of artifacts (e.g., videos, datasets, raw data, appendices), is recommended but completely optional, and will not be used for evaluation criteria. The paper should be evaluated on its own merits, not depending on supporting artifacts that are not submitted by the authors.

## Posters

Posters provide an interactive forum in which authors can present their work to conference attendees during special poster sessions.

### Submission Information

*   **Submission Platform:** All materials must be submitted electronically to PCS before the submission deadline.
*   **Submission Format and Length:** The extended abstract should not exceed 2 pages (excluding references).
*   **We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow.**
*   For LaTeX authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format ([example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/UIST2025_Poster_Example.pdf)) using \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}
*   For Word authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ).
*   **Accompanying Poster:** Recommended physical size is equal to or less than 841 mm x 1189 mm (A0 size) in either portrait or landscape
*   **Accompanying Video:**
    *   Optional, but highly encouraged
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   No more than 5 minutes long
    *   Size: < 250 MB
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
*   **Maximum File Size:** Maximum total size for all files < 300 MB
*   **Anonymity:** IMPORTANT: Anonymous, i.e. authors must remove their names and affiliations throughout all submission materials (paper, videos, supplementary material) ( [anonymity policy](https://uist.acm.org/2025/author-guide/#anonymity) )
*   **Selection Process:** Reviewed
    *   Less rigorous than a paper review and does not include an author’s rebuttal. Authors may expect to receive only light feedback
    *   The submitted content is generally not required to make the same level of lasting and significant contribution as refereed content
*   **Publication:** Semi-archival, i.e., authors may re-use and re-submit the content to other peer-reviewed venues (e.g., could be reused in a future UIST full paper submission).
    *   The 2-page extended abstracts will be included in the ACM Digital Library as adjunct proceedings and distributed digitally to conference attendees. The poster design will not be included in the ACM Digital Library
*   **Presentation Format:** At least one author is requested to register and stand by their poster during the poster session to speak with conference attendees
*   **Concurrent UIST Demo Submission:** The same work cannot be submitted to both the UIST Demo and Posters tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as demo submissions and will be rejected from the Posters track
*   **Novelty of Work:** Resubmission of posters previously shown at other venues is allowed
*   Please state previous poster venues and differences from previous posters in the appropriate box in PCS
*   **Online Presentation:** UIST '25 will be held in person only. It is recommended that authors consider this before submitting their work. However, accepted submissions will not be rejected if none of the authors can travel due to unavoidable issues (e.g., visa problems). Recording options may be considered for these cases, but we anticipate them being rare.
*   In-person registration is required. We do not plan to offer any virtual or online registration options. Even if no authors can attend in person, at least one author of each accepted poster must register at the in-person attendance rate. Failure to register will result in withdrawal from the accepted posters program.
*   Authors must contact the Posters Chairs [posters2025@uist.org](mailto:posters2025@uist.org) and the Program Chairs [program2025@uist.org](mailto:program2025@uist.org) as soon as physical attendance becomes difficult.

## Demos

Demos are one of the highlights of the UIST conference. Accepted authors show implementations of novel and compelling interaction concepts, techniques, devices, and systems. We particularly encourage highly interactive demos— from novel web systems and prototype devices, to new materials, fabrication methods, XR, and large interactive installations.

### Submission Information

*   **Submission Platform:** All materials must be submitted electronically to PCS before the submission deadline.
*   **Submission Format and Length:**
    *   Demo Abstract
    *   We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow.
    *   For LaTeX authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) using \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}.
    *   For Word authors, submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) or the single-column template ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.pdf) ).
    *   We do not have a strong page limit, but we recommend that authors prepare a manuscript of ~1,500-2,000 words to equate to the double column 2-page length, often 4-5 pages in the single column (plus references). Submissions could be both single-column or double-column format in PDF. We strongly encourage to use the double-column format.
*   **Floor Plan:** The demo submission should include a PDF document describing the envisioned setup and interaction (demo hardware components, tables, chairs, lights, and other equipment) so that organizers get a good understanding of your setup. This will also allow the organizers to better consider your requirements when organizing the demonstration space at the venue. [Recommended submission template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rf91u5ioLQ0npQAIIkaOmwiP5J-fZjz61M19ezs5uSI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.h223k5sfeu1w)
*   **Demo Video:**
    *   This video should be a standalone demonstration of the work
    *   It shows the working demo in appropriate detail
    *   It will be published ahead of time (~2 weeks before the conference) on the conference website
    *   Length: up to 5 min
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
*   **Preview Video:**
    *   Video previews are mandatory (7 days grace period after camera-ready deadline)
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   Size: < 150 MB
    *   Length: 30 seconds
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
*   **Anonymity:** Demo submissions are not anonymous. Author names and institutions will be visible to the reviewing committee throughout the submission process.
*   **Selection Process:** Demos are juried by the UIST demo chairs, and there is no rebuttal phase. Due to the nature of the juried process, authors will not receive review feedback and will only be informed about the decision.
*   **Publication:** Non-archival, ideas presented as a UIST demo can be resubmitted as an extended full paper in subsequent years. Authors may choose whether demo abstracts will be included in the ACM Digital Library as Adjunct Proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees. Demos that accompany a UIST paper submitted as a fast-track submission will not be included in the ACM Digital Library as Adjunct Proceedings.
*   **Presentation Format:** At least one author is required to be physically present at the conference and present their demo during demo sessions
*   **Lab Demos:** If the authors have multiple demo submissions from the same lab/company, we can group these demos together at the venue. Please indicate the submission IDs of all demos from the same lab on the PCS submission page.
*   **Concurrent UIST Poster Submission:** The same work cannot be submitted to both the UIST demo and poster tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as a demo submission and will be rejected from the poster track
*   **Novelty of Work:** Resubmission of demos previously shown at other venues is allowed
*   **Demos of Accepted UIST 2025 Papers:**
    *   Authors of accepted full papers who also want to present a demo must submit an entry into the demos track. They have two choices:
    *   Demos that accompany accepted papers will follow a fast-track process with an abbreviated submission. Although no demo abstract is required, authors are still required to submit a video preview and other relevant data (e.g., title, abstract, floorplan). Demos accompanying full papers will not receive a separate DOI. Note that unlike in previous years, there will be no option for a fast-track submission with a DOI. Authors who wish to have their demo abstract published with a DOI in the proceedings are welcome to submit a full demo submission by the demo track deadline.
*   **Changes in author list and affiliations:**
    *   Please make sure that all authors and their affiliation are correct before submitting in PCS
    *   It is not possible to add or remove any author from a demo abstract after submission
    *   It is not possible to change the affiliation of any author after the submission
