*   **Format:** Submissions must be in English and conform to the **IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines**. Use A4 paper size PDF format. LaTeX users must use `\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}`.
*   **Submission System:** Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format before the due date via HotCRP: [https://apsec25.hotcrp.com](https://apsec25.hotcrp.com)
*   **Originality:** Submitted papers must have been neither previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop.
*   **Evaluation Criteria:** Submissions will be evaluated by at least three program committee members focusing on novelty, originality, importance to the field, proper use of research methods, and presentation.

## Double Blind Policy

APSEC 2025 uses a double-blind reviewing process. Submissions must **not reveal authors' identities**.

*   Omit authors’ names and institutions from the title page.
*   References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person (e.g., ""We build on the work of..."").
*   If a submission is a clear follow-up to previous work, references to that previous work can be anonymized (e.g., ""based on previous results [10] Anonymous Authors. Omitted for double blind reviewing.""). Ensure the submission is self-contained.
*   Do not include acknowledgements that would reveal identity.
*   Avoid accidental unblinding by using different project/work names for submissions if the original name is identifying.
*   Avoid mentioning specific institution affiliations or organizations; use general terms like ""an introductory CS course"" or ""Org/Company"" where appropriate.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract Deadline:** Sunday, July 6, 2025
*   **Paper Deadline:** Sunday, July 13, 2025

The 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2025) seeks paper submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of security and privacy. We seek articles presenting accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. Purely theoretical submissions (e.g., cryptography-focused, with no security/application connections) are not encouraged, nor are submissions focusing primarily on blockchains or machine learning.

Like in previous years, we will also be accepting “Systemisation of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. SoK submissions need to add the prefix **“SoK: ”** in the title. They will be accepted based on the value to the community. Survey papers without insights evaluating, systematizing, and contextualizing current knowledge will be rejected.

## Submission Instructions

Please read the instructions below before submitting your paper. Please get in touch with the PC chairs at [asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org](mailto:asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org) for any questions regarding the submissions.

[SUBMIT YOUR PAPER HERE](https://asiaccs2025b.hotcrp.com/)

## Paper Formatting

*   Technical papers submitted for ASIACCS must be written in English.
*   Papers must be in PDF format and at most **12 pages** double-column. We will allow up to 10 additional pages for the bibliography and well-marked appendices, but note that reviewers are not expected to read the appendices.
*   Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest [ACM Sigconf style conference template](https://www.acm.org/conference-conference-templates).
*   All fonts, images, tables, and figures must comply with common standards and not generate problems for reviewers.
*   Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:”
*   Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

## Conflicts of Interest (COI)

When submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include:

*   Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission.
*   Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past.
*   Anyone the author has collaborated with or published within the prior two years.

PC members, including chairs with a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure to declare COI or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a PC member with COI reviews a paper, it will be rejected.

## Anonymous Submissions

ASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized. Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used. The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the submission is made unless approved by the Program Chairs. Publishing the submission on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, is allowed, but authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results (e.g., social media, seminars, etc.) and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.

## Double and Concurrent Submissions

Submissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double submission will result in immediate rejection. We may report detected violations to other conference chairs and journal editors.

## Ethical Considerations

The authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence (beyond approval of the experiment by their institution) elaborating how they have thoroughly considered such issues. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns.

## Early Rejection and Appeals

There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early. The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification email. Authors’ appeals must clearly and explicitly identify substantial disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews that should be adjudicated by a particular arbitration reviewer who the PC chairs may recruit. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.

## Paper Revision and Resubmission

Rejected papers in Cycle 1 cannot be resubmitted in Cycle 2. A small number of Cycle 1 submissions may receive a “Revise” decision, rather than “Accept” or “Reject,” and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server. The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. We will request additional revisions only in exceptional circumstances.

## Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation

If a paper is accepted, the author list in the submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version. Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.

ASE is the premier research forum for Automated Software Engineering, bringing together researchers and practitioners to discuss foundations, techniques, and tools for automating software development.","# Call for Papers: ASE 2025

The IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) Conference series is the premier research forum for automated software engineering. Each year, it brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss foundations, techniques, and tools for automating the analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance of large software systems. ASE 2025 invites high-quality contributions describing significant, original, and unpublished results.

## New This Year

*   **PC Self-nomination:** We are inviting self-nominations to serve on our Program Committee. To contribute as a reviewer and help shape the technical program, please complete the PC self-nomination form: [https://forms.gle/uPZCVDeH4WzwvtmF6](https://forms.gle/uPZCVDeH4WzwvtmF6). We would greatly appreciate receiving your self-nomination by **January 10**.
*   **Major Revisions:** Instead of rejecting papers outright, reviewers have the opportunity to request changes that may require up to four weeks to accommodate. If a paper receives a 'Revision' outcome, reviewers will specify concrete and actionable revision criteria, agreeing to accept the paper in principle if these criteria are met. Authors will be notified about the outcome for their revision after it is checked by the discussion lead.
*   **Auto-bidding:** Leveraging the success at other conferences like ICSE 2025 and OOPSLA 2024, we will use the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) to streamline and automate the paper bidding and assignment process, reducing reviewer workload and increasing expertise per paper.
*   **Rapid Response Reviewers:** To handle unexpected unavailability of reviewers, we invite a small percentage of interested PC members to become Rapid Response Reviewers. They will initially review a smaller number of papers but commit to reviewing up to two additional papers within a shorter timeframe at the end of the reviewing period.

### Track I: Foundations

*   **Focus:** Foundational nature (formal, mathematical, algorithmic, or conceptual). Investigating underlying principles, computational theories, formal methods, and algorithms for modeling, automating, analyzing, and optimizing business processes. Identifying novel problems, modeling languages, architectures, conceptual papers on frameworks, taxonomies, and patterns.
*   **Evaluation:** Technical quality standards, convincing argumentation, and benefits of the contribution. Empirical evaluation is not mandatory.
*   **Audience:** Engineers building solutions on formal methods and algorithms, or the broader BPM community concerning new types of contributions.

### Track II: Engineering

*   **Focus:** Engineering aspects of BPM research, focusing on the development and investigation of artifacts and systems to solve concrete problems. Covers tools and techniques for process modeling, enactment, monitoring, and analytics (including process mining), usage in particular domains, and interaction between processes and software infrastructure.
*   **Evaluation:** Rigorous and reproducible empirical evaluations demonstrating the merits of the artifact. Self-critical discussion of limitations and threats to validity is expected. Adaptations of AI techniques for BPM must be justified.
*   **Audience:** Engineers analyzing or further developing artifacts, or analysts applying them in practice.

### Track III: Management

*   **Focus:** Empirical, socio-technical, cognitive, psychological, managerial, and societal aspects of BPM. Techniques, tools, and methods for governing business processes, advancing understanding of process-oriented capabilities, and examining the impact of BPM affordances. Includes strategic alignment, governance, methods, IT, people, and culture related to BPM.
*   **Evaluation:** Appropriate motivation and framing, rigorous research method, convincing argumentation, positioning against state-of-the-art, and demonstration of findings’ applicability and efficacy. Various research methodologies are welcome.
*   **Audience:** Managers and decision-makers seeking lessons from organizational endeavors in BPM.

Presentation of an accepted paper is a requirement for publication in the proceedings. Any paper not meeting requirements will not be included in the conference proceedings under IEEE Xplore.

## Submission Link

Submit your paper: [https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/HiPC/](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/HiPC/)

## AI-Assisted Text Usage

HiPC will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you use these services merely for language rectification. The authors should verify whether the results are accurate before submission.

As required by IEEE, the use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.

If you use AI tools, you should include an acknowledgment section to disclose the AI assistance with appropriate references to the sections in the paper, but this acknowledgment section should still abide by the double-blind submission guideline (i.e., any funding or author-related information should not be included).

## ArXiv Submission Policy

Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to HiPC 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).

## Inclusive Description of Research Contributions

Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

## Review Process

All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.

The initial decision for the submission may be Accept, Reject or Shepherd. Papers that are recommended for shepherding will have to address the comments from the reviewers, and submit a revised article along with a summary of changes. The revised manuscript will be reviewed by the shepherd and the final decision will be communicated.

*   Whether the paper is long or short must be indicated at submission time.
*   Over-length papers will be rejected without review.
*   All papers that satisfy length and formatting requirements will be reviewed against standard criteria such as relevance, originality, significance, clarity, and soundness.
*   Submissions are expected to meet the high standards of publication expected by ICAPS. Please refer to the for further details and reviewing guidelines.
*   The review process has three possible outcomes: (1) acceptance for oral presentation and inclusion in the archival proceedings; (2) acceptance for poster presentation and non-archival extended abstract; (3) rejection.
*   Papers submitted to ICAPS 2025 may not be submitted to other conferences or journals during the ICAPS 2025 review period, nor may they be already under review, accepted, or published in other conferences or journals.
*   Authors making multiple submissions must ensure that each submission has significant, unique content. Papers sharing co-authors and substantial overlap will be rejected.
*   The format of ICAPS 2025 will be **in-person**. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present their work in person, unless exceptional circumstances prevent this.

## Use of Generative AI

*   Papers that include text generated from an LLM are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as part of the paper’s experimental analysis.
*   This policy DOES NOT prohibit authors from using these technologies for editing or polishing author-written text.
*   No AI system satisfies the criteria for authorship of papers published by AAAI Press (ICAPS’ publisher) and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in such papers.
*   Authors assume full responsibility for the content of submitted work, including checking for plagiarism and authenticity of all text.

## Ethical / Societal Impact

Authors are encouraged to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences.

## Best Paper Awards and Journal Fast Track

Best non-student and student papers will be awarded. These papers may also receive an invitation to submit an extended version to a top AI journal, such as the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) or the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ).

## Submission Instructions

*   All submissions will be made electronically via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=icaps-conference.org/ICAPS/2025/Conference).
*   Submitted papers must be anonymous for double-blind reviewing.
*   Papers must adhere to the page limits of the relevant submission type (long or short) and follow the author kit instructions for formatting. The author kit can be found [here](/files/icaps2025-author-kit.zip).
*   Authors can submit supplementary material (videos, technical proofs, additional experimental results) in addition to the PDF paper.

Failure to comply with the submission instructions will result in desk rejection.

## Double-blind Requirements

*   Omit names and institutions.
*   Refer to prior work by themselves or others in the third person.
*   Ensure that acknowledgement notices or ethics statements do not include information that may identify them.
*   Authors are not discouraged from posting manuscripts onto Arxiv.org or other similar repositories, but should avoid doing so during the bidding and paper assignment process.

The 16th International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC’25) will be held in **Campinas, Brazil**, from **June 23rd to June 27th, 2025**. ICCC is the sole scientific conference dedicated to computational creativity, covering all its facets, from theoretical frameworks to practical applications.

Computational creativity is defined as the art, science, philosophy, and engineering of computational systems which, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviours that unbiased observers would deem to be creative. The field is thriving with advancements in formalizing machine creativity and exciting applications across sciences, arts, literature, and gaming.

## Themes and Topics

Original research contributions are solicited in all areas related to Computational Creativity research and practice, including but not limited to:

*   **Applications of Computational Creativity:** in music, language, games, visual arts, design, architecture, entertainment, education, mathematical invention, scientific discovery, programming.
*   **Human-Machine Co-Creativity:** systems, studies, frameworks, or methodologies related to co-creativity between humans and AI, emphasizing machine as a creative partner.
*   **Computational Creativity Evaluation:** metrics, frameworks, formalisms, and methodologies for evaluating creativity in computational systems or their societal perception.
*   **Social Models:** computational models of social aspects of creativity, including social creativity, diffusion of ideas, collaboration, team dynamics, and creativity in social settings.
*   **Computational Paradigms:** computational approaches for modelling cognitive aspects of creativity, such as heuristic search, analogical and meta-level reasoning, cognitive architectures, and re-representation.
*   **Interdisciplinary Perspectives:** drawing from philosophy and/or sociology in the context of creative AI systems.
*   **Data and Creativity:** data science approaches, resource development, and data gathering/knowledge curation for creative AI, with a focus on scalable, extensible, and open-source datasets.
*   **Societal Impact:** ethical considerations in the design, deployment, or testing of creative AI systems, and studies on the societal impact of computational creativity and generative AI.
*   **Psychological Factors:** computational models of psychological factors enhancing creativity (emotion, surprise, reflection, motivation, etc.), as well as social or experiential factors related to novelty and originality.
*   **Provocations:** raising new issues that question the foundations of the discipline or shed new light on debates.

A note on generative AI models: While welcomed, applications must be properly situated in the CC literature and evaluated according to field standards.

## Paper Types

We welcome five types of full papers:

*   **Technical papers:** Focus on hypotheses about creative behaviour in computational systems, requiring solid experimentation, models, proof, or argumentation, with strong evaluation.
*   **System or Resource description papers:** Describe the building and deployment of a creative system or resource, emphasizing engineering achievement, technical challenges, reusable resources, and some evaluation.
*   **Study papers:** Draw on allied fields (psychology, philosophy, etc.) or appeal to broader AI/CS areas, providing novel perspectives on CC systems or their evaluation.
*   **Cultural application papers:** Present the use of creative software in a cultural setting (art exhibitions, concerts, literature, games, etc.), detailing the system's role, results, and feedback.
*   **Position papers:** Present opinions on CC research, future directions, speculative explorations, or current issues, requiring careful argumentation and thorough knowledge of the field.

The 20th International Symposium on Parameterized and Exact Computation (IPEC 2025) invites papers presenting original research in the area of parameterized and exact algorithms and complexity.

Papers can be submitted via Easychair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ipec2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ipec2025) (please see submission and coi guidelines below).

## Topics

The topics include but are not limited to:

*   new techniques for the design and analysis of parameterized and exact algorithms;
*   fixed-parameter tractability and kernelization results;
*   parameterized complexity theory;
*   parameterized (in)approximability results;
*   relationships between parameterized complexity and traditional complexity classifications;
*   applications of parameterized and exact computation;
*   engineering and experimentation of exact, parameterized, and kernelization algorithms.

## Important Dates

*   Abstract submission / paper registration: **June 27th** (23:59 AoE)
*   Submission deadline: **June 30th** (23:59 AoE)
*   Notification: **August 7th**
*   IPEC dates: **Sept. 17—19** (Wed-Fri)
*   Camera-ready version: **October 10th** (23:59 AoE)
*   *AoE=Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12)*

## Submission Guidelines

*   Each submission is required to be in the `LIPIcs` format; no changes to font size, page margins, etc., are permitted. Line numbers must be activated.
*   We welcome submissions of the full version of the paper. Regardless, the first **12 pages** of the submission (excluding the title page) should be enough to assess the paper and contain a summary of the main results, their motivation and importance, and evidence of their correctness. In particular, PC members and potential subreviewers may treat the first 12 pages as the short version (the rest being read at their discretion).
*   Results previously published in conference proceedings or a journal (or scheduled for publication prior to IPEC) or under simultaneous submission will not be considered.
*   PC members (outside the PC chairs) are allowed to author or coauthor submissions.
*   **Double-blind reviewing:** As in previous years, IPEC 2025 employs a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. In case there exist publicly available versions of the submission online, the authors might mention this in their submission (without providing references/links), and briefly explain the differences if any. Alternatively, they might communicate the details to the chairs, who will keep them confidential unless revealing them to the PC is needed for a fair judgement. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC chairs.

## Conflicts of Interest

IPEC takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, seriously. Authors are responsible for declaring conflicts of interest with any of the PC members.

You have a conflict of interest with:

*   family members and close friends;
*   Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years;
*   people with the same affiliation;
*   involved in an alleged incident of harassment (it is not required that the incident be reported);
*   reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter); and
*   frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.

## Conference and Paper Publication

Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the symposium, and to incorporate the comments from the program committee.

The conference proceedings will be published in the **Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs)** series after the conference (post-proceedings).

The final submission will be made in LIPIcs format, with a higher page limit of **15 pages** plus bibliography (no appendix). More details will follow from LIPIcs upon acceptance. The submissions will be published as post-proceedings.

## Awards

A **best paper award** and a **best student paper award** may be conferred. All submissions are eligible for the best paper award, except submissions co-authored by PC members. Submissions of which all authors are students at the time of submission are also eligible for the best student paper award. Papers meeting the requirement for the best student paper award should indicate this during submission.

Besides the best paper and best student paper award, during the IPEC conference, the [IPEC Nerode Prize](https://eatcs.org/index.php/nerode-prize) will be conferred. The winner(s) will be chosen by a separate award committee; please refer to the webpage for details.",sub: 2/3

## Update

**2025-03-06:** One week submission extension, submissions now due **2025-03-18 (AoE UTC-12h)**.

## Expanded Scope

Continuing from ISMM 2024, we are excited to announce the continued expanded scope of ISMM this year to encourage submissions and participation from related fields such as **computer architecture** and **computer systems** in addition to our core PL community!

## Solicitation

The 2025 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2025) is soliciting full-length submissions covering new work on all memory management related topics in both software and hardware (and their cooperation), as well as papers presenting confirmations or refutations of important prior results.

In addition to regular papers, traditionally submitted to ISMM, we also invite submissions of the following kinds:

*   **Surveys and comparative analyses** that shed new light on previously published techniques.
*   **Practitioner reports**, describing experience with memory management in production. Such papers are not expected to provide novel research contributions, but they should not have been previously published.
*   **Intellectual abstracts**, where researchers share designs, algorithms, or theory that may be interesting to the memory management community, but not yet evaluated.

Please indicate whether the paper is a regular paper, a survey, a practitioner report, or an intellectual abstract, by using a subtitle. For example, for a regular paper, include on of the following on the line below the title line:

`\subtitle{This submission is a regular paper},
\subtitle{This submission is a survey},
\subtitle{This submission is a practitioner report},
\subtitle{This submission is an intellectual abstract}.`

ISMM 2025 will be colocated with [PLDI 2025](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/).

## Areas of Interest

Areas of interest include but are not limited to (in no particular order):

*   Garbage collection algorithms and implementations
*   Memory allocation and de-allocation
*   Memory system design and analysis (both software and hardware)
*   Hardware support for memory management
*   Memory management for large-scale data-intensive systems
*   Memory management at datacenter and cloud scales
*   Formal analysis and verification of memory management algorithms
*   Compiler analyses to aid memory management
*   Tools to analyze memory usage and characteristics of programs
*   Empirical analysis of memory intensive programs
*   Formal analysis and verification of memory intensive programs
*   Memory management for machine learning systems
*   Programming and management of emerging or persistent memories
*   Caches, memory controllers, memory hierarchies and their management
*   Cache coherence and memory consistency
*   Processing in memory (including processing near and using memory)
*   Memory technology and architecture (SRAM, DRAM, flash, NVM, emerging technologies)
*   Security and privacy of memory systems
*   Robustness of memory systems
*   Low-latency and low-energy memory systems

The symposium welcomes industry practitioners presenting their recent practice and findings in memory management related to real-world deployments.

## Submission Link

[https://ismm25.hotcrp.com](https://ismm25.hotcrp.com)

## Formatting Instructions

*   All papers must be submitted on-line in **Portable Document Format (PDF)**.
*   Papers should be formatted according to the **two-column ACM proceedings format**. Each paper should have no more than **12 pages**, excluding bibliography, in **10pt font**.
*   There is no limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al).
*   The citations should be in **numeric style**, e.g., `[52]`.
*   Submissions should be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper.
*   Make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale.
*   Appendices should not be part of the paper, but should be submitted as supplementary material. Supplementary material should also be anonymized, as described below.
*   As explained in more detail at [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author), authors should use the `sigplan` subformat of the `acmart` format. Please note the following:
    ```latex
    \documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart}
    \settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}
    ```
*   The default citation style is numeric.
*   Do not mess with the class file or settings to try to sneak in additional space.
*   Do not use the PACMPL files or format; ISMM is not using them.

Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

ISMM uses **double-blind reviewing**. This means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. These are firm submission requirements. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized.

An earlier FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs – [FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2023-pldi#FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing). If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, or any cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ, please contact the Program Chairs. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Program Chairs than to risk summary rejection.

## Declaring Conflicts

When submitting the paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).

Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.

## Publication Date

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## Author Response

The author response process will occur in **April 2025**, and will give the authors an opportunity to respond to factual errors in reviews before the Program Committee meets to make its decisions.

## Important Dates (AoE - UTC-12h)

*   **Paper submission:** Tue 18 Mar 2025
*   **Author response period:** Wed 23 - Fri 25 Apr 2025

The IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the field of real-time systems, where researchers and practitioners showcase innovations covering all aspects of real-time systems, including theory, design, analysis, implementation, verification, evaluation, and experience.

## Scope of the Conference

RTSS’25, the 46th edition of the event, continues the tradition of embracing new and emerging areas of real-time systems research. It is an expansive and inclusive event.

## Tracks

RTSS’25 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems theory and practice. Manuscripts may be submitted to either of the following tracks:

### Track 1: Real-Time Systems and Foundations

This track focuses on the practical and theoretical foundations that enable predictable timing in computing systems. This includes core real-time operating systems components, schedulability analysis, scheduling algorithms, theoretical foundations, and verification methods. Topics of interest also cover timing analysis (e.g., WCET analysis), real-time and time-sensitive networking, timing-predictable hardware architectures, modeling and analysis of stochastic real-time systems, fault tolerance, security in relation to timing guarantees, compiler techniques, system synthesis, model-driven engineering, and applied formal methods.

**Artificial Intelligence for Real-Time Systems Foundations:** RTSS invites contributions on the use of AI and machine learning techniques to advance real-time scheduling, timing analysis, resource management, and system optimization under timing constraints.

### Track 2: Design and Applications

This track focuses on real-time systems in a broader systems context, emphasizing novel research on designs, implementations, and applications where real-time requirements are integral. It explores how tools and techniques are adapted and applied to specific application domains.

*   **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS):** Applications in transportation, healthcare, industrial control, etc., that interact closely with the physical world. Topics include enabling technologies, application-specific solutions, design methodologies, tool chains, CPS architectures, secure CPS, performance analysis, robustness, safety, certification, and hardware/software co-design.
*   **Real-Time System Design for Artificial Intelligence:** Practical implementation of AI components in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. Focuses on designing real-time systems to deploy AI under real-time constraints, including system design, frameworks, resource management, hardware acceleration, and AI safety in CPS.
*   **HW-SW Integration and System-Level Design:** Design methodologies and tools for hardware/software integration and co-design in embedded systems. Topics include architecture description languages, hardware architectures, design space exploration, synthesis, optimization, SoC design, FPGA-based simulation, emerging trends like RISC-V, and AI/ML hardware accelerators.
*   **Internet of Things (IoT):** Addressing challenges in IoT with resource constraints, scalability demands, and dynamic environments. Topics include real-time capabilities in IoT, distributed sensing and control, low-latency processing, edge computing, fog computing, and AI-at-the-edge.

The 2025 USENIX Annual Technical Conference (ATC '25) will be held from **July 7–9, 2025**, at the **Sheraton Boston in Boston, MA, USA**. It is co-located with the **19th USENIX Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation (OSDI '25)**.

## Overview

The USENIX ATC '25 seeks original, high-quality submissions that improve and further the knowledge of computing systems, with an emphasis on implementations and experimental results. Submissions are welcome for systems of all scales, from embedded mobile devices to data centers and clouds. The scope covers all practical aspects related to computer systems, including operating systems, runtime systems, parallel and distributed systems, storage, networking, security and privacy, virtualization, software-hardware interactions, performance evaluation, reliability, energy management, and bug-finding.

USENIX ATC '25 particularly encourages new ideas and approaches, and values submissions accompanied by clearly defined artifacts (traces, data, source code, tools) not previously available.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum.
*   Papers will be judged on relevance, novelty, technical merit, correctness, and clarity. Flawed ideas or designs may lead to rejection.
*   **USENIX ATC '25 will employ double-blind reviewing.** Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   Papers need to be registered, and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract will be rejected.
*   An optional artifact evaluation process will be available for accepted papers.

## Submission Type: Full vs. Short

*   **Full submissions:** Must not exceed **12 pages** (excluding references and appendices).
*   **Short submissions:** Must not exceed **6 pages** (excluding references and appendices).
*   Both types are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in scope. Short papers present a complete idea that is properly evaluated.
*   Optionally, authors can include an appendix for material not central to the contributions (e.g., algorithm details, proofs, code snippets).
*   For further details, see the [submission instructions](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc25/submission-instructions).

Double-blind stage. Striving for at least three reviews per submission. Initial recommendations: Conditionally accept as IEEE TVCG paper, Conditionally accept as conference paper, Recommend as a two-page poster, or Reject.
*   **Review Cycle II (Initial notification to Final decision):** Revision of conditionally accepted papers reviewed by the coordinator for final recommendation.

### Additional Guidelines

*   **Abstract Submission:** Abstract must be uploaded seven days prior to the paper submission deadline.
*   **Ethics and Responsibility:** All research experiments with human participants must follow institutional ethical guidelines and secure ethics committee approval. Approval details must be reported in the submission system.
*   **Participant Diversity:** Research with human participants should strive for participant diversity and report demographics. Submissions making general claims with imbalanced participant groups may be negatively impacted.
*   **Review Duties for Authors:** One author per submitted paper must register to review up to three papers through PCS.
*   **Presentation at the Conference:** All accepted submissions must be presented orally at the conference. In-person presentation is expected; online presentations are accommodated only in exceptional cases.
*   **Submission Language:** All submissions must be in English.
*   **Previous Publication and Plagiarism:** Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously published or simultaneously under consideration elsewhere. Builds upon prior work can be submitted with additional papers and an explanation letter (seen by primary reviewer). Plagiarism will be checked using IEEE Crosscheck and may lead to rejection.
*   **AI-generated Text:** Large-scale language models (LLMs) can only be used for grammar editing.
*   **Submission Anonymity:** IEEE VR uses a DOUBLE-BLIND review process. Submissions must not contain author identifying information. Citations to authors' previous work must be in the third person. Failure to adhere to the double-blind policy will result in desk rejection.
*   **Pre-dissemination:** Uploading manuscripts to online repositories before the review process does not constitute a reason for rejection but can compromise anonymity.
*   **Videos:** Videos must be submitted according to instructions, free of identifying information. Accepted videos for the video proceedings will require a revised version.

Submissions will be assigned to two members of the ISMAR 2025 International Program Committee (IPC). Submissions that violate the submission guidelines will be desk rejected. Those that are not desk rejected will receive at least three full reviews.

Based on reviews and discussions, the Program Chairs will make one of the following initial recommendations:

*   **Revise and Resubmit:** These submissions will go through a second review cycle. A revise and resubmit recommendation does not guarantee acceptance.
*   **Reject:** Authors may resubmit rejected papers to the poster track.

### Review Cycle II (Revision with Rebuttal to Final Decision)

Authors will have time to revise their submissions and write a rebuttal. The revised submission and rebuttal will be reviewed, leading to a final recommendation by the committee.

4.  Referring to related work, particularly your own, in the third person. Avoid omitting references.
5.  If citing anonymous work, send deanonymized references to the PC chairs via email.
6.  Authors may use a non-anonymized version for other purposes but must not mention submission to ISSRE 2025.

Submissions violating formatting and anonymization rules will be desk rejected.

## Formatting Rules

*   Submissions must adhere to the IEEE Computer Society Format Guidelines using the provided LaTeX/Word templates.
*   Each paper must be submitted as a single Portable Document Format (PDF) file with embedded fonts.
*   The first page must include the title and a maximum 200-word abstract.
*   Figures and graphs should be readable in grayscale.
*   Symbols and labels in graphs should be readable when printed.
*   Limit file size to less than 15 MB.
*   Authors are encouraged to supply source code and raw data for reproducibility.

## Paper Submission

*   Papers are submitted via Easychair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=issre2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=issre2025)
*   Submissions will be reviewed via a double-blind process. Papers with non-disclosure agreement forms will be rejected.
*   Changes in author numbers/order are not allowed after acceptance.
*   Submissions violating formatting and anonymization rules will be desk rejected without review.

## Review Process and Author Response

Reviews will be made available to authors before the PC/Board meeting for factual error correction. Responses should be concise and focus on reviewer concerns. The new ""Early Decisions"" system will categorize papers as ""Accept"", ""Reject"", or ""Response Recommended"" early on, reducing the need for responses in many cases.

## Awards

*   **Best Research Paper Award:** Awarded annually to the best paper in the Research Track.

## Submission Website

*   [Spring Cycle HotCRP](https://asplos26-spring.hotcrp.com/)

## Scope and Expectations

ASPLOS 2026 covers all practical aspects related to computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems, as well as closely-related associated areas. This includes topics such as:

*   Existing, emerging, and nontraditional compute platforms at all scales
*   Heterogeneous architectures and accelerators
*   Internet services, cloud computing, and datacenters
*   Memory, storage, networking, and I/O
*   Power, energy, and thermal management
*   Profiling, debugging, and testing
*   Security, reliability, and availability
*   Systems for enabling parallelism and computation on big data
*   Virtualization and virtualized systems

We seek original, high-quality research submissions that improve and further the knowledge of applied computer systems, with emphasis on the intersection between the main ASPLOS disciplines: Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Computer Architecture and Emerging Hardware. Submissions may target diverse goals such as throughput, latency, energy, and security. We value submissions accompanied by clearly defined artifacts and encourage new ideas and approaches.

## Explicit Assessment of Interdisciplinary Research

This interdisciplinary nature will be a significant factor in acceptance decisions. Authors must identify and justify the core disciplines their paper contributes to. Papers with only a single specified discipline are less likely to be accepted, and low relevance scores from reviewers will affect acceptance chances. Papers deemed to not fit the selected disciplines may be rejected without review.

## Resubmissions

*   Papers rejected from ASPLOS'25 Spring may be submitted to ASPLOS'26 Spring.
*   Papers rejected from ASPLOS'25 Summer may be submitted to ASPLOS'26 Summer.
*   Papers rejected from ASPLOS'25 Fall may be submitted to ASPLOS'26 Summer.
*   Papers withdrawn after reviews are considered ""rejected"" and are subject to resubmission rules.

## Limit on Submissions

The number of submissions by the same author is limited to **5 submissions per submission cycle**.

## Major Revisions

Some submissions may receive a ""Major Revision"" decision. Authors will have the opportunity to revise their work based on reviewer feedback and resubmit within 6 weeks. Revised submissions can use up to 13 pages (2 more than the original submission limit).

## Declaring Areas and Topics

Authors should indicate up to 3 relevant topics on the submission form to aid reviewer assignment. Incorrect selection may lead to less competent reviewers.

## Anonymization

ASPLOS employs a **double-blind review process**. Authors must anonymize their submissions by avoiding explicit or implicit identification of themselves or their institutions in the submitted documents, including metadata. Cite your own work as if by a third party or use anonymized supplemental material. Contact the program chairs for exceptions.

## Anonymized Supplemental Material and Appendixes

Supplemental material and appendixes may be submitted with no page limit but are not required reading for reviewers and should not be used to circumvent the main page limit.

## Declaring Conflicts of Interest (COI)

Authors must register all conflicts in the HotCRP submission page. Failure to declare or false declaration of conflicts may result in summary rejection. Specific guidelines for declaring COIs with institutions, individuals, and collaborations are provided.

## Declaring Authors

All authors must be declared upfront. Additions or removals after acceptance require program chair approval.

## Originality and Concurrent Submissions

Submitted manuscripts must be original and not substantially similar to prior publications or under review elsewhere. Technical reports and arXiv.org uploads are not considered prior publications.

## Ethical and Other Obligations

Authors must not break anonymity, contact reviewers/PC members inappropriately, advertise their work during certain periods, or post reviews publicly before results are announced. Adherence to the ACM ethics policy and ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects is mandatory.

## Formatting and Editing

*   Submissions must be PDF files, using the ACM's acmart Latex class with the sigplan proceedings template.
*   **Page Limit:** 11 pages (excluding references and appendices).
*   **Page Size:** US Letter (8.5in x 11in).
*   **Margins:** 1in top/bottom, 0.75in left/right.
*   **Layout:** 2-column, single-spaced text.
*   **Font Size:** 10pt for main text; figures/tables/captions must be legible (>= 8pt, preferably >= 9pt).
*   **References:** No page limit; include full author names, clickable links/DOIs. References should be hyperlinked to citations.
*   ""Squeezing"" space using \vspace or similar is forbidden and may lead to rejection.

## Author Response Period

Authors will have an opportunity to respond to reviews, focusing on correcting factual errors and addressing reviewer questions. Rebuttals are optional but encouraged and should be kept under 800 words.

## Accepted Papers

Accepted papers are conditionally accepted, pending revision and shepherd approval. They are allowed +2 pages in the proceedings (more pages for a fee). At least one author is expected to attend physically to present. Accepted papers will be published online and in separate volumes.

## Artifact Evaluation

Artifact evaluation will continue in 2026. Refer to the ASPLOS 2026 AEC web page for details.

## Poster and Lightning Sessions

Poster and lightning sessions may be included; details will be announced later.

## Wild and Crazy Ideas (WACI) Session

Submission deadlines are firm; late submissions will not be considered.

## Submission Process

All submissions will be electronic via [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lics25](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lics25).

## Formatting Instructions

*   Every full paper must be submitted in the IEEE Proceedings 2-column 10pt format.
*   Papers may be at most **12 pages**, excluding references.
*   Please use IEEEtran.cls version V1.8b, updated 2024. LaTeX style files are available at ieee.org.
*   The paper must be in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee to assess the merits of the paper.
*   It should begin with a succinct statement of the issues, a summary of the main results, and a brief explanation of their significance and relevance to the conference and to computer science, all phrased for the non-specialist. Technical development directed to the specialist should follow.
*   References and comparisons with related work must be included.
*   (If necessary, detailed proofs of technical results may be included in a clearly-labeled appendix, to be consulted at the discretion of program committee members.)
*   Submissions not conforming to the above requirements will be rejected without further consideration.
*   Papers authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed, with at most one submission per PC member.
*   Results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere.
*   The program chair must be informed, in advance of submission, of any closely related work submitted or about to be submitted to a conference or journal.
*   Authors of accepted papers are expected to sign copyright release forms.
*   One author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference. Remote presentations can be organized for authors who are not able to attend the meeting.

## Review Process

LICS 2025 will use a **lightweight double-blind reviewing process**.

To facilitate this process:

*   Author names and institutions must be omitted.
*   References to the authors' own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not ""We build on our previous work ..."" but rather ""We build on the work of ..."").

## Awards and Special Issues

*   **Kleene Award:** For the best student paper(s).
*   **Distinguished Papers:** Around 10% of accepted papers will be selected.
*   **Special Issues:** Full versions of up to three accepted papers will be invited for submission to the Journal of the ACM. Additional selected papers will be invited to a special issue of Logical Methods in Computer Science.
