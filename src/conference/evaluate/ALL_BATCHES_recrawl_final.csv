The 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy. CCS has two review cycles in 2025.

## Review Cycles and Decisions

For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:

*   **Accept:** Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference, possibly after making minor changes with the oversight of a shepherd.
*   **Minor revision:** Papers in this category are considered promising but need some minor additional work. Authors will be given the opportunity to resubmit such papers, with appropriate revisions. The revised paper will then be re-evaluated.
*   **Reject:** Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Papers rejected from the first review cycle may not be submitted again to the second review cycle.

Authors of each accepted paper must ensure that at least one author registers for the conference, and that their paper is presented in-person at the conference if at all possible.

## Paper Submission Information

*   All submissions must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the corresponding deadline.
*   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings.
*   All submissions should be properly anonymized. Papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   Authors may submit up to a maximum of 7 papers for Cycle B.
*   Submitted papers will be evaluated based on their merits, particularly their importance to practical aspects of computer and communications security and privacy, novelty, quality of execution, and presentation.
*   For papers that might raise ethical concerns, authors are expected to convince reviewers that proper procedures (such as IRB approval or responsible disclosure) have been followed.
*   No modifications to the author list on a paper may be made after submission.

## Mandatory Reviewing

Authors submitting 3 papers or more may be required to submit reviews for other papers at CCS 2025. Failure to provide requested information may result in desk rejection.

## Withdrawing Policy

A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent, the paper cannot be withdrawn.

## Paper Format

*   Submissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format using ""sigconf"" 2-column format.
*   Maximum length: 12 pages, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material.
*   Reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material.
*   Authors should not change the font or the margins of the ACM format.
*   Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.

## Providing Artifacts at Submission Time

Submissions whose claimed contributions rely on artifacts (e.g., code, models, data sets) are expected to make these accessible to the reviewers, unless there are good reasons not to.

## Optional Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to submit artifacts for an optional Artifact Evaluation (AE) process.

## Conference Tracks

CCS features a multi-track format. Authors must select one track at the time of submission.

The 26th International Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications (**ACM HotMobile 2025**) will be held on **February 26-27, 2025**, in **Palm Springs, CA**. Sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE, HotMobile is a highly selective, interactive workshop focused on mobile applications, systems, and environments, and their underlying state-of-the-art technologies. Its small workshop format is ideal for processing and discussing new directions or controversial approaches.

## Call for Papers (Full Papers)

We solicit submissions of papers that (1) focus primarily on systems and applications and (2) propose new directions of research, advocate non-traditional approaches to old (or new) ideas, or generate controversy and discussion. We especially encourage papers that identify fundamental open questions, advocate a new approach, offer a constructive critique of the state-of-the-art, debunk existing assumptions, report unexpected early results, report on promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Novel ideas need not be supported by full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations suffice. The program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion over a “6-pages conference paper.”

## Scope of the Conference

The IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the field of real-time systems. It serves as a platform for researchers and practitioners to showcase innovations covering all aspects of real-time systems, including theory, design, analysis, implementation, verification, evaluation, and experience. RTSS’25, the 46th edition, continues the tradition of embracing new and emerging areas of real-time systems research.

## Tracks

RTSS’25 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems theory and practice. Manuscripts may be submitted to either of the following tracks:

### Track 1: Real-Time Systems and Foundations

This track focuses on the practical and theoretical foundations that enable predictable timing in computing systems.
*   **Core topics:** Real-time operating systems components (kernels, hypervisors, middleware, runtime environments), schedulability analysis and scheduling algorithms, theoretical foundations, verification methods.
*   **Timing analysis:** Worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis, measurement-based timing analysis (MBTA).
*   **Other areas:** Real-time and time-sensitive networking, timing-predictable hardware architectures, modeling and analysis of stochastic real-time systems, statistical and empirical approaches to timing predictability.
*   **Fault tolerance and security:** Real-time systems under adversarial conditions (e.g., timing-based side-channel attacks), secure communication in time-sensitive networks.
*   **Cross-layer predictability:** Hardware, operating systems, and applications.
*   **Enabling technologies:** Compiler techniques, system synthesis, model-driven engineering, applied formal methods (model checking, proof-based verification).
*   **Experimental contributions:** System designs, case studies, and experience reports.
*   **Artificial Intelligence for Real-Time Systems Foundations:** Use of machine learning and other AI techniques to advance real-time scheduling, timing analysis, resource management, and system optimization under timing constraints. (Focus is on AI *for* real-time systems foundations, not real-time systems *for* AI, which is Track 2).

### Track 2: Design and Applications

This track focuses on real-time systems in a broader systems context, emphasizing novel research on designs, implementations, and applications. It explores how tools and techniques are adapted and applied to specific application domains.

*   **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS):** Safety-critical, autonomous, and robotic systems interacting with the physical world. Includes theoretical foundations, design methodologies, simulation and emulation, tool chains, architectures, secure CPS, performance analysis, robustness, safety, certification, and hardware/software co-design.
*   **Real-Time System Design for Artificial Intelligence:** Practical implementation of AI components (perception, planning, decision-making) in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. Design of real-time systems to deploy AI under real-time constraints. Topics include system design, frameworks, resource management, hardware acceleration, and case studies. Also covers AI safety in CPS: verification/validation of learning-enabled components, runtime monitoring, safe exploration, explainability, and robustness.
*   **HW-SW Integration and System-Level Design:** Methodologies and tools for hardware/software integration and co-design in modern embedded systems. Includes architecture description languages, hardware architectures, design space exploration, synthesis, optimization. Focus on SoC design for real-time workloads, custom memory hierarchies, multi-core architectures, communication infrastructure. Emerging trends like RISC-V, AI/ML hardware accelerators, and chiplet-based design are of strong interest.
*   **Internet of Things (IoT):** Challenges such as resource constraints, scalability demands, and dynamic environments. Focus on enabling real-time capabilities in IoT applications (distributed sensing/control, reliable communication, low-latency processing). Edge computing, fog computing, and AI-at-the-edge for responsiveness. Application domains include smart cities, industrial IoT, smart healthcare. 5G/6G for real-time and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and in-network computing.

## Timing Requirements

To be in scope, **ALL submissions must explicitly address some form of real-time requirements / constraints**.

Common examples include (but are not limited to) deadlines, response-time bounds, thresholds on acceptable tail latencies (as found in service level agreements - SLAs), as well as statistical and stochastic notions of timeliness.

Other forms of real-time requirements may be considered if the submission provides a compelling justification that the problem requires a nontrivial resource allocation, programming, scheduling, or design approach to satisfy timing-predictability requirements.

Improving average-case performance without regard to other criteria is **not** considered addressing a real-time requirement. However, improving average-case performance while ensuring worst-case latency or execution time variability is not worsened *is* considered addressing a real-time requirement.

RTSS especially welcomes new and emerging topics that address novel aspects of real-time requirements, such as machine learning techniques for real-time systems, system design for real-time machine learning, resource management in autonomous systems, and system-level solutions for real-time applications exploiting domain-specific accelerators.

When in doubt, please contact the track chairs for clarification.

## Surveys and User Studies

Empirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field is also welcome. This type of research uses surveys, questionnaires, interviews, use-cases, or other empirical techniques to obtain information about the past/current/future state of play in the research, design, development, verification, validation, and deployment of real-time systems.

(Note that literature surveys that solely classify, review, and summarize existing research papers are not considered empirical research and are not in scope of the conference.)

## Proceedings and Awards

All accepted papers will appear in the main program and proceedings, provided they are presented at the conference.

A selection of papers will receive recognition as outstanding papers and will be highlighted as such in the proceedings. **Best paper**, **best student paper**, and **best presentation** awards will be presented at the conference. Submissions are eligible for the best student paper award if the first author is a student as of the submission deadline.

## Important Dates

*   **Submission Deadline (firm):** May 22, 2025 (anywhere on Earth)
*   **Author Response Period:** July 14-17, 2025
*   **Author Notification:** July 25, 2025
*   **Camera-Ready Deadline:** September 16, 2025 (tentative)
*   **Conference:** December 2–5, 2025

## Submission Guidelines

*   Submissions are accepted through the conference site: [https://rtss25.hotcrp.com](https://rtss25.hotcrp.com).
*   **Supplemental materials** such as source code, mechanized proofs, data sets, formal models, short demo videos, etc., can be uploaded alongside manuscripts (up to 600 MB, as a ZIP archive). Ideally, each submitted artifact should contain a README with a table of contents, an overview or guidance for reviewers, and reproduction instructions (if applicable).
*   Authors should use the official option to provide supplemental materials rather than linking to external repositories.
*   Refer to the [paper submission guidelines](https://2025.rtss.org/paper-submission/) for further details.

## Policy on Remote Participation

RTSS’25 is an in-person conference. However, exceptions can be made for authors on a case-by-case basis according to the following TCRTS guidance:

> In-person presentations are expected. However, if an author has a valid reason why neither they nor their co-authors can attend the conference in person, then exceptions can potentially be made at the discretion of the Program Chair. Authors who know in advance that this will apply to them, for example because they cannot get a visa for the host country, should contact the Program Chair prior to paper submission.
>
> Following existing TCRTS policy, one author will be required to register for the conference at the “in-person” rate (either student or full) in any case.

Please contact the track chairs by email via [rtss25-track-chairs@mpi-sws.org](mailto:rtss25-track-chairs@mpi-sws.org) if you would like to inquire about a possible exception or in case of any questions.",các impDate sai hết
