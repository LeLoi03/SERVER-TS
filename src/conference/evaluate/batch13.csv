## Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) 2025

The 16th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) conference will take place **in person** at **Columbia University** from **January 7 - January 10, 2025**.

ITCS seeks to promote research with innovative or bold agendas, which could be conceptual, technical, or methodological, and whose message will advance and inspire the greater theory community. The program committee welcomes papers introducing a new concept, model or understanding; opening a new line of inquiry within traditional or interdisciplinary areas; introducing new mathematical techniques and methodologies, or new applications of known techniques; putting forth a bold, even if preliminary, vision or line of attack; or unearthing novel or surprising connections between different topics.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract submission deadline:** September 3, 2024
*   **Submission deadline:** September 5, 2024
*   **Notification to authors:** November 2, 2024
*   **Conference dates:** January 7-January 10, 2025

## Submission Instructions

Authors should register and submit their paper via the [hotcrp submission site](https://itcs2025.hotcrp.com/) by the strict deadlines.

*   The font size should be at least 11 point and the paper should be single column.
*   Beyond these, there are no specific formatting requirements.
*   Authors are required to submit a COI (Conflict of Interest) declaration upon submission.

## Review Process

The conference will employ a **lightweight double-blind reviewing process**.

*   Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.
*   This process is intended to help PC members and external reviewers come to a judgment without unconscious bias.
*   Important references should not be omitted or anonymized.
*   Authors are encouraged to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would, including posting papers to arXiv/ECCC/IACR.

## Paper Content & Style

*   Authors should strive to make their paper accessible not only to experts in their subarea, but also to the theory community at large.
*   The submission should include clear proofs of all central claims.
*   It is strongly recommended that the paper contain, within the first 10 pages, a concise and clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its significance, innovations, and place within (or outside) of our field's scope and literature.
*   The committee will put a premium on writing that conveys clearly, in as simple and straightforward a manner as possible, what the paper accomplishes.

## PC Member Submissions

Submissions authored by program committee members (with the exception of the PC chair) are allowed. Utmost care will be taken to avoid COIs with PC submissions, ensuring that such submissions receive no unfair advantage, and that the reviews and discussion remain confidential from the authors.

## Confidentiality

All submissions will be treated as confidential and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees. The program committee may consult with journal editors and program chairs of other conferences about controversial issues such as parallel submissions.

## Prior, Simultaneous, and Subsequent Submissions

*   Results published/presented/submitted at another archival conference will not be considered for ITCS.
*   Simultaneous submission to ITCS and to a journal is allowed.
*   Papers accepted to ITCS should not be submitted to any other archival conferences.

## Online Posting

Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible online repository such as the arXiv, the ECCC, or the Cryptology ePrint archive. It is generally expected that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers, with proofs, available before the conference begins.

## Conference Presentation

*   All talks are expected to be in person.
*   Talks in the conference will not be recorded. Instead, authors of each paper will be asked to upload a 20-25 minute talk, which will be posted online.

## Graduating Bits

Participants nearing graduation (on either side) will be given an opportunity to present (in 2-3 minutes) their results, research, plans, personality, and so on during the ""Graduating bits"" session. Details on how to participate will be provided closer to the conference date.

## Awards

The committee may award a ""best student paper"" award.

## Code of Conduct

ITCS is committed to an inclusive conference experience, respectful of all participants, and free from any discrimination or harassment. All ITCS attendees are expected to behave accordingly. If you experience or witness discrimination, harassment, or other unethical behavior at the conference, we encourage you to seek advice by contacting SafeToC advocates (http://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/).

## Proceedings

The accepted papers will be published by LIPIcs in the electronic proceedings of the conference. Authors of accepted papers can ask the PC chair to have only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the PDF of the full paper on an online archive."

## Paper Categories and Submission

We welcome **regular papers** and **short papers**.

### Submission Process

Submission for both categories is **lightweight double-blind**. This means that:

1.  Author names and institutions must be omitted using the `anonymous` option of the document class.
2.  References to authors’ own related work should be in the third person.
3.  The identity of authors will be revealed to reviewers once they have submitted a first draft of their review.

*Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing it more difficult. Important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. Authors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as usual.* 

### Regular Papers

*   Must be no more than **16 pages** in length excluding bibliographic references.
*   Must not include an appendix.
*   Must be in LIPIcs format.

### Short Papers

*   Can be used to describe interesting work that is still ongoing and not fully mature.
*   Accepted short papers will be published in the main proceedings and will be presented as short talks.
*   Must be no more than **6 pages** in length excluding bibliographic references and may consist of an extended abstract.
*   Must have the phrase ""Short paper"" as a subtitle.
*   Must not include an appendix.
*   Must be in LIPIcs format.

## Formatting and Submission Platform

Both categories of papers must be prepared in LaTeX using the [lipics-v2021 style](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author) (v2021.1.3) and must be submitted electronically as pdf files through [HotCRP](https://itp25.hotcrp.com).

## Supplementary Material

All submissions are expected to be accompanied by supplementary material containing verifiable evidence of a suitable implementation, such as the source files of a formalization for the proof assistant used.

*   **Anonymous supplementary material** is made available to the reviewers before they submit their first-draft reviews.
*   **Non-anonymous supplementary material** is made available to the reviewers after they have submitted their first-draft reviews and have learned the identity of the authors.

We strongly encourage anonymous supplementary material whenever possible.

## Publication

The conference proceedings will be published in Dagstuhl Publishing's Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series in **Gold Open Access** under the CC-BY-4.0 license.

## Registration and Participation

## Scope

Image analysis is a scientific discipline providing theoretical foundations and methods for solving problems appearing in a wide range of areas, as diverse as medicine, robotics, defense, and security. As a rule, the processed data are discrete; therefore, the “discrete approach” to image analysis appears to be a natural one and has an increasing importance. It is based on studying combinatorial properties of the considered digital data sets. Combinatorial image analysis often features various advantages (in terms of efficiency and accuracy) over the more traditional approaches based on continuous models requiring numeric computation.

The Workshop is a forum for current research on the following (or similar) research subjects which are directly or potentially applicable to image analysis:

*   Combinatorial problems in the discrete plane and space
*   Lattice polygons and polytopes
*   Digital/combinatorial geometry and topology
*   Digital manifolds
*   Geometry of digital curves and surfaces
*   Analysis and processing of digital surfaces with singularities (such as “pinched digital surfaces”)
*   Homotopy of digital manifolds; thinning algorithms and skeletons
*   Boundary tracking of digital solids; Geometric characteristics of object boundaries
*   Multigrid convergence analysis of metric-based descriptors
*   Tilings and patterns; Combinatorial pattern matching
*   Computational geometry and imaging sciences
*   Integer programming, linear programming, and graph theoretic models and approaches to problems of image analysis
*   Image representation, segmentation, grouping, and reconstruction
*   Processing “very large” digital pictures; Methods for image compression
*   Parallel architectures and algorithms
*   Fuzzy and stochastic image analysis
*   Discrete tomography
*   Grammars and models for image or scene analysis and recognition; cellular automata
*   Mathematical morphology and image analysis
*   Applications in medical imaging, biometrics, computer vision, image understanding, robotics, metrology, and others
*   AI and machine learning in imaging and image analysis

Programming languages, compilers, and tools are crucial interfaces between embedded systems and emerging real-world applications, including deep neural networks, large language models, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare. These applications present challenges that often conflict with conventional design requirements and increase the complexity of embedded system designs. They also leverage new hardware paradigms like multicores (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs) and distributed systems. Consequently, programming languages, compilers, and tools are increasingly vital for addressing productivity, validation, verification, maintainability, safety, and reliability, while meeting performance goals and resource constraints.

The 26th ACM SIGPLAN/SIGBED International Conference on Languages, Compilers, Tools and Theory of Embedded Systems (LCTES 2025) invites original work on programming languages, compilers, tools, theory, and architectures that address these challenges. Both research papers on innovative techniques and experience papers on real-world system experimentation are welcome.

The symposium focuses on advances in biomedical imaging.","# Call for Academic Software Demos

We welcome proposals for in-person demos of academic, open, free, and non-commercial software. The software may or may not be directly associated with accepted ISBI 2025 papers and abstracts, but should still have relevance to accepted ISBI 2025 work. The academic demo sessions of ISBI 2025 will aim to showcase recent developments in the field, software used in ISBI 2025 papers, all relevant to the ISBI community. This will be an opportunity for presenters to perform live demos of their code/software while interacting with conference attendees face-to-face.

## Focus Areas

Demos should focus on **open science, reproducible research, clinically-translational work, and soft skills development**. Demos should provide material for all levels of expertise, including students, early career scientists, professionals, and clinical users. Demos should primarily focus on the (relatively mature) tools developed by the presenters rather than results.

## Demo Format

*   All accepted demos will be **in-person** in an assigned conference hall during the main conference.
*   Each demo will be provided with a **small table, power outlet, wireless (shared) Internet, and a monitor** during its assigned time slot.
*   Submissions should list all other supporting equipment that will be needed per demo, so the conference committee may do their best to arrange them.
*   Demo presenters are expected to bring their own laptops/PCs as needed for their demo.

## Demo Fee

*   There will be a **$140 fee** for the demo package (table, poster board, screen, power connection).
*   This fee must be paid upon registration by the presenter of the relevant paper the demo is attached to, who will be attending the conference, in addition to their conference attendee fee.

## Demo Proposal Requirements

Proposals should be **no more than one (1) page** in 12-point font submitted as a single PDF file. Demo proposals should contain the following sections:

*   **Title:** Must have the prefix ""Demo:"" (e.g., ""Demo:<Title>""). Include a brief topic overview and brief expected learning outcomes.
*   **Representative Image:** One ""representative image"".
*   **Relevance to ISBI community:** Emerging topics will be favorably considered if the link with the ISBI community is clearly established (the software is associated with an accepted ISBI 2025 paper or abstract).
*   **Software URLs:** List any GitHub or otherwise public software related URLs.
*   **Target Audience:** Describe from which areas potential participants are expected to visit the demo, what prior knowledge or skills are expected from the audience, and what software or programming languages might be involved.
*   **Presenter Information:** (Not included in page limit) Please provide names, affiliations, positions, and email addresses for each demo-presenter.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are 11:59pm USA (PST).

*   **Demo proposals due:** **February 24, 2025**
*   **Accept/Reject notification:** **February 28, 2025**
*   **Deadline to submit any update on requested materials needed:** **March 7, 2025**
