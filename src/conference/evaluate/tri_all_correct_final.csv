The review process will consist of two rounds with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee will reject some submissions; the rest will proceed to the second round. At the end of the first round, the authors will be either notified of rejection, or invited to submit a response to questions from the program committee (if any). The authors' response will be used to make the final decision in the second round.

The double-blind review process will follow the IACR Conflict of Interest Policy. The authors will be asked, at submission time, to help identify program committee members with potential conflicts of interest.

## Awards

The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall **Best Paper Award**. The Program Committee may also award a prize for the **best paper(s) authored exclusively by students and postdocs** (at the time of submission). Awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.

## Stipends

Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. A limited number of stipends will be available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply.

ECAI 2025 is planned as an in-person event, encouraging participation and knowledge sharing in a city renowned for its ancient university and thriving scientific environment.","# ECAI 2025: Call for Main Track Papers

We invite all members of the international AI research community to submit their best work to the **28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2025)**, which will take place in the historic city of Bologna from **October 25 to 30, 2025**.

We welcome submissions on all aspects of AI. Submissions will be subject to **double-blind peer review** by the programme committee. They will be evaluated based on relevance, clarity, significance, originality, soundness, reproducibility, scholarship, and quality of presentation.

The conference is planned as an **in-person event**. Each accepted paper will get assigned either an oral presentation slot or a combined poster/spotlight presentation slot. The presentation modality is not intended to reflect perceived scientific quality of the paper, so this assignment will be made in a randomised fashion (subject to programme constraints).

The open-access proceedings will be published by [IOS Press](https://frontiersinai.com/?q=ecai). A selection of the best papers submitted to the conference will be invited for fast-track consideration by the Artificial Intelligence Journal or the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research.

## Topics

Submissions on all aspects of AI are welcome. This includes in particular:

*   Computer Vision
*   Constraints and Satisfiability
*   Data Mining
*   Fairness, Ethics, and Trust
*   Game Theory and Economic Paradigms
*   Humans and AI
*   Intelligent Robotics
*   Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
*   Machine Learning
*   Multiagent Systems
*   Natural Language Processing
*   Planning and Search
*   Uncertainty in AI
*   Multidisciplinary Topics

## Important Dates

*   Submission site opening: **Thursday, 10 April 2025**

*   Paper deadline: **Tuesday, 6 May 2025**
*   Rebuttal period: **Monday-Wednesday 23-25 June 2025** (72 hours)
*   Author notification: **Thursday, 10 July 2025**
*   Early registration deadline: TBC
*   Camera-ready deadline: **Tuesday, 26 August 2025**

All deadlines are at the end of the day specified, anywhere on Earth (UTC-12).

Author requests to formally withdraw a paper from review might take up to one week to process and might not be honoured at all if received after 25 June 2025.

## Ethics Statement

Research reported at ECAI should avoid harm, be honest and trustworthy, fair and non-discriminatory, and respect privacy and intellectual property. Where relevant, authors can include in the main body of their paper, or on the reference page, a short ethics statement that addresses ethical issues regarding the research being reported and the broader ethical impact of the work.

Reviewers will be asked to flag possible violations of relevant ethical principles. Such flagged submissions will be reviewed by a senior member of the programme committee.

Authors may be required to revise their paper to include a discussion of possible ethical concerns and their mitigation.

## Submission Instructions

Papers must be written in English, be prepared for double-blind review using the ECAI LaTeX template, and not exceed 7 pages (plus at most 1 extra page for references).

*   **ECAI LaTeX Template:** [Download Link](https://ecai2025.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ecai-template.zip)
    *   *Update on April 1, 2025: The README file in the LaTex package has been updated to include the current contact details in case there are issues. All other files (in particular, the ecai.cls file) remain the same.*
*   Excessive use of typesetting tricks to make things fit is not permitted. Please do not modify the style files or layout parameters.
*   Registering an abstract of your paper (of around 100-300 words in plain text) is required in advance of the paper submission deadline and you will be asked to provide additional information (such as keywords) at that time. Please do not leave things to the very last moment; you can resubmit any number of times until the submission deadline.
*   The submission website is: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecai20250](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecai20250).

### Supplementary Material

You have the option to accompany your submission with supplementary material, such as a technical appendix or code and data (up to 50MB). Reviewers will consult supplementary material at their own discretion, and you should not assume that they necessarily will. Make sure that any supplementary material you submit really is supplementary in nature: any information that is essential for understanding or evaluating your paper must be included in the paper itself. You of course must ensure that your supplementary material does not compromise the anonymity of your submission.

We will not publish your supplementary material. Nevertheless, if your paper gets accepted, then the readers of your published paper should have access to the same information as the reviewers of your submission. So you should make your (suitably revised) supplementary material openly available in archival form at the time of publication of your paper, and you should include a reference to the supplementary material in the camera-ready copy of your paper. For code or data you may wish to use a service such as Zenodo. For a technical appendix you may wish to use an archival preprint server such as arXiv.

### Resubmission from Other Conferences

If an earlier version of your paper was rejected from another conference with archival proceedings and double-blind reviewing during the 12 months preceding the submission deadline (such as ECAI-2024, AAAI-2025, or IJCAI-2025), you can supplement your submission with a document detailing how you have taken the reviews received into account to improve your paper.

This document must be a single PDF consisting of the following three parts:

1.  A cover letter, of at most one page, in which you summarise your response to the reviews received and how you have changed your paper since then.
2.  All reviews, including the metareview (if any), in anonymised form (but otherwise unedited). A screenshot from the submission system will usually work best.
3.  An unedited copy of the earlier submission.

This is entirely voluntary. Do it if you feel it would help reviewers to better appreciate your work. You can include documentation for at most one conference. The document you provide will be shared with your reviewers at the start of the reviewing process.

## Policies

ECAI subscribes to the [European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://allea.org/code-of-conduct/). By submitting to ECAI you confirm that you are aware of and accept the following specific policies:

*   **Originality:** Submissions must not have substantial overlap in either contribution or text with work previously accepted for publication as a full paper in another archival forum. Papers at workshops without archival proceedings and preprints are fine.
*   **Concurrent submission:** The work you submit must not be under review elsewhere at any time between submission and notification.
*   **Anonymity:** Reviewing for ECAI is double-blind, meaning that reviewers should not be aware of the identity of the authors of the papers they review. As an author you must make a reasonable effort to ensure that this is possible. Specifically, use the â€œdoubleblindâ€ option of the LaTeX template and do not include any acknowledgements in your submission. Cite your own prior work where appropriate, but do so in the third rather than the first person (that is, write, for instance, â€œTuring et al. [42] have shown â€¦â€ rather than â€œWe have shown â€¦ [42]â€).
*   **Links:** Papers must not include pointers to supplementary material on the web, not even when that supplementary material has been fully anonymised, as we would be unable to ensure that it remains unaltered throughout the reviewing period.
*   **Social media:** Actively promoting a paper on social media channels while it is undergoing double-blind review is discouraged.
*   **Reproducibility:** Reviewers will be instructed to pay close attention to reproducibility of results where appropriate and you should submit relevant code and data as supplementary material whenever feasible.
*   **Information sharing:** Submissions will be treated confidentially. However, papers, author information, and reviews may be shared with the organisers of other AI conferences to identify duplicate submissions and to limit duplicate reviewing efforts.
*   **Abstracts:** Abstracts are central for the assignment of reviewers. Therefore, they must not be altered in any significant way after the abstract submission deadline. In particular, submitting â€œplaceholder abstractsâ€ is not admissible.
*   **Authorship:** All individuals, and only those, who have made significant contributions to a paper should be listed as authors in the submission system. We will not permit adding or removing authors to a paper after the submission deadline. Please also ensure that the order of authors is correct at submission time.
*   **Submission limit:** No individual may be listed as an author for more than 8 separate submissions to ECAI.
*   **Generative AI:** The use of AI systems to generate text for inclusion in an ECAI submission is only allowed if its role is properly documented in the manuscript (e.g., when reporting on experiments on such systems). However, the use of AI-powered systems to assist with the polishing of human-authored text is permissible.
*   **Attendance:** At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference by the early registration deadline with the intention of presenting the paper at the conference. This is a prerequisite for inclusion in the proceedings.
*   **Reviewing:** Authors may be called upon to help with reviewing papers for ECAI. This does not apply to individuals who already are serving on the PC or who are not yet qualified to serve on the PC (such as students). Waivers will be granted in exceptional circumstances (such as parental leave).

### Use of Generative AI Software Tools

The use of generative AI software tools is permitted subject to the following requirements:

*   The AI systems have not been used to plagiarize, misrepresent, or falsify content.
*   The resulting work, in its entirety, accurately represents the authors' original research and novel intellectual contributions, and is not primarily the result of the AI tool's generative capabilities.
*   The authors accept full responsibility for the veracity and correctness of all material in their work, including any content generated by AI tools.

> Note that all submissions will be checked using suitable AI content detectors

## Double-Blind Reviewing

The conference will employ a **lightweight double-blind reviewing process**. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authorsâ€™ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear anywhere in the submission. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. Use the third person to refer to the author's previous work, e.g., replace ""as we have shown before"" with ""as shown before in [X].""

In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC Co-Chairs by email at icdcn2025-tpc-chairs@iit.cnr.it.

## Conflict of Interest

Indications of conflicts of interest will be required in the submission form. A conflict of interest is limited to the following:

*   A family member or close friend.
*   A Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or a postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years.
*   A person with the same affiliation.
*   A person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.)
*   Frequent collaborators, or collaborators who have jointly published papers within the last two years.

The 9th IEEE International Conference on Fog and Edge Computing (ICFEC 2025) is a leading forum to disseminate and discuss research activities and results on a broad range of topics in the fields of fog and edge computing. ICFEC 2025 will take place in conjunction with The 25th International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid 2025) from **May 19-22, 2025**, in **TromsÃ¸, Norway**.

## About Fog and Edge Computing

Fog and edge computing are seen as alternatives to cloud-based computational resources, especially in scenarios with large amounts of data produced in distributed settings (e.g., IoT) requiring near real-time processing or when suboptimal network connectivity hampers data upload to the cloud. Use cases span smart factories, smart grids, and autonomous vehicles. Current challenges include developing new abstractions for programming and storage models, addressing security, privacy, and trust in distributed systems, managing resources of mobile and hardware-constrained devices, processing large data streams, integrating novel communication protocols, and enabling distributed machine learning like federated learning.

## Topics of Interest

The conference seeks high-quality contributions covering both theory and practice in systems research and emerging domain-specific applications related to next-generation distributed systems across the cloud-edge compute continuum. This includes mist computing, edge computing, multi-access edge computing, fog computing, and mobile cloud computing. Some representative topics include:

*   Data centers and infrastructures along the compute continuum
*   Mobility management along the compute continuum
*   Federated learning and distributed machine learning in and for the compute continuum
*   5G/6G for the compute continuum
*   Middleware and runtime systems for the compute continuum
*   Programming models for the compute continuum
*   Storage and data management platforms along the compute continuum
*   Scheduling and resource management for the compute continuum
*   Security, privacy, trust, and provenance issues for the compute continuum
*   Distributed consensus and blockchains in the compute continuum
*   Modeling and simulation for and in the compute continuum

## Reciprocal Reviewing Requirement

*   Authors submitting **3 or more papers** must serve as a reviewer for at least **6 papers**.
*   At least one author of each submission must be registered to review at least **3 papers**.
*   Authors are exempt if they are serving as an AC, SAC, or organizing chair.
*   All authors will be notified to register as reviewers after the abstract deadline. Failure to comply may result in desk rejection.

## Code of Conduct and Ethics

*   All participants must adhere to the ICLR [Code of Conduct](https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfConduct) and [Code of Ethics](https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfEthics).
*   Authors must read, adhere to, and acknowledge the Code of Ethics during submission.

## Dual Submission Policy

*   Submissions identical or substantially similar to previously published or submitted work are not allowed.
*   Papers on arXiv or presented at non-peer-reviewed workshops do not violate the policy.
*   Submissions to ICLR can be modified on arXiv during the review period.

## Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)

*   LLMs are allowed as general-purpose assist tools.
*   Authors and reviewers are responsible for LLM-generated content, including plagiarism or fabrication.

## Review Style

ACM ICMR follows a **double-blind review process** for full paper selection. Authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the name(s) of the author(s). Please prepare your paper in a way that preserves anonymity of the authors:

*   Do not put your names under the title.
*   Avoid using phrases such as â€œour previous workâ€ when referring to earlier publications by the authors.
*   Remove information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs).
*   Check supplemental material for information that may identify the authorsâ€™ identity.
*   Avoid providing links to Websites that identify the authors.

## Abstract and Keywords

The abstract and the keywords form the primary source for assigning papers to reviewers. So make sure that they form a concise and complete summary of your paper with sufficient information to let someone who has not read the full paper know what it is about.

## Submission Instructions

See the [Paper Submission]( /authors/paper-submissions ) section.

## Presentation Format

ACM ICMR 2025 will be an in-person event. All oral talks and demonstrations must be on-site at the conference venue, otherwise they will be removed from the proceedings and no refund given. This includes full papers, BNI papers and doctoral symposium papers. Posters should be presented at the conference, but we will also facilitate online posters using our online conference platform. This platform requires the upload of a poster and short accompanying video. We will be strictly enforcing this policy across all submission types.

We expect and require that for each accepted paper at least one author fully (non-student) register into the conference before the camera-ready deadline. We are working on a way to allow remote presentation in case authors are unable to join in person.",,100.00,,,

NSPW 2025 invites three types of submissions:

1.  **Regular submissions:** Present a new approach (paradigm) to a security problem or critique existing approaches. While regular submissions may present research results, the change in approach should be the focus.
2.  **Theme Submissions:** Focused on “**Trusting**” and should explain the connection with the theme in the justification statement. They follow the format of a regular submission.
3.  **Implementation Submissions:** Explore implementing previous NSPW submissions. These submissions should clearly cite which previous work(s) is being referenced and how the current submission extends beyond the original scope.

The theme for NSPW 2025 is **Trusting**.

## Relevant Topics for the Theme ""Trusting""

*   Novel paradigms for conceptualising trust and trusting in computer security
*   Trust decisions in a world of deepfakes and misinformation
*   Detection of breach of trust, intrusion and misinformation
*   Trust boundaries and threat modeling
*   Trust in changing threat landscapes and technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence

## Submission Instructions

*   **Confidentiality:** All submissions are treated as confidential.
*   **Prior Publication:** NSPW does not accept previously published or concurrently submitted papers.
*   **Due Date:** **April 25, 2025, 11:59 PM AoE**
*   **Response Date:** May 30, 2025
*   **Format:** PDF format, **6-15 pages**, ACM “sigconf” formatting.
*   **Submission System:** Submit through EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025)

### Special Submission Instructions

Each paper requires two separate EasyChair submissions:

1.  **Cover page:** with authors’ names, affiliation, and the participation statement.
2.  **Anonymous PDF paper:** with a justification statement.

The **participation statement** must specify which author(s) will attend upon acceptance/invitation, that all authors will engage in good faith with the feedback given in the review and revision periods, and that all authors will abide by the NSPW code of conduct.

The **justification statement** (clearly marked as part of the PDF submission) briefly explains why the submission is appropriate for NSPW and the chosen submission category. The justification statement will not appear in the final publication.

To support double-blind reviewing, the cover page should not be part of the PDF submission but will be submitted separately on EasyChair. Submissions that do not include both statements risk rejection without review. In addition, submissions should blind author identity where possible (e.g., using the LaTeX `anonymous=true` option and avoiding self-referencing).

Organizers and Program Committee members are allowed to submit papers, but will not be involved in evaluating their papers.

## Publication

NSPW'25 papers will be published in the International Conference Proceedings Series of the ACM Digital Library. Note: ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance).

## Social Contract and Code of Conduct

*   Acceptance to the workshop is conditional on engagement with the revision, presentation, and discussion process.
*   All participants must commit to a “social contract”: no one arrives late, no one leaves early, no electronic distractions (including laptops, tablets, and mobile devices), attend all sessions of the 2.5-day program, share meals in a group setting, and comply with the code of conduct.
*   The workshop is preceded by an evening reception.
*   NSPW is making arrangements for (some) child care during the event. If interested, please email [general-chairs@nspw.org](mailto:general-chairs@nspw.org) for planning purposes.

## Review Process (New for 2025)

Authors invited to revise their submissions will receive specific revision criteria. Revisions are guided by a revision editor, and accepted revisions for the current issue must be completed within 1 month of notification; revisions accepted between 1-4 months will appear in the following issue. Papers not adequately revised by the following issue's revision deadline will be rejected. More details are available on the href=""reviews-2025.php"" - review process page.

## Resubmission of Rejected Papers (New for 2025)

Authors of rejected papers must skip one full issue before resubmitting to a future issue of PoPETs.

## Scope (New for 2025)

Papers submitted to PETS/PoPETs should present novel practical and/or theoretical research into the requirements, design, analysis, experimentation, or fielding of privacy-enhancing technologies and their contexts. Interdisciplinary research is welcome if it clearly impacts privacy technology design, development, or deployment.

## Paper Submission

A submitted paper should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A submission should strive to be accessible to a broad audience, as well as having sufficient details for experts in the area.

### Regular Papers

A regular paper must report on original research that has not been previously published. It is not permitted to submit the same material concurrently to journals or conferences with proceedings. Format and length requirements for submissions are stated below. All ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in a paper, including full proofs and experimental results, where applicable, should be included in the submission.

### Brief Announcements

A brief announcement may describe work in progress or work presented elsewhere. A brief announcement may also report on original research results that can be fully presented in the limited space available. The title of a brief announcement must begin with `Brief Announcement: `.

## Submission Format

All submissions should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper.

Alternatively, papers can also be submitted by using the official ACM Master article LaTeX template `acmart.cls`, version 1.80 or greater, using the following documentclass instruction:

```latex
\documentclass[acmsmall,nonacm,anonymous]{acmart}
```

The template is available at [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

The following instructions equally apply in both cases.

Regular submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information (see paragraph on double-blind reviewing below), and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper’s contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the “full version” of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial 10 pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. Each submission must contain full proofs of all claims in the paper. Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first 10 pages will be read at the committee’s discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission.

Brief announcement submissions must have a length of at most 5 pages including title, abstract, and the references.

Submissions not conforming to the rules stated in this call, as well as papers outside the scope of the conference, may be rejected without consideration.

## Best practices for citations

Alphabetical orderings of authors can lead to biases. Therefore, authors are encouraged to avoid “et al.” in citations, and instead mention all author names.

## Double-blind reviewing

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear anywhere in the submission. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC chair by email.

## Conflict of Interest

Indications of conflicts of interest will be required in the submission form. A conflict of interest is limited to the following:

*   A family member or close friend.
*   A Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years.
*   A person with the same affiliation.
*   A person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.)
*   Frequent collaborators, or collaborators who have jointly published papers within the last two years.

If you feel that you have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, contact the PC chair or one of the Theory of Computing Advocates affiliated with this conference (Faith Ellen and Idit Keidar). The PC chair may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for a conflict of interest.

## Publication

Accepted regular papers of up to 10 pages and brief announcements of up to 3 pages in two-column ACM proceedings format will be included in the conference proceedings. They must be formatted with the ACM Master templates using `\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}`.

If more space than available in the proceedings for an accepted paper is needed, a full version must be available publicly, e.g. on arXiv, by the due date for the proceedings version, and the proceedings version must refer to this.

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

It is expected that papers that are published at PODC 2025 are presented by one of the authors in person at the conference. In exceptional circumstances (e.g., because of visa issues), a limited number of exceptions can be approved by the PC chair. A paid conference registration by one of the authors of each accepted paper will be required in any case.

Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of the journal Distributed Computing. Up to two selected papers will be considered for publication in the Journal of the ACM.

## Policy for Authors' Use of Generative AI Language Tools

AJCAI recognizes that authors of scientific works use a variety of tools to do the science on which they report, and to prepare the report itself, from simple ones to very sophisticated ones. 

In view of this, we:

*   continue to require authors to report in their work any significant use of sophisticated tools, such as instruments and software; we now include in particular text-to-text generative AI among those that should be reported consistent with subject standards for methodology.
*   remind all colleagues that by signing their name as an author of a paper, they each individually take full responsibility for all its contents, irrespective of how the contents were generated. If generative AI language tools generate inappropriate language, plagiarized content, biased content, errors, mistakes, incorrect references, or misleading content, and that output is included in scientific works, it is the responsibility of the author(s).
*   generative AI language tools should not be listed as an author.

## Submission Guidelines

All papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format and formatted using Springer's [manuscript submission guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

Submitted papers should not exceed **12 pages** (including references). Reviews will be double blind; authors must avoid including anything that can be used to identify them. The authors' information, including the author order, will not be able to be changed after the submission deadline.

### Important for Blind Review

When using LaTeX, please set `\author{Anonymous}` and `\authorrunning{Anon}` to avoid revealing identifying information. For the institution, use `\institute{Anonymous Institution}` to display anonymous affiliation. Please also ensure that acknowledgments, funding information, and any other identifying details are removed from your submission.

AJCAI 2025 uses a single-stage review process (no rebuttal phase).

The deadline for submitting supplementary materials is the same as the deadline for full paper submissions. We recommend using the same template as the paper for supplementary materials. There is no page limit for supplementary materials.

Each accepted paper requires at least one Full Registration. If you have more than one accepted paper, you have to register for each paper individually.

Submissions will be through the OpenReview system at the following URL: [https://openreview.net/group?id=AJCAI/2025](https://openreview.net/group?id=AJCAI/2025)

All accepted papers submitted to the Conference will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference and to present the paper.

The European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA) is one of the premier conferences on algorithms. It is organized in collaboration with the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS) and is a part of ALGO 2025, to be held in Warsaw.

The symposium seeks original algorithmic contributions for problems with relevant theoretical and/or practical applications. Papers with a strong emphasis on the theoretical analysis of algorithms should be submitted to **Track A**, while papers reporting the results of extensive experimental evaluations and/or providing original contributions to the engineering of algorithms for practical applications should be submitted to **Track B**. Submissions that prove or explain results, possibly already known, in a particularly clear, simple or elegant way should be submitted to **Track S**.

There will be a **Best Student Paper Award** as well as a **Best Paper Award**, both sponsored by EATCS. In order for a paper to be considered for the Best Student Paper Award, all of its authors are required to be students (including PhD candidates) at the time of submission.

## Submission Guidelines

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper. Submissions must be formatted in accordance with the LIPIcs proceedings guidelines and may not exceed 500 lines of text. Authors must use the LaTeX class file `socg-lipics-v2021.cls`; for a quick start, duplicate [this Overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/project).

Proofs omitted due to the line constraint must be placed in an appendix. This appendix can even comprise an entire full version of the paper. The appendix will be read by the program committee members at their discretion. In particular, appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.

These guidelines are strict: submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk being rejected without consideration of their merits.

Papers must be submitted electronically via the [EasyChair submission system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esa2025).

Results previously published (or scheduled for publication) in another conference proceedings or journal should not be submitted to ESA. Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings, journals, or to multiple tracks of ESA 2025, is also not permitted.

By submitting a paper the authors acknowledge that in case of acceptance, at least one of the authors must register at ALGO 2025, attend the conference on-site and present the paper. Papers with no author fulfilling this requirement may risk being removed from the final conference proceedings (unless there are extenuating circumstances).

## Double-Blind Reviewing

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias.

Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).

Double-blind reviewing is intended to help PC members and reviewers to counter bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. In case there exist publicly available versions of the submission online, the authors might mention this in their submission (without providing references/links), and briefly explain the differences if any. Alternatively, they might communicate the details to the chairs, who will keep them confidential unless revealing them to the PC is needed for a fair judgement.

When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members. A CoI is limited to the following categories:

*   Family member or close friend.
*   Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years.
*   Person with the same affiliation.
*   Involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.)
*   Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter).
*   Frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.

The 30th European Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, People, and Practices (**EuroPLoP**) will be held from **July 2-6, 2025**, in **Kloster Irsee, Germany**.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of EuroPLoP, featuring special activities and the presence of important figures from its history. As part of this celebration, we welcome submissions that reflect on the history of patterns and look at their future.

## Why Participate in EuroPLoP?

**EuroPLoP** is the premier European conference on patterns and pattern languages, representing practical experience and best practices.

*   **Authors:** Gain visibility by publishing patterns and receive active, high-quality feedback to improve their pattern writing and daily activities.
*   **Practitioners:** Enlarge their network and increase visibility by meeting leading experts and practitioners. They also get trained on how to get and give structured feedback.
*   **Academics:** Benefit from EuroPLoP’s intensive shepherding process, reviews, and peer discussions at Writers’ Workshops, leading to high-quality publications. Accepted papers will be published in the Springer LNCS.
*   **Participants:** Keep up-to-date with contemporary movements in software engineering and related topics through in-depth discussions during EuroPLoP’s Writers’ Workshops.

## Call for Pattern Papers

We encourage you to submit pattern papers on software-related topics, as well as other topics. EuroPLoP is open to synergies with other fields and therefore accepts up to 20% of pattern papers on non-computing topics. EuroPLoP accepts papers containing patterns or pattern languages, as well as papers related to the theory and the practical application of patterns. EuroPLoP also accepts excerpts from Ph.D. theses or book projects.

We particularly welcome submissions on the following topics (theory and practice):

## Call for Focus Group Proposals

Focus Groups at EuroPLoP are an excellent opportunity to collaborate with other passionate pattern writers. They are 1 to 2 hour sessions. Your submission should include a summary of the topic, outcomes you envision, a brief description of how you will organize the session, its time budget, and the required number of participants.

## Paper Submission Process

The submission runs through three quality gates before the final proceedings are published. After the first draft is accepted, your paper will be assigned to a shepherd. Following several iterations of shepherding, your improved second draft will be reviewed again and accepted or rejected for the conference. On acceptance, your paper will be discussed in the writers’ workshop during the conference. Based on the feedback received during the workshops, you must submit a final revised version that will be published. The submission system is available under [https://www.europlop.net/submission/](https://www.europlop.net/submission/) .

## Paper Submission Format

The final submission for publication must be formatted using the Springer template, but for the drafts and intermediate versions, you can use any format. We recommend 10 pages as a guideline and especially welcome shorter papers.

## Submission Details

Any paper submitted to EWSN 2025 must be original (i.e., not previously published) and should not have been published, accepted for publication, or be under review by any other venue. All submissions within the scope of EWSN are equally welcome.

The conference will accept two types of papers:

*   **Full Papers** (max 12 pages)
*   **Short Papers** (max 6 pages). *Short papers are intended to present preliminary research results or advocate for new research directions; their titles should be prepended with “Vision paper: / Position paper: / WiP paper” when they are submitted for review as well as in the final proceedings.*

EWSN 2025 will use a **double-anonymous review policy** during the paper review process. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed.

Submission to arXiv (or similar) is allowed, provided cross-citations are not made. I.e.,

*   You MAY post a version of your paper on arxiv that lists the names of authors.
*   You MAY NOT reference the arxiv version of your paper from the paper submitted for review at EWSN.
*   You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN paper in the arxiv paper.
*   You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN paper in any other papers you submit for review at other conferences.
*   Once your paper is accepted, you MAY reference your EWSN paper (you can use ""accepted, to appear"" until the conference actually happens).

Submissions are via HotCRP: [https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/](https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/)

Decisions will be: accept, reject, or one-shot revision; papers receiving a “one-shot revision” for the winter deadline will be invited to submit a revised paper by the summer deadline.

Authors of papers rejected in the winter cycle may submit a revised paper in the summer cycle along with a cover letter. Papers submitted to the summer deadline that are deemed by the program chairs to be too similar to a paper rejected from the winter review cycle will be returned without review.

Pages must use 8.5″ x 11″ (letter) two-column format, using 10-point type on 11-point leading, with a maximum text block of 7″ wide x 9″ deep with an inter-column spacing of .25″. Submissions with a page size of 11.7 x 8.3 ” (297 x 210 mm / A4) will not be accepted. The page limits include figures, tables, and references. Authors may use the EWSN 2025 template adapted from the ACM templates for convenience (on Overleaf here).

All accepted papers will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library, SCOPUS, and other prominent digital libraries.

*   **Format:** All submissions need to follow ACM single column format. Use the correct template; a single-column format must be used for the reviewing phase. Use of different templates or formats may result in desk rejection.
    *   LaTeX OR Overleaf: The default template is set for 2-column and needs to be manually changed to 1-column for initial review using `\documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart}`
    *   [Word Template](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx): The Microsoft Word Template contains invisible meta-tags related to the paper format and structure. Authors are requested to add their content without altering any format and structure of the template.
*   **Paper Length:** No strict page limit. However, authors are encouraged to submit a paper of length proportional to its contribution. The average length of papers can be approximately 7,000–8,000 words excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Submissions above 12,000 words (two standard deviations above the average) will be desk rejected unless strongly justified.
*   **Originality:** Your submission must be original; it cannot be published or under concurrent review elsewhere. If you make multiple submissions to India HCI 2025 Papers, they must be distinct from each other.
*   **Anonymity:** Your submission must be anonymized; conform to the [Anonymization Policy](https://chi2025.acm.org/submission-guides/chi-anonymization-policy/). Papers that violate the anonymization policy will be desk rejected. You will have 48hrs to submit a revised version or the paper will be desk rejected.
*   **Videos:** Videos accompanying submissions can be submitted through the India HCI Microsoft CMT as supplementary material (max 100 MB in size). Authors should note that videos too need to maintain anonymity for the review process.

## Reviewing Process

Each paper will be subjected to rigorous review by two Associate Chairs and two external reviewers.  Contact authors will be sent the initial reviews for their papers. Authors will have an opportunity to submit a 500-word rebuttal to answer questions or clarify misunderstandings of reviewers. The final decision for accepting or rejecting a paper will be done in a PC meeting.

*   Papers should be written and presented in English.
*   There is no strict maximum length for submitted papers. However, we recommend that research papers be up to 16 pages (excluding references), and longer papers should make a very significant contribution.
*   Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content.
*   A paper submission should describe an original work of the authors.
*   Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources.
*   Supplementary material such as videos may also be submitted electronically and will be made available to reviewers (size up to 500MB). Videos are required for techniques involving motion or animation.
*   The author(s) of accepted papers must also attend the conference and present their work in-person. At least one (1) author from each accepted paper must register for the conference.
*   Submitted articles will receive two rounds of reviewing by at least three (3) expert reviewers. Technical papers conditionally accepted in the first round will undergo a second round of revision and review and, conditional on final acceptance, will be published in the PACMCGIT issue on SCA 2025. There is no rebuttal process.

### Paper Format

Research papers should be in [ACM article format](https://www.siggraph.org/preparing-your-content/author-instructions/) using the ACM small trim journal size (acmsmall). For the review version, please use the command `\documentclass[acmsmall, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart}`.

### Anonymous Submissions

Paper submissions must be anonymous and include the unique paper ID that will be assigned upon creating a submission using the online system. The review process is double-anonymous, so please remove all personal data, such as author names and affiliation from all your submission files.

Papers should not have previously appeared in, or be currently submitted to, any other conference or journal. SCA follows the same [anonymity policy as SIGGRAPH](https://s2025.siggraph.org/anonymity-policy/). Any case of violation will be determined by the chairs and could result in a desk rejection.

### Awards

Best Paper Awards will be given to exceptional submissions on the cutting edge of computer animation.

## Poster Abstracts

As in previous years, the poster session will be part of the SCA program. However, the poster abstracts will not be included in the conference proceedings.

Poster abstracts should be sent to the poster chair Alexandre Mercier-Aubin at alexandre.mercier-aubin@usherbrooke.ca

*   Submissions must be camera-ready, with author names and affiliations listed. The review process will be single-blind.
*   Poster abstract submissions should consist of a PDF paper according to the ACM article format. Submissions are permitted to be up to two pages in length, written and presented in English.
*   Supplementary material such as videos may also be submitted electronically and will be made available to reviewers. All supplementary materials must be submitted as a single zip file (size up to 500MB).

Authors of accepted papers are also welcome to reserve a spot for a poster presentation. To do so, please email the Poster Chair with your request. All accepted papers are guaranteed to be approved for a poster without the need to submit a poster abstract.

## Double Deadline

Thanks to the merging of several conferences, SenSys will transition to a new submission process with two deadlines.

Papers rejected in one cycle can be resubmitted to the next, but only with a strong statement justifying in detail how the revised version addresses the reviewers’ concerns. Resubmissions lacking this justification will be desk-rejected.

## Submission Guidelines

Submitted papers must be original, unpublished work, and must not be under review for any other publication at the time of submission. Submissions must be at most **12 pages (full papers)** or **6 pages (short papers)**, and must include all figures and tables within the page limits. References may use as many pages as needed. Both formats should be prepared on single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages, using a 9-point font size in a two-column layout. Submissions must follow either the LaTeX template (preferred) or Word style files. LaTeX submissions should specifically use the acmart.cls template with the sigconf option.

Authors are expected to make a good-faith effort to anonymize their manuscripts. The presence of non-anonymous preprints (such as those on arXiv or similar repositories) will not result in rejection. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but incidentally discovering such materials will not violate the double-blind policy. Submissions that do not comply with the specified size, formatting, or anonymization guidelines will not be reviewed. All papers must be submitted in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) through the designated conference submission system.

For submissions that involve research with human participants, including those using anonymized data, authors must include a brief description of how ethical considerations were addressed and whether the work received approval from an ethics review board (e.g., IRB). All authors are expected to comply with the policies of their institutions regarding data collection and research involving human subjects.

Submit your paper at [https://sensys26.hotcrp.com](https://sensys26.hotcrp.com).

## Camera-Ready Manuscript Details

Accepted submissions will be available on the ACM digital library. Please note that ACM uses 9-pt fonts in all conference proceedings, and the templates in both LaTeX and Word implicitly define the font size to 9-pt. Please refer to the publication chair's earlier Note and the User Guide of the new class.

*   At least one coauthor of each accepted paper is required to attend CSF to present the paper. Exceptions can be made for visa difficulties.
*   **CSF 2025 will employ double-blind reviewing.** Submitted papers must:
    *   Omit any reference to the authors’ names or the names of their institutions.
    *   Reference the authors’ own related work in the third person (e.g., not ""We build on our previous work…"" but rather ""We build on the work of …"").
*   Submissions should be made via the submission server: [https://hotcrp.csf2025.ieee-security.org/](https://hotcrp.csf2025.ieee-security.org/)

## Ethics

> We expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out the research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so will result in summary rejection of a submission regardless of its quality and scientific value.
>
> Authors are expected to document how they have addressed and mitigated the risks, including considering the impact of their research on deployed systems, understanding costs and risks, safely collecting data, and following responsible disclosure. If the submitted research has the potential to cause harm, the paper should include a clear statement about why the benefit of the research outweighs the harms, and how the authors have taken measures to ensure safety and minimize harms.
>
> If the submitted research has potential to cause harm and authors have access to an Institutional Review Board (IRB), we expect that this IRB is consulted and its approval and recommendations are documented in the paper. IRB approval does not absolve researchers from considering ethical aspects of their work.
>
> We encourage authors to consult with existing documentation, e.g., ""Common Pitfalls in Writing about Security and Privacy Human Subjects Experiments, and How to Avoid Them"" or the Menlo Report and existing Safety consultation entities, e.g., the [Tor Safety Research Board](https://research.torproject.org/safetyboard/).

## Decisions and Revisions

*   The outcome of the review process can be accept, reject, or major revision.
*   Papers with a ""major revision"" decision must be re-submitted within the following two cycles, accompanied by a writeup explaining how the revision meets reviewers’ requirements. These papers may use 16 pages.
*   Rejected papers can be re-submitted at any time. If re-submitted within 11 months of the last deadline, previous reviews and an explanation must be submitted as supplementary material.

## Submissions

Submissions should be done via the following web page: [https://disc25.hotcrp.com](https://disc25.hotcrp.com)

### Submission Types

*   **Regular Papers:** Must report on original research that has not previously been published (and may not be concurrently submitted to other journals or conferences with proceedings). All ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in a paper, including experimental results, should be included in the submission.
*   **Brief Announcements:** May describe work in progress or work presented elsewhere. A brief announcement may also present a result that is short and elegant, but does not require a longer paper. It may also be used to announce a software distribution or an experimental result of interest that can be concisely described. The title of a brief announcement should start with the phrase ""Brief Announcement: "".

*A paper that is not accepted as a regular paper may be invited as a brief announcement.* 

## Submission Format

*   Submissions must be in English in pdf format.
*   They must be prepared using the LIPIcs LaTeX style template: `\documentclass[a4paper,anonymous,USenglish]{lipics-v2021}`.
*   Submissions must be anonymous, without any author names, affiliations, or email addresses. The contact information of the authors will be entered separately in the submission metadata.
*   **Regular papers:** No page limit. The initial 15 pages, excluding the title page and a table of contents, should contain a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. Material other than the first 15 pages will be read at the committee’s discretion.
*   **Brief announcements:** Should comply with the above rules, replacing 15 pages with 5 pages.
*   Submissions not conforming to the submission guidelines and papers outside of the scope of the conference will be rejected without consideration.

## Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)

The use of LLMs for submission preparation is permitted, although it is highly recommended that they only be used for cosmetic changes, e.g. proofreading of the text. The use of LLMs in technical parts should be treated in the same way as any other software or system, and thus carefully described and documented in the submission. Ultimately, the authors are responsible for the content of their submission, and mis-use of LLM may result in rejection. Any questions about the LLM use policy should be directed to the PC chair, Dariusz Kowalski (dkowalski@augusta.edu).

## Anonymous Submissions

We will use a relaxed implementation of double-blind peer review. Submissions must not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names and affiliation should not appear in the document itself. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).

## Conflict of Interest

The submission form provides an opportunity to specify conflicts of interest with any of the PC members and other member of research community. A conflict of interest is limited to the following:

*   A family member or close friend;
*   A Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years;
*   A person with the same affiliation;
*   A person involved in an alleged incident of harassment;
*   Frequent collaborators, or collaborators who have jointly published papers within the last two years.

If you feel that you have a valid reason for a conflict of interest beyond listed above, or any other issues related to the fair treatment of your submission, contact the PC chair, Dariusz Kowalski (dkowalski@augusta.edu), or the SafeTOC representative for DISC, listed at [https://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/](https://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/).

## Participation at DISC

It is expected that accepted papers and brief announcements be presented in-person at the conference.

## Publication

The proceedings will be published by LIPIcs. The final version of the paper has to be formatted following the LIPIcs guidelines. Regular papers will have 15 pages in the final proceedings (excluding references), and brief announcements will have 5 pages in the proceedings (including everything). If more space is needed, the authors are encouraged to post the full version e.g. on arXiv and refer to it in their paper.

Accepted papers and brief announcements must be presented by one of the authors, with a full registration and according to the final schedule.

Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of the journal Distributed Computing.

The best paper at DISC will be considered for publication in the Journal of the ACM.

## Awards

Awards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper. To be eligible for the best student paper award, at least one of the paper authors must be a full-time student at the time of submission, and the student(s) must have made a significant contribution to the paper.

*   Papers exceeding 12,000 words may be rejected if no justification is provided.
*   References and appendix do not count toward the paper length.
*   Reviewers will weigh the contribution relative to its length; papers with a length disproportionate to their contribution will likely be rejected. Shorter, more focused papers are encouraged.
*   The abstract must be a paragraph of 150 words or less.

### Formatting

*   Papers must be in English.
*   Authors are required to use the **single-column ACM Manuscript template**.
    *   LaTeX templates: [Preparing your article for LaTeX](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-latex) (use `\documentclass[manuscript, screen, review]{acmart}`)
    *   Word template: [Preparing your article for Word](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word)
*   References must be complete, accurate, accessible, and conform to the ACM Publication Format.

### Anonymity

*   All submissions must be **fully anonymized**, including appendices and acknowledgments.
*   Citations to the authors’ own previous work are **NOT allowed to be anonymized**. Refer to your own prior work in the third person (e.g., ""Smith et al. [1] did ..."" instead of ""We did ... [1]"").
*   Papers that violate the anonymization policy, including within supplemental materials or external links, will be desk rejected.

### Supplementary Materials

*   All videos and supplementary material must be anonymized.
*   Videos should include closed captions and audio descriptions (see [Accessible Presentation Guide](https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/#accessible-presentation-guide)).
*   Other supplementary material (e.g., survey text, experimental protocols, source code, data) should be submitted as a single .zip file with a README.
*   The paper submission must stand independently without supplementary material.

### Accessibility

*   Authors are required to follow [SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission](https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/).

## Review Process

NDSS Symposium 2026 will have two review cycles: a summer submission cycle and a fall submission cycle. For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:

*   **Accept:** Accepted for publication and presentation.
*   **Minor Revision:** Accepted if minor revisions are made and deemed satisfactory by shepherds.
*   **Major Revision:** Considered promising but needs additional work. Authors may revise and resubmit within six weeks for a second review based on specified revision tasks. A paper may undergo at most one major revision.
*   **Reject:** Not allowed to be resubmitted to NDSS Symposium 2026.

The review process happens in two rounds for each cycle. Round 1 identifies papers for further review and discussion. Round 2 selects papers for acceptance. Both cycles include an early notification sharing Round 1 reviews and indicating if the paper proceeds to Round 2. Authors of papers proceeding to Round 2 will have an opportunity to rebut reviews and interact with reviewers.

Authors of accepted papers must ensure their papers are presented at the conference according to the conference participation policy.

## Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted papers are **strongly encouraged** to open-source their artifacts and to submit them for an artifact evaluation. Details will be released on the NDSS Symposium website.

## Areas/Topics of Interest

Submissions are solicited in, but not limited to, the following areas:

*   Anti-malware techniques: detection, analysis, and prevention
*   Cyber attack (e.g., APTs, botnets, DDoS) prevention, detection, investigation, and response
*   Cyber-crime defense and forensics (e.g., anti-phishing, anti-blackmailing, anti-fraud techniques)
*   Integrating security in network protocols (e.g., routing, naming, and management)
*   Mobile and wireless network security
*   Network security policy implementation, deployment, and management
*   Privacy and anonymity in networks and distributed systems

*   Security for future Internet architectures and designs (e.g., Software-Defined Networking, Intent-Based Networking)
*   Security for large-scale, critical infrastructures (e.g., electronic voting, smart grid)
*   Security of web-based applications and services (e.g., social networking, crowd-sourcing, fake news/disinformation), web security and privacy
*   Software/firmware/hardware security analysis, customization, and extensions
*   Special problems and case studies: e.g., tradeoffs between security and efficiency, usability, cost, and ethics
*   Trustworthy computing software and hardware to secure networks and systems
*   Usable security and privacy

### Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers

Papers that focus on the systematization of knowledge (SoK-papers at other venues) are within the scope of NDSS Symposium, particularly if they provide new insights and compelling evidence. Such papers do NOT need to be prefixed with “SoK:”, but authors may choose to do so. These papers go beyond summarizing previous research; they also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area, and may also involve new experiments to replicate and compare previous solutions.

### Topic Fit

NDSS Symposium primarily focuses on network and systems security. The Program Committee seeks papers with a clear relation to real systems, networks, and their applications. Papers with questionable fit may be desk rejected without reviews. Examples of topic concerns include (but are not limited to):

*   Papers focusing on theoretical cryptography without implementation or evaluation on real systems.
*   Papers focusing on mathematical proof without implementation/evaluation.
*   Papers with contributions primarily in another field (e.g., AI, ML) without substantial security/privacy novelty.
*   Papers without any security or privacy contribution (e.g., optimizing network performance).

## Paper Formatting

*   Technical papers must not exceed **13 pages**, excluding the “Ethics Considerations” section, references, or appendices.
*   Papers must be written in English.
*   Formatted for **US letter size** (not A4) paper in a **two-column layout**.
*   Columns no more than **9.25 in. high and 3.5 in. wide**.
*   Text must be in **Times font, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line spacing**.
*   Authors must use the [NDSS templates](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2025/submissions/templates/) (Note: 2025 templates, 2026 ones to be published soon).
*   Submissions must be in **Portable Document Format (.pdf)**.
*   Documents should render correctly in Adobe Reader when printed in black and white.

## Double and Concurrent Submissions

Technical papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference/workshop with proceedings. **Double-submissions will result in immediate rejection.** The Program Committee may share information with other conference chairs and journal editors to detect such cases.

Major overlap between a rejected paper from the first cycle and a submission to the second cycle is disallowed and will be grounds for desk rejection.

## Ethical Considerations

Each paper may **optionally** include an “Ethics Considerations” section immediately preceding the reference section. In this section, authors may discuss ethical risks and mitigation steps. If no ethical considerations are believed to exist, this section is not necessary.

> Research can potentially lead to adverse outcomes. Authors must proactively anticipate and address potential negative consequences of both conducting and publishing their research. Submissions may be rejected regardless of scientific merit if they fail to adequately address ethical concerns. If a paper relates to human subjects, analyzes data derived from human subjects, may put humans at risk, or might have other ethical implications or introduce legal issues, authors should disclose if an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval) was conducted, and discuss how ethical and legal concerns were addressed. IRB exemptions may not be sufficient. If the paper reports a potentially high-impact vulnerability, authors should report or discuss their plan for responsible disclosure. An Ethics Review Board (ERB) will check flagged papers. Authors are encouraged to review the [Menlo Report](https://www.menloreport.org/) for general ethical guidelines. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if insufficient evidence was presented that ethical or relevant legal concerns were appropriately addressed.

## Anonymous Submissions (Double-Blind Reviewing)

NDSS Symposium implements a **double-blind reviewing process**.

*   Author names and affiliations should **not appear in the paper**.
*   Authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data.
*   Authors’ prior work must be referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded.
*   Submissions violating these requirements will be **rejected without review**.
*   The list of authors **cannot be changed** while the paper is under review unless approved by the Program Chairs.
*   Publishing a technical report on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, while not encouraged, is **not forbidden**.
*   Authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.
*   **New authors cannot be added** to any submission for any reason after the submission deadline.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors and Program Committee members are required to indicate any conflict of interest and its nature. Conflicts include:

*   **Perpetual conflict:** Advisors and advisees (regardless of graduation date).
*   **Institutional relationship:** Authors and PC members with an institutional relationship.
*   **Recent professional collaborations:** (past 2 years, regardless of publication/funding).
*   **Close personal relationships.**

PC members, including chairs, with a conflict of interest with a paper will be excluded from its evaluation. Other cases (grey areas) should be brought to the PC Co-Chairs’ attention prior to the submission deadline.

> **PC Co-Chairs are not allowed to submit papers to the conference.**

> **A Special Note on “Fake Conflicts”:** Declaring conflicts of interest to avoid certain (otherwise non-conflicting) PC members is not allowed and can constitute grounds for rejection. The PC Chairs reserve the right to request additional explanation for any declared conflict. Authors with concerns about fair treatment should contact the chairs directly with convincing arguments.

## Use of Generative AI

The use of Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (text, images, or other data) is **permitted for paper preparation** under these conditions:

1.  The result does not plagiarize, misrepresent, or falsify content.
2.  The resulting work in its totality is an accurate representation of the authors’ underlying work and novel intellectual contributions and is not primarily the result of the tools’ generative capabilities.
3.  The authors accept responsibility for the veracity and correctness of all material in their paper, including any AI-generated material.

### Disclosure Requirements

The use of generative AI software tools **must be disclosed** as part of the paper submission. The level of disclosure should be commensurate with the proportion of new text or content generated:

*   If entire (sub)sections (including tables, graphs, images, etc.) were AI-generated, authors must disclose which sections and which tools and tool versions were used (e.g., via an Appendix describing usage, specific tools/versions, prompts, and post-generation editing).
*   If the amount of text generated is small (limited to phrases or a few sentences), a citation or footnote to the relevant section is sufficient, with a general disclaimer in the Acknowledgements section.
*   If generative AI tools are used **only to edit and improve the quality of human-generated existing text** (e.g., for spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement), disclosure is **not necessary**.

The conference is dedicated to addressing challenges in dynamic networks and computing, with an expanded scope including theory, algorithms, and systems research on next-generation networking, communications, and related applications.","# Call for Papers: ACM MobiHoc 2025

ACM MobiHoc is a premier conference with a highly selective single-track technical program dedicated to addressing the challenges emerging from networked systems that must operate in the face of dynamics ranging from changing user demands to connectivity and resource availability. Examples of such networked systems include next-generation cellular networks, multi-hop wireless networks, datacenter networks, Internet-of-Thing networks, mobile autonomous systems, cyber-physical systems, and online social networks. We encourage work that presents new modeling tools or performance evaluation methods, novel algorithms, or novel fundamental insights for these systems.

We are interested both in innovative works in unexplored and/or emerging topics broadly related to networked systems, and in novel findings and/or new insights that build on existing works. This year, we have significantly adapted the scope of the conference to suit the emerging challenges in networked systems.

## Overview

NSDI focuses on the design principles, implementation, and practical evaluation of networked and distributed systems. Our goal is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community to foster a broad approach to addressing overlapping research challenges. NSDI provides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further the knowledge and understanding of the networked systems community as a whole, continue a significant research dialog, or push the architectural boundaries of network services.

## Topics

NSDI invites any innovative solution for a significant problem involving networked systems, including topics from within the following list:

*   Highly available and reliable networked systems
*   Security and privacy of networked systems
*   Distributed storage, caching, and query processing systems
*   Sustainable, low-energy, and low-carbon networked systems
*   Cloud/multi-tenant systems
*   Mobile and embedded/sensor applications and systems
*   Systems aspects of networking hardware and physical layer communication technologies
*   Network and workload measurement systems
*   Self-organizing, autonomous, and federated networked systems
*   Managing, debugging, and diagnosing problems in networked systems
*   Virtualization and resource management for networked systems
*   Experience with deployed networked systems
*   Networked systems for big data
*   Testing and/or verification applied to networked systems
*   Networked systems for machine learning (ML) and ML for networked systems

Papers with no clear contributions to the design of systems or the networking stack will be considered out of scope.

### Excluded Topics

The NSDI Steering Committee has identified a list of topics that are explicitly excluded from upcoming NSDI symposia. Papers whose core contributions are on the following topics are likely to be rejected for reasons of scope:

*   Physical layer contributions: beamforming, modulation techniques, communication through unconventional mediums (capacitative, inductive, acoustic)
*   Sensing and localization contributions: gesture sensing, environment mapping, remote sensing
*   Architecture contributions: voltage scaling, GPU resource scheduling, hardware level fault tolerance
*   User interface contributions

## Submission Process & One-Shot Revision

*   **Two Deadlines**: NSDI '26 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines (Spring and Fall).
*   **One-Shot Revision**: Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. Such a revision decision includes a summary of the paper's merits and a list of necessary changes. Authors may then submit a version addressing all revision instructions during the subsequent deadline. This revised paper will be reviewed primarily to judge if it addresses the requested changes. Papers revised and resubmitted following a one-shot-revision decision can only receive a decision of accept or reject, not revise.
*   **Concurrent Submission**: Papers must not be submitted concurrently to other venues. USENIX prohibits simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues.
*   **Resubmission Policy**: Papers rejected from one deadline cannot be submitted to the immediate next deadline.
*   **Workshop Paper Extensions**: Work extending a previous workshop paper is welcome but must acknowledge prior publication anonymously and explain the differences.

## Operational Systems Track

NSDI '26 also solicits papers describing the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with large-scale, operational systems and networks. These papers need not present new ideas but should validate techniques at scale or in new environments.

*   **Reviewing**: Papers in this track will be reviewed in a more limited double-blind process. Authors' names should be withheld, but company names, links, and real system names can be kept as appropriate.
*   **Indication**: Authors should indicate on the title page and submission form that they are submitting to this track.

## What to Submit

*   **Double-blind review**: Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize papers by removing authors' names and affiliations, acknowledgments of funding sources, and avoiding self-identifying references. Care should be taken with file names.
*   **Page Limit**: Submissions must be no longer than **12 pages**, including footnotes, figures, and tables. Additional pages are allowed for references and supplementary material in appendices.
*   **Format**: Two-column format, 10-point type on 12-point leading, text block 7"" wide x 9"" deep, .33"" inter-column space, formatted for 8.5"" x 11"" paper.
*   **Submission Method**: All papers must be submitted via the submission form: [https://nsdi26spring.usenix.hotcrp.com/](https://nsdi26spring.usenix.hotcrp.com/)

## On the Use of Generative AI

Authors must not submit papers generated entirely by generative AI. A statement attesting that their paper is not completely created by generative AI must be submitted as part of the submission process.

## Policies

*   **Simultaneous Submissions**: Prohibited.
*   **Extensions on Workshop Papers**: Acceptable if the NSDI submission includes substantial new material. Must acknowledge prior publication anonymously and explain differences.
*   **Online Technical Reports**: Allowed if authors use a different title and system name than the technical report to avoid reviewer bias.

## Conflicts

At submission time, authors must provide information about conflicts with PC members based on Institution, Advisor, or Collaboration within the past two years.

## Ethical Considerations

Papers describing experiments with users or user data must follow ethical research principles (beneﬁcence, minimal risk, voluntary consent, respect for privacy, limited deception). Authors are encouraged to include a subsection on these issues and must attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their institution(s).

## Processes for Accepted Papers

*   **Visa Invitation Letters**: Contact [conference@usenix.org](mailto:conference@usenix.org) for assistance.
*   **Shepherding**: Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process.
*   **Registration Hardship**: Contact [conference@usenix.org](mailto:conference@usenix.org) if registration fees pose a hardship.

## Submission Guidelines

### Submission Evaluation and Scope

Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process. OSDI '25 will have a deliberate focus on selecting papers that offer significant contributions to computer systems research and align with community interests. Reviewers will evaluate submissions based on topic relevance to computer systems and their potential to impact future research and practices. Submissions must demonstrate relevance and offer unique insights to capture the interest of a substantial portion of OSDI attendees.

### Confidentiality and Simultaneous Submission

*   Papers will be treated as confidential prior to publication. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered.
*   Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud and is prohibited. See the [USENIX Conference Submissions Policy](https://www.usenix.org/conferences/submissions-policy).
*   Submitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted as long as authors have substantially addressed the previous reviewers' comments. Information regarding the previous submission and revisions must be provided.
*   Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in OSDI. Authors must provide a copy of the workshop paper and explain new material.
*   Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts (e.g., arXiv.org, technical reports) is permitted, but submissions must use an anonymized project or system name.

### Paper Formatting and Length

*   **Length:** Maximum 12 single-spaced 8.5"" x 11"" pages, including figures and tables. Additional pages are allowed for references only.
*   **Typeface:** 10-point type on 12-point leading.
*   **Layout:** Two-column format.
*   **Margins:** Text block 7"" wide x 9"" deep.
*   **Accepted Papers:** Allowed 14 pages in proceedings, plus references.
*   **Requirements:** Papers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review. Figures and tables should be legible in black and white. Short papers may not receive full consideration.

### Supplementary Material

Authors may upload supplementary material in separate files. PC members are not required to read supplementary material; the paper must stand alone without it.

### Identity Blinding

The paper review process is **double-blind**. Authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions, refraining from identifying themselves or their institutions either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or acknowledgments). Submissions violating these rules will be rejected without review. Contact the program co-chairs well in advance for anonymization assistance.

### Abstract Registration

Abstract registration is an essential part of the paper-reviewing process. Abstracts must provide sufficient information to understand the topic and contribution. Insufficient abstracts will be rejected, precluding paper submission.

### Conflicts

Authors must provide information about conflicts with PC members (institution, advisor, collaboration, personal) when registering abstracts. Extraneous conflicts are not permitted. Chairs will review conflicts and may reject abstracts or papers based on conflict information.

### Submission System

All papers must be submitted via the [submission system](https://osdi25.usenix.hotcrp.com/).

### Author Response Period

Authors will have an opportunity to respond to reviews prior to the program committee meeting. Responses should be limited to correcting factual errors or directly addressing reviewer questions. New experiments or promises of future work are not allowed. Responses are optional, up to 2000 words.

### Revise and Resubmit

OSDI '25 will continue the option to revise and resubmit for some of the rejected papers.

## Introduction

The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming systems, languages, and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.

OOPSLA 2025 will have two rounds of reviewing, with the Round 1 submission deadline **October 15, 2024** and Round 2 submission deadline **March 25, 2025 (AoE)**. All deadlines are firm. New papers may be submitted to either round. Papers accepted in either round will be published in the 2025 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to present at the SPLASH conference in 2025.

## What’s New

There are two new things in this year’s Call that you should be sure to pay attention to:

*   **Reserve Reviewer Policy**
*   **Data-Availability Statement**

## Contact

You can reach the two RC Chairs (Shriram and Sukyoung) through this email: [oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com).

Please use this address, not their personal email addresses, unless you think they are not getting your messages. Please allow 1–2 working days for a response before assuming they didn’t see your message, and longer right around deadlines.

In your email, please mention the number of the paper you are writing about (if you have one). That makes it easier to track the context (and avoids ambiguity).

## Review Process

PACMPL(OOPSLA) has two rounds of reviewing. Each paper will typically receive three or more reviews. You will get an opportunity to respond to these reviews before decisions are finalized.

At the end of each round, each paper will receive one of the following decisions:

*   **Accept:** Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).
*   **Reject:** Your paper will not appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). In addition, a resubmission in less than a year from the original submission is not guaranteed a review. A paper is considered a resubmission if, in the judgment of the Chairs, it is substantially similar to the original submission.
*   **Conditional Accept:** While the Review Committee likes the work, it would like to see some specific changes made. You will receive a list of specific required revisions.
*   **Minor Revision:** While the Review Committee likes the direction of the work, it has several concerns that it would like to see revised. These concerns go beyond what can be enumerated in a list. Thus, you may receive some specific required revisions, but can also expect to receive broader comments.
*   **Major Revision:** While the Review Committee thinks the direction of the work has promise, it has significant concerns that it would like to see revised. You may receive some specific required revisions, but will also receive broader comments that may take significantly longer to execute.

If you receive one of the latter three decisions, please note:

*   Unlike in some previous years, there is no restriction on when you can submit your revision. The decision does not imply a duration.
*   If you choose to submit a revised paper, you must also submit both (a) a clear explanation of how your revision addresses these comments, and (b) unless impossible, a diff of the PDFs. Independent of the decision, you can submit at the next deadline (either the opening deadline of the next round or the revision deadline of the current round). To the extent possible, your submission will be reviewed by the same reviewers.
*   Unless you explicitly withdraw your paper, it is considered under review. Therefore, it would violate policy to submit it elsewhere. If you choose to withdraw the paper (e.g., to submit elsewhere), the next time you submit it, it will be treated as a fresh paper: you may get entirely different reviewers, previous reviews and comments will not be available, etc.
*   Until your paper is accepted or rejected, you should maintain the anonymity of your submission. If you believe you need to violate it to respond to the reviews, please first discuss this with the Chairs.
*   If the Artifact Evaluation submission deadline occurs before the decision date, Conditionally Accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts. However, acceptance of artifacts has no impact on the acceptance of the revised papers.
*   Only Accepted and Conditionally Accepted papers can submit artifacts for evaluation. The reason for this is that often, Minor and Major revisions end up affecting the artifacts, sometimes substantially. It is not reasonable to ask the AEC to review the artifacts twice; nor does it make sense to review artifacts that are likely to change. For this reason, artifact evaluation will only happen once the paper reaches (near-)final form. Thus, for instance, a paper accepted after revisions in R1 can submit to the AEC for R2, and get its badges then.

## Reserve Reviewer Policy

To prepare for the possibility of a higher volume of submissions, we are implementing a new review policy: for each paper, at least one senior author must — unless exempt under the criteria below — register as a reserve reviewer. They must list their information on the submission form, and they must register themselves on TPMS.

Instructions: Log into TPMS with the same email address as for your HotCRP account. The system will ask you to upload (or provide URLs for) 5-10 of your previous papers, to base your matching on. Uploading papers/URLs is pretty straightforward; here’s also a step-by-step video. You get to choose which papers you want to upload; these determine what papers you are most likely to be asked to review. So please go for both depth and breadth. In particular, please provide papers on topics for which you are a relatively rare expert.

The goal of this policy is to uphold the high standard of reviews within the SIGPLAN community. To achieve this, we must ensure manageable review loads, prevent burnout, and encourage reviewers to stay engaged for future rounds. High-quality reviews are one of the community’s greatest assets, playing a crucial role in elevating the quality of research for everyone.

Our hope is that these reserve reviewers won’t be needed at all! They will only be called upon as ad hoc reviewers if our projections fall significantly short. Even in that case, their review load will be far lighter than that of RC members, and we will do our best to assign papers that closely match expertise (hence the need for TPMS registration).

We define “senior” authors as those who completed their PhD five or more years ago. A paper is exempt from the reserve reviewer policy if:

*   The paper has no senior authors.
*   At least one senior author is already in the RC for this conference.
*   Every senior author of the paper satisfies one or more of these criteria:
    *   is new to SIGPLAN (has never published in it before);
    *   is chairing a SIGPLAN conference with 150 or more submissions last year, this year, or next year;
    *   has some other exceptional circumstance that didn’t prevent writing the paper but prevents doing any reviewing. This must be cleared at least three days before submission with the RC Chairs.

It is okay for one person to serve as the reserve reviewer for more than one paper. Please enter their information for each such paper (preferably identically).

## Submissions

### Template

SPLASH’s PACMPL templates and instructions are on the [SIGPLAN author information page](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/). Please use:

```latex
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review]{acmart}
```

### Page Limit

Initial submissions must be at most **23 pages** using the template. This page limit does not include required statements, references, or supplementary material (such as appendices). However, papers must be self-contained; reviewers are under no obligation to read the supplementary material.

Revisions can correspondingly go up to a maximum of **25 pages**. This includes papers given a minor or major revision in 2024, as well as the final, camera-ready papers. For fairness, there will not be an option to purchase additional pages. For the final paper, we ask you to stick as closely as possible to the final version accepted by reviewers, and only add material that reviewers requested or that you promised.

### Anonymity

PACMPL uses **double-blind reviewing**. Authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Your papers must:

*   omit author names and institutions,
*   use the third person when referencing your work,
*   anonymize supplementary material.

Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.

### Novelty

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Re-Publication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. Submissions are expected to comply with the ACM Policies for Authorship.

### Data-Availability Statement

To help readers understand the state of the intended artifact, we ask you to add a section just before references titled **Data-Availability Statement** in the initial submission. This will not count towards the page limit, but please limit it to at most a few paragraphs (usually one paragraph suffices).

In it, indicate whether an artifact exists, its nature and limitations, and whether it will be submitted for Artifact Evaluation. This section should ideally also include links to preliminary versions of (anonymized) artifacts, datasets, and so on that reviewers may find useful (but are not obliged to follow). The statement is not meant to be a detailed description of how to use the artifact; that should accompany the artifact itself.

It is understood that some papers have no artifacts but, given the broad range of what constitutes an artifact, it would be helpful to readers to explain why the paper has none.

Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact after promising one will be asked to explain why they did not do so.

Artifact Evaluation submission will closely follow paper notification, so make sure you check the Artifact Call as soon as you submit your paper.

### Procedure

Please submit using [HotCRP](https://oopsla2425.hotcrp.com/).

### Publication

PACMPL is a **Gold Open Access** journal. All papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge (USD 400), but payment is not required.

The official publication date is the date the journal is made available in the ACM Digital Library. The journal issue and associated papers accepted in Round 1 (OOPSLA1) will be published no earlier than April 1, 2025, while those accepted in Round 2 (OOPSLA2) will be published no earlier than October 1, 2025. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## ACM Policies

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID iD, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and has made a [commitment to collecting ORCID iDs from all of our published authors](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs).

The ACM Publications Board has recently updated the ACM Authorship Policy in several ways:

*   Addressing the use of generative AI systems in the publications process
*   Clarifying criteria for authorship and the responsibilities of authors
*   Defining prohibited behaviour, such as gift, ghost, or purchased authorship
*   Providing a linked FAQ explaining the rationale for the policy and providing additional details

You can find the [updated policy here](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship).

## FAQ

### What are reviewers looking for?

We consider the following criteria when evaluating papers:

*   **Novelty:** The paper presents new ideas and results and places them appropriately within the context established by previous research.
*   **Importance:** The paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field. We welcome papers that diverge from the dominant trajectory of the field.
*   **Evidence:** The paper presents sufficient evidence supporting its claims, such as proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, user studies, case studies, and anecdotes.
*   **Clarity:** The paper presents its contributions, methodology, and results clearly.

### How are papers from previous years handled?

We follow the same timeline as the other papers with the following two differences: (1) we try to assign the same reviewers you had in the previous year’s OOPSLA; (2) we strongly discourage reviewers from giving another “major revision” decision.

### Are artifacts required?

No! It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. However, if the nature of the paper’s content and claims suggest there ought to be an artifact, authors must explain why they will not be providing one. The absence of such an explanation can be cause for rejection.

### Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?

Yes. Sometimes artifacts are rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the research results (e.g., packaging issues).

### What exactly do I have to do to anonymize my paper?

Use common sense. Your job is not to make your identity completely undiscoverable (e.g., if a reviewer does a Web search for the text of your paper) but simply to make it possible for reviewers to evaluate your submission without knowing who you are. This includes omitting your names from your title page, and referring to your own work in the third person. For example, if your name is Smith and you have worked on amphibious type systems, instead of saying “We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004]”, you might say “We extend Smith’s [2004] work on statically typed toads.” Also, be sure not to include any acknowledgements that would give away your identity. It is best to suppress acknowledgments entirely until camera-ready.

### Should I change the name of my system?

No. However, if it is not a new system and is likely to be known to others, you should refer to it as if it were created by a third party, rather than as your own creation.

### My submission is based on code available in a public repository. How do I deal with this?

Cite the code in your paper, but replace the URL with text like “link removed for double-blind review”. If you believe reviewer access to your code would help during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.

### I am submitting an extension of my workshop paper. Should I anonymize reference to that work?

Yes, you should treat it like any other anonymization. But you should also change the title of the paper to break a direct link between the two.

### Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv, send it to colleagues, give a talk about it, mention it on social media, …?

We want to help you navigate the tension between the normal communication of scientific results and actions that essentially force potential reviewers to learn the identity of authors. Roughly speaking, you may discuss work under submission, but you should not broadly advertise your work through media that are likely to reach your reviewers. We acknowledge there are grey areas and trade-offs. When in doubt about any of these guidelines, please first check in with the Review Committee Chairs: better safe than sorry. (If the Chairs give you permission, they can then also address any subsequent complaints about those actions from reviewers.)

Things you may do:

*   Put your submission on your home page, arXiv, or other pre-publication sites.
*   Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict.
*   Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc.
*   Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on a pre-publication site, previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing, etc.

Things you should not do:

*   Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be.
*   Publicize your work on social media in an identifiable way with broad settings. For example, a post with a broad privacy setting (public or all friends) saying, “Whew, OOPSLA paper in, time to sleep” is okay, but one describing the work or giving its title is not appropriate. Alternatively, a post with paper details to a group including only the colleagues at your institution is fine.
*   Reviewers will not be asked to recuse themselves from reviewing your paper unless they feel you have gone out of your way to advertise your authorship information to them.

## Submission Guidelines

### Submission Types

PAM welcomes both short and long submissions. This includes early-stage contributions with exciting promise, high-level visions, challenging future directions, validation of important results, or new ideas challenging existing assumptions.

Submissions should describe original research that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue.

### Formatting Requirements

*   Submissions must follow **Springer LNCS format**.
*   **Short papers:** Up to 11 pages for technical content (up to 5 pages for appendices and references).
*   **Long papers:** Up to 24 pages for technical content (up to 5 pages for appendices and references).
*   *Note: Reviewers are not required to read appendices. Everything essential must be within the first 11 pages for short papers and 24 pages for long papers.*.

### Anonymization

Reviewing will be **double-blind**.

*   Do not include names or affiliations of authors in the submission.
*   Refer to your prior work in the third person.
*   Make a best effort to anonymize system names that would identify you.
*   Contact the PC chairs if you have concerns about anonymizing your paper while maintaining its integrity.

### Submission Portal

Please submit your paper via HotCRP: [https://hotcrp.dacs.utwente.nl/pam2025/](https://hotcrp.dacs.utwente.nl/pam2025/)

## Ethical Considerations

Ethics will be considered during the review process. Each paper must include a statement detailing the ethical considerations of the work. If no ethical concerns are raised, this must be clearly stated.

> Papers describing experiments with users or sensitive user data must follow basic precepts of ethical research and subscribe to community norms. These include: respect for privacy, secure storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent if users are placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential, beneficence, and risk mitigation.

Authors may consult the [Menlo Report](https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance) for further ethical information and the [Allman/Paxson IMC 2007 paper](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2007/papers/imc80.pdf) for guidance on ethical data sharing.

Submitting research for approval by an institutional ethics review body is necessary but not sufficient. The PC will consider the ethical soundness and justification of any paper.

If work has been submitted to an IRB or ethics committee, the ethical considerations section or appendix should clearly indicate this and include the reference number of the approval if available.

## Awards

*   **Best Paper Award:** Recognizes the paper with the highest merit.
*   **Community Contribution Award:** Given to the best paper that makes relevant datasets, source code, or platforms available to the public by the camera-ready deadline, sufficiently documented for replication.

## Publication

*   **Publisher:** IARIA Press (operated by Xpert Publishing Services)
*   **Archived:** Open Access IARIA ThinkMind Digital Library
*   **Prints:** Available at Curran Associates, Inc.

Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions to an IARIA Journal.",,,,,

The 13th Workshop on Programming Languages and Operating Systems (PLOS 2025) will be held on **October 13, 2025**, in **Seoul, Republic of Korea**.

This workshop is held in conjunction with the [31st ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP '25)](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/sosp/2025/).

## Rationale and Overview

Historically, operating system (OS) development and programming language (PL) development went hand-in-hand, with cross-fertilization being the norm. Today, modern PL ideas continue to spark innovations in OS design and construction, while the systems field provides challenging problems and practical results that should drive advances in PLs, software designs, and idioms.

This workshop will bring together researchers and developers from the PL and OS domains to discuss recent work at the intersection of these fields. It will serve as a venue for discussing new visions, challenges, experiences, problems, and solutions arising from the application of advanced programming and software engineering concepts to OS construction, and vice versa.

## Suggested Paper Topics

Suggested paper topics include, but are not restricted to:

*   Domain-specific and type-safe languages for the OS;
*   The design of language-specific unikernels;
*   Language-based approaches to crosscutting system concerns, such as security and run-time performance;
*   PL support for system verification, testing, and debugging;
*   Synthesis of OS code;
*   Static/dynamic OS configuration and specialization;
*   PL support for OS integration of modern hardware (NVM, HBM, FPGAs, accelerators, RDMA, etc.);
*   The use of OS abstractions and techniques in language runtimes;
*   Verification and static analysis of OS components;
*   Critical evaluations of new programming language ideas in support of OS construction; and
*   Experience reports on applying new language techniques in commercial OS settings.

## Agenda

The workshop will be a highly interactive event designed to promote focused and lively discussions, including paper presentations. PLOS welcomes research, experience, and position papers; papers describing industrial experience are particularly encouraged. Accepted papers will be made available to registered attendees in advance.

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Language:** All papers must be written in English.
*   **Formatting:** Papers should be formatted in the two-column ACM article style using the options `sigplan,anonymous,10pt`. CCS Concepts, Keywords, and ACM Reference Format sections are not required in submissions.
*   **Double-Blind Review:** Submissions must not include author names and affiliations.
*   **Page Limit:** Submissions must not be more than **six (6) pages** in length, using 10-point font. The bibliography does not count towards the page limit. This limit will be strictly enforced.
*   **Submission Website:** [http://plos25.hotcrp.com/](http://plos25.hotcrp.com/)
*   **Review Criteria:** Papers will be evaluated based on technical quality, originality, relevance, and presentation.
*   **Publication:** Accepted papers will be published electronically in the ACM Digital Library. Authors of accepted papers must sign ACM copyright release forms. Publication in the PLOS workshop proceedings is not intended to replace future conference publication.

## Important Dates (tentative)

*   **Paper submission deadline:** July 25, 2025 (Anywhere on Earth)
*   **Notification of acceptance:** August 25, 2025
*   **Final papers due:** September 19, 2025

## Topics

SOSP takes a broad view of systems and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including: operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, virtualization, networking as it relates to operating systems, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interaction of computer systems with related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, verification, and databases. In keeping with SOSP tradition, we will favor work that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with or measurements of state-of-the-art implementations.

## Submission Criteria

Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. A good paper will:

*   Motivate a significant problem;
*   Propose and implement an interesting, compelling solution;
*   Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution;
*   Draw appropriate conclusions;
*   Clearly describe the paper's contributions; and
*   Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work.

We encourage submission of groundbreaking work in significant new directions, with the understanding that the evaluation criteria for papers addressing new problems may be different from those continuing a line of work in a more established area.

## Artifact Evaluation

SOSP will continue the successful tradition of running an optional Artifact Evaluation process. Authors have a few days after acceptance notifications to register their artifact, then a few more days to polish them for evaluation. The artifact evaluation process is cooperative. Authors have the opportunity to fix problems found by evaluators during the evaluation period, and are thus expected to reply within reasonable time.

## Originality

Submissions should contain original, unpublished material. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism is not allowed. Submissions that extend the authors' previous work are welcome, but authors must explain the differences between the SOSP submission and the prior work, much in the same way that the authors are expected to articulate the contributions of their submission as they relate to prior work by others. Self-comparisons should be properly anonymized, as described below. Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in SOSP. The online submission form will require authors to submit a copy of the related workshop paper and a short explanation of the new material in the conference paper beyond that published in the workshop version. As long as there is significant additional content in the submission compared to the prior workshop publication, the PC will evaluate the submission's entire contribution, not just the delta. Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is explicitly permitted.

## Resubmissions

Submitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted, although authors are expected to have improved the paper to address substantive issues raised in previous reviews. Authors should provide information regarding the previous submission(s) and a summary of the subsequent revisions to the paper. This description, which will be supplied to reviewers after they’ve completed their reviews, helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit the description of changes to one page. All information should be properly anonymized, as described below, and should be uploaded via the submission form.

## Anonymity

SOSP will use double-blind reviewing. Please make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of the author names. If the name of your project or system is already known to the community (e.g., through arXiv, technical reports, talks, social media posts, or other uses), your SOSP submission must use an anonymized name. Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. For example, you might say ""Our system modifies the XYZ operating system built by Lee et al. [Lee17]"". For concurrent submissions on related topics, cite an anonymized version of the concurrent submission and discuss the relation between the submissions. Additionally, please email the PC chairs (program@sosp26.cit.tum.de) a copy of your other concurrent submission. If your submission reports on experiences with a system at your institution or organization, you should refer to the system anonymously but describe the properties of the system that are needed to appreciate the work (e.g., size of the user base, volume of requests, etc.). We recognize that, in some cases, these properties may allow a reviewer to identify your institution or organization. Check with the program chairs (program@sosp26.cit.tum.de) if you are uncertain about the anonymity rules.

## Supplementary Material

Authors may optionally include supplementary material as a separate document. Supplementary material is intended for items that are not critical for evaluating the paper but may be of interest to some readers. Examples include: formal proofs that are only sketched in the submission, additional analyses, and methodological details that aren’t essential for the PC’s assessment but are important for reproducibility. PC members are not required to read this optional supplementary material, so the submission must stand alone without it.

## Formatting

Papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format via the [web submission form](https://sosp26.hotcrp.com/) (TBD).

Submissions may have at most **12 pages** of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit. Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by 8 mm (0.33 in) of whitespace. Use 10-point font (typeface Times Roman, Linux Libertine, etc.) on 12-point (single-spaced) leading. Graphs and figures should be readable without magnification; they are encouraged to be in color, but should remain readable if printed in grayscale. All pages should be numbered, and references within the paper should be hyperlinked.

Submissions violating these rules will not be considered for publication, and there will be no extensions for fixing violations. We encourage you to upload an early draft of the paper well before the deadline to check if the paper meets the formatting rules. Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the [official SIGPLAN LaTeX](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) or [MS Word templates](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) from the ACM.

For Latex, we recommend you use:
```latex
\documentclass[sigplan,10pt]{acmart}
\renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{}
... (other preamble settings)
\settopmatter{printfolios=true}
\maketitle
\pagestyle{plain}
...
```

## Confidentiality

Reviewing will be done mostly by members of the program committee, with limited use of outside reviewers. Submissions will be treated as confidential; however, papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered for publication.

## Conflicts

To avoid conflicts of interest in the review process, when you register and submit your paper, we ask that you provide information about conflicts between any of the authors of your submission and PC members. Use the following guidelines to determine conflicts:

*   **Institutional:** You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years (since April 2024), or are going to begin employment at the same institution. Former interns should list their internship supervisor(s) and collaborator(s) as conflicts, not the entire institution where they interned.
*   **Advisor:** You have a past or present association as PhD thesis advisor or advisee.
*   **Collaborator:** You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years (April 2024 or later).
*   **Personal:** You are close family relatives (e.g., spouses, domestic partners, parents, children, or siblings).

The PC chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. Similarly, if there is no basis for conflicts provided by authors, such conflicts may be removed (e.g., do not improperly identify a PC member as a conflict in an attempt to avoid having the individual review your paper). If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program co-chairs (program@sosp26.cit.tum.de).

PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the ""conflict chair"". Any paper with a PC chair co-author will be held to a higher standard of being a “clear accept”.

## Author Response Period

SOSP will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments or data, describe additional work completed since submission, or promise additional work to follow. As PC members are not required to review supplementary materials, responses must not rely on the existence of those materials. Submission of a response is optional. There is no explicit limit to the response, but authors are strongly encouraged to keep responses under 500 words; reviewers are neither required nor expected to read excessively long responses.

## Accepted Papers

Papers selected by the program committee will be subject to revision and approval by a program committee member acting as a shepherd. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to supply electronic versions of their papers and encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and understand their results, as part of an artifact evaluation process. To facilitate broad technical discussion, all accepted papers will be made available online in advance of the conference. The official publication date will be the date the proceedings are made publicly accessible. For more information about the ACM OpenSurround Service, please go to [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/free-access](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/free-access). Papers of particular merit will be forwarded to the ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS) and the Communications of the ACM's Research Highlights (CACM RH) for possible publication.

## About TechDebt 2026

Technical Debt stands as a pivotal metaphor in the realm of software evolution, representing development shortcuts taken for expediency that cause the degradation of internal software quality. A critical element of the technical debt metaphor is its ability to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders within software development teams. The International Conference on Technical Debt (TechDebt) is the flagship conference dedicated to discussing how to identify, address, and manage technical debt in software projects. This premier event unites leading researchers and practitioners in software engineering to explore diverse strategies for managing various forms of technical debt, share experiences and best practices, and identify the most pressing challenges faced by both industry and academia.

The 9th International Conference on Technical Debt will be held on **April 12-13, 2026**, in **Rio de Janeiro, Brazil**. As with the previous editions, TechDebt will be co-located with the **48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)**.

Manuscripts will be double-blind to regular and Senior PC members, but metadata will be available to Associate Chairs for conflict of interest checks. Papers not related to the conference theme may be desk-rejected.

## Ethical Considerations

Submitted manuscripts should include a section on the ethical implications of the proposed research. This section will not count towards the page limit and should discuss potential negative societal impacts (e.g., fairness, privacy, security, misuse) and appropriate mitigation strategies.

## Acceptance and Presentation

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference (in-person) to present the paper. Each paper requires a paper presentation fee. WSDM 2026 is an in-person conference with no remote presentation options. Papers not presented will be removed from the proceedings.

## Publication and Open Access Policy

ACM will transition to 100% Open Access starting January 1, 2026. Authors can publish via the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs). Most papers will not require APCs if the author's institution participates in ACM Open. For authors from non-participating institutions, APCs may apply, subject to waivers and discounts. A temporary subsidy for 2026 is available: **$250 APC for ACM/SIG members** and **$350 for non-members**.

## Program Committee (PC) Membership

Interested individuals with at least 5 years of research experience and prior reviewer experience for WSDM or related conferences are welcome to reach out to pcchairs-wsdm2026@easychair.org. Self-nomination for Senior PC is not accepted.",,,,,

## Reviewing Philosophy

We strongly encourage constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work. The aim of the reviewing process is to assess whether the work is close to being ready for publication, and the interaction between authors and referees is meant to guide the paper into a publishable state.

## Rebuttal Phase

As in previous years, there will be a rebuttal phase during the review process. Initial reviews will be sent to authors before final decisions are made, and authors will have an opportunity to address the issues brought up in the reviews.

## Awards

COLT will award both **best paper** and **best student paper** awards. To be eligible for the best student paper award, the primary contributor(s) must be full-time students at the time of submission.

## Dual Submissions Policy

Submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings or journals may not be submitted to COLT.

## Publication

Accepted papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper should present the work at the conference. Accepted papers will be published electronically in the **Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR)**. Authors will have the option of opting out of the proceedings in favor of a 1-page extended abstract, which will point to an open access archival version of the full paper.

## Call for Open Problems

## Sharing and Reproducibility

Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly accessible during the review process, unless there is an inevitable reason that prohibits sharing (e.g., it requires data from a specific company or it is medical data where there is no public alternative). Algorithms and resources used in a paper should be described as completely as possible to enable reproducibility. This includes model parameters, experimental methodology, hardware and software platforms used during empirical evaluations, and results. The reproducibility factor will play an important role in the assessment of each submission. In the case where data cannot be released publicly, authors are encouraged to include experiments on relevant public datasets and/or create simulated data with the same properties.

## Policies

Please read the [Dual submission, Plagiarism, and Conflict of Interest](https://ikdd.acm.org/cods-2025/common-instructions-and-policies.php) policies before finalising your submission.

## Awards and Grants

Several technical awards are available for best paper, etc. The awards will be announced during the conference.

Partial travel Grants will be available for students whose papers are accepted.

## Double Anonymity Requirement

CODS 2025 will be using double-anonymous reviewing for Research Track papers (but not the ADS Track papers). Please review the instructions below carefully.

*   Authors’ names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or anywhere else in the submission. Funding sources must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the submission. The file names of any documents submitted must not identify the authors of the submission. Source file naming must also be done with care, to avoid identifying the authors’ names in the submission’s associated metadata.
*   Only after acceptance at the camera-ready stage should the author list, acknowledgments, and funding sources be added to the paper.
*   If a version of a submission already resides on a pre-publication server, such as arXiv, the authors do not need to remove it before submitting to CODS.
*   Be careful when referring to related past work, particularly your own, in the paper. Authors must refer to their own past work in the third person. This allows setting the context for your submission, while at the same time preserving anonymity. Do not omit referring to your own past related work because that could reveal your identity by negation. Limit self-references to only the essential ones. Extended versions of the submitted paper (e.g., technical reports or URLs for downloadable versions) must not be referenced.
*   Many peer-reviewed conferences have successfully followed double anonymity for decades to offer more equity for all authors in the reviewing process. Common sense and careful writing can go a long way toward preserving double anonymity without diminishing the quality or impact of a paper. It is the responsibility of the authors to do their very best to preserve double anonymity.
*   Papers that do not follow the guidelines here, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to Desk Rejection.

The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research (CPAIOR 2025) will be held in **Melbourne, Australia**, from **November 10 to November 13, 2025**. The conference will be co-located with [ICAPS 2025](https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/) and [KR 2025](https://kr.org/KR2025/).

While the conference will take place later in the year than usual, papers are still due in December 2024, in order to not interfere with the usual sequence of conference deadlines.

## Aim and Scope

The aim of CPAIOR is to promote a space where researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Operations Research (OR) present innovative techniques, new applications, and original cutting-edge ideas, thereby encouraging researchers from one area to learn from the others. Of particular interest to the conference are papers that integrate concepts and methodologies from these different fields, either proposing interesting new techniques for complex/practical problems or expanding our theoretical insights and cross-field understanding. However, high-quality original papers from a single area are welcome when also relevant to the other communities involved. The conference also strongly encourages regular papers or experience reports showcasing CP/AI/OR techniques on challenging real-world applications.

## Topics of Interest

The program committee invites submissions that include, but are not limited to, the following topics:

*   New methodologies in the interface between predictive and prescriptive pipelines, such as machine learning techniques applied to tackle optimization problems and, conversely, CP/OR techniques to address AI and machine learning tasks.
*   Novel relaxation and inference methods based on constraint propagation, polyhedral techniques/cutting planes, convex/second-order conic optimization, graph-based algorithms, dynamic programming, and decision diagrams for optimization.
*   New search perspectives involving enumeration/branch-and-bound strategies, innovative decomposition techniques (e.g., based on column generation/Benders), intelligent backtracking, incomplete search, and learning-based heuristics.
*   Advanced integrated methods that expose new model transformations, communication strategies across MIP/CP/SAT solvers, distributed solution techniques, and solver selection (e.g., portfolio approaches).
*   Innovative models and applications of CP/AI/OR techniques.
*   Implementation or evaluation of CP/AI/OR techniques and optimization systems.

## Submission Types

Submissions are of two types:

1.  **Regular Papers:** Submitted for publication and presentation.
    *   **Long Papers:** At most **15 pages** plus references.
    *   **Short Papers:** At most **8 pages** plus references.
    Both long and short papers will undergo rigorous review and are eligible for awards. Short papers are particularly encouraged for interesting and novel work in progress.

2.  **Extended Abstracts:** Submitted for presentation only (not formally published in LNCS, but a collection will be published on the conference website).
    *   Length: One or two pages.
    *   May present preliminary work or work already published in other outlets (should state the outlet).

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Review Process:** Single-blind (author names are visible to reviewers, reviewer names are hidden from authors).
*   **Proceedings:** Published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series (LNCS).
*   **Format:** Papers should be prepared in the LNCS format. Instructions and templates can be found on the Springer website.
*   **Submission Platform:** [OpenReview.net](https://openreview.net/group?id=cpaior.org/CPAIOR/2025/Conference)
*   **Originality:** Papers submitted to CPAIOR must not be under review at a different venue at the same time.

## Important Dates (Regular Papers)

*   **Abstracts Due:** **December 8, 2024** (AoE)
*   **Full Papers Due:** **December 15, 2024** (AoE, no extension possible)
*   **Rebuttal Phase:** January 26-29, 2025 (AoE)

## Important Dates (Extended Abstracts)

*   **Abstracts Due:** August 2025 (TBA)
*   **Notification of Acceptance:** September 2025 (TBA)

## Awards

The conference will recognize a **Distinguished Paper Award** and a **Student Paper Award**.

### Main Conference Submissions

We invite original contributions that have not been previously published to another venue. The page limit for the contributions submitted to the main conference, including special sessions, is **15 pages** in the LNCS format (note that 15 pages in LNCS format is roughly equivalent to 8 pages in NeurIPS format). This includes figures, title pages, references, and appendices.

Submission of the camera-ready version of the paper has to include the authors' consent to publish on the above Springer LNCS website.

Submissions will be reviewed following a **single-blind procedure**. Therefore, authors should include their names and affiliations in the paper.

Authors may not submit any paper that is under review elsewhere or has been accepted for publication in a journal or another conference; neither will they submit their papers elsewhere during the review period of DS 2025.

Accepted papers will be published in the **Discovery Science Springer LNCS series**.

### One-day Event (Workshops) Submissions

DS2025 will include several satellite events dedicated to specific applications of AI to science and technology. We invite original technical/position papers or contributions discussing published works. We particularly welcome contributions presenting initial or late-breaking results as well as ongoing work, including works currently under review at other venues.

For the parallel one-day events, the page limit for contributions is **2 pages** in LNCS format, including figures, title pages, references, and appendices.

Submissions to the parallel one-day events are **non-archival** and, therefore, will not be included in the conference proceedings.

## Artifacts

DSN supports open science. Authors are encouraged to make their code and datasets publicly available for reproducibility and replicability. A separate artifact evaluation track will be offered for accepted papers. Authors should indicate their intent to submit an artifact, its type, and reserve a DOI on an open-access repository (Zenodo or Figshare) at the time of paper submission. Artifacts will be evaluated by a dedicated Artifacts Evaluation (AE) committee.

## Review Process and Author Response

DSN employs a double-blind review process. In addition to a rebuttal process, a **Paper Revision Process** is in place for papers not early rejected. Authors will be invited to submit a revised paper along with a rebuttal to strengthen their submission and allow reviewers to see addressed comments. Revised papers may have an extra page allowance (12 pages for regular, 8 for practical/tool). The rebuttal is strictly limited to 750 words.

## Awards

DSN gives three Best Paper Awards, with one receiving a Distinguished Best Paper Award based on oral presentation quality. Awards are also given for Best Ph.D. Dissertation, Rising Star in Dependability, Test-of-Time, and Jean-Claude Laprie. A Distinguished Artifact Award is also presented.

## Open Science Policy

Authors are encouraged to make all research results accessible and ensure reproducibility. Sharing research data is not mandatory but is strongly encouraged.

## Ethical Considerations

Submissions describing experiments with human subjects or with ethical implications must discuss how ethical concerns were addressed and disclose if an ethics review was conducted. Papers reporting high-impact vulnerabilities should discuss steps taken to address them. The PC may examine the ethical soundness of papers.

MEMOCODE: ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Formal Methods and Models for System Design

Over the last decade, the boundaries between computer system components, such as hardware, software, firmware, middleware, and applications, have blurred. This evolution in system design and development practices led in 2014 to a change in the title and scope of the MEMOCODE conference from its original focus on hardware/software co-design to its new focus on formal methods and models for developing computer systems and their components. MEMOCODE’s objective is to emphasize the importance of models and methodologies in correct system design and development, and to bring together researchers and industry practitioners interested in all aspects of computer system development, to exchange ideas, research results and lessons learned.

ESWEEK 2025 will take place as an in-person event from **September 28th to October 3rd, 2025 in Taipei, Taiwan**. MEMOCODE is one of the symposia held as part of ESWEEK.

The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation (PEPM) has a history going back to 1991 and has been held in conjunction with POPL every year since 2006. The origin of PEPM is in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over time, PEPM has broadened its scope to include a variety of research areas centered around semantics-based program manipulation — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analyzed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties.

PEPM 2025 will be held on **January 21, 2025**, in **Denver, Colorado, United States**, in conjunction with POPL 2025.

## Scope

In addition to the traditional PEPM topics, PEPM 2025 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular:

*   Semantics-based and machine-learning-based program synthesis and program optimization.
*   Modeling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications.

More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2025 include, but are not limited to:

*   Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation.
*   Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation.
*   Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation.
*   Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security.

This list of categories is not exhaustive, and we encourage submissions describing new theories and applications related to semantics-based program manipulation in general. If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the program co-chairs, Guillaume Allais (guillaume.allais@strath.ac.uk) and Annie Liu (liu@cs.stonybrook.edu).

## Submission Types

Three kinds of submissions will be accepted:

*   **Regular Research Papers:** Should describe new results, and will be judged on originality, correctness, significance, and clarity. Must not exceed **12 pages**. Accepted papers will appear in formal proceedings published by ACM and be included in the ACM Digital Library.
*   **Short Papers:** May include tool demonstrations and presentations of exciting if not fully polished research, and of interesting academic, industrial, and open-source applications. Must not exceed **6 pages**. Accepted short papers do not constitute formal publications and will not appear in the proceedings.

*   Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom
*   Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages

PADL 2025 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches related to applications, design, and implementation of declarative languages going beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example, advanced database languages and contract languages, as well as verification and theorem-proving methods that rely on declarative languages.

## Submissions

PADL 2025 welcomes:

*   **Regular papers** (max. 15 pages, excluding references) describing original and previously unpublished research results on complex and/or real-world applications in industry or other areas of research that rely on an innovative use of declarative languages; tools and/or systems developed for such applications, and/or to improve practical aspects of declarative languages; and technical results related to the practical aspects of declarative languages. Application and systems descriptions, engineering solutions, and real-world experiences (both positive and negative) are in particular solicited. These papers will be published in the formal proceedings.
*   **Short papers** (max. 8 pages, excluding references) on the same topics as regular papers. These papers will also be published in the formal proceedings.
*   **Extended abstracts** (max. 3 pages) on the topics above, describing new ideas, a new perspective on already published work, or work-in-progress that is not yet ready for a full publication. Extended abstracts will be posted on the symposium website but will not be published in the formal proceedings.

All page limits exclude references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style: [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)

## Review Process

PKC 2025 will operate a two-round review system with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee selects submissions for the second round and provides review comments. Authors of selected submissions can submit a text-based rebuttal letter. In the second round, the program committee further reviews selected submissions considering the rebuttal letters to make final acceptance or rejection decisions. Submissions not selected in the first round may be submitted to other conferences after the first round notification date.

## Awards

The Program Committee may choose a paper for an overall best paper award. To promote independent work by early-career researchers, the Program Committee may also award a prize for the best paper authored exclusively by early-career researchers. Eligibility requires all co-authors to be studying full/part-time or to have received their degree in 2019 or later. Awards are given only if deserving papers are identified.

## Stipends

Students whose papers are accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration waived. A limited number of stipends are available for those unable to obtain funding. Students presenting their own papers are encouraged to apply if needed. Requests for stipends should be sent to the general chair.

The 47th IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP 2026) will be held from **May 18-21, 2026**, at the **Hilton San Francisco Union Square, San Francisco, CA**.

## Overview

Since 1980, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for presenting developments in computer security and electronic privacy, and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field.

## Submission Topics

We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in any aspect of security or privacy. Papers may present advances in the theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and measurement of secure systems. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice.

Topics of interest include:

*   Applied cryptography
*   Attacks with novel insights, techniques, or results
*   Authentication, access control, and authorization
*   Blockchains and distributed ledger security
*   Cloud computing security
*   Cyber physical systems security
*   Distributed systems security
*   Economics of security and privacy
*   Embedded systems security
*   Formal methods and verification
*   Hardware security
*   Hate, Harassment, and Online Abuse
*   Human-centered security and privacy
*   Intrusion detection and prevention
*   Malware and unwanted software
*   Network security and measurement
*   ML - Methods for confidentiality and privacy of data in ML systems
*   ML - Methods for integrity and availability of ML systems
*   ML - Novel attacks on ML systems
*   ML - Verifying security and privacy properties of ML algorithms
*   Operating systems security
*   Privacy-enhancing technologies, anonymity, and censorship
*   Program and binary analysis
*   Protocol security
*   Security and privacy metrics
*   Security and privacy policies
*   Security architectures
*   Security for at-risk populations
*   Software supply chain security
*   Systems security
*   User studies for security and privacy
*   Web security and privacy
*   Wireless and mobile security/privacy

This topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; S&P is interested in all aspects of computer security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to security or privacy, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.

## Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers

We solicit SoK papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge. Suitable papers provide an important new viewpoint on an established research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs with compelling evidence, or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate.

Submissions should be prefixed with “**SoK:**” in the title and have a checkbox selected on the submission form.

SoCS 2025

Heuristic search and other forms of combinatorial search and optimization are very active areas of research in artificial intelligence, robotics, planning, constraint programming, meta-reasoning, navigation, bioinformatics, and other areas of computer science and operations research. The International Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS) is meant to bring researchers in such areas together to exchange their ideas and cross-fertilize the field. We especially invite submissions presenting real-world applications of heuristic search.

With CP 2025 and SAT 2025 co-located this year, we particularly welcome papers that explore the intersections between our research topics and the problems studied by these communities.

**Submissions are now closed.**

All accepted papers will be included in the proceedings published by AAAI Press.

## Types of Submissions

We encourage researchers to submit three categories of papers to the symposium:

*   **Technical papers:** Original long (up to 8 pages plus up to one page of references) and short (up to 4 pages plus up to one page of references) papers are the standard category. We welcome technical papers that report substantial original research in search or in related areas that are not under review in other archival conferences or journals.
*   **Position papers:** In addition to the main technical track, we encourage authors to submit original long (up to 8 pages plus up to one page of references) and short (up to 4 pages plus up to one page of references) position papers discussing ideas and concepts related to heuristic and combinatorial search. Examples of position papers could include thoughtful critiques or bold new perspectives of the field, historical perspectives and analysis, technical discussions of various implementation techniques, methodological contributions, and insightful reports on new and demanding applications.
*   **Extended abstracts:** To foster the exchange of ideas at SoCS, we encourage authors to submit extended abstracts (up to 2 pages, including references) of original work, work-in-progress, or work that has recently appeared in or is under review at other venues such as AAAI/ICAPS/IJCAI. Most archival conferences do not consider a 2-page extended abstract as preventing the submission of a full-length technical paper giving full details on the same work. For recently published work, authors can alternatively submit their original published paper for review (no page limit and no need to remove author information, but please indicate on the front page when and where the paper was published). If the submission is accepted, authors will then be required to submit a 2-page abstract for the proceedings. The submitted version itself will not be reprinted in the proceedings. All extended abstract submissions will be lightly reviewed in order to ensure that they are of interest to the SoCS community.

## Submission Instructions

*   Submitted technical and position papers must be original and not submitted concurrently to a journal or another conference. **Double-blind reviewing** will be provided, so submitted papers must omit **author names and affiliations**.
*   Extended abstracts representing previously published or under-review work should mention this on the first page (e.g., in the title).
*   The paper submission is a two-step process. First, the paper abstract needs to be registered in EasyChair by the Paper abstract submission deadline. Then, the full paper in PDF is due by the Paper submission deadline. Remember, without registering your abstract on time, you will not be allowed to submit the paper later.
*   Submissions may be accompanied by supplementary material (video, appendices), which must also be anonymized. Reviewers will not be required to consult such material - submitted paper should stand on their own. The omission of supplementary material will not disadvantage a submission during the review.
*   SoCS will not accept any technical or position paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Authors are also required not to submit their technical or position papers elsewhere during SoCS's review period.

*   [Author kit](https://aaai.org/authorkit25/)
*   [Submission link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=socs2025)

## Important Dates

All deadlines are at 23:59 UTC-12.

*   **Paper abstract submission deadline:** March 19, 2025 (now closed)
*   **Paper submission deadline:** March 26, 2025 (now closed)
*   **Author response:** May 2-5, 2025 (already past)
*   **Notification:** May 16, 2025
*   **Camera-ready copy:** May 30, 2025

## Best paper awards

Technical papers will be considered for the best paper award. If the main authors, both in terms of work and writing, are students at the time of submission, the paper will be considered for a best student paper award.

TAP 2024 is the 18th International Conference on Tests and Proofs. TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability.

Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of dynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic techniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Notable examples that provide evidence for the potential of a combination of static and dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based on symbolic execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking, or the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive enumeration. The verification of systems based on machine learning spurs novel combinations of dynamic and static analyses, e.g., property verification of surrogate models that are generated through testing.

TAP’s scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology, including foundational work, tool development, and empirical research. Topics of interest center around the combination of static techniques such as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.

## Invited Speakers

*   **Rosemary Monahan** (Maynooth University, Ireland)
*   **Rüdiger Ehlers** (TU Clausthal, Germany)

## Topics of Interest

Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

*   Verification and analysis techniques combining proofs and tests,
*   Static analysis of programs with the aid of dynamic techniques,
*   Deductive techniques supporting the automated generation of test vectors and oracles,
*   Deductive techniques supporting (novel) definitions of coverage criteria,
*   Specification inference by deductive or dynamic methods,
*   Testing and runtime analysis of formal specifications,
*   Search-based techniques for proving and testing,
*   Testing and Verification of systems based on machine learning,

## Introduction

As computer systems, communication networks and artificial intelligence (AI) undergo rapid development, accompanied by increasing complexity, the expectations of users for trust, security, and privacy have grown considerably. This presents a significant challenge, as traditional security technologies and measures may struggle to meet the evolving demands within open, dynamic, heterogeneous, mobile, wireless, and distributed computing environments. Consequently, the imperative is to construct systems and networks that enable users to access more comprehensive services while concurrently upholding trust, security, and privacy. In response to this challenge, trusted computing and communications have emerged as pivotal and innovative technologies, capturing the heightened interest of researchers. These advancements offer promising solutions to address the intricate demands of contemporary computing landscapes.

The conference continues the tradition of successful IEEE TrustCom conferences held from 2002 to 2023 across Asia, Europe, Australia, and America. It will feature sessions of regular presentations, workshops, tutorials, and keynote speeches.

The conference theme for 2025 is \'Safe and Responsible Multimodal Interactions\'.","# ICMI 2025: Call for Papers

The 27th International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (ICMI 2025) will be held in **Canberra, Australia**.

ICMI is the premier international forum for advancing research at the intersection of multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) and social interaction. Multimodal AI addresses technical challenges in machine learning and computational modelling, such as representations, data fusion, system design, and large-scale data management. Social interaction research encompasses both human-human interactions and human-computer interactions to uncover insights that bridge behavioural understanding with technology. A unique aspect of ICMI is its multidisciplinary nature which values both scientific discoveries and technical innovations, with an eye towards impactful applications that benefit people and society.

## Novelty

Novelty will be evaluated along two dimensions: scientific novelty and technical novelty. Accepted papers at ICMI 2025 must demonstrate novelty in at least one of these dimensions:

*   **Scientific Novelty:** Papers should contribute new scientific insights into human social interactions, including human-computer interactions. Authors are expected to conduct a thorough literature review and clearly articulate the scientific advancements and discoveries presented in their work.
*   **Technical Novelty:** Papers should introduce innovations in their computational approach for recognising, generating or modelling multimodal data. Novelty may also arise from creative and impactful new applications of existing methodologies.

## Ethical Conduct

Commitment to ethical conduct is mandatory and submissions must adhere to ethical standards in particular when human-derived data are employed. Authors are encouraged to consult the [ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://ethics.acm.org/).

## ICMI 2025 Conference Theme: Safe and Responsible Multimodal Interactions

The focus is on exploring how multimodal systems and multimodal interactive applications can support safe, ethical, and inclusive interactions across diverse contexts, ensuring that advancements in multimodal AI and interaction technologies align with societal values and address pressing global challenges.

This theme emphasizes the importance of developing systems that prioritize users’ well-being, trust, and fairness. It calls for addressing critical issues such as bias mitigation, ensuring transparency in decision-making processes, and upholding privacy and security in handling multimodal data. Researchers are encouraged to explore innovative approaches that promote inclusivity and accessibility for underrepresented communities and vulnerable populations, fostering a more equitable digital future.

Furthermore, the theme highlights the role of multimodal AI in addressing real-world safety concerns, such as building reliable systems for mental health monitoring, assisting vulnerable users (e.g., children, elderly individuals, or those with disabilities), and supporting safety-critical applications, including healthcare, education, and autonomous systems.

## Topics of Interest

## Best Paper Award and Editorial Follow-Up

The best paper will receive the prestigious Mark Weiser Best Paper Award.

Selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions for a special issue of the Pervasive and Mobile Computing Journal.

## Submission Details

Paper submission must be done for the main conference and all associated events via EDAS. If you do not have an EDAS account, please, register first (it’s free) via the following link: [register](register). The direct submission link for PerCom 2026 is [here](here).

PerCom 2026 will follow a double-blind review process. Authors are expected to make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions. In particular, as in previous PerCom editions, publishing pre-prints of your submitted papers in online archives (e.g., arXiv) prior to submission does NOT disqualify the paper from consideration at PerCom. Moreover, we instruct reviewers NOT to go searching for pre-prints of submitted papers.

Submitted papers must be unpublished and not considered elsewhere for publication. Also, they must show a significant relevance to pervasive computing and communications. Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous review process handled by the Technical Program Committee. Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered.

The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as formatting instructions, can be found [here](here). Papers must be at most 9 pages of technical content (10pt font, 2-column format), including text, figures, and tables, and up to 1 additional page for references only.

PerCom 2026 introduces a rebuttal phase to further improve the quality of the review process. Authors are offered the opportunity to respond to the initial reviews. Particularly, they are encouraged to briefly clarify points, explain misunderstandings, etc.

PerCom would not be PerCom without its community. For this reason, we are looking for ways to strengthen the community and encourage meaningful interactions. To this end, all accepted papers must be presented in person by one of the authors, in addition to having an associated full registration. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the exclusion of the paper from the final proceedings and from the IEEE Digital Library, and the paper will not be eligible for the Best Paper Award.

We strongly advise authors of submitted papers to be prepared to apply for their visa (if required for entry into Italy) as soon as their paper is accepted.

Accepted papers will be published in IEEE Xplore. All accepted papers will be invited to submit an artifact abstract providing the code, data, results, etc. associated with the contribution.

## Junior PC

MSR 2026 will integrate the junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!

The primary audience for the Junior PC is early-career researchers (PhD students, postdocs, new faculty members, and industry practitioners) who are keen to get more involved in the academic peer-review process but have not yet served on a technical research track program committee at big international SE conferences (e.g., ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, MSR, ICSME, SANER).

All submissions to the MSR research track will be reviewed jointly by both regular and junior PC members, as part of the same process. We expect that each paper will receive three reviews from PC members. The final decisions will be made by consensus among all reviewers.

## Submission Process

All submissions must be in PDF format and conform to the official ACM Primary Article Template, which can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template page. LaTeX users should use the `sigconf` option, as well as the `review` (to produce line numbers) and `anonymous` (omitting author names) options.

Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the [submission site](https://msr2026.hotcrp.com).

All submissions must adhere to the following requirements:

*   All submissions must not exceed **10 pages for the main text**, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. **Two more pages containing only references are permitted.**
*   Submissions must strictly conform to the ACM conference proceedings formatting instructions.
*   Papers submitted to MSR 2026 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2026.
*   If the research involves human participants/subjects, the authors must adhere to the ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.
*   Authors will be asked to fill out a copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing the camera-ready version of their papers.

## Open Science Policy

The MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. We expect all contributing authors to disclose:

*   The source code of relevant software.
*   The data used in the paper.
*   Instructions for other researchers describing how to reproduce or replicate the results.

The 22nd International Conference on Managed Programming Languages & Runtimes (MPLR, formerly ManLang, originally PPPJ) will be held as part of ICFP/SPLASH 2025 in Singapore.

MPLR is a premier forum for presenting and discussing novel results in all aspects of managed programming languages and runtime systems, which serve as building blocks for some of the most important computing systems in use, ranging from small-scale (embedded and real-time systems) to large-scale (cloud-computing and big-data platforms) and anything in between (desktop, mobile, IoT, and wearable applications).

## Topics

The areas of interest include but are not limited to:

### Languages and Compilers

*   Managed languages (e.g., Java, Scala, JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C#, F#, Clojure, Groovy, Kotlin, R, Smalltalk, Racket, Rust, Go, Lua, MATLAB, Raku, Pony, …)
*   Domain-specific languages
*   Language design
*   Compilers and interpreters
*   Type systems and program logics
*   Language interoperability
*   Parallelism, distribution, and concurrency

### Virtual Machines

*   Portable intermediate representations (e.g., JVM, WebAssembly, RPython, …)
*   Managed runtime systems (e.g., GraalVM, Android Runtime (ART), V8, JavaScriptCore, .NET, …)
*   VM design and optimization
*   VMs for mobile and embedded devices
*   VMs for real-time applications
*   Memory management and garbage collection
*   Hardware/software co-design
*   Persistence

### Techniques, Tools, and Applications

*   Static and dynamic program analysis
*   Testing and debugging
*   Refactoring
*   Program understanding
*   Program synthesis
*   Security and privacy
*   Performance analysis and monitoring
*   Compiler and program verification and model checking

If you are unsure whether a particular topic falls within the scope of MPLR ’25 or if you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to contact the Program Chair Tomoharu Ugawa at ugawa ci i u-tokyo ac jp.

## Submission Categories

MPLR accepts three types of submissions:

*   **Regular research papers:** describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms. Research papers will be evaluated based on their relevance, novelty, technical rigor, and contribution to the state-of-the-art. (Format: up to 12 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix)
*   **Work-in-progress research papers:** describing hot topics or promising new ideas, with perhaps less maturity than full papers. Work-in-progress papers will be evaluated with an emphasis on novelty and the potential of the new ideas instead of technical rigor and experimental results. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix)
*   **Industry and tool papers:** presenting technical challenges and solutions for managed language platforms in the context of deployed applications and systems. Industry and tool papers will be evaluated on their relevance, usefulness, and results. Suitability for demonstration and availability will also be considered for tool papers. (Format: up to 6 pages, excluding bibliography and appendix; up to 12 pages allowed if justified by the content)

Accepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library, except if the authors prefer not to be included.

MPLR 2025 submissions must conform to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions and to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy. See [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication)

MPLR 2025 will not hold its own poster session. Please consider submitting to the SPLASH poster track.

## Author Instructions

Submissions need to use the ACM SIGPLAN format with the sigplan style.

If you are using LaTeX, submissions need to use the acmart document class with the sigplan option (not the sigconf option). In the acmart-primary.zip file that downloads from the LaTeX (Version 1.90) link on the [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) page, look for `samples/sample-sigplan.tex` as a guide. If you use Overleaf, be sure to change the documentclass option `manuscript` to `sigplan`. For ease of reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission using the LaTeX command `\settopmatter{printfolios=true}`. Please use the standard setting, e.g., the default font size for the SIGPLAN style is 10 point and the format uses two columns for the test.

All submissions need to be in PDF format. MPLR now uses double-blind reviewing. Authors should not show their names on a submission and should refer to their own work in third person. We further recommend that they avoid publicizing the work, at least under the same or similar title, while it is under review.

Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.
