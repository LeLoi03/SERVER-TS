The review process will consist of two rounds with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee will reject some submissions; the rest will proceed to the second round. At the end of the first round, the authors will be either notified of rejection, or invited to submit a response to questions from the program committee (if any). The authors' response will be used to make the final decision in the second round.

The double-blind review process will follow the IACR Conflict of Interest Policy. The authors will be asked, at submission time, to help identify program committee members with potential conflicts of interest.

## Awards

The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall **Best Paper Award**. The Program Committee may also award a prize for the **best paper(s) authored exclusively by students and postdocs** (at the time of submission). Awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.

## Stipends

Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. A limited number of stipends will be available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply.

ECAI 2025 is planned as an in-person event, encouraging participation and knowledge sharing in a city renowned for its ancient university and thriving scientific environment.","# ECAI 2025: Call for Main Track Papers

We invite all members of the international AI research community to submit their best work to the **28th European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI-2025)**, which will take place in the historic city of Bologna from **October 25 to 30, 2025**.

We welcome submissions on all aspects of AI. Submissions will be subject to **double-blind peer review** by the programme committee. They will be evaluated based on relevance, clarity, significance, originality, soundness, reproducibility, scholarship, and quality of presentation.

The conference is planned as an **in-person event**. Each accepted paper will get assigned either an oral presentation slot or a combined poster/spotlight presentation slot. The presentation modality is not intended to reflect perceived scientific quality of the paper, so this assignment will be made in a randomised fashion (subject to programme constraints).

The open-access proceedings will be published by [IOS Press](https://frontiersinai.com/?q=ecai). A selection of the best papers submitted to the conference will be invited for fast-track consideration by the Artificial Intelligence Journal or the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research.

## Topics

Submissions on all aspects of AI are welcome. This includes in particular:

*   Computer Vision
*   Constraints and Satisfiability
*   Data Mining
*   Fairness, Ethics, and Trust
*   Game Theory and Economic Paradigms
*   Humans and AI
*   Intelligent Robotics
*   Knowledge Representation and Reasoning
*   Machine Learning
*   Multiagent Systems
*   Natural Language Processing
*   Planning and Search
*   Uncertainty in AI
*   Multidisciplinary Topics

## Important Dates

*   Submission site opening: **Thursday, 10 April 2025**

*   Paper deadline: **Tuesday, 6 May 2025**
*   Rebuttal period: **Monday-Wednesday 23-25 June 2025** (72 hours)
*   Author notification: **Thursday, 10 July 2025**
*   Early registration deadline: TBC
*   Camera-ready deadline: **Tuesday, 26 August 2025**

All deadlines are at the end of the day specified, anywhere on Earth (UTC-12).

Author requests to formally withdraw a paper from review might take up to one week to process and might not be honoured at all if received after 25 June 2025.

## Ethics Statement

Research reported at ECAI should avoid harm, be honest and trustworthy, fair and non-discriminatory, and respect privacy and intellectual property. Where relevant, authors can include in the main body of their paper, or on the reference page, a short ethics statement that addresses ethical issues regarding the research being reported and the broader ethical impact of the work.

Reviewers will be asked to flag possible violations of relevant ethical principles. Such flagged submissions will be reviewed by a senior member of the programme committee.

Authors may be required to revise their paper to include a discussion of possible ethical concerns and their mitigation.

## Submission Instructions

Papers must be written in English, be prepared for double-blind review using the ECAI LaTeX template, and not exceed 7 pages (plus at most 1 extra page for references).

*   **ECAI LaTeX Template:** [Download Link](https://ecai2025.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ecai-template.zip)
    *   *Update on April 1, 2025: The README file in the LaTex package has been updated to include the current contact details in case there are issues. All other files (in particular, the ecai.cls file) remain the same.*
*   Excessive use of typesetting tricks to make things fit is not permitted. Please do not modify the style files or layout parameters.
*   Registering an abstract of your paper (of around 100-300 words in plain text) is required in advance of the paper submission deadline and you will be asked to provide additional information (such as keywords) at that time. Please do not leave things to the very last moment; you can resubmit any number of times until the submission deadline.
*   The submission website is: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecai20250](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ecai20250).

### Supplementary Material

You have the option to accompany your submission with supplementary material, such as a technical appendix or code and data (up to 50MB). Reviewers will consult supplementary material at their own discretion, and you should not assume that they necessarily will. Make sure that any supplementary material you submit really is supplementary in nature: any information that is essential for understanding or evaluating your paper must be included in the paper itself. You of course must ensure that your supplementary material does not compromise the anonymity of your submission.

We will not publish your supplementary material. Nevertheless, if your paper gets accepted, then the readers of your published paper should have access to the same information as the reviewers of your submission. So you should make your (suitably revised) supplementary material openly available in archival form at the time of publication of your paper, and you should include a reference to the supplementary material in the camera-ready copy of your paper. For code or data you may wish to use a service such as Zenodo. For a technical appendix you may wish to use an archival preprint server such as arXiv.

### Resubmission from Other Conferences

If an earlier version of your paper was rejected from another conference with archival proceedings and double-blind reviewing during the 12 months preceding the submission deadline (such as ECAI-2024, AAAI-2025, or IJCAI-2025), you can supplement your submission with a document detailing how you have taken the reviews received into account to improve your paper.

This document must be a single PDF consisting of the following three parts:

1.  A cover letter, of at most one page, in which you summarise your response to the reviews received and how you have changed your paper since then.
2.  All reviews, including the metareview (if any), in anonymised form (but otherwise unedited). A screenshot from the submission system will usually work best.
3.  An unedited copy of the earlier submission.

This is entirely voluntary. Do it if you feel it would help reviewers to better appreciate your work. You can include documentation for at most one conference. The document you provide will be shared with your reviewers at the start of the reviewing process.

## Policies

ECAI subscribes to the [European Code of Conduct for Research Integrity](https://allea.org/code-of-conduct/). By submitting to ECAI you confirm that you are aware of and accept the following specific policies:

*   **Originality:** Submissions must not have substantial overlap in either contribution or text with work previously accepted for publication as a full paper in another archival forum. Papers at workshops without archival proceedings and preprints are fine.
*   **Concurrent submission:** The work you submit must not be under review elsewhere at any time between submission and notification.
*   **Anonymity:** Reviewing for ECAI is double-blind, meaning that reviewers should not be aware of the identity of the authors of the papers they review. As an author you must make a reasonable effort to ensure that this is possible. Specifically, use the â€œdoubleblindâ€ option of the LaTeX template and do not include any acknowledgements in your submission. Cite your own prior work where appropriate, but do so in the third rather than the first person (that is, write, for instance, â€œTuring et al. [42] have shown â€¦â€ rather than â€œWe have shown â€¦ [42]â€).
*   **Links:** Papers must not include pointers to supplementary material on the web, not even when that supplementary material has been fully anonymised, as we would be unable to ensure that it remains unaltered throughout the reviewing period.
*   **Social media:** Actively promoting a paper on social media channels while it is undergoing double-blind review is discouraged.
*   **Reproducibility:** Reviewers will be instructed to pay close attention to reproducibility of results where appropriate and you should submit relevant code and data as supplementary material whenever feasible.
*   **Information sharing:** Submissions will be treated confidentially. However, papers, author information, and reviews may be shared with the organisers of other AI conferences to identify duplicate submissions and to limit duplicate reviewing efforts.
*   **Abstracts:** Abstracts are central for the assignment of reviewers. Therefore, they must not be altered in any significant way after the abstract submission deadline. In particular, submitting â€œplaceholder abstractsâ€ is not admissible.
*   **Authorship:** All individuals, and only those, who have made significant contributions to a paper should be listed as authors in the submission system. We will not permit adding or removing authors to a paper after the submission deadline. Please also ensure that the order of authors is correct at submission time.
*   **Submission limit:** No individual may be listed as an author for more than 8 separate submissions to ECAI.
*   **Generative AI:** The use of AI systems to generate text for inclusion in an ECAI submission is only allowed if its role is properly documented in the manuscript (e.g., when reporting on experiments on such systems). However, the use of AI-powered systems to assist with the polishing of human-authored text is permissible.
*   **Attendance:** At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference by the early registration deadline with the intention of presenting the paper at the conference. This is a prerequisite for inclusion in the proceedings.
*   **Reviewing:** Authors may be called upon to help with reviewing papers for ECAI. This does not apply to individuals who already are serving on the PC or who are not yet qualified to serve on the PC (such as students). Waivers will be granted in exceptional circumstances (such as parental leave).

### Use of Generative AI Software Tools

The use of generative AI software tools is permitted subject to the following requirements:

*   The AI systems have not been used to plagiarize, misrepresent, or falsify content.
*   The resulting work, in its entirety, accurately represents the authors' original research and novel intellectual contributions, and is not primarily the result of the AI tool's generative capabilities.
*   The authors accept full responsibility for the veracity and correctness of all material in their work, including any content generated by AI tools.

> Note that all submissions will be checked using suitable AI content detectors

## Double-Blind Reviewing

The conference will employ a **lightweight double-blind reviewing process**. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authorsâ€™ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear anywhere in the submission. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. Use the third person to refer to the author's previous work, e.g., replace ""as we have shown before"" with ""as shown before in [X].""

In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC Co-Chairs by email at icdcn2025-tpc-chairs@iit.cnr.it.

## Conflict of Interest

Indications of conflicts of interest will be required in the submission form. A conflict of interest is limited to the following:

*   A family member or close friend.
*   A Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or a postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years.
*   A person with the same affiliation.
*   A person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.)
*   Frequent collaborators, or collaborators who have jointly published papers within the last two years.

The 9th IEEE International Conference on Fog and Edge Computing (ICFEC 2025) is a leading forum to disseminate and discuss research activities and results on a broad range of topics in the fields of fog and edge computing. ICFEC 2025 will take place in conjunction with The 25th International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid 2025) from **May 19-22, 2025**, in **TromsÃ¸, Norway**.

## About Fog and Edge Computing

Fog and edge computing are seen as alternatives to cloud-based computational resources, especially in scenarios with large amounts of data produced in distributed settings (e.g., IoT) requiring near real-time processing or when suboptimal network connectivity hampers data upload to the cloud. Use cases span smart factories, smart grids, and autonomous vehicles. Current challenges include developing new abstractions for programming and storage models, addressing security, privacy, and trust in distributed systems, managing resources of mobile and hardware-constrained devices, processing large data streams, integrating novel communication protocols, and enabling distributed machine learning like federated learning.

## Topics of Interest

The conference seeks high-quality contributions covering both theory and practice in systems research and emerging domain-specific applications related to next-generation distributed systems across the cloud-edge compute continuum. This includes mist computing, edge computing, multi-access edge computing, fog computing, and mobile cloud computing. Some representative topics include:

*   Data centers and infrastructures along the compute continuum
*   Mobility management along the compute continuum
*   Federated learning and distributed machine learning in and for the compute continuum
*   5G/6G for the compute continuum
*   Middleware and runtime systems for the compute continuum
*   Programming models for the compute continuum
*   Storage and data management platforms along the compute continuum
*   Scheduling and resource management for the compute continuum
*   Security, privacy, trust, and provenance issues for the compute continuum
*   Distributed consensus and blockchains in the compute continuum
*   Modeling and simulation for and in the compute continuum

## Reciprocal Reviewing Requirement

*   Authors submitting **3 or more papers** must serve as a reviewer for at least **6 papers**.
*   At least one author of each submission must be registered to review at least **3 papers**.
*   Authors are exempt if they are serving as an AC, SAC, or organizing chair.
*   All authors will be notified to register as reviewers after the abstract deadline. Failure to comply may result in desk rejection.

## Code of Conduct and Ethics

*   All participants must adhere to the ICLR [Code of Conduct](https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfConduct) and [Code of Ethics](https://iclr.cc/public/CodeOfEthics).
*   Authors must read, adhere to, and acknowledge the Code of Ethics during submission.

## Dual Submission Policy

*   Submissions identical or substantially similar to previously published or submitted work are not allowed.
*   Papers on arXiv or presented at non-peer-reviewed workshops do not violate the policy.
*   Submissions to ICLR can be modified on arXiv during the review period.

## Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)

*   LLMs are allowed as general-purpose assist tools.
*   Authors and reviewers are responsible for LLM-generated content, including plagiarism or fabrication.

## Review Style

ACM ICMR follows a **double-blind review process** for full paper selection. Authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the name(s) of the author(s). Please prepare your paper in a way that preserves anonymity of the authors:

*   Do not put your names under the title.
*   Avoid using phrases such as â€œour previous workâ€ when referring to earlier publications by the authors.
*   Remove information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs).
*   Check supplemental material for information that may identify the authorsâ€™ identity.
*   Avoid providing links to Websites that identify the authors.

## Abstract and Keywords

The abstract and the keywords form the primary source for assigning papers to reviewers. So make sure that they form a concise and complete summary of your paper with sufficient information to let someone who has not read the full paper know what it is about.

## Submission Instructions

See the [Paper Submission]( /authors/paper-submissions ) section.

## Presentation Format

ACM ICMR 2025 will be an in-person event. All oral talks and demonstrations must be on-site at the conference venue, otherwise they will be removed from the proceedings and no refund given. This includes full papers, BNI papers and doctoral symposium papers. Posters should be presented at the conference, but we will also facilitate online posters using our online conference platform. This platform requires the upload of a poster and short accompanying video. We will be strictly enforcing this policy across all submission types.

We expect and require that for each accepted paper at least one author fully (non-student) register into the conference before the camera-ready deadline. We are working on a way to allow remote presentation in case authors are unable to join in person.",,100.00,,,

NSPW 2025 invites three types of submissions:

1.  **Regular submissions:** Present a new approach (paradigm) to a security problem or critique existing approaches. While regular submissions may present research results, the change in approach should be the focus.
2.  **Theme Submissions:** Focused on “**Trusting**” and should explain the connection with the theme in the justification statement. They follow the format of a regular submission.
3.  **Implementation Submissions:** Explore implementing previous NSPW submissions. These submissions should clearly cite which previous work(s) is being referenced and how the current submission extends beyond the original scope.

The theme for NSPW 2025 is **Trusting**.

## Relevant Topics for the Theme ""Trusting""

*   Novel paradigms for conceptualising trust and trusting in computer security
*   Trust decisions in a world of deepfakes and misinformation
*   Detection of breach of trust, intrusion and misinformation
*   Trust boundaries and threat modeling
*   Trust in changing threat landscapes and technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence

## Submission Instructions

*   **Confidentiality:** All submissions are treated as confidential.
*   **Prior Publication:** NSPW does not accept previously published or concurrently submitted papers.
*   **Due Date:** **April 25, 2025, 11:59 PM AoE**
*   **Response Date:** May 30, 2025
*   **Format:** PDF format, **6-15 pages**, ACM “sigconf” formatting.
*   **Submission System:** Submit through EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025)

### Special Submission Instructions

Each paper requires two separate EasyChair submissions:

1.  **Cover page:** with authors’ names, affiliation, and the participation statement.
2.  **Anonymous PDF paper:** with a justification statement.

The **participation statement** must specify which author(s) will attend upon acceptance/invitation, that all authors will engage in good faith with the feedback given in the review and revision periods, and that all authors will abide by the NSPW code of conduct.

The **justification statement** (clearly marked as part of the PDF submission) briefly explains why the submission is appropriate for NSPW and the chosen submission category. The justification statement will not appear in the final publication.

To support double-blind reviewing, the cover page should not be part of the PDF submission but will be submitted separately on EasyChair. Submissions that do not include both statements risk rejection without review. In addition, submissions should blind author identity where possible (e.g., using the LaTeX `anonymous=true` option and avoiding self-referencing).

Organizers and Program Committee members are allowed to submit papers, but will not be involved in evaluating their papers.

## Publication

NSPW'25 papers will be published in the International Conference Proceedings Series of the ACM Digital Library. Note: ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance).

## Social Contract and Code of Conduct

*   Acceptance to the workshop is conditional on engagement with the revision, presentation, and discussion process.
*   All participants must commit to a “social contract”: no one arrives late, no one leaves early, no electronic distractions (including laptops, tablets, and mobile devices), attend all sessions of the 2.5-day program, share meals in a group setting, and comply with the code of conduct.
*   The workshop is preceded by an evening reception.
*   NSPW is making arrangements for (some) child care during the event. If interested, please email [general-chairs@nspw.org](mailto:general-chairs@nspw.org) for planning purposes.

## Review Process (New for 2025)

Authors invited to revise their submissions will receive specific revision criteria. Revisions are guided by a revision editor, and accepted revisions for the current issue must be completed within 1 month of notification; revisions accepted between 1-4 months will appear in the following issue. Papers not adequately revised by the following issue's revision deadline will be rejected. More details are available on the href=""reviews-2025.php"" - review process page.

## Resubmission of Rejected Papers (New for 2025)

Authors of rejected papers must skip one full issue before resubmitting to a future issue of PoPETs.

## Scope (New for 2025)

Papers submitted to PETS/PoPETs should present novel practical and/or theoretical research into the requirements, design, analysis, experimentation, or fielding of privacy-enhancing technologies and their contexts. Interdisciplinary research is welcome if it clearly impacts privacy technology design, development, or deployment.

## Paper Submission

A submitted paper should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A submission should strive to be accessible to a broad audience, as well as having sufficient details for experts in the area.

### Regular Papers

A regular paper must report on original research that has not been previously published. It is not permitted to submit the same material concurrently to journals or conferences with proceedings. Format and length requirements for submissions are stated below. All ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in a paper, including full proofs and experimental results, where applicable, should be included in the submission.

### Brief Announcements

A brief announcement may describe work in progress or work presented elsewhere. A brief announcement may also report on original research results that can be fully presented in the limited space available. The title of a brief announcement must begin with `Brief Announcement: `.

## Submission Format

All submissions should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper.

Alternatively, papers can also be submitted by using the official ACM Master article LaTeX template `acmart.cls`, version 1.80 or greater, using the following documentclass instruction:

```latex
\documentclass[acmsmall,nonacm,anonymous]{acmart}
```

The template is available at [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

The following instructions equally apply in both cases.

Regular submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information (see paragraph on double-blind reviewing below), and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper’s contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the “full version” of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial 10 pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. Each submission must contain full proofs of all claims in the paper. Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first 10 pages will be read at the committee’s discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission.

Brief announcement submissions must have a length of at most 5 pages including title, abstract, and the references.

Submissions not conforming to the rules stated in this call, as well as papers outside the scope of the conference, may be rejected without consideration.

## Best practices for citations

Alphabetical orderings of authors can lead to biases. Therefore, authors are encouraged to avoid “et al.” in citations, and instead mention all author names.

## Double-blind reviewing

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear anywhere in the submission. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC chair by email.

## Conflict of Interest

Indications of conflicts of interest will be required in the submission form. A conflict of interest is limited to the following:

*   A family member or close friend.
*   A Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years.
*   A person with the same affiliation.
*   A person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.)
*   Frequent collaborators, or collaborators who have jointly published papers within the last two years.

If you feel that you have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, contact the PC chair or one of the Theory of Computing Advocates affiliated with this conference (Faith Ellen and Idit Keidar). The PC chair may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for a conflict of interest.

## Publication

Accepted regular papers of up to 10 pages and brief announcements of up to 3 pages in two-column ACM proceedings format will be included in the conference proceedings. They must be formatted with the ACM Master templates using `\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}`.

If more space than available in the proceedings for an accepted paper is needed, a full version must be available publicly, e.g. on arXiv, by the due date for the proceedings version, and the proceedings version must refer to this.

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

It is expected that papers that are published at PODC 2025 are presented by one of the authors in person at the conference. In exceptional circumstances (e.g., because of visa issues), a limited number of exceptions can be approved by the PC chair. A paid conference registration by one of the authors of each accepted paper will be required in any case.

Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of the journal Distributed Computing. Up to two selected papers will be considered for publication in the Journal of the ACM.

## Review Process

NDSS Symposium 2026 will have two review cycles: a summer submission cycle and a fall submission cycle. For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:

*   **Accept:** Accepted for publication and presentation.
*   **Minor Revision:** Accepted if minor revisions are made and deemed satisfactory by shepherds.
*   **Major Revision:** Considered promising but needs additional work. Authors may revise and resubmit within six weeks for a second review based on specified revision tasks. A paper may undergo at most one major revision.
*   **Reject:** Not allowed to be resubmitted to NDSS Symposium 2026.

The review process happens in two rounds for each cycle. Round 1 identifies papers for further review and discussion. Round 2 selects papers for acceptance. Both cycles include an early notification sharing Round 1 reviews and indicating if the paper proceeds to Round 2. Authors of papers proceeding to Round 2 will have an opportunity to rebut reviews and interact with reviewers.

Authors of accepted papers must ensure their papers are presented at the conference according to the conference participation policy.

## Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted papers are **strongly encouraged** to open-source their artifacts and to submit them for an artifact evaluation. Details will be released on the NDSS Symposium website.

### Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers

Papers that focus on the systematization of knowledge (SoK-papers at other venues) are within the scope of NDSS Symposium, particularly if they provide new insights and compelling evidence. Such papers do NOT need to be prefixed with “SoK:”, but authors may choose to do so. These papers go beyond summarizing previous research; they also include a thorough examination and analysis of existing approaches, identify gaps and limitations, offer insights or new perspectives on a given, major research area, and may also involve new experiments to replicate and compare previous solutions.

### Topic Fit

NDSS Symposium primarily focuses on network and systems security. The Program Committee seeks papers with a clear relation to real systems, networks, and their applications. Papers with questionable fit may be desk rejected without reviews. Examples of topic concerns include (but are not limited to):

*   Papers focusing on theoretical cryptography without implementation or evaluation on real systems.
*   Papers focusing on mathematical proof without implementation/evaluation.
*   Papers with contributions primarily in another field (e.g., AI, ML) without substantial security/privacy novelty.
*   Papers without any security or privacy contribution (e.g., optimizing network performance).

## Paper Formatting

*   Technical papers must not exceed **13 pages**, excluding the “Ethics Considerations” section, references, or appendices.
*   Papers must be written in English.
*   Formatted for **US letter size** (not A4) paper in a **two-column layout**.
*   Columns no more than **9.25 in. high and 3.5 in. wide**.
*   Text must be in **Times font, 10-point or larger, with 11-point or larger line spacing**.
*   Authors must use the [NDSS templates](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2025/submissions/templates/) (Note: 2025 templates, 2026 ones to be published soon).
*   Submissions must be in **Portable Document Format (.pdf)**.
*   Documents should render correctly in Adobe Reader when printed in black and white.

## Double and Concurrent Submissions

Technical papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference/workshop with proceedings. **Double-submissions will result in immediate rejection.** The Program Committee may share information with other conference chairs and journal editors to detect such cases.

Major overlap between a rejected paper from the first cycle and a submission to the second cycle is disallowed and will be grounds for desk rejection.

## Ethical Considerations

Each paper may **optionally** include an “Ethics Considerations” section immediately preceding the reference section. In this section, authors may discuss ethical risks and mitigation steps. If no ethical considerations are believed to exist, this section is not necessary.

> Research can potentially lead to adverse outcomes. Authors must proactively anticipate and address potential negative consequences of both conducting and publishing their research. Submissions may be rejected regardless of scientific merit if they fail to adequately address ethical concerns. If a paper relates to human subjects, analyzes data derived from human subjects, may put humans at risk, or might have other ethical implications or introduce legal issues, authors should disclose if an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval) was conducted, and discuss how ethical and legal concerns were addressed. IRB exemptions may not be sufficient. If the paper reports a potentially high-impact vulnerability, authors should report or discuss their plan for responsible disclosure. An Ethics Review Board (ERB) will check flagged papers. Authors are encouraged to review the [Menlo Report](https://www.menloreport.org/) for general ethical guidelines. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if insufficient evidence was presented that ethical or relevant legal concerns were appropriately addressed.

## Anonymous Submissions (Double-Blind Reviewing)

NDSS Symposium implements a **double-blind reviewing process**.

*   Author names and affiliations should **not appear in the paper**.
*   Authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data.
*   Authors’ prior work must be referred to in the third person; if this is not feasible, the references should be blinded.
*   Submissions violating these requirements will be **rejected without review**.
*   The list of authors **cannot be changed** while the paper is under review unless approved by the Program Chairs.
*   Publishing a technical report on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, while not encouraged, is **not forbidden**.
*   Authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.
*   **New authors cannot be added** to any submission for any reason after the submission deadline.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors and Program Committee members are required to indicate any conflict of interest and its nature. Conflicts include:

*   **Perpetual conflict:** Advisors and advisees (regardless of graduation date).
*   **Institutional relationship:** Authors and PC members with an institutional relationship.
*   **Recent professional collaborations:** (past 2 years, regardless of publication/funding).
*   **Close personal relationships.**

PC members, including chairs, with a conflict of interest with a paper will be excluded from its evaluation. Other cases (grey areas) should be brought to the PC Co-Chairs’ attention prior to the submission deadline.

> **PC Co-Chairs are not allowed to submit papers to the conference.**

> **A Special Note on “Fake Conflicts”:** Declaring conflicts of interest to avoid certain (otherwise non-conflicting) PC members is not allowed and can constitute grounds for rejection. The PC Chairs reserve the right to request additional explanation for any declared conflict. Authors with concerns about fair treatment should contact the chairs directly with convincing arguments.

## Use of Generative AI

The use of Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (text, images, or other data) is **permitted for paper preparation** under these conditions:

1.  The result does not plagiarize, misrepresent, or falsify content.
2.  The resulting work in its totality is an accurate representation of the authors’ underlying work and novel intellectual contributions and is not primarily the result of the tools’ generative capabilities.
3.  The authors accept responsibility for the veracity and correctness of all material in their paper, including any AI-generated material.

### Disclosure Requirements

The use of generative AI software tools **must be disclosed** as part of the paper submission. The level of disclosure should be commensurate with the proportion of new text or content generated:

*   If entire (sub)sections (including tables, graphs, images, etc.) were AI-generated, authors must disclose which sections and which tools and tool versions were used (e.g., via an Appendix describing usage, specific tools/versions, prompts, and post-generation editing).
*   If the amount of text generated is small (limited to phrases or a few sentences), a citation or footnote to the relevant section is sufficient, with a general disclaimer in the Acknowledgements section.
*   If generative AI tools are used **only to edit and improve the quality of human-generated existing text** (e.g., for spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement), disclosure is **not necessary**.
