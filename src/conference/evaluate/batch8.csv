The workshop aims to bring together researchers in computer networks and systems to discuss innovative ideas and debate future research agendas in networking.","# HotNets 2025: Call for Papers

The 24th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets 2025) will bring together researchers to engage in a lively debate on the theory and practice of computer networking and networked systems. HotNets provides a venue to discuss innovative ideas and debate future research agendas for the field.

## Overview

We invite researchers and practitioners to submit short position papers. We encourage submissions that identify fundamental open questions, advocate for new approaches, offer constructive critiques of the state of networking research, re-frame or debunk existing work, report unexpected early results from a deployment, report promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Authors need not support their ideas with full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations are sufficient support for the possibility of the paper's claims in HotNets.

We seek interesting ideas over incremental, well-baked systems. An ideal submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry for the networking and adjacent communities. We strongly discourage ""conference papers in the miniature."" The program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion, ideally benefiting the networking community broadly, over incremental work that is ready for publication at a conference.

HotNets takes a broad view of networking research. The scope includes (but is not limited to) new ideas that relate to mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks and that use a variety of link technologies (e.g. wired, wireless, optical, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks and network architecture. HotNets encompasses all aspects of networks, which include (but is not limited to) packet-processing and transmission hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, provisioning and resource management, performance, energy consumption, sustainability, topology, robustness, measurement, diagnosis, verification, privacy, security, economics and evolution, theory, usability, machine learning, and interactions with applications.

This year, the program committee will do an initial fast round of reviewing that will provide early rejection or advancement to later rounds of more traditional, thorough reviewing. The program committee will select papers based on originality, likelihood to stimulate insightful discussion, and technical merit. Accepted papers will be posted online prior to the workshop and will be published in the ACM Digital Library to facilitate wide dissemination of the ideas discussed at the workshop.

## Important Dates

*   **Paper submission deadline:** July 9, 2025 (23:59 AoE)
*   **Author notification:** September 19, 2025

## Submission and Formatting

*   Papers should be formatted according to the **two-column ACM proceedings format**.
*   Each paper should have no more than **6 pages**, excluding references, in **10 point font**. There is no limit on the page count for references, however appendices are not allowed.
*   Papers must contain novel ideas and must differ significantly in content from previously published papers.
*   All submissions must be **blind**: they must not indicate the names or affiliations of the authors in the paper.
*   Only electronic submissions in **PDF** will be accepted.
*   Submissions must be written in English, render without error using standard tools (e.g., Acrobat Reader), and print on US Letter paper.
*   Each reference must list all authors of the paper (i.e., do not use ""et al.""). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52].
*   Please ensure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale.
*   Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected.

A LaTeX class file that follows the prescribed submission format is available: [hotnets25-template.zip](https://hotnets.acm.org/2025/docs/hotnets25-template.zip)

For the LaTeX template, the first two lines should be:
```latex
\documentclass[sigconf, 10pt, anonymous, nonacm]{acmart}
       \settopmatter{printfolios=true, printccs=false, printacmref=false}
```

Submit papers on the [HotCRP](https://hotnets25.hotcrp.com/).

## Policies

### Policy on Concurrent Submissions

Concurrent submissions to HotNets 2025 and any other peer-reviewed venue that cover the same work (differences in the degree of detail given the two venues' length limits notwithstanding) are prohibited, and will result in the immediate rejection of the HotNets submission in question. ""Concurrent"" means any other peer-reviewed venue whose reviewing period (i.e., between submission and notification) overlaps with that of HotNets. The ""same work"" means, for example, a submission overlapping significantly in content with a conference submission. However, a position paper submitted to HotNets (e.g., that reflects broadly on the state of some aspect of the field, adopts a position as to how the field should move forward, or articulates a broad avenue of future work) will not be considered the ""same work"" as a conference-length paper on a specific system that addresses a point under the broad umbrella covered by the position paper. Authors with questions about this policy should contact the PC co-chairs before submitting.

### Ethical Concerns

As part of the submission process, authors must attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans. Note that submitting research for approval by one's institution's ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient – in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will have its own discussion of the ethics of that work. The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and authors agree to be available at any time during the review process to rapidly respond to queries from the PC chairs regarding ethical standards.

## Workshop Participation

HotNets attendance is limited to roughly 90 people in person to facilitate a lively discussion (potentially with additional virtual participants). In-person invitations will be allocated first to one author of each paper, HotNets organizers and committee members, and conference sponsors. We require the paper presentations to be in-person (if authors have any concerns about this, they are welcome to contact the PC chairs). To promote an inclusive workshop, HotNets will also make a limited number of open registration slots for in-person attendance available to the community.

## Manuscript and Submission Guidelines

*   Abstracts of no more than 300 words must be submitted by the abstract submission deadline. The title and abstract submitted by this deadline should have sufficient detail and not just be a placeholder.
*   Authors are strongly advised to submit their papers with the final list of authors, as changes may not be feasible at later stages.
*   Submitted manuscripts should be structured as technical papers and the full papers may not exceed **ten (10) single-spaced double-column pages** using 10-point size font on 8.5×11 inch pages (IEEE conference style), including figures, tables, and references.
*   All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a **double-blind review process**, so the submitted paper should NOT list any authors or their affiliations.
*   The author list at the time of submission is considered final – no co-authors can be added or removed after the submission deadline or upon acceptance (no exceptions). The author affiliation and order can be changed with notice to the PC chair before the camera-ready deadline if the paper is accepted.
*   The IEEE conference style templates for MS Word and LaTeX provided by IEEE eXpress Conference Publishing are available for download here: [https://template-selector.ieee.org/instance/credential/index](https://template-loc.ieee.org/instance/credential/index).
*   Electronic submissions must be in the form of a readable PDF file.
*   Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other conference or journal. Papers not following these guidelines will be rejected without review and further action may be taken, including (but not limited to) notifications sent to the heads of the institutions of the authors and sponsors of the conference.
*   Submissions received after the due date, exceeding the length limit, or not appropriately structured may also not be considered.
*   Papers must be submitted under one of the technical tracks listed. The topics listed under each track are representative, but not exhaustive.
*   At the time of publishing, authors of accepted papers may buy up to two pages in addition to the page limits specified above for their manuscript.

## No Show Policy

At least one author of each paper must be registered for the conference in order for the paper to be published in the proceedings. Accepted full papers will be presented in technical sessions and selected papers will be presented in a separate poster session. Presentation of an accepted paper is a requirement for publication in the proceedings. Any paper not meeting requirements will not be included in the conference proceedings under IEEE Xplore.

## Submission Link

Submit your paper: [https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/HiPC/](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/HiPC/)

## AI-Assisted Text Usage

HiPC will allow the use of tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you use these services merely for language rectification. The authors should verify whether the results are accurate before submission.

As required by IEEE, the use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text.

If you use AI tools, you should include an acknowledgment section to disclose the AI assistance with appropriate references to the sections in the paper, but this acknowledgment section should still abide by the double-blind submission guideline (i.e., any funding or author-related information should not be included).

## ArXiv Submission Policy

Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit authors from submitting a paper to HiPC 2025. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and not considered as formal publications, hence do not count as prior work. Authors are not expected to compare against arXiv papers that have not formally appeared in previous conference or journal proceedings. If a submitted paper is already on arXiv, please continue to follow the double-blind submission guidelines. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission, not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period after the submission deadline).

## Inclusive Description of Research Contributions

Please consider making your research contribution description inclusive in nature. For example, consider using gender-neutral pronouns, consider using examples that are ethnicity/culture-rich, consider engaging users from diverse backgrounds if your research involves a survey, etc. Best efforts should be made to make the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

## Review Process

All submitted manuscripts will be reviewed by the Program Committee under a double-blind review process. Submissions will be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance, potential impact, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the conference scope. Submitted manuscripts should NOT have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference, workshop, or journal.

The initial decision for the submission may be Accept, Reject or Shepherd. Papers that are recommended for shepherding will have to address the comments from the reviewers, and submit a revised article along with a summary of changes. The revised manuscript will be reviewed by the shepherd and the final decision will be communicated.

## Paper Submission Categories

Submissions to HPDC can be made in one of the following two categories:

1.  **Regular Papers:** The primary focus should be to describe new research ideas supported by experimental implementation and evaluation.
2.  **Open-source Tools and Data Papers:** The primary focus should be to describe the design, development, and evaluation of new open-source tools or novel data sources.

Authors are required to indicate the category of the paper in the title (e.g., ""Paper Type: Regular"" or ""Paper Type: Open-source tools and data paper""). Submissions in both categories will be evaluated to the same standards. The chosen category at the time of submission cannot be changed after the submission deadline.

## ACM Publication

Papers accepted and presented at HPDC 2025 will be published in the ACM Digital Library at no additional cost to the authors.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Authors are invited to submit technical papers of at most **11 pages** in PDF format, excluding references.
*   Accepted papers will have the flexibility to use an additional page in the camera-ready to incorporate feedback from the reviewers.
*   Papers should be formatted in the ACM Proceedings Style (using `sigconf` from [ACM Proceedings Template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)).
*   Submitted papers must be original work that has not appeared in and is not under consideration for another conference or a journal.

## Anonymizing Submissions

HPDC uses **dual-anonymous reviewing**. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through references or acknowledgments).

*   The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of author names.
*   Reference your past work in the third person, as you would any other piece of related work.
*   If your submission extends a previous workshop paper or relates to a submission under review, cite the other work anonymously and email the deanonymized work to the PC chairs.
*   If your submission reports on experiences with a system at your institution, refer to the system anonymously but describe the properties needed for evaluation.
*   Tool/data papers should also adhere to the double-blind submission policy.

## arXiv Submission Policy

Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit submission to HPDC. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and do not count as prior work. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title in the submission and do not upload/revise the arXiv version during the review period).

## Author List After Acceptance

The author list cannot be changed after acceptance.

## Conflict of Interest Declaration

At the time of submission, all authors must indicate their conflict of interest with PC members (institutional, collaborative, or personal).

## HPDC Policy on the use of AI

*   HPDC permits the use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly) for language rectification. Authors are responsible for the accuracy of the content.
*   AI tools are not eligible for authorship.
*   The use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section, citing the AI system used. The acknowledgment section must still follow dual-anonymous submission guidelines.

## ACM Policy on Authorship

Refer to the [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/frequently-asked-questions) for all other guidelines, including policies on the use of generative AI tools.

## Suggestions for Document Preparation for Authors

HPDC authors are encouraged to structure their introduction section as follows:

*   **Motivation:** State the objective and provide quantitative support.
*   **Limitation of state-of-art approaches:** Review prior works and articulate limitations.
*   **Key insights and contributions:** Specify novelty and contributions.
*   **Experimental methodology and artifact availability:** Specify infrastructure and methodology, indicate artifact availability.
*   **Limitations of the proposed approach:** Articulate limitations and conclusions sensitive to assumptions.

This format is a suggestion and not a requirement.

## Ethical Considerations

If your research describes a new security-related attack, please consider adding information about responsible disclosure. The paper should follow ethical principles and not alter security/privacy/equality expectations of users.

## Inclusive Description of Research Contributions

Consider using gender-neutral pronouns, diverse examples, engaging users from diverse backgrounds, and making the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.",

Ensure that the metadata included in the PDF does not give away the authors. Refer to prior work in the third person and include a full citation for the work in the bibliography.

## Authorship Guidelines

IEEE guidelines dictate that authorship should be based on a substantial intellectual contribution. All authors must have met specific conditions related to intellectual contribution, drafting/revising the article, and approving the final version.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site. Conflicts include advisor-advisee relationships, family members, collaborations within the last 4 years, people from the same institution within the last 4 years, funding relationships, and members of the same research center where unpublished work is regularly discussed. 

*Scenarios that do NOT constitute a conflict include: authors of previously-published, closely related work; service collaborations; co-authoring community-wide tools; people working on similar topics; and people under the same umbrella funding award without close collaboration.*

## ArXiv Submissions

Authors may submit their work to HPCA 2025 even if it appears on Arxiv. However, authors are encouraged to reduce the possibility of their name being disclosed to avoid issues with the double-blind review process.

## Concurrent Submissions

*   Authors making multiple submissions must ensure that each submission has significant, unique content. Papers sharing co-authors and substantial overlap will be rejected.
*   The format of ICAPS 2025 will be **in-person**. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present their work in person, unless exceptional circumstances prevent this.

## Use of Generative AI

*   Papers that include text generated from an LLM are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as part of the paper’s experimental analysis.
*   This policy DOES NOT prohibit authors from using these technologies for editing or polishing author-written text.
*   No AI system satisfies the criteria for authorship of papers published by AAAI Press (ICAPS’ publisher) and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in such papers.
*   Authors assume full responsibility for the content of submitted work, including checking for plagiarism and authenticity of all text.

## Ethical / Societal Impact

Authors are encouraged to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences.

## Best Paper Awards and Journal Fast Track

Best non-student and student papers will be awarded. These papers may also receive an invitation to submit an extended version to a top AI journal, such as the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) or the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ).

## Submission Instructions

*   All submissions will be made electronically via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=icaps-conference.org/ICAPS/2025/Conference).
*   Submitted papers must be anonymous for double-blind reviewing.
*   Papers must adhere to the page limits of the relevant submission type (long or short) and follow the author kit instructions for formatting. The author kit can be found [here](/files/icaps2025-author-kit.zip).
*   Authors can submit supplementary material (videos, technical proofs, additional experimental results) in addition to the PDF paper.

Failure to comply with the submission instructions will result in desk rejection.

## Double-blind Requirements

*   Omit names and institutions.
*   Refer to prior work by themselves or others in the third person.
*   Ensure that acknowledgement notices or ethics statements do not include information that may identify them.

The 16th International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC’25) will be held in **Campinas, Brazil**, from **June 23rd to June 27th, 2025**. ICCC is the sole scientific conference dedicated to computational creativity, covering all its facets, from theoretical frameworks to practical applications.

Computational creativity is defined as the art, science, philosophy, and engineering of computational systems which, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviours that unbiased observers would deem to be creative. The field is thriving with advancements in formalizing machine creativity and exciting applications across sciences, arts, literature, and gaming.

## Themes and Topics

Original research contributions are solicited in all areas related to Computational Creativity research and practice, including but not limited to:

*   **Applications of Computational Creativity:** in music, language, games, visual arts, design, architecture, entertainment, education, mathematical invention, scientific discovery, programming.
*   **Human-Machine Co-Creativity:** systems, studies, frameworks, or methodologies related to co-creativity between humans and AI, emphasizing machine as a creative partner.
*   **Computational Creativity Evaluation:** metrics, frameworks, formalisms, and methodologies for evaluating creativity in computational systems or their societal perception.
*   **Social Models:** computational models of social aspects of creativity, including social creativity, diffusion of ideas, collaboration, team dynamics, and creativity in social settings.
*   **Computational Paradigms:** computational approaches for modelling cognitive aspects of creativity, such as heuristic search, analogical and meta-level reasoning, cognitive architectures, and re-representation.
*   **Interdisciplinary Perspectives:** drawing from philosophy and/or sociology in the context of creative AI systems.
*   **Data and Creativity:** data science approaches, resource development, and data gathering/knowledge curation for creative AI, with a focus on scalable, extensible, and open-source datasets.
*   **Societal Impact:** ethical considerations in the design, deployment, or testing of creative AI systems, and studies on the societal impact of computational creativity and generative AI.
*   **Psychological Factors:** computational models of psychological factors enhancing creativity (emotion, surprise, reflection, motivation, etc.), as well as social or experiential factors related to novelty and originality.
*   **Provocations:** raising new issues that question the foundations of the discipline or shed new light on debates.

A note on generative AI models: While welcomed, applications must be properly situated in the CC literature and evaluated according to field standards.

## Paper Types

We welcome five types of full papers:

*   **Technical papers:** Focus on hypotheses about creative behaviour in computational systems, requiring solid experimentation, models, proof, or argumentation, with strong evaluation.
*   **System or Resource description papers:** Describe the building and deployment of a creative system or resource, emphasizing engineering achievement, technical challenges, reusable resources, and some evaluation.
*   **Study papers:** Draw on allied fields (psychology, philosophy, etc.) or appeal to broader AI/CS areas, providing novel perspectives on CC systems or their evaluation.
*   **Cultural application papers:** Present the use of creative software in a cultural setting (art exhibitions, concerts, literature, games, etc.), detailing the system's role, results, and feedback.
*   **Position papers:** Present opinions on CC research, future directions, speculative explorations, or current issues, requiring careful argumentation and thorough knowledge of the field.
