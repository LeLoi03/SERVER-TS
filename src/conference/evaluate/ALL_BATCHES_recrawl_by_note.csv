The 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2025) seeks paper submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of security and privacy. We seek articles presenting accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. Purely theoretical (e.g., cryptography-focused, with no security/application connections) submissions are not encouraged. The same goes for submissions focusing primarily on blockchains or machine learning.

Like in previous years, we will also be accepting “Systemisation of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. SoK submissions need to add the prefix “SoK: ” in the title. They will be accepted based on the value to the community. Survey papers without insights evaluating, systematizing and contextualizing current knowledge will be rejected.

*   Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:”
*   Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

## Conflicts of Interest

When submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include:

*   Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission.
*   Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past.
*   Anyone the author has collaborated with or published within the prior two years.

PC members, including chairs with a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure to declare COI or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a PC member with COI reviews a paper, it will be rejected.

## Anonymous Submissions

ASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized.

*   Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used.
*   The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the submission is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.
*   Publishing the submission on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, is allowed but authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results (e.g., social media, seminars, etc.) and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.

## Double and Concurrent Submissions

Submissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double submission will result in immediate rejection. We may report detected violations to other conference chairs and journal editors.

## Ethical Considerations

The authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence (beyond approval of the experiment by their institution) elaborating how they have thoroughly considered such issues. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns.

## Early Rejection and Appeals

There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early.

The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification email. Authors’ appeals must clearly and explicitly identify substantial disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews that should be adjudicated by a particular arbitration reviewer who the PC chairs may recruit. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.

## Paper Revision and Resubmission

Rejected papers in the Cycle 1 cannot be resubmitted in the Cycle 2.

A small number of the Cycle 1 submissions may receive a Revise decision, rather than Accept or Reject and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server. The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. We will request additional revisions only in exceptional circumstances.

## Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation

If a paper is accepted, the author list in the submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version.

Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.

The ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS) is the premier academic forum for multidisciplinary applied computer systems research spanning hardware, software, and their interaction. ASPLOS 2026 will be held in **Pittsburgh, USA – March 22-26, 2026**.

## Synopsis

ASPLOS focuses on practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and associated areas such as networking and storage. Key changes for this year include:

*   **Two submission cycles**
*   **Limit on the number of submissions by the same author**
*   **Explicit assessment of Interdisciplinary research**
*   **Unlimited appendix**

## Program Chairs

*   Benjamin C. Lee, University of Pennsylvania
*   Harry Xu, University of California Los Angeles
*   Mark Silberstein, Technion – Israel Institute of Technology

## Important Dates

ASPLOS 2026 features two submission deadlines: Spring and Summer.

### Spring Cycle

*   **Abstract submission:** March 05, 2025 (11:59pm Eastern)
*   **Full paper submission:** March 12, 2025
*   **Author response:** June 09 — 13, 2025
*   **Notification:** June 24, 2025

### Summer Cycle

*   **Abstract submission:** August 13, 2025 (11:59pm Eastern)
*   **Full paper submission:** August 20, 2025
*   **Author response:** November 10 — 14, 2025

*   **Notification:** November 24, 2025

## Submission Website

*   [Spring Cycle HotCRP](https://asplos26-spring.hotcrp.com/)

## Scope and Expectations

ASPLOS 2026 covers all practical aspects related to computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems, as well as closely-related associated areas. This includes topics such as:

*   Existing, emerging, and nontraditional compute platforms at all scales
*   Heterogeneous architectures and accelerators
*   Internet services, cloud computing, and datacenters
*   Memory, storage, networking, and I/O
*   Power, energy, and thermal management
*   Profiling, debugging, and testing
*   Security, reliability, and availability
*   Systems for enabling parallelism and computation on big data
*   Virtualization and virtualized systems

We seek original, high-quality research submissions that improve and further the knowledge of applied computer systems, with emphasis on the intersection between the main ASPLOS disciplines: Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Computer Architecture and Emerging Hardware. Submissions may target diverse goals such as throughput, latency, energy, and security. We value submissions accompanied by clearly defined artifacts and encourage new ideas and approaches.

## Explicit Assessment of Interdisciplinary Research

This interdisciplinary nature will be a significant factor in acceptance decisions. Authors must identify and justify the core disciplines their paper contributes to. Papers with only a single specified discipline are less likely to be accepted, and low relevance scores from reviewers will affect acceptance chances. Papers deemed to not fit the selected disciplines may be rejected without review.

## Resubmissions

*   Papers rejected from ASPLOS'25 Spring may be submitted to ASPLOS'26 Spring.
*   Papers rejected from ASPLOS'25 Summer may be submitted to ASPLOS'26 Summer.
*   Papers rejected from ASPLOS'25 Fall may be submitted to ASPLOS'26 Summer.
*   Papers withdrawn after reviews are considered ""rejected"" and are subject to resubmission rules.

## Limit on Submissions

The number of submissions by the same author is limited to **5 submissions per submission cycle**.

## Major Revisions

Some submissions may receive a ""Major Revision"" decision. Authors will have the opportunity to revise their work based on reviewer feedback and resubmit within 6 weeks. Revised submissions can use up to 13 pages (2 more than the original submission limit).

## Declaring Areas and Topics

Authors should indicate up to 3 relevant topics on the submission form to aid reviewer assignment. Incorrect selection may lead to less competent reviewers.

## Anonymization

ASPLOS employs a **double-blind review process**. Authors must anonymize their submissions by avoiding explicit or implicit identification of themselves or their institutions in the submitted documents, including metadata. Cite your own work as if by a third party or use anonymized supplemental material. Contact the program chairs for exceptions.

## Anonymized Supplemental Material and Appendixes

Supplemental material and appendixes may be submitted with no page limit but are not required reading for reviewers and should not be used to circumvent the main page limit.

## Declaring Conflicts of Interest (COI)

Authors must register all conflicts in the HotCRP submission page. Failure to declare or false declaration of conflicts may result in summary rejection. Specific guidelines for declaring COIs with institutions, individuals, and collaborations are provided.

## Declaring Authors

All authors must be declared upfront. Additions or removals after acceptance require program chair approval.

## Originality and Concurrent Submissions

Submitted manuscripts must be original and not substantially similar to prior publications or under review elsewhere. Technical reports and arXiv.org uploads are not considered prior publications.

## Ethical and Other Obligations

Authors must not break anonymity, contact reviewers/PC members inappropriately, advertise their work during certain periods, or post reviews publicly before results are announced. Adherence to the ACM ethics policy and ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects is mandatory.

## Formatting and Editing

*   Submissions must be PDF files, using the ACM's acmart Latex class with the sigplan proceedings template.
*   **Page Limit:** 11 pages (excluding references and appendices).
*   **Page Size:** US Letter (8.5in x 11in).
*   **Margins:** 1in top/bottom, 0.75in left/right.
*   **Layout:** 2-column, single-spaced text.
*   **Font Size:** 10pt for main text; figures/tables/captions must be legible (>= 8pt, preferably >= 9pt).
*   **References:** No page limit; include full author names, clickable links/DOIs. References should be hyperlinked to citations.
*   ""Squeezing"" space using \vspace or similar is forbidden and may lead to rejection.

## Author Response Period

Authors will have an opportunity to respond to reviews, focusing on correcting factual errors and addressing reviewer questions. Rebuttals are optional but encouraged and should be kept under 800 words.

## Accepted Papers

Accepted papers are conditionally accepted, pending revision and shepherd approval. They are allowed +2 pages in the proceedings (more pages for a fee). At least one author is expected to attend physically to present. Accepted papers will be published online and in separate volumes.

## Artifact Evaluation

Artifact evaluation will continue in 2026. Refer to the ASPLOS 2026 AEC web page for details.

## Poster and Lightning Sessions

Poster and lightning sessions may be included; details will be announced later.

The International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM) is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners in the field of Business Process Management (BPM).

BPM 2025 will be held in Seville, Spain, from **August 31 to September 5, 2025**.

## Conference Tracks

The BPM conference is structured into three tracks:

### Track I: Foundations

This track invites papers that have a **foundational, formal, mathematical, algorithmic, or conceptual nature**. It focuses on:

*   Investigating the underlying principles of BPM, computational theories, formal methods, and algorithms for modeling, automating, analyzing, and optimizing business processes.
*   Identifying novel problems, novel modeling languages, architectures, and other concepts underlying process-aware information systems.
*   Conceptual papers on frameworks, taxonomies, and patterns that investigate problems in the design of BPM systems.

Empirical evaluation is not mandatory, but technical quality standards and the degree to which foundations lay out new ways of modeling, analyzing, and improving BPM systems are key.

### Track II: Engineering

This track invites papers that deal with **engineering aspects of BPM research**, focusing on the development and investigation of artifacts and systems that aim to solve concrete problems in business environments. This includes:

*   Tools and techniques for process modeling, the enactment of process models, and process monitoring and analytics (including process mining techniques).
*   Usage of artifacts and systems in particular domains (e.g., digital health, smart mobility, logistics, smart government).
*   Aspects related to the interaction between processes and software infrastructure and services.

All papers in this track must include rigorous and reproducible empirical evaluations. Contributions based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques must provide adequate justification for adaptations to BPM contexts.

### Track III: Management

This track invites papers that focus on the **empirical, socio-technical, cognitive, psychological, managerial, and societal aspects of BPM**. This includes techniques, tools, and methods employed in organizations to better govern business processes. Research papers aim to advance the understanding of how process management (and mining) concepts deliver business value.

Areas of interest include strategic alignment, governance, methods, information technology, people, and culture, as long as they have a significant link to BPM. All levels of analysis (individual, team, organization, or ecosystem) are welcome.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Each paper must be submitted to exactly **one track**.
*   Papers must be formatted according to **Springer’s LNCS formatting guidelines**.
*   Submissions must be in English and **cannot exceed 16 pages** including references and appendices.
*   The title page must contain a short abstract clarifying the relation of the paper with the topics.
*   Submissions must be original contributions that have neither been published previously nor submitted to other conferences or journals.
*   Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the [BPM 2025 EasyChair submission site](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2025).

## Key Dates

*   **Paper Abstract submission:** March 4, 2025
*   **Paper submission:** March 18, 2025
*   **Notification to authors:** May 8, 2025
*   **Camera-ready submission:** June 13, 2025

All deadlines correspond to Anywhere on Earth (AoE or UTC-12).

## Awards

The conference will recognize outstanding contributions with a **Best Paper Award** and a **Best Student Paper Award**. Papers eligible for the Best Student Paper Award must be marked as such during submission and presented by a student author.

## BPM Forum

Papers that do not fully meet the quality criteria for the main conference but make a significant contribution to the community will be invited for presentation at the BPM Forum. These papers will be published in a separate post-proceedings volume (LNBIP series) and presented during the main conference.

## Open Science Principles

BPM encourages authors to follow principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability, supporting open data and open source principles. Authors are encouraged to disclose research artifacts and datasets, potentially earning an ""Artifacts Available"" badge.

## Double-Blind Review

BPM 2025 reviews are double blind. Authors must ensure that no identifying information is included in the submission, including meta-data. References to the authors' previous work should be in the third person, or blinded. Supplementary material and code must also be anonymized.",lần này lấy được ít ngày hơn lần trước

---

## Submission Guidelines

Submitted papers must have been neither previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop.

### Technical Track Paper Requirements

*   Technical research papers must not exceed **12 pages (including references)**.
*   All submissions must be in **English** and must come in **A4 paper size PDF format**.
*   Submissions must conform to the **IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines** (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt font). LaTeX users must use `\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}` without including the `compsoc` or `compsocconf` option.
*   Papers must comply with the IEEE Policy on Authorship.
*   The Chairs reserve the right to reject submissions (without reviews) that are not in compliance or out of scope for the conference.

### Submission System

Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF before the due date via HotCRP: [https://apsec25.hotcrp.com](https://apsec25.hotcrp.com)

### Double-Blind Policy

The APSEC 2025 technical research track will use a **double-blind reviewing process**, which means that submissions must not reveal the authors’ identities. Authors must make every effort to honor this process by adhering to the following rules:

*   Omit authors’ names and institutions from your title page.
*   References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person. Example: *Not* “We build on our previous work…” but rather “We build on the work of…”.
*   If the current submission is a clear follow-up to previous work, and reviewers might associate authorship, you may anonymize the reference. For example: “based on previous results [10]” where `[10]` is reported as “`[10] Anonymous Authors. Omitted for double blind reviewing.`”. Ensure the submission is self-contained.
*   Do not include acknowledgements of people, grants, organizations, etc., that would give away your identity. These can be added in the camera-ready version.
*   Aim to reduce the risk of accidental unblinding (e.g., identifiable project names should be changed for submission, e.g., `GoogleDeveloperHelper` becomes `DeveloperHelper`).
*   Avoid revealing institutional affiliations or where the work was performed. Generalize descriptions (e.g., “The study participants consist of 200 students in an introductory CS course.”). For industrial studies, refer to the organization as “Org” or “Company”.
*   While open science is encouraged (disclosing source code/datasets), avoid linking directly to code repositories or tool deployments that can reveal your identity. Use services like [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org) or [figshare.com](https://figshare.com) for anonymous archiving, or [archive.org](https://archive.org) for larger datasets. Link these archived and anonymized datasets within the paper itself.

> **Important Note:** Submissions that allow the author to be identified may be returned for editing at short notice or may be rejected outright.

### Preprint Policy

To ensure a fair and unbiased double-blind review process, authors submitting papers must comply with guidelines regarding non-anonymized versions. A non-anonymized version is any publicly available document (e.g., on arXiv) with essentially the same scientific content as the submitted paper, even if it differs in minor ways such as the title, paper structure or organization, length or formatting.

#### Preprints Posted Before the Anonymity Period

Authors are permitted to make a non-anonymized version publicly available *before* the anonymity period. The anonymity period starts **one month before the submission deadline** and ends when the paper is accepted, rejected, or withdrawn. However, authors are responsible for minimizing the risk of trivial linking between the submitted paper and a public version. Specifically, authors must:

*   Prevent the submitted manuscript from being associated with the non-anonymized version.
*   Not make the non-anonymized version easily discoverable via search engines by reusing distinctive phrases (e.g., title, keywords).
*   Not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period.
*   Not actively promote the non-anonymized version (e.g., via social media, blogs, or mailing lists).
*   Not reference, cite, or link to any non-anonymized version within the submitted manuscript.

#### Post-Publication Preprint Policy According to IEEE Guidelines

Upon acceptance and publication by IEEE, authors *must* update any publicly available non-anonymized version of the paper by:

1.  Replacing it with the full IEEE citation, including the Digital Object Identifier (DOI), **OR**
2.  Posting the accepted version of the paper (i.e., the author’s final version prior to IEEE formatting), along with the DOI. The IEEE-published version must **not** be posted.

IEEE will provide each author with a preprint version including the DOI and IEEE copyright notice. Authors may post this preprint version in accordance with IEEE’s posting guidelines. For more details: [https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/get-published/post-your-paper/](https://conferences.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/get-published/post-your-paper/)

*   High-quality papers on unpublished research and implementation experiences may be submitted.
*   All papers must be original and not substantially duplicated work that has been published at, or is simultaneously submitted to, a journal or another conference or workshop.
*   All submissions must be written in English and span **no more than 20 pages** in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format, including title, abstract, and bibliography. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level understandable by a non-expert reader and explain the context to related work.
*   Submitted papers may contain supplementary material in the form of well-marked appendices or a separate file archive (particularly for source code, data files, etc.). Note that supplementary material will not be included in the proceedings. Moreover, the main paper should be intelligible without requiring the reader to consult the supplementary material; the reviewers may optionally refer to the supplementary material, but are also permitted to base their assessment on the main paper alone.
*   **Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper.** The authors should make a reasonable effort not to reveal their identities or institutional affiliations in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data that is contained in the paper.
*   The conference will also consider **short papers of up to eight pages** in the LNCS format, excluding the bibliography (max 2 pages), for results that are not yet fully fleshed out or that simply require fewer pages to describe but still make a significant contribution.
*   All submissions must be processed with **LaTeX2e** according to the instructions given by Springer. Submitted manuscripts must be typeset in plain Springer LNCS format, in particular without changing the font size, margins or line spacing. Submissions not meeting these guidelines may be rejected without consideration of their merits.
*   Papers must be submitted via **EasyChair**: [https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cans2025](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=cans2025).

## Submission Guidelines

All submissions must be made electronically through the conference submission website: [https://cc25.hotcrp.com](https://cc25.hotcrp.com).

1.  **Abstract:** Submissions must include an abstract (100–400 words), author contact information, the full list of authors and their affiliations.
2.  **Format:** Full paper submissions must be in PDF formatted printable on US letter size paper.
    *   Papers must be prepared in **ACM Conference Format** using the 2-column `acmart` format.
    *   For LaTeX, use the options `\documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart}`.
    *   For Word, use `interim-layout.docx`. *Important note:* The Word template on the ACM website uses 9pt font; you need to increase it to **10pt**.
3.  **Page Limit:** Papers should contain a maximum of **10 pages** of text or figures, *NOT INCLUDING references*.
4.  **References:** There is no page limit for references, and they must include the name of all authors (do not use `et al.`).
5.  **Supplementary Material:** Appendices are not allowed. Authors may submit anonymous supplementary material, such as proofs, source code, or data sets; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.
6.  **Resubmission:** Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed.
7.  **Rejection Criteria:** Papers that exceed the length requirement, deviate from the expected format, or are submitted late will be rejected.

> Prospective authors should be aware of [ACM’s Copyright Policies](https://authors.acm.org/main.html), adhere to [SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/), and to [ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-detection).

> By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including [ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

> Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an [ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/), as this will be a requirement for the publishing process.

## Double-Blind Reviewing Process

CC uses a double-blind reviewing process. Authors will need to identify any potential conflicts of interest with the Program Committee (PC), as defined in the SIGPLAN policy.

To facilitate the double-blind reviewing process, submissions (including supplementary material) should **not reveal the identity of the authors in any way**.

*   Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission.
*   Any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).
*   Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized.

## Artifact Evaluation (AE)

Authors of accepted CC 2025 papers are invited to formally submit their supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation (AE) process. This submission is voluntary and does not influence the final decision regarding paper/poster acceptance. The AE process begins after the acceptance notification and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers.

To ease the organization of the AE committee, authors are kindly asked to indicate their interest in submitting an artifact at the time of paper submission.

*   **Single-Blind:** The artifact evaluation process is single-blinded. Authors are requested to disable any form of analytics, tracking, and logging on sites and services used to share the artifact with reviewers.
*   **Communication:** During the process, authors and evaluators are allowed to anonymously communicate with each other through Hotcrp to overcome technical difficulties. Authors should be available to resolve clarifications within **24 hours**.
*   **Public Availability:** Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.

### Badge Types

CC follows ACM’s artifact reviewing and badging policy. The AE committee will award two types of badges:

*   **Red badge (Artifact Usable):** Awarded based on the usability and robustness of the artifact. The **Light-red badge** is for functional artifacts, while the **Dark-red badge** is granted when the artifact far exceeds usability expectations. For red badges, your artifact must be: Documented, Consistent, Complete, and Exercisable.
*   **Blue badge (Results Replicated):** Awarded if the main paper results can be reproduced with the authors' provided artifact. If applying for this badge, include scripts to execute, gather, and plot the main results, and the README must include a statement describing the criteria for deeming results similar enough.
*   **Green Artifact Available Badge:** This badge is awarded if the artifact is publicly available. This badge is awarded directly by the publisher if authors provide a link to the deposited artifact.

### Artifact Submission Guidelines

**Components of the Artifact:**

1.  The submission version of your paper/poster.
2.  A `README` file (PDF or plaintext format) that explains your artifact.
3.  The artifact itself, packaged as a single archive file (ZIP, TGZ, TBZ2). For artifacts larger than 600MB, provide a URL pointing to the artifact, ensuring reviewer anonymity.

**General Guidelines:**

*   **Simplify Installation:** Provide a “push-button approach” (virtual machine or Docker image) or scripts that automate dependency installation, compilation, and build commands. Admin or superuser privileges should not be necessary.
*   **Include Data:** Try to include all datasets and benchmarks used.
*   **Specialized Hardware:** If experimental test-bed requires specialized hardware, consider providing open access to a non-tracked testbed.

**Artifact Documentation Guidelines (in `README`):
**

*   **Brief description:** One or two paragraphs describing the artifact, its type, and overall behavior (inputs and outputs).
*   **Hardware requisites:** Specify compute cores, memory (DRAM), GPU(s), FPGAs, etc.
*   **Software pre-requisites:** Operating system and version (e.g., Ubuntu Linux LTS 2020); compiler and runtime versions (e.g., GCC 8.1, OpenMP 5.1, CUDA 9.0). Do not assume tools like CMake or Python are installed.
*   **Expectations:** Approximate time to install, run/use the artifact, and reproduce results.

> **NOTE:** The AE will not invest substantial time or effort on debugging the installation and use process. The information provided will be for internal use.

## Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers

This year, CC will offer a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”.

*   Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.
*   The successful evaluation of an artifact is **mandatory for a Tool Paper**.
*   Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.
*   These papers abide by the same limit of **10 pages** in the ACM format, references excluded, and are not distinguished in the final proceedings. Shorter submissions accounting for scientific ideas in practice are encouraged.

**Selection Criteria:**

*   **Originality:** Present CC-related technologies applied to real-world problems with unique scope or characteristics.
*   **Usability:** Broad usage or applicability, assisting CC-related research or extensible to new technologies. Significant unimplemented components will result in rejection.
*   **Documentation:** Tool or compiler must be presented on a website with documentation.
*   **Benchmark Repository:** A suite of benchmarks for testing should be provided.
*   **Availability:** The tool or compiler should be available for public use.
*   **Foundations:** Incorporate Compiler Construction principles; thorough discussion of theoretical foundations is not required, a summary suffices.
*   **Artifact Evaluation:** The submitted artifact must be functional and support paper claims. Mandatory for tool papers.

## Dual Submission Policy

Submitting papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences is not allowed. However, it is allowed to make an abstract submission by May 16, 2025 (without uploading the paper PDF) for a paper that is still under review as long as the ongoing review process ends by the full paper final deadline of May 23, 2025. You need to withdraw your submission in case the paper is accepted or still under review by May 23, 2025.

Authors are allowed to submit papers that have been presented or are to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Authors may also submit anonymized work already available as a preprint (e.g., in arXiv). In this case, the authors must modify the title and abstract while refraining from citing the manuscript to preserve anonymity.

## Authorship Policy

Before paper submission, authors are advised to review [ACM’s authorship policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) carefully. The full list of author names, including the ordering, must be finalized by the paper submission deadline.

## Conflict of Interest Policy

All authors must adhere to the ACM Conflict of Interest policy. For full details, please visit this site: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest).

## Desk Rejection Policy

Submissions that fail to adhere to the anonymity, length, or formatting requirements, or violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty—such as plagiarism, author misrepresentation, or falsification—may be subject to desk rejection by the chairs.

## ACM Policy Against Harassment

All authors and participants must adhere to the ACM Policy Against Harassment. For full details, please visit this site: [https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment).

HPDC uses dual-anonymous reviewing. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication.

*   The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of author names.
*   Reference your past work in the third person, as you would any other piece of related work.
*   If your submission extends a previous workshop paper or relates to a submission under review, cite the other work anonymously and email the deanonymized work to the PC chairs.
*   If reporting on system experiences at your institution, refer to the system anonymously but describe necessary properties. Consider describing frameworks using a different name and not sharing open-source code repositories if they are widely used.

## arXiv Submission Policy

Having an arXiv paper does not prohibit submission to HPDC. arXiv papers are not peer-reviewed and do not count as prior work. Authors are encouraged to use preventive measures to reduce the chances of accidental breach of anonymity (e.g., use a different title and do not revise the arXiv version during the review period).

## Author List After Acceptance

The author list cannot be changed after acceptance.

## Conflict of Interest Declaration

All authors must indicate their conflict of interest (institutional, collaborative, or personal) with PC members at the time of submission. Refer to the submission website for detailed guidelines.

## HPDC Policy on the use of AI

*   HPDC permits the use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly) for language rectification.
*   Authors must verify the accuracy of AI-generated results.
*   AI tools are not eligible for authorship.
*   The use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section, citing the AI system used. The acknowledgments section must still follow dual-anonymous guidelines.

## ACM Policy on Authorship

Refer to the ACM Policy on Authorship and the ACM's frequently asked questions page for policies on generative AI tools.

## Submissions

Submit via the HPDC Submission Site: [HPDC Submission Site](https://hpdc.sci.utah.edu/)

## Suggestions for Document Preparation for Authors

Authors are encouraged to structure their introduction section as follows:

*   **Motivation:** Clearly state the objective and provide quantitative support for the problem.
*   **Limitation of state-of-art approaches:** Review prior works, articulate limitations, and explain novelty.
*   **Key insights and contributions:** Articulate major insights, specify novelty, describe key ideas, and list contributions.
*   **Experimental methodology and artifact availability:** Specify infrastructure, methodological details, and indicate artifact availability.
*   **Limitations of the proposed approach:** Clearly articulate major limitations and sensitive conclusions.

## Ethical Considerations

If research describes a new security-related attack, consider responsible disclosure. Papers should follow ethical principles and not alter security/privacy/equality expectations of users.

## Inclusive Description of Research Contributions

Consider using gender-neutral pronouns, diverse examples, and making the paper accessible to visually impaired or color-blind readers.

KR is a leading forum for research in Artificial Intelligence focusing on the explicit, declarative representation of knowledge and its computational management.","# KR 2025: Call for Papers - Main Track

The International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR) is a well-established and vibrant field of research within Artificial Intelligence. KR builds on the fundamental thesis that knowledge can often be represented in an explicit declarative form, suitable for processing by dedicated symbolic reasoning engines.

KR 2025 will be held in Melbourne, Australia, from **November 11-17, 2025**, co-located with CPAIOR 2025, ICAPS 2025, and NMR 2025.

## Main Track

We solicit papers presenting novel results on the principles of KR, which clearly contribute to the formal foundations of the field or show the applicability of KR techniques to implemented or implementable systems. We welcome papers from other areas that demonstrate clear use of, or contributions to, the principles or practice of KR. We also encourage ""reports from the field"" of applications, experiments, developments, and tests.

*   Reviewers will not see the authors' names or affiliations initially.
*   Author names will be revealed to reviewers only after their reviews have been submitted.

To facilitate this process:

*   Submitted papers must omit author names and institutions.
*   References to the authors' own related work should be in the third person (e.g., ""We build on the work of ..."" instead of ""We build on our previous work ..."").

## Awards and Special Issues

*   **Kleene Award:** For the best student paper(s).
*   **Distinguished Papers:** Around 10% of accepted papers will be selected.
*   **Special Issues:** Invited submissions to the Journal of the ACM and Logical Methods in Computer Science.

## Logic Mentoring Workshop (LMW)

The Logic Mentoring Workshop is co-located with LICS on **Monday 23 of June**. The registration fee is included in the LICS registration. The LMW is organizing a Buddy Program to pair junior academics with other LICS participants. Details can be found on the [LMW website](https://logic-mentoring-workshop.github.io/lics25).

## Registration

## Scope of the Conference

The IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the field of real-time systems. It serves as a platform for researchers and practitioners to showcase innovations covering all aspects of real-time systems, including theory, design, analysis, implementation, verification, evaluation, and experience. RTSS’25, the 46th edition, continues the tradition of embracing new and emerging areas of real-time systems research.

## Tracks

RTSS’25 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems theory and practice. Manuscripts may be submitted to either of the following tracks:

### Track 1: Real-Time Systems and Foundations

This track focuses on the practical and theoretical foundations that enable predictable timing in computing systems.
*   **Core topics:** Real-time operating systems components (kernels, hypervisors, middleware, runtime environments), schedulability analysis and scheduling algorithms, theoretical foundations, verification methods.
*   **Timing analysis:** Worst-case execution time (WCET) analysis, measurement-based timing analysis (MBTA).
*   **Other areas:** Real-time and time-sensitive networking, timing-predictable hardware architectures, modeling and analysis of stochastic real-time systems, statistical and empirical approaches to timing predictability.
*   **Fault tolerance and security:** Real-time systems under adversarial conditions (e.g., timing-based side-channel attacks), secure communication in time-sensitive networks.
*   **Cross-layer predictability:** Hardware, operating systems, and applications.
*   **Enabling technologies:** Compiler techniques, system synthesis, model-driven engineering, applied formal methods (model checking, proof-based verification).
*   **Experimental contributions:** System designs, case studies, and experience reports.
*   **Artificial Intelligence for Real-Time Systems Foundations:** Use of machine learning and other AI techniques to advance real-time scheduling, timing analysis, resource management, and system optimization under timing constraints. (Focus is on AI *for* real-time systems foundations, not real-time systems *for* AI, which is Track 2).

### Track 2: Design and Applications

This track focuses on real-time systems in a broader systems context, emphasizing novel research on designs, implementations, and applications. It explores how tools and techniques are adapted and applied to specific application domains.

*   **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS):** Safety-critical, autonomous, and robotic systems interacting with the physical world. Includes theoretical foundations, design methodologies, simulation and emulation, tool chains, architectures, secure CPS, performance analysis, robustness, safety, certification, and hardware/software co-design.
*   **Real-Time System Design for Artificial Intelligence:** Practical implementation of AI components (perception, planning, decision-making) in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. Design of real-time systems to deploy AI under real-time constraints. Topics include system design, frameworks, resource management, hardware acceleration, and case studies. Also covers AI safety in CPS: verification/validation of learning-enabled components, runtime monitoring, safe exploration, explainability, and robustness.
*   **HW-SW Integration and System-Level Design:** Methodologies and tools for hardware/software integration and co-design in modern embedded systems. Includes architecture description languages, hardware architectures, design space exploration, synthesis, optimization. Focus on SoC design for real-time workloads, custom memory hierarchies, multi-core architectures, communication infrastructure. Emerging trends like RISC-V, AI/ML hardware accelerators, and chiplet-based design are of strong interest.
*   **Internet of Things (IoT):** Challenges such as resource constraints, scalability demands, and dynamic environments. Focus on enabling real-time capabilities in IoT applications (distributed sensing/control, reliable communication, low-latency processing). Edge computing, fog computing, and AI-at-the-edge for responsiveness. Application domains include smart cities, industrial IoT, smart healthcare. 5G/6G for real-time and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) and in-network computing.

## Timing Requirements

To be in scope, **ALL submissions must explicitly address some form of real-time requirements / constraints**.

Common examples include (but are not limited to) deadlines, response-time bounds, thresholds on acceptable tail latencies (as found in service level agreements - SLAs), as well as statistical and stochastic notions of timeliness.

Other forms of real-time requirements may be considered if the submission provides a compelling justification that the problem requires a nontrivial resource allocation, programming, scheduling, or design approach to satisfy timing-predictability requirements.

Improving average-case performance without regard to other criteria is **not** considered addressing a real-time requirement. However, improving average-case performance while ensuring worst-case latency or execution time variability is not worsened *is* considered addressing a real-time requirement.

RTSS especially welcomes new and emerging topics that address novel aspects of real-time requirements, such as machine learning techniques for real-time systems, system design for real-time machine learning, resource management in autonomous systems, and system-level solutions for real-time applications exploiting domain-specific accelerators.

When in doubt, please contact the track chairs for clarification.

## Surveys and User Studies

Empirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field is also welcome. This type of research uses surveys, questionnaires, interviews, use-cases, or other empirical techniques to obtain information about the past/current/future state of play in the research, design, development, verification, validation, and deployment of real-time systems.

(Note that literature surveys that solely classify, review, and summarize existing research papers are not considered empirical research and are not in scope of the conference.)

## Proceedings and Awards

All accepted papers will appear in the main program and proceedings, provided they are presented at the conference.

A selection of papers will receive recognition as outstanding papers and will be highlighted as such in the proceedings. **Best paper**, **best student paper**, and **best presentation** awards will be presented at the conference. Submissions are eligible for the best student paper award if the first author is a student as of the submission deadline.

## Important Dates

*   **Submission Deadline (firm):** May 22, 2025 (anywhere on Earth)
*   **Author Response Period:** July 14-17, 2025
*   **Author Notification:** July 25, 2025
*   **Camera-Ready Deadline:** September 16, 2025 (tentative)
*   **Conference:** December 2–5, 2025

## Submission Guidelines

*   Submissions are accepted through the conference site: [https://rtss25.hotcrp.com](https://rtss25.hotcrp.com).
*   **Supplemental materials** such as source code, mechanized proofs, data sets, formal models, short demo videos, etc., can be uploaded alongside manuscripts (up to 600 MB, as a ZIP archive). Ideally, each submitted artifact should contain a README with a table of contents, an overview or guidance for reviewers, and reproduction instructions (if applicable).
*   Authors should use the official option to provide supplemental materials rather than linking to external repositories.
*   Refer to the [paper submission guidelines](https://2025.rtss.org/paper-submission/) for further details.

## Policy on Remote Participation

RTSS’25 is an in-person conference. However, exceptions can be made for authors on a case-by-case basis according to the following TCRTS guidance:

> In-person presentations are expected. However, if an author has a valid reason why neither they nor their co-authors can attend the conference in person, then exceptions can potentially be made at the discretion of the Program Chair. Authors who know in advance that this will apply to them, for example because they cannot get a visa for the host country, should contact the Program Chair prior to paper submission.
>
> Following existing TCRTS policy, one author will be required to register for the conference at the “in-person” rate (either student or full) in any case.

Please contact the track chairs by email via [rtss25-track-chairs@mpi-sws.org](mailto:rtss25-track-chairs@mpi-sws.org) if you would like to inquire about a possible exception or in case of any questions.",các impDate sai hết

*   **Submissions due:** Tuesday, January 14, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Authors' response period:** Monday, April 7–Wednesday, April 9, 2025, 11:59 pm UTC
*   **Notification to authors:** Friday, April 25, 2025
*   **Final papers due:** Tuesday, June 3, 2025

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Anonymity:** USENIX ATC '25 will employ **double-blind reviewing**. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   **Originality:** Submissions must contain original unpublished material that is not under review at any other forum, including journals, conferences, and workshops with proceedings.
*   **Registration:** Papers need to be registered and their abstracts submitted by the abstract registration deadline. Papers with an empty abstract at the time of the abstract registration deadline will be rejected.
*   **Artifact Evaluation:** There will be an optional artifact evaluation process for accepted papers. Visit the href=""/conference/atc25/call-for-artifacts"" - Call for Artifacts page for details.
*   **Further Details:** For detailed submission instructions, please see the href=""/conference/atc25/submission-instructions"" - Submission Instructions page.

## Submission Types

USENIX ATC '25 accepts both **full and short submissions**.

*   **Full submissions:** Must not exceed **12 pages**, excluding references and appendices.
*   **Short submissions:** Must not exceed **6 pages**, excluding references and appendices.

Both types are reviewed to the same standards and differ primarily in scope. A short paper presents a complete idea that is properly evaluated, just like in a full-length submission. Optionally, authors can include an appendix to provide material that may be of interest to some reviewers, such as algorithm details, proofs, and code snippets, but is not central to the contributions of the paper.

## Deployed Systems Track

USENIX ATC '25 solicits papers that describe the design, implementation, analysis, and experience with real-world deployment of systems and networks. Papers for the deployed systems track need not present new ideas or results to be accepted but should convey practical insights. Note that the rules regarding submission and anonymization are different for deployed systems track papers.

## Generative AI Policy

Authors must not submit papers containing sections generated entirely by generative AI. Authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper does not include sections completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP. For more detailed questions about the appropriate use of generative AI, please feel free to contact the ATC co-chairs.

## Review Process

The review process will have two cycles under the single submission deadline.

### Review Cycle I (Submission to Initial Notification)

Submissions will be assigned to two members of the ISMAR 2025 International Program Committee (IPC). Submissions that violate the submission guidelines will be desk rejected. Those not desk rejected will receive at least three full reviews.

Based on the reviews and initial discussions, the Program Chairs will make one of the following initial recommendations:

*   **Revise and Resubmit:** These submissions will go through the second review cycle. Note that this does not guarantee acceptance.
*   **Reject:** Authors of rejected submissions will be able to resubmit to the poster track.

### Review Cycle II (Revision with Rebuttal to Final Decision)

Authors will have time to revise their submissions and write a rebuttal. The revised submission and rebuttal will be reviewed by the original reviewers. Based on these reviews, a final recommendation (journal, conference, poster, or rejection) will be made by the committee. Minor revisions may be required before final acceptance of camera-ready versions.

**Submission Deadline:** Friday, February 7, 2025, 23:59 AoE

## Scope

The conference seeks original research papers in all areas of computational complexity theory, studying the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints. We welcome contributions from all topics with connections to or motivated by questions in complexity theory, broadly construed. We especially encourage submissions that address complexity-theoretic issues in complexity-adjacent areas such as coding theory, cryptography, game theory, learning, logic and privacy.

Possible topics include but are not limited to:

*   Complexity classes
*   Reducibility and completeness
*   Circuit complexity
*   Communication complexity
*   Algebraic complexity
*   Proof complexity
*   Complexity in other concrete computational models
*   Interactive and probabilistic proof systems
*   Logic and descriptive complexity
*   Pseudorandomness and derandomization
*   Average case complexity
*   Quantum computation
*   Parametrized complexity
*   Fine-grained complexity
*   Complexity-theoretic aspects of:
    *   coding theory
    *   cryptography
    *   optimization (including inapproximability, continuous optimization)
    *   property testing
    *   streaming and sublinear computation
    *   distributed computation
    *   game theory
    *   machine learning
    *   privacy

## Submission

**Deadlines:** Papers must be submitted electronically via submission server [here](https://ccc2025.hotcrp.com/), and received by **Friday, February 7, 2025, 23:59 AoE**. Notification of acceptance will be sent by **Friday, May 2, 2025**, and final camera-ready copies of accepted papers will be due end of **May, 2025**.

**Format:**

Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper and an abstract of 1-2 paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. A submission must contain within its first 10 pages a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including discussion of its importance, prior work, and an outline of key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims (similar to the content of a brief oral presentation). There is no bound on the total length of a submission, but material other than the abstract, references, and the first 10 pages is considered as supplementary and will be read at the committee's discretion.

Submissions should include proofs of all central claims.

The submission should be in single-column format, use at least 11-point font, at least 1-inch margins, and at least single-spacing between lines. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Instructions for formatting camera-ready versions will be communicated to the authors of accepted papers.

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. (Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.) The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without unconscious bias, and is not intended to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may (and are in fact encouraged to) post their papers to arXiv/ECCC/IACR etc.

Additional remarks: In addition to the submission, authors may optionally send a short email to the program committee (PC) chair at [ccc2025chair@gmail.com](mailto:ccc2025chair@gmail.com) containing any additional remarks for the PC, such as the relationship with independent/concurrent work, differences from prior versions, conflict of interest statements, or clarifications concerning prior reviews of the work. Submissions involving PC members are not allowed.

**Conflict of interest:** We expect PC members and reviewers to recuse themselves from the evaluation of any submission, if they would not be able to give an objective opinion due to some conflict of interest (COI). Some examples why a COI may arise are being a thesis advisor, being an immediate family member or close friend, sharing a recent institutional affiliation or being a close collaborator. Any author may write to the PC chair at [ccc2025chair@gmail.com](mailto:ccc2025chair@gmail.com) if there is a COI that may not be covered by the above measure, such as significant interactions that would suggest the inability to assess a paper objectively. They need only give the names and affiliations of the people with whom a COI exists; no explanation is required. The COI will be held in confidence by the PC chair.

**Simultaneous submission policy:** Material which has been previously published in a journal or another conference proceedings, or which is scheduled for publication prior to September 2025, will not be considered for acceptance. Simultaneous submission of the same or essentially the same material to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed.

**Confidentiality:** All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees.

## Publication

**Online posting:** Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible on-line repository such as the [Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity](http://eccc.hpi-web.de/eccc) or the arXiv. It is hoped that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers publicly available by the camera-ready deadline.

**Proceedings:** The conference proceedings will be published under a Creative Commons BY license in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series. Publication in the conference proceedings does not preclude subsequent journal publication.

**Presentation:** Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the conference. The program committee will determine time allocations for presentations (between 15 and 45 minutes).

## Awards

*   **EATCS Luca Trevisan award for the CCC best student paper:** This award will be given to the best paper written solely by one or more students as judged by the program committee. A paper is eligible if all authors are full-time students on the day of the submission deadline. Authors should indicate their eligibility by using the check-box for this on the submissions page. The program committee may decline to make the award or may split it among several papers. Funding for the best student paper award is provided by EATCS.
*   **Best paper award:** This award will be given to the best paper submitted to the conference as judged by the program committee. The program committee may decline to make the award or may split it among two or more papers. Full versions of the papers chosen by the program committee to receive the best paper award will be invited for submission to the Journal of the ACM.
*   **Special journal issue:** The program committee will invite full versions of a select number of conference submissions to a special issue of the journal Computational Complexity.

## Conference Information

*   **Dates and location:** The conference will be held from Tuesday, August 5 to Friday, August 8, 2025 in Toronto, Canada. The details of the conference format will be posted in due course.
*   **Travel allowances:** In order to defray the costs of attending the conference, travel allowances will be offered to students and post-doctoral fellows. More information will be made available on the conference webpage in due time.
*   **Visas:** A visa for Canada may be needed for attending the conference, e.g., for citizens of China, India, and Russia. See the [visa website of the Canadian government](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada.html) for the exact rules for short-term stay visas. If a visa is needed, please get in touch with your local Canadian consulate as soon as possible; the whole process may take several months. Feel free to contact the local arrangements committee if you need a letter to obtain your visa.
*   **Code of conduct:** CCC 2025 is a participant in the SafeTOC initiative. The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of CCC. These require an environment that recognizes every person and group's inherent worth; fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect; and embraces diversity. The CCC'25 organizers are committed to providing an environment free of discrimination and harassment and expect all participants to honor that commitment.

The ASSETS conference is the premier forum for presenting research on the **design, evaluation, use, and education** related to computing for people with disabilities and older adults. We invite high-quality original submissions on topics relevant to computing and **accessibility**.

Submissions should present significant contributions to design, systems, tools, scientific understanding, methodology, or social issues. Relevant topics include (but are not limited to) new enabling technologies, studies of how technologies are used by people with disabilities, explorations of barriers to access, and evaluations of accessibility education methods. We recommend that papers with a technical contribution be validated through research activities with representative users when possible. However, we acknowledge that many accessibility-focused projects may begin with deep formative work with representative users, or may be based on prior research with representative users, and as such key contributions of a single paper may be primarily technical.

## Submission Categories and Deadlines

All accepted papers and abstracts will be archived in the ACM Digital Library. At least one author of accepted submissions must register as the presenter by the early registration deadline.

The conference focuses on methods and solutions for software test automation, with a special theme on adapting test automation to the AI era, including sustainability and emerging challenges.","# The 6th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automation of Software Test (AST 2025) - Call for Papers

## Scope

Software pervasiveness in both industry and digital society, as well as the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, are continuously leading to emerging needs from both software producers and consumers. Infrastructures, software components, and applications aim to hide their increasing complexity to appear more human-centric. However, the potential risk from design errors, poor integrations, and time-consuming engineering phases can result in unreliable solutions that can barely meet their intended objectives. In this context, Software Engineering processes and methods keep demanding the investigation of novel and further refined approaches to Software Quality Assurance (SQA).

Software testing automation is a discipline that has produced noteworthy research in the last decades. The search for solutions to automatically test any concept of software is critical, and it encompasses several areas: from the generation of test cases, test oracles, test stubs/mocks; through the definition of selection and prioritization criteria; up to the engineering of infrastructures governing the execution of testing sessions locally or remotely in the cloud.

The Automation of Software Test (AST) conference continues with a long record of international scientific forums on methods and solutions to automate software testing. In 2025, AST is in its 6th edition, having been formerly organized as workshops since 2006. The conference promotes high-quality research contributions on methods for software test automation and original case studies reporting practices in this field. We invite contributions that focus on:

i) lessons learned about experiments of automatic testing in practice;
ii) experiences of the adoption of testing tools, methods and techniques;
iii) best practices to follow in testing and their measurable consequences; and
iv) theoretical approaches that are applicable to the industry in the context of AST.

Our theme for this year is **“Adapting test automation to the AI era including sustainability and emerging challenges”** with special sessions on test automation for AI, sustainability, and AI testing education and training.

## Topics of Interest

## Paper Evaluation Objectives

The committee will make every effort to judge each submitted paper on its own merits. There will be no target acceptance rate. We expect to accept a wide range of papers with appropriate expectations for evaluation – while papers that build on significant past work with strong evaluations are valuable, papers that open new areas with less rigorous evaluation are equally welcome and especially encouraged. We also acknowledge the wide range of evaluation methodologies in HPCA including modeling, simulation, prototyping, experimental implementation, real product evaluation, etc.

## Paper Formatting Details

*   **Page Limit:** 11 pages, not including references.
*   **Paper Size:** US Letter: 8.5in x 11in
*   **Margins:** Top/Bottom: 0.7in / 1in, Left/Right: 0.7in

*   **Caption Font:** 9pt (minimum)
*   **References:** 8pt, no page limit, list all authors’ names

## Reviewing Process

Reviewing will be **double blind**. Authors must not include any author names on submitted documents except in the space provided on the submission form. Ensure that the metadata included in the PDF does not give away the authors. Refer to prior work in the third person and include a full citation for the work in the bibliography.

## Authorship Guidelines

IEEE guidelines dictate that authorship should be based on a substantial intellectual contribution. All authors must have met specific conditions related to intellectual contribution, drafting/revising the article, and approving the final version.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site. Conflicts include advisor-advisee relationships, family members, collaborations within the last 4 years, people from the same institution within the last 4 years, funding relationships, and members of the same research center where unpublished work is regularly discussed. 

*Scenarios that do NOT constitute a conflict include: authors of previously-published, closely related work; service collaborations; co-authoring community-wide tools; people working on similar topics; and people under the same umbrella funding award without close collaboration.*

## ArXiv Submissions

Authors may submit their work to HPCA 2025 even if it appears on Arxiv. However, authors are encouraged to reduce the possibility of their name being disclosed to avoid issues with the double-blind review process.

## Concurrent Submissions

Manuscripts must not have been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form, nor be under review for any other conference or journal during the HPCA 2025 review period, with specific exceptions for workshops without archived proceedings or venues like arXiv.

## Submission Instructions

Registration and submission should be done on the [ISPASS 2025 AE HotCRP site](https://ispass2025ae.hotcrp.com/).

An artifact submission consists of two parts:

1.  **Paper and a two-page appendix:** Prepare your appendix using the provided template. The appendix should include an abstract, metainformation, artifact access details, system requirements, experiment workflow, steps for evaluation, and results. This appendix does not count towards the regular page limit.
2.  **The artifact:** Ensure the artifact evaluation committee can access your artifact. For submission, providing code via convenient means like GitHub is sufficient. To earn the ""Available"" badge, you must upload your artifact to a public archival website.

## Badges

The availability of artifacts will be denoted by the following IEEE Reproducibility Badges:

*   **Available:** Reasonable and complete code and/or datasets, including data and documentation, provided by authors to support reproducibility.
*   **Reviewed:** Reasonable and complete code and/or datasets that run to produce described outputs and support reproducibility.
*   **Reproducible:** Computational results regenerated by an independent party using author-created research objects, methods, code, and analysis conditions. Assumes artifacts were also reviewed.

Artifacts can be **Code** or **Datasets**. A paper can have both.

## Earning the ""Available"" Badge

To earn the ""Available"" badge, artifacts must be uploaded to either [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) to ensure long-term archival storage and provide a persistent identifier (DOI).

## Artifact Evaluation Process

*   Artifacts will be evaluated by a dedicated Artifacts Evaluation (AE) committee through a **single-blind review process**.
*   Authors should be available to respond quickly during the evaluation period.
*   The evaluation is restricted to **accepted papers** at ISPASS 2025.
*   The committee may communicate with authors (anonymously through the submission platform) to provide feedback and allow authors to address issues.
*   Authors are recommended to document artifacts thoroughly to minimize interaction.
*   For artifacts requiring significant computation time, provide a shortcut or sampling mechanism.
*   For system requirements that cannot be met by a standard computer, authors are responsible for providing remote access (e.g., via SSH) with proper anonymization.

## Distinguished Artifact Award

All submitted artifacts will compete for a ""Distinguished Artifact Award"" based on reproducibility, ease of use, documentation, extensibility, and substantial support for the paper's claims.
