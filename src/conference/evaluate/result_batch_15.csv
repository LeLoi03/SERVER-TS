The 22nd International Conference on Relational and Algebraic Methods in Computer Science (RAMICS 2026) will be held on **April 7-10, 2026**, at the **Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Będlewo, Poland**.

RAMICS serves as the primary forum for research on relation algebras, Kleene algebras, and related algebraic structures. These frameworks play a central role as conceptual and methodological tools in computer science and beyond.

## Scope

On the theoretical side, RAMICS covers topics such as semigroups, residuated lattices, semirings, Kleene algebras, relation algebras, quantales, and other related structures. The conference explores their connections with program logics and other logical systems, as well as their roles in automata theory, concurrency, formal languages, games, networks, and programming languages. It also welcomes contributions on the development of algebraic, algorithmic, categorical, coalgebraic, and proof-theoretic methods, including formalisation efforts using theorem provers.

Applications of these formalisms span a wide range of domains, including tools and techniques for program specification, verification, and correctness; qualitative and quantitative models of computing systems; algorithm design; automated reasoning; network protocol analysis; optimisation; control; and even social choice theory.

## Submission Guidelines

*   All papers will be peer-reviewed by at least three referees.
*   The proceedings will be published in an LNCS volume by Springer, ready at the conference.
*   Submissions must not be published or under review for publication elsewhere.
*   Submissions must be in English using a PDF not exceeding **16 pages** (excluding references) in LNCS style.
*   Submission is via EasyChair at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ramics2026](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ramics2026)
*   Submissions must provide sufficient information to judge their merits. Additional material may be provided in a clearly marked appendix or by a reference to a manuscript on a web site. Experimental data, software or mathematical components for theorem provers must be available in sufficient detail for referees. Deviation from these requirements may lead to rejection.
*   One author of each accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference.
*   Accepted papers must be produced with LaTeX. Formatting instructions and LNCS style files are available at [http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html](http://www.springer.com/comp/lncs/authors.html).

## Publication

As for earlier RAMiCS conferences, there is intent to publish a journal special issue with revised and extended versions of a selection of the best papers.

The 17th International Conference on Reversible Computation (RC) will be held in **Odense, Denmark, July 3 - July 4, 2025**.

Reversible computation has a growing number of promising application areas such as low power design, coding/decoding, debugging, testing and verification, database recovery, discrete event simulation, reversible algorithms, reversible specification formalisms, reversible programming languages, process algebras, and the modeling of biochemical systems. Furthermore, reversible logic provides a basis for quantum computation with its applications, for example, in cryptography and in the development of highly efficient algorithms. First reversible circuits and quantum circuits have been implemented and are seen as promising alternatives to conventional CMOS technology.

The conference will bring together researchers from computer science, mathematics, and physics to discuss new developments and directions for future research in Reversible Computation. This includes applications of reversibility in quantum computation.

## Submission

All publication material submitted for presentation at an IFAC-sponsored meeting must be original and hence cannot be already published, nor can it be under review elsewhere. The authors take responsibility for the material that has been submitted. IFAC-sponsored conferences will abide by the highest standard of ethical behavior in the review process as explained on the Elsevier webpage ([https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/policies-and-ethics](https://www.elsevier.com/authors/journal-authors/policies-and-ethics)), and the authors will abide by the IFAC publication ethics guidelines ([https://www.ifac-control.org/events/organizersguide/PublicationEthicsGuidelines.pdf/view](https://www.ifac-control.org/events/organizersguide/PublicationEthicsGuidelines.pdf/view)).

Accepted papers that have been presented at an IFAC meeting will be published in the proceedings of the event using the open-access IFAC-PapersOnLine series hosted on ScienceDirect ([https://sciencedirect.com/](https://sciencedirect.com/)).  To this end, the author(s) must grant exclusive publishing rights to IFAC under a Creative Commons license when they submit the final version of the paper. The copyright belongs to the authors, who have the right to share the paper in the same terms allowed by the end user license, and retain all patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights (including research data).

Paper length and file size: Organizers should limit the length of regular papers to a minimum of 4 pages and a maximum of 6 pages in the final version. The limit for plenary and keynote papers is 18 pages.

Check the IFAC site for rules, paper format and style that may apply: [https://www.elsevier.com/journals/ifac-papersonline/2405-8963/guide-for-authors](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/ifac-papersonline/2405-8963/guide-for-authors) . Only unpublished and original material may be submitted

## Technical Papers - Submission Guidelines

We invite you to submit high-quality work on animation and simulation broadly defined as computation dealing with time-varying phenomena. Each submission will be reviewed by an international program committee for technical quality, novelty, significance, and clarity, novelty, significance, and clarity.

Papers can be submitted via the [EasyChair website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sca2025).

*   Papers should be written and presented in English.
*   There is no strict maximum length for submitted papers. However, we recommend that research papers be up to 16 pages (excluding references), and longer papers should make a very significant contribution.
*   Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content.
*   A paper submission should describe original work of the authors.
*   Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources.
*   Supplementary material such as videos may also be submitted electronically and will be made available to reviewers (size up to 500MB). Videos are required for techniques involving motion or animation.
*   The author(s) of accepted papers must also attend the conference and present their work in-person. At least one (1) author from each accepted paper must register for the conference.

Submitted articles will receive two rounds of reviewing by at least three (3) expert reviewers. Technical papers conditionally accepted in the first round will undergo a second round of revision and review and, conditional on final acceptance, will be published in the PACMCGIT issue on SCA 2025. There is no rebuttal process.

### Paper Format

Research papers should be in [ACM article format](https://www.siggraph.org/preparing-your-content/author-instructions/) using the ACM small trim journal size (acmsmall). For the review version, please use the command `\documentclass[acmsmall, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart}`.

### Anonymous Submissions

Paper submissions must be anonymous and include the unique paper ID that will be assigned upon creating a submission using the online system. The review process is double-anonymous, so please remove all personal data, such as author names and affiliation from all your submission files.

Papers should not have previously appeared in, or be currently submitted to, any other conference or journal. SCA follows the same [anonymity policy as SIGGRAPH](https://s2025.siggraph.org/anonymity-policy/). Any case of violation will be determined by the chairs and could result in a desk rejection.

### Awards

Best Paper Awards will be given to exceptional submissions on the cutting edge of computer animation.

## Poster Abstracts

As in previous years, the poster session will be part of the SCA program. However, the poster abstracts will not be included in the conference proceedings, thus providing more freedom for the authors to decide if they want to upload the posters as a timestamp or not. Note that as usual, a SCA poster does not preclude subsequent publication of a complete paper on the same topic by the same authors (however, a SCA poster by other authors is considered prior art and should be cited as such).

Poster abstracts should be sent to the poster chair Alexandre Mercier-Aubin at alexandre.mercier-aubin@usherbrooke.ca

*   Submissions must be camera-ready, with author names and affiliations listed. The review process will be single-blind.
*   Poster abstract submissions should consist of a PDF paper according to the ACM article format. Submissions are permitted to be up to two pages in length, written and presented in English.
*   Supplementary material such as videos may also be submitted electronically and will be made available to reviewers. All supplementary materials must be submitted as a single zip file (size up to 500MB).

Authors of accepted papers are also welcome to reserve a spot for a poster presentation. To do so, please email the Poster Chair with your request. All accepted papers are guaranteed to be approved for a poster without the need to submit a poster abstract. Presenting a poster offers an excellent opportunity to showcase your work and engage in deeper, more interactive discussions with conference attendees, beyond what is typically possible during Q&A sessions.

All papers have to be anonymized so author names and affiliations cannot be included (see Double-Blind Reviewing section). Non-anonymized papers will be desk-rejected.

Authors are required to use the LaTeX style file supplied for the LIPIcs style, without changing default values nor setting font size options in the ""documentclass"" statement ([click here to access LIPICs instructions for authors and download the LaTex template](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author)).

All submissions have to be made via the EasyChair submission page for the conference ([click here to access the submission page](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sea2025)).

At the time the paper is submitted to SEA, and for the entire review period, the paper (or essentially the same paper) should not be under review by any other conference with published proceedings or by a scientific journal.

At least one author of each accepted paper will be expected to attend the conference and present the paper. Specifically, no accepted paper will be published unless an author registers to participate in the conference.

### Double-Blind Reviewing

SEA will implement a double-blind review process for the first time. As such, submissions must not disclose the authors' identities in any way.

Authors are free to share their ideas and drafts as they usually would. For instance, they can submit to repositories like arXiv or give talks on their research. If there are publicly accessible versions of the submission, authors may mention this in the submission (without including links or citations).

Authors should not compromise the submission's quality or hinder the review process in the name of anonymity; thus, key references must not be omitted or anonymized.

### Large Language Models Usage Policy

Papers containing content generated by large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or images created using deep generative models (DGMs) such as StableDiffusion are not allowed, except for:

*   Generating scientific plots displaying data that the authors obtained from experiments.
*   Polishing the text that the authors have personally written.

If a submission includes LLM-generated text or DGM-generated images, authors must disclose this information to the Program Chairs at the moment of submitting the paper, by checking a dedicated box on EasyChair and providing details on how they used these models.

## Important Dates

*   **Paper Submission Deadline:** February 2nd, 2025, AoE (extended)
*   **Authors' notification:** March 31st, 2025 (extended)
*   **Final version due:** April 28th, 2025

## Proceedings

The conference proceedings will be published in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs), a series of high-quality conference proceedings across all fields in informatics established in cooperation with Schloss Dagstuhl Leibniz Center for Informatics. SEA Proceedings volumes are published according to the principle of OpenAccess, i.e., they are available online and free of charge.

## Best Paper Award

The program committee will identify a submission as the best paper.

The 32nd Static Analysis Symposium (SAS 2025) will be held from **October 13-15, 2025** at the **Marina Bay Sands Convention Centre** in Singapore, co-located with [ICFP/SPLASH 2025](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025).

SAS is a fundamental tool for program verification, bug detection, compiler optimization, program understanding, and software maintenance. It is the primary venue for the presentation of theoretical, practical, and application advances in the area for over 30 years.

## Topics

The technical program for SAS 2025 will consist of invited lectures and presentations of refereed papers. Contributions are welcomed on all aspects of program analysis, including, but not limited to:

*   Abstract interpretation
*   Automated deduction
*   Data flow analysis
*   Debugging techniques
*   Deductive methods
*   Emerging applications
*   Model-checking
*   Data science
*   Program optimizations and transformations
*   Program synthesis
*   Program verification
*   Machine learning and verification
*   Security analysis
*   Tool environments and architectures
*   Theoretical frameworks
*   Type checking
*   Distributed or networked systems
*   LLM for static analysis and static analysis for LLM

All paper submissions will be evaluated on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity.

We welcome regular papers as well as papers focusing on any of the following in the **NEAT** (New questions/areas, Experience, Announcement, Tool) category:

*   Well-motivated discussion of new questions or new areas.
*   Experience with static analysis tools, Industrial Reports, and Case Studies
*   Brief announcements of work in progress
*   Tool papers

If you are submitting to the **NEAT** category rather than as a regular paper, please ensure your submission title is formatted as: “**NEAT**: your original paper title”. Note that both regular and **NEAT** submissions share the same page limits.

Submissions can address any programming paradigm, including concurrent, constraint, functional, imperative, logic, object-oriented, aspect, multi-core, distributed, and GPU programming.

With the exception of **NEAT** papers, all papers will follow a double-blind reviewing process. The identity of the authors for the **NEAT** papers will be therefore known to the reviewers.

Papers must be written and presented in English. A submitted paper must describe original work and must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or that are simultaneously submitted to a journal or a conference with refereed proceedings.

The review process will include a rebuttal period where authors have the opportunity to respond to preliminary reviews on the paper.

## Radhia Cousot Award

The program committee will select an accepted regular paper for the Radhia Cousot Young Researcher Best Paper Award in memory of Radhia Cousot.

## Artifacts

Authors are encouraged to submit a virtual machine image containing any artifacts and evaluations presented in the paper. Artifact submission is optional. Artifact evaluation will be concurrent with paper review. For more details, please visit the [SAS 2025 Artifacts page](https://2025.splashcon.org/track/sas-2025-sas-artifact).

## Double-Blind Requirement

All regular papers will follow a double-blind process, where author names and affiliations are hidden for the review. To facilitate this process, submitted regular papers must adhere to the following:

1.  Author names and affiliations must be omitted
2.  References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person

## NEAT Papers Content

**New problems papers** are an opportunity to discuss visions, challenges, experiences, problems, and impactful solutions in the field of static analysis from both a research and applications perspective.

**User experience & Industrial reports & Case studies papers** describe the use of static analysis in industrial settings or in any chosen application domains. Such papers are encouraged to discuss the unique challenges of transferring research ideas to a real-world setting, reflect on any lessons learned from this technology transfer experience, and compare experiences with different analyzers highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.

**Brief announcements of work in progress papers** may describe work in progress.

## Submission Guidelines

The SAS 2025 proceedings will be published by Springer in their LNCS series. Authors should consult Springer’s authors’ guidelines and use their proceedings templates, for LaTeX, Overleaf, or Word, for the preparation of their papers. The corresponding author of each accepted paper must complete and sign a Consent-to-Publish form.

Accepted papers will be invited to submit to a special issue of the Science of Computer Programming (SCP).

Established in 1979, SafeComp is an annual international conference covering the state-of-the-art, experience, and new trends in the areas of safety, security, and reliability of critical computer applications. SafeComp provides ample opportunity to exchange insights and experience on emerging methods, approaches, and practical solutions. It is a single-track conference allowing easy networking.

This 44th edition of SAFECOMP is a unique occasion to explore and debate hot topics of current challenges and solutions for future safety-critical systems.

## Theme

**Managing safety in an era of a software defined computing continuum**

Future societal and industrial systems will be increasingly relying on a digitalized infrastructure, from embedded systems, fog/edge-computing systems, to cloud and communications. Entire systems will also increasingly be software defined and upgradeable. Societal and industrial systems consequently be increasingly relying on such digitalized infrastructures, requiring an even stronger and proactive emphasis on key dependability properties, as emphasized by the SafeComp conferences. The theme for SafeComp 2025 has been chosen to highlight some of the following topics and challenges:

*   Predictability and reliability of cloud and edge computing, and AI components: The corresponding systems yet have to offer dependability properties suitable for critical systems
*   Architectures ensuring safety while enhancing performance
*   Co-design of applications and digital infrastructure to achieve cost-efficient dependability
*   Trustworthy DevOps – reconciling software and safety practices

## Paper Submission Guidelines

The tradition of SAFECOMP is to act as a platform for bringing academic research and industrial needs together. Therefore, industrial contributions and real-world experience reports are explicitly invited. We solicit two types of paper submission (in both cases, up to 14 pages incl. bibliography):

*   Research papers address a research gap and illustrate how the contribution submitted can help improve the state-of-the-art by advancing current knowledge;
*   Practical experience reports / tool descriptions provide new insights and valuable support to practitioners.

Papers exceeding the page limit will be excluded from the review process. All papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the International Programme Committee. Papers must not have been previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere.

All paper submissions must be formatted according to the LNCS templates provided by Springer. Abstracts and papers should be submitted in pdf through Easychair.

## Author Responses

Authors of papers that receive “Revision” decisions will have the opportunity to submit a revised version of their papers. The authors are required to provide a response letter that (1) explains how the comments have been tackled, (2) provides answers to the questions posed by reviewers.

## Paper Submission

All submissions must be in PDF format and conform, at time of submission, to the official “ACM Primary Article Template”, which can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template Page. LaTeX users should use the `sigconf` option, as well as the `review` (to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers) and `anonymous` (omitting author names) options. To that end, the following LaTeX code can be placed at the start of the LaTeX document:

```latex
\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}
```

All submissions must not exceed the specified page limits. The purchase of additional pages in the proceedings is not allowed.

Submissions must strictly conform to the ACM conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above. Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review.

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2026. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

Starting 2026, all articles published by ACM will be made Open Access. This is greatly beneficial to the advancement of computer science and leads to increased usage and citation of research. Most authors will be covered by ACM OPEN agreements by that point and will not have to pay Article Processing Charges (APC). Check if your institution participates in ACM OPEN. Authors not covered by ACM OPEN agreements may have to pay APC; however, ACM is offering several automated and discretionary APC Waivers and Discounts.

The SEAMS 2026 Research Track will use a lightweight double- anonymous review process. No submission may reveal its authors’ identities.

## Call for Papers

We invite submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results on software engineering for self-adaptive and self-managing systems, across the broad spectrum of topics of interest listed below. SEAMS 2026 will use a single-round submission system for the Research Track with the possibility of submitting a revised version. Accepted papers will be published in the IEEE and ACM digital libraries. In addition, authors of distinguished papers will be invited to submit revised and extended versions of their work to a dedicated Special Issue of ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems ( TAAS ).

*   **Verifiability**: To what extent does the paper include sufficient information to understand how a proposed approach works and/or how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted? Does the paper support independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions?

### Short papers & Extended Abstract

*   **Novelty**: Is the proposal sufficiently novel with respect to the state-of-the-art? Do the authors discuss related work and clearly identify the gaps their contribution aims to fill?
*   **Soundness of the research plan**: Do the authors present a convincing research plan? Do the authors discuss the limitations and risks of their plan? Does the plan refer to a sound research method(s)? Do the authors clarify their research questions, planned data collection, and data analysis? Do the authors perform a convincing proof-of-concept or some preliminary research steps?
*   **Presentation**: is the paper clearly presented? To what extent can the content of the paper be understood by the SEAMS audience?

### (New) Future of SAS papers

*   **Novelty and ambition**: Is the vision sufficiently surprising or thought-provoking? To what extent does the paper have the potential to excite the community? Is the scope of the proposed idea ambitious enough to potentially bring about a paradigm shift in SEAMS research?
*   **Potential for discussion**: Does the presentation of the paper at SEAMS have potential to encourage discussions or debates among the audience?

## Preparing Your Submission

A paper submission has three components: the paper itself, an Artifact Description Appendix (AD), and an Artifact Evaluation Appendix (AE). The Artifact Description Appendix, or explanation of why there is no artifact description, is mandatory. The Artifact Evaluation Appendix is optional.

Details on how to compile the AD/AE Appendices, including LaTeX templates, can be found on the AD/AE Appendices page.

## Eligibility

Papers that have not previously been published in peer-reviewed venues are eligible for submission to SC. For example, papers pre-posted to arXiv, institutional repositories, and personal websites (but no other peer-reviewed venues) remain eligible for SC submission.

Papers that were published in a workshop are eligible if they have been substantially enhanced (i.e., 30% new material).

## Paper Format

Submissions are limited to 10 2-column pages (U.S. letter – 8.5″x11″), excluding the bibliography, using the ACM proceedings template. Latex users, please use the “sigconf” option (use of the “review” option is recommended but not required). Word authors can use the “Interim Layout”. See the templates here.
*   AD and AE appendices do not count against the 10 pages.
*   Authors of accepted papers may provide supplemental material with their final version of the paper (e.g., additional proofs, videos, or images).

## Reproducibility Initiative

Reproducible science is essential, and SC continues to innovate in this area. AD/AE Appendices will be integrated into the review process, with AD/AE Appendices considered at every stage of paper review. While the Artifact Description Appendix, or explanation of why there is no Artifact Description Appendix, is mandatory, the Artifact Evaluation Appendix is optional.

Learn more about the [Reproducibility Initiative](https://sc25.supercomputing.org/program/papers/reproducibility-initiative/).

## Paper Review Process

Papers are peer-reviewed by a committee of experts. Each paper will have three to four reviews. The peer review process is double-anonymous for the paper and potentially double-open for the Appendices. Appendices reviewers will know the authors’ names but are not required to disclose their names to the authors. Learn more about the SC double-anonymous review policy.

Papers not respecting the submission guidelines will be subject to immediate rejection without review. Examples include papers not respecting the double-blind submission, papers exceeding the page limit, and papers not submitting the AD artifacts.

## Conflict of Interest & Plagiarism

Please be aware of, and adhere to, these SC Conference guidelines regarding potential conflicts of interest and disclosure.

## AI-Generated Text

SC permits the use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants) to help improve the submission text. The authors should verify whether the results are accurate before submission. Authors are completely accountable for the contents of their papers, including content generated by AI tools that could be interpreted as plagiarism or scientific misconduct (e.g., fabrication of facts). AI tools are not eligible for authorship.

The use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text. If you use AI tools, you should include an acknowledgment section to disclose the AI assistance with appropriate references to the sections in the paper, but this acknowledgment section should still abide by the double-anonymous submission guideline (i.e., any funding or author-related information should not be included).

## Scope of the Workshop

The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) community needs data with known ground truth to develop, evaluate, and validate computerized image analytic tools, as well as to facilitate clinical training. Synthetic data are ideally suited for this purpose. Another motivation to generate synthetic data is to improve the generalizability of deep learning and machine learning algorithms that are affected by domain shift issues.

To generate synthetic data, a full range of models underpinning image simulation and synthesis, also referred to as image translation, cross-modality synthesis, image completion, domain adaptation, etc. have been developed over the years:

*   deep learning methods including fully-supervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, unsupervised, transfer, and multi-task learning
*   deep learning model architectures including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), Flows, Transformers, and etc
*   machine learning methods using hand-crafted features
*   detailed mechanistic models (top–down), which incorporate priors on the geometry and physics of image acquisition and formation processes
*   complex spatio-temporal computational models of anatomical variability, organ physiology, and morphological changes in tissues or disease progression
*   applications of synthetic images including improving image quality, segmentation, tracking, detection, registration, and etc.

The goal of the Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging (SASHIMI) workshop is to bring together all those interested in such problems in order to engage in invigorating research, discuss current approaches, and stimulate new ideas and scientific directions in this field. The objectives are to:

*   bring together experts on image synthesis to raise the state of the art
*   hear from invited speakers outside of the MICCAI community, for example in the areas of transfer learning, generative adversarial networks, or variational autoencoders, to cross-fertilize these fields
*   identify challenges and opportunities for further research

SASHIMI also aims to identify the suitable approaches to evaluate the plausibility of synthetic data and to collect benchmark data that could help with the development of future algorithms.

## Topics

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

*   Fundamental methods for image-based biophysical modeling and image synthesis
*   Biophysical and data-driven models of disease progression, organ development, motion and deformation, image formation and acquisition
*   Virtual cell imaging
*   Segmentation/registration across or within modalities to aid the learning of model parameters
*   Imaging protocol harmonization approaches across imaging systems, sites and time points
*   Image synthesis for normalization and spatio-temporal intensity correction
*   Cross modality (PET/MR, PET/CT, CT/MR, etc.) image synthesis
*   Simulation and synthesis from large-scale databases
*   Machine and deep learning techniques in image simulation and synthesis
*   Handling uncertainty and incomplete data via simulation and synthesis techniques
*   Automated techniques for quality assessment of simulations and synthetic images
*   Image synthesis in high dimensional spaces (vectors, tensors, spatio-temporal features, etc.)
*   Evaluation and benchmarking of state of-the-art approaches in simulation and synthesis
*   Normative and annotated datasets for benchmarking and learning models
*   Novel ideas on evaluation metrics and methods in image-based simulation and image synthesis
*   Applications of image synthesis in super resolution imaging and multi/cross-scale regression
*   Applications of image synthesis and simulation in medical image registration and segmentation
*   Applications of image synthesis/simulation in super resolution imaging and multi/cross-scale regression, registration, segmentation, denoising, fusion reconstruction and real-time simulation of biophysical properties
*   Applications of synthesis and simulation to image reconstruction from sparse data or sparse views

## Submission Types

All papers submitted to SASHIMI will be split into two categories:

*   **Method-oriented paper:** The main emphasis during the review process will be put on the novelty, correctness of the presented method, and proper validation of the results. The authors are expected to submit a full-length paper which will be (upon acceptance) included in the conference proceedings.
*   **Application-oriented paper:** The main focus will be put on the novel application of an existing theoretical image synthesis method and the data which the given method is applied to. The data should be described in detail. For new data collected, the collection process should be described (experimental setup, device(s) used, image acquisition parameters, subjects/objects involved, instructions to annotators, methods for quality control). For existing datasets, citations, as well as descriptions if they are not publicly available, should be specified. If public, a link to a downloadable version of the dataset should be included. The authors are expected to submit a full-length paper which will be (upon acceptance) included in the conference proceedings.

The 44th International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability and Security.

Established in 1979 by the European Workshop on Industrial Computer Systems, Technical Committee 7 on Reliability, Safety and Security (EWICS TC7), SafeComp has contributed to the progress of the state-of-the-art in dependable application of computers in safety-related and safety-critical systems.

SafeComp is an annual event covering the state-of-the-art, experience and new trends in the areas of safety, security and reliability of critical computer applications. SafeComp provides ample opportunity to exchange insights and experience on emerging methods, approaches, and practical solutions. It is a single-track conference allowing easy networking.

This 44th edition of SAFECOMP is a unique occasion to explore and debate hot topics of current challenges and solutions for future safety critical systems.

## Theme

Managing safety in an era of a software defined computing continuumFuture societal and industrial systems will be increasingly relying on a digitalized infrastructure, from embedded systems, fog/edge-computing systems, to cloud and communications. Entire systems will also increasingly be software defined and upgradeable. Societal and industrial systems consequently be increasingly relying on such digitalized infrastructures, requiring an even stronger and proactive emphasis on key dependability properties, as emphasized by the SafeComp conferences. The theme for SafeComp 2025 has been chosen to highlight some of the following topics and challenges:

*   Predictability and reliability of cloud and edge computing, and AI components: The corresponding systems yet have to offer dependability properties suitable for critical systems
*   Architectures ensuring safety while enhancing performance
*   Co-design of applications and digital infrastructure to achieve cost-efficient dependability
*   Trustworthy DevOps – reconciling software and safety practices

## Paper Submission Guidelines

The tradition of SAFECOMP is to act as a platform for bringing academic research and industrial needs together. Therefore, industrial contributions and real-world experience reports are explicitly invited. We solicit two types of paper submission (in both cases, up to 14 pages incl. bibliography):

*   Research papers address a research gap and illustrate how the contribution submitted can help improve the state-of-the-art by advancing current knowledge;
*   Practical experience reports / tool descriptions provide new insights and valuable support to practitioners.

Papers exceeding the page limit will be excluded from the review process. All papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the International Programme Committee. Papers must not have been previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Submissions are limited to **10 2-column pages** (U.S. letter – 8.5″x11″), excluding the bibliography, using the ACM proceedings template. Latex users, please use the “sigconf” option (use of the “review” option is recommended but not required). Word authors can use the “Interim Layout”. See the templates [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
*   An **Artifact Description Appendix (AD)** is mandatory for all papers submitted to SC. An **Artifact Evaluation Appendix (AE)** is optional. AD and AE appendices do not count against the 10 pages.
*   Papers that have not previously been published in peer-reviewed venues are eligible for submission to SC. For example, papers pre-posted to arXiv, institutional repositories, and personal websites (but no other peer-reviewed venues) remain eligible for SC submission.
*   Papers that were published in a workshop are eligible if they have been substantially enhanced (i.e., 30% new material).

## Areas/Tracks

Submissions will be considered on any topic related to high performance computing within the areas below. Authors must indicate a primary area from the choices on the submissions form and are strongly encouraged to indicate a secondary area.

*   Algorithms
*   Applications
*   Architecture & Networks
*   Data Analytics, Visualization, & Storage
*   HPC for Machine Learning
*   Performance Measurement, Modeling, & Tools
*   Post-Moore Computing
*   Programming Frameworks
*   State of the Practice
*   System Software & Cloud Computing

Small-scale studies – including single-node studies – are welcome as long as the paper clearly conveys the work’s contribution to high performance computing.

## Reproducibility Initiative

Reproducible science is essential, and SC continues to innovate in this area. AD/AE Appendices will be integrated into the review process, with AD/AE Appendices considered at every stage of paper review. While the Artifact Description Appendix, or explanation of why there is no Artifact Description Appendix, is mandatory, the Artifact Evaluation Appendix is optional.

Learn more about the [Reproducibility Initiative](https://sc25.supercomputing.org/program/papers/reproducibility-initiative/).

## Paper Review Process

Papers are peer-reviewed by a committee of experts. Each paper will have three to four reviews. The peer review process is double-anonymous for the paper and potentially double-open for the Appendices. Appendices reviewers will know the authors’ names but are not required to disclose their names to the authors.

Papers not respecting the submission guidelines will be subject to immediate rejection without review. Examples include papers not respecting the double-blind submission, papers exceeding the page limit, and papers not submitting the AD artifacts.

## AI-Generated Text

SC permits the use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants) to help improve the submission text. The authors should verify whether the results are accurate before submission. Authors are completely accountable for the contents of their papers, including content generated by AI tools that could be interpreted as plagiarism or scientific misconduct (e.g., fabrication of facts). AI tools are not eligible for authorship.

The use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text shall have a citation to the AI system used to generate the text. If you use AI tools, you should include an acknowledgment section to disclose the AI assistance with appropriate references to the sections in the paper, but this acknowledgment section should still abide by the double-anonymous submission guideline (i.e., any funding or author-related information should not be included).

## Conflict of Interest & Plagiarism

Please be aware of, and adhere to, these SC Conference guidelines regarding potential conflicts of interest and disclosure. Please review the [ACM guidelines on identifying plagiarism](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism).

## Double-Anonymous Review

Authors should write their paper so as not to disclose their identity or the identities of their co-authors. The following guidelines are best practices for anonymizing a submission.
