## Author Guidelines

All types of papers can be submitted as either **long (8 pages AAAI style plus one page of references) or short (4 pages plus one page of references)**. Whether the paper is long or short must be indicated at submission time.

Papers submitted to ICAPS 2025 may not be submitted to other conferences or journals during the ICAPS 2025 review period, nor may they be already under review, accepted, or published in other conferences or journals.

The format of ICAPS 2025 will be in-person. As such, we expect at least one author of each accepted paper to register for the conference and present their work in person, unless exceptional circumstances prevent this.

## Use of Generative AI

Papers that include text generated from an LLM are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. We stress that this policy DOES NOT prohibit authors from using these technologies for editing or polishing author-written text.

Authors assume full responsibility for the content of submitted work, including checking for plagiarism and authenticity of all text.

## Ethical / Societal Impact

Authors are encouraged to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences.

## Best Paper Awards and Journal Fast Track

Following the ICAPS tradition, we will award the best non-student and student papers. These papers may also receive an invitation to submit an extended version to a top AI journal.

## Submission Instructions

All submissions will be made electronically via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=icaps-conference.org/ICAPS/2025/Conference).
Submitted papers must be anonymous for double-blind reviewing, must adhere to the page limits of the relevant submission type (long or short), and must follow the author kit instructions for formatting. 

Find the author kit [following this link](/files/icaps2025-author-kit.zip).

Failure to comply with the submission instructions above will result in desk rejection.

Double-blind requirements are satisfied whenever authors omit their names and institutions, refer to prior work by themselves or others in the third person, and ensure that the acknowledgement notices or ethics statements do not include information that may identify them.

The 52nd EATCS International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP) will take place in **Aarhus, Denmark, July 8-11, 2025**.

ICALP is the main conference and annual meeting of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS).

The conference website is [https://conferences.au.dk/icalp2025](https://conferences.au.dk/icalp2025).

## Important Dates

*   **Submissions:** February 8, 2025 (anywhere on Earth)
*   **Rebuttal:** March 21-24, 2025
*   **Author notification:** April 14, 2025
*   **Camera-ready version:** April 28, 2025
*   **Early registration:** To be announced
*   **Conference:** July 8-11, 2025 (Workshops on July 7)

Deadlines are firm; late submissions will not be considered.

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions to ICALP 2025 use the HotCRP system:

*   Submission server Track A: [icalp25-a.hotcrp.com](https://icalp25-a.hotcrp.com)
*   Submission server Track B: [icalp25-b.hotcrp.com](https://icalp25-b.hotcrp.com)

### Guidelines:

1.  Papers must present original research on the theory of computer science. No prior publication and no simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed. Authors are encouraged to also make full versions of their submissions freely accessible in an on-line repository such as ArXiv, HAL, ECCC.

2.  Submissions take the form of an extended abstract of no more than 15 pages, excluding references and a clearly labelled appendix. The appendix may consist either of omitted proofs or of a full version of the submission, and it will be read at the discretion of program committee members. The use of the LIPIcs document class is an option, but not required. The extended abstract has to present the merits of the paper and its main contributions clearly, and describe the key concepts and technical ideas used to obtain the results. Submissions must provide the proofs which can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be verified.

3.  Submissions are anonymous. The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).

    The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, and not to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas.

4.  Submissions authored or co-authored by members of the program committee are allowed.

5.  The submissions are done via HotCRP to the appropriate track of the conference. The use of pdflatex or similar pdf generating tools is mandatory and the page limit is strict (see point 2.) Papers that deviate significantly from these requirements risk rejection without consideration of merit.

6.  During the rebuttal phase, authors will have from March 21-24, 2025 the opportunity to view and respond to initial reviews. Further instructions will be sent to authors of submitted papers before that time.

7.  At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register for the conference, and all talks are in-person. In exceptional cases, there may be support for remotely presenting a talk.

8.  Papers authored only by students should be marked as such upon submission in order to be eligible for the best student paper awards of the track.

### Formatting

The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on A4 or letter-size paper.

Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

The 16th International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC’25) will be held in **Campinas, Brazil, from June 23 to 27, 2025.** It welcomes the submission of full papers on related topics.

Computational Creativity (CC) is a discipline with its roots in scientific disciplines such as Artificial Intelligence, Cognitive Science, Engineering, Design, Psychology, and Philosophy.

The International Conference on Computational Creativity (ICCC) is an annual conference that welcomes papers on different aspects of CC, on systems that exhibit varying degrees of creative autonomy, on systems that act as creative partners for human creators, on frameworks that offer greater clarity or computational felicity for thinking about machine (and human) creativity, on methodologies for building or evaluating CC systems, on approaches to teaching CC in schools and universities or to promoting societal uptake of CC as a field and as a technology, and so on.

## Topics

Original research contributions are solicited in all areas related to Computational Creativity research and practice, including, but not limited to:

*   Applications of Computational Creativity
*   Human-Machine Co-Creativity
*   Computational Creativity Evaluation
*   Social Models
*   Computational Paradigms
*   Interdisciplinary Perspectives
*   Data and Creativity
*   Societal Impact
*   Psychological Factors
*   Provocations

A note on generative AI models: while the study of generative AI models is both welcomed and encouraged, such models and their application must be properly situated in the CC literature and evaluated according to acceptable practices in the field. Papers that fail to do this are unlikely to be reviewed favorably.

## Paper Types

We welcome the submission of five different types of full papers. During your submission, please indicate the category in which your paper best fits:

*   Technical papers
*   System or Resource description papers
*   Study papers
*   Cultural application papers
*   Position papers

ICCC is a conference that emphasizes the empirical and theoretical evaluation of technical systems, results, and outcomes, in an ethical and scientific fashion.

All submissions will be reviewed in terms of quality, impact, and relevance to the area of Computational Creativity.

## Presentation

To be included in the proceedings, each paper must be presented at the conference by one of the authors. This implies that at least one author will have to register and will have to participate live in the session in which their paper is presented, including the designated question-and-answer period.

## Submission Instructions

This year the submission process has two stages: initial submission of a title and abstract, and subsequent submission of the full paper a week later.

*   Recommended length for the abstract is 100–200 words.
*   The full paper page limit is 8 pages + up to 2 pages of references.
*   Papers will be reviewed in a double-blind fashion, which necessitates that authors take appropriate steps to remain anonymous.
*   To be considered, papers must be submitted as a PDF document formatted according to ICCC style (which is similar to AAAI and IJCAI formats).
*   You can download the updated ICCC’25 LaTeX template [here](https://computationalcreativity.net/ICCC-author-kit-2022.zip) and Word template [here](https://computationalcreativity.net/ICCC-author-kit-Word.zip).
*   Submit your abstract via the EasyChair system [here](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccc202501). You are required to fill out author(s) information, a title, abstract, and keywords.

## Submission Details

Paper submissions must be made through the online submission system at the IEEE ICCAD website.

Regular papers will be reviewed as finished papers; preliminary submissions will be at a disadvantage. Research papers with open-source software are highly encouraged where the software will be made publicly available (via GitHub or similar) with the camera-ready version if the paper has been accepted. For protecting the authors’ identities in the double-blind review process, please do not include direct link to the non-anonymized software but indicate the open-source contribution on a textural basis only. Authors wanting to share GitHub repositories may want to look into using anonymous.4open.science which is an open-source tool that helps you to quickly double-blind your repository.

Authors are asked to submit their work in two stages. In stage one (abstract submission), a title, abstract, and a list of all co-authors must be submitted via the ICCAD web submission site. In stage two (paper submission), the paper itself is submitted whereby the submitted abstract of stage one can still be modified. Authors are responsible for declaring COIs, ensuring that their paper submission meets all guidelines, and that the PDF is readable.

## Deadlines

*   **Abstract Submission Deadline:** April 14, 2025 at 23:59 AOE
*   **Paper Submission Deadline:** April 21, 2025 at 23:59 AOE
*   **Proposal Submission Deadline for Workshops, Tutorials, Special Sessions, Panels:** April 21, 2025

*   **Notification for Regular Papers:** June 30, 2025
*   **Camera-Ready Paper Submission:** August 14, 2025
*   **Author Registration Deadline:** August 14, 2025

## Regular Paper Submissions

*   All papers must be in PDF format only, with savable text and embedded fonts in included graphics.
*   Each paper must be no more than 8 pages (including the abstract, figures and tables), double-columned, 9pt or 10pt font. One page of references is allowed, which does not count towards this 8-page limitation.
*   ICCAD follows a double-blind review policy. Your submission must not include information that serves to identify the authors of the manuscript, such as name(s) or affiliation(s) of the author(s), anywhere in the manuscript, abstract, or in the embedded PDF data. References and bibliographic citations to the authors’ own published works or affiliations should be made in the third person.
*   Submissions of workshop papers without archived proceedings (or where the authors chose not to have their paper appear in the archived proceedings) or pre-prints, e.g., published on arXiv are allowed. Note, however, that the authors are expected to follow all reasonable efforts to ensure that the submission is compliant with the double-blind review process.
*   Submissions not adhering to these rules or determined to be previously published or simultaneously submitted to another conference, or journal, will be summarily rejected.

## Important

Final camera-ready versions must be identical to the submitted papers with the following exceptions: inclusion of author names/affiliation, correction of identified errors, addressing reviewer demanded changes. No other modifications of any kind are allowed including modification of title, change of the author list, reformatting, restyling, rephrasing, removing figures/results/text, etc. The TPC Chairs reserve the right to finally reject any manuscripts not adhering to these rules.

## Templates

Paper templates are available at the ICCAD website and authors are recommended to format their papers based on the IEEE template.

## Notification of Acceptance

Authors will be notified of acceptance on or before, June 30, 2025. Final paper guidelines will be sent at that time.

## Proceedings

The deadline for final camera-ready papers is August 14, 2025. Accepted regular papers or invited papers are allowed six pages plus one page of references in the conference proceedings free of charge. Each additional page (except references) beyond six pages is subject to the page charge at $150.00 per page up to the eight-page plus one page of references. IEEE will hold the copyright for ICCAD 2025 proceedings. Authors of accepted papers must sign an IEEE copyright release form for their paper.

## Conference Registration

At least one author per accepted regular paper or invited paper must be registered to the conference by August 14, 2025. Failure to register will result in your paper being removed from the conference proceedings. IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution after the conference (e.g., removal from the official proceedings) if the paper is not presented at the conference.

## Awards

*   **William J. McCalla IEEE ICCAD Best Paper Award:** Two papers from this year’s ICCAD conference will receive this prestigious award.

## Paper Types and Publication

| Submission Type | Published in LNCS | Pages |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----- |
| Full Paper      | ✓               | 12-15 |
| Short Paper     | ✓               | 6-8   |
| Abstract        | —               | 2     |

ICCS was co-organized with the Workshops on Computational Science. You can submit your paper to either the Main Conference or any of the Workshops via the same EasyChair link.

*   ICCS and WCS papers are published in separate proceedings (LNCS publication for Main Conference and different LNCS publication for Workshops).
*   The only difference between Full and Short papers is the number of accepted pages.

The ""Abstract Only"" option caters to researchers who can only publish in specific journals or work for companies in circumstances such that they cannot publish at all but still want to present their work and discuss it with their peers at ICCS. In the “Abstract Only” option, a short abstract is included in the conference program, but not in LNCS.

After the conference, the best papers were to be invited for a special issue of the *Journal of Computational Science* (Impact Factor: 3.1)

## Instructions for Authors

The manuscripts of up to 15 pages, written in English and formatted according to the Springer LNCS templates, should be submitted electronically via [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iccs2026).

The most recent versions of the Templates are available for download from this [link](https://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2026/templates-forms/). The LaTeX2e Proceedings Templates are also available in the scientific authoring platform [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

Please also make sure to follow Springer’s [authors’ guidelines](https://resource-cms.springernature.com/springer-cms/rest/v1/content/19242230/data/v12), as well as Springer’s [Book Authors’ Code of Conduct](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct).

Papers must be based on unpublished original work and must be submitted to ICCS only. Submission implies the willingness of at least one of the authors to register and present the paper.

ICCS lays crucial emphasis on the explicit relevance of submitted contributions to Computational Science. All submissions to the conference, whether to the main conference or to the workshops, were evaluated for this relevance (through a mandatory field in the submission form).

*   **Page limit:** Research and EAB papers must not exceed 12 pages, excluding references and the AI-generated content acknowledgement.
*   **Duplicate submissions:** A paper submitted to ICDE 2026 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire time it is under consideration for ICDE 2026, and it must be substantially different from any previously published work.
*   **Novelty requirement:** A paper submitted to ICDE 2026 must present original work not described in any prior publication that is more than 4 double-column pages in length.
*   **Max submissions per author:** An author may submit a maximum of 6 papers to the research track (regular and EAB papers) across both submission rounds.
*   **1-year wait:** Papers rejected from ICDE cannot be submitted again to ICDE until a full year has passed from the time of their last submission.
*   **Single-blind anonymity:** Submissions will be reviewed in a single-blind manner.
*   **No title/author change:** After a paper is accepted, neither the set of authors nor the title of the paper can be changed.
*   **Special issue:** The best papers (as judged by the ICDE 2026 PC) will be selected for submission as an extended version to be published in the IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE).
*   **Mandatory conference presentation:** IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution (e.g., remove it from IEEE Xplore) after the conference if none of the authors attend the conference and present their paper.

## Reviewing Process

ICDE 2026 papers will be reviewed by at least 3 reviewers.

## Supplemental Material

Authors are expected to submit supplemental material, such as code, data, and other implementation artifacts used to produce the results reported in this submission.

Experiment, Analysis, and Benchmark papers MUST provide all the artifacts required to reproduce the results.

Supplemental material should be provided through a URL pointing to standard, openly accessible file sharing services with well-understood privacy policies (e.g., a public GitHub repo).

## Guidelines for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Generated Content

Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of a submission to ICDE 2026.

The use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in an ""AI-Generated Content Acknowledgement"" section placed just before the References. This section does not count toward the page limit.

## Inclusions and Diversity in Writing

Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing.

## Conflict of Interest

The onus for correctly declaring COIs rests with the authors who must submit their complete set of COIs for a submission to be considered for review.

## Desk Rejection Policy

ICDE research track submissions that don’t meet the following requirements will be rejected without review (desk-reject).

*   Formatting violations
*   COI violations
*   Relevance mismatch (out-of-scope)

The responsibility rests with the authors to ensure their paper meets all submission requirements."

## Paper Submission

There is both a standard conference paper track and a journal track at ICDAR 2025. Details regarding the journal track may be found in a separate [Call for Journal Track](/submission/call-for-journal-track).

Reviewing for conference papers will be double blind. Authors should not include their names, affiliations, or acknowledgements in submitted manuscripts, and should ensure that their identity is not revealed indirectly by citing their earlier work in the third person.

Papers should be formatted according to the instructions and style files provided by Springer. The LaTeX template for LNCS can be downloaded [here](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). It is also available on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

Papers are limited to **15 pages** (not including references). Papers that do not meet these requirements will be desk rejected. The accepted papers for ICDAR 2025 will be presented in Oral or Poster presentation forms. All papers should be submitted electronically via the online submission form [here](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICDAR2025).

No changes in paper authorship will be permitted after a paper has been submitted.

No-show papers (papers not presented at the conference in person by one of the authors) will not be eligible for a best paper award, and the author(s) of the paper will not receive a conference participation certificate. If an author is unable to attend in person due to an unsuccessful visa application or other insurmountable difficulties, they should immediately contact the conference organizers and the Program Chairs who will determine whether an online presentation can be made instead. In any case, whether the presentation is in person or online, authors must obey the same rules regarding the conference registration process.

In addition, there is also iaria-lite (not bound to pdflatex+biblatex+biber, but compatible with any TeX stack; thus, it cannot provide the IARIA citation formattings, but only the titlepage and content-related IARIA formatting rules). Based on the iaria package, there is a minimal working example as Overleaf template. When you are using the LaTeX templates, please still adhere to the additional editorial rules.

*   Slides-based contributions can use the corporate/university format and style.

Your paper should also comply with the additional editorial rules.

In 2026, the joint EDBT/ICDT conference will be held in Tampere, Finland, from March 24 to March 27.","# ICDT 2026 - Call for Papers

ICDT is a series of international scientific conferences on research of data management theory ([https://databasetheory.org/icdt-pages](https://databasetheory.org/icdt-pages)). Since 2009, it is annually and jointly held with EDBT (Extending DB Technology).

The 29th edition of ICDT, in 2026, is planned to take place in **Tampere, Finland**.

## Topics of Interest

We welcome research papers on every topic related to the principles and theory of data management, provided that there is a clear connection to foundational aspects. This includes, for example, articles on ""classical"" data management topics such as:

*   The theoretical investigation of various aspects of underlying data management systems (e.g., Indexes, Concurrency and recovery, Distributed and parallel databases, Cloud computing, Privacy and security, Graph databases, Data streams and sketching, Data-centric (business) process management and workflows, Data and knowledge integration and exchange, Data provenance, Views, Data warehouses, Domain-specific databases - multimedia, scientific, spatial, temporal, text data, ...),
*   The design and study of data models and query languages,
*   The development and analysis of algorithms for data management,

but also includes papers exploring existing or identifying new connections between data management and other areas, such as the areas of: knowledge representation, semantic web, web services, information retrieval and data mining, machine learning/AI, distributed computing, theoretical computer science.

In all of the above, a clear emphasis on foundational aspects is expected. You may want to check [https://dblp.org/db/conf/icdt/index.html](https://dblp.org/db/conf/icdt/index.html) to get an overview of previous editions of ICDT.

The Program Committee reserves the right to desk reject a submission when it is regarded to be out of scope.

## Submission Cycles and Dates

ICDT will have two submission cycles for 2026, with deadlines as follows:

All times are Anywhere on Earth (UTC + 12)

**ICDT Submission Cycle 1**

*   **March 13, 2025:** Abstract submission
*   **March 20, 2025:** Paper submission
*   **June 1, 2025:** Notification

**ICDT Submission Cycle 2**

*   **September 3, 2025:** Abstract submission
*   **September 10, 2025:** Paper submission
*   **December 1, 2025:** Notification

Papers rejected in the first submission cycle cannot be submitted to the second submission cycle unless explicitly requested by the reviewers.

## Tracks

1.  **Regular Research Papers** (15 pages, anonymized)

The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere, including the proceedings of other symposia or workshops. Papers must be at most 15 pages, excluding references. Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, which, however, will be read at the discretion of the program committee (online appendices are not allowed). Papers not conforming to these requirements may be rejected without further consideration.

2.  **Database Theory in Action** (4 pages, non-anonymized)

To broaden the scope of ICDT and showcase the impact of database theory, ICDT 2026 includes again a ""Database Theory in Action"" track that calls for short papers illustrating interesting applications of database theory in other domains or in solving real-world problems. These papers will be 4 pages + references, and can be based on a previously published paper at another venue. In particular, we invite papers that demonstrate novel and important connections between database theory and neighboring communities such as Database Systems, Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation, Distributed Computing, and Industry. At the discretion of the program committee, there may be invited papers to this track as well. The title of the papers submitted to this track must start with ""Database Theory in Action:"". These papers should also include clear pointers to all relevant previous publications, websites, tools, repositories, etc.

## Submission Instructions

All submissions will be electronic via EasyChair. Link: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icdt2026](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icdt2026)

Papers must be written in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee to assess their merits. Papers must be submitted as PDF documents, using the LIPIcs style ([http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors](http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors)).

The proceedings will appear in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series, based at Schloss Dagstuhl. This guarantees that the proceedings will be available online and free of charge, while the authors retain the rights over their work.

At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register at the conference and to present the paper.

## Anonymous Submission

From 2024, ICDT has adopted anonymous submission (only for regular track papers; submissions for the ""database theory in action"" track should not be anonymous), in line with other leading conferences in the database community such as SIGMOD and PODS. The intent of anonymous submission is to ensure that the identity of the authors is not presented to the reviewers during the review process. Specifically, submitted papers must not list authors or affiliations, and must not include acknowledgments to funding sources, or other colleagues or collaborators. References to the authors' own prior work must not be distinguished from other references. Where this is not possible (for instance, when referring to a specific system to which the authors have privileged access), anonymized citations are permissible. For more background on the motivation for anonymous submissions, and the mechanisms to achieve it, please consult [Snodgrass, 2007] [https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~rts/pubs/TODS07.pdf](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~rts/pubs/TODS07.pdf)

Simultaneously, the authors may make their submissions available to the community via pre-print services such as ArXiv and through talks. We do require that work is not labeled as ""under submission at ICDT"" or indicates that it is under review, but otherwise place no restrictions on sharing results. This does not conflict with the anonymous submission requirement.

## Awards

An award will be given to the **Best Paper**. Also, an award will be given to the **Best Newcomer Paper** written by newcomers to the field of database theory. The latter award will preferentially be given to a paper written only by students; in that case the award will be called **Best Student-Paper Award**. The program committee reserves the following rights: not to give any award; to split an award among several papers; and to define the notion of a newcomer. Following a recent decision by the ICDT council, papers authored or co-authored by program committee members may be eligible for the best paper award, in which case the programme committee will take care to follow a selection procedure that avoids any conflicts of interest.

Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting can be found at the Springer website (more details here). We encourage authors to add line numbers to their submissions. This can be done, for example, using the lineno LaTeX package.

Even though there will be no artifact evaluation at ICFEM this year, we encourage authors to upload their artifacts to an archive such as Zenodo or GitHub to ensure reproducibility and availability.

### Main Conference Paper

Submissions should not exceed 16 pages (excluding references and appendix) in Springer's LNCS format. Each submission will undergo a rigorous single-blind peer-review process by at least three experts.

Invited extended versions of selected papers will be recommended to a special issue of Formal Aspects of Computing after the conference proceedings.

After the conference, the best software linked to a paper (typically any paper with a dedicated implementation) will be recommended to a special issue of the Software track of Elsevier's Science of Computer Programming journal.

### Journal-First Presentations

Journal-first presentations invite interested researchers to submit a short proposal for their recently published journal articles, providing the authors an opportunity to speak directly to the community.

When submitting: Please select the ICFEM 2025 Journal First Track in the submission system.

### Doctoral Symposium

The Doctoral Symposium seeks students' submissions in two categories:

## Doctoral Symposium Paper Submission

The ICFEM Doctoral Symposium is an international forum for PhD students studying all areas related to formal methods for software, hardware and system development.

We seek submissions from PhD students who have either determined the direction of their thesis research, but who still have substantial work to complete; or PhD student participants who are in the early stages of their dissertations.

Submissions to the Doctoral Symposium should include: Title of the research, the author name (single name) and affiliation; Context and motivation; Problem statement and related work; Proposed solutions and current research efforts, their significance, methodology, results and analysis, and future work. The paper should be prepared using the LNCS format and submitted in PDF format via EasyChair.

We accept two types of submissions:

*   2-page extended abstracts which will not be included in the ICFEM proceedings; and
*   6-page papers which will be published in the LNCS volume of Springer as part of the main ICFEM proceedings.

Authors with accepted submissions are expected to attend the Doctoral Symposium in person to present their work. A discounted registration fee for Doctoral Symposium participants will be announced later."

The conference aims to provide a forum for researchers and developers to discuss the latest work on functional programming, covering design, implementations, principles, and uses.","# ICFP 2025: Call for Papers

The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (**ICFP**) is seeking original papers on the art and science of functional programming. ICFP 2025 will take place in **Singapore from Sun 12 - Sat 18 October 2025**, co-located with [SPLASH](https://2025.splashcon.org/) as part of [ICFP/SPLASH 2025](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icfp-splash-2025).

Submissions are invited on all topics from principles to practice, from foundations to features, and from abstraction to application. The scope includes all languages that encourage functional programming, including both purely applicative and imperative languages, as well as languages with objects, concurrency, or parallelism.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

*   **Language Design:** concurrency, parallelism, and distribution; modularity; components and composition; meta-programming; macros; pattern matching; type systems; type inference; dependent types; effect types; gradual types; refinement types; session types; interoperability; domain-specific languages; imperative programming; object-oriented programming; logic programming; probabilistic programming; reactive programming; generic programming; bidirectional programming.
*   **Implementation:** abstract machines; virtual machines; interpretation; compilation; compile-time and run-time optimisation; garbage collection and memory management; runtime systems; multi-threading; exploiting parallel hardware; interfaces to foreign functions, services, components, or low-level machine resources.
*   **Software-Development Techniques:** algorithms and data structures; design patterns; specification; verification; validation; proof assistants; debugging; testing; tracing; profiling; build systems; program synthesis.
*   **Foundations:** formal semantics; lambda calculus; program equivalence; rewriting; type theory; logic; category theory; computational effects; continuations; control; state; names and binding; program verification.
*   **Analysis and Transformation:** control flow; data flow; abstract interpretation; partial evaluation; program calculation.
*   **Applications:** symbolic computing; formal-methods tools; artificial intelligence; systems programming; distributed systems and web programming; hardware design; databases; scientific and numerical computing; graphical user interfaces; graphics and multimedia; GPU programming; scripting; system administration; security.
*   **Education:** teaching introductory programming; mathematical proof; algebra.

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions will be evaluated according to their relevance, correctness, significance, originality, and clarity. Each submission should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work. The technical content should be accessible to a broad audience.

PACMPL issue ICFP 2025 also welcomes submissions in two separate categories — Functional Pearls and Experience Reports — that must be marked as such when submitted and that need not report original research results. Detailed guidelines on both categories are given at the end of this call.

In an effort to achieve a balanced, diverse program, each author may be listed as a (co)author on a maximum of four submissions.

Authors who require financial support to attend the conference can apply for PAC funding ([http://www.sigplan.org/PAC/](http://www.sigplan.org/PAC/)).

The General Chair and PC Chair may not submit papers. PC members (other than the PC Chair) may submit papers.

## Full Double-Blind Reviewing Process

ICFP 2025 will use a full double-blind reviewing process. This means that identities of authors will not be made visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made, and then only for the conditionally-accepted papers. The use of full double-blind reviewing has several consequences for authors.

Authors must omit their names and institutions from their paper submissions. In addition, references to authors’ own prior work should be in the third person.

Links to supplementary material on external websites are not permitted.

## Preparation of submissions

The deadline for submissions is **Thursday, 27 February, 2025**, Anywhere on Earth.

Submissions must be in PDF format, printable in black and white on US Letter sized paper and interpretable by common PDF tools. All submissions must adhere to the “ACM Small” template that is available (in both LaTeX and Word formats) from [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions).

There is a limit of **25 pages** for a full paper or Functional Pearl and **12 pages** for an Experience Report; in either case, the bibliography and an optional clearly marked appendix will not be counted against these limits. Submissions that exceed the page limits or, for other reasons, do not meet the requirements for formatting, will be summarily rejected.

Submissions will be accepted at [https://icfp25.hotcrp.com/](https://icfp25.hotcrp.com/)

## Special Categories of Papers

In addition to research papers, PACMPL issue ICFP solicits two kinds of papers that do not require original research contributions: **Functional Pearls**, which are full papers, and **Experience Reports**, which are limited to half the length of a full paper.

## Artifact Evaluation

Authors of papers that are conditionally accepted in the first phase of the review process will be encouraged (but not required) to submit supporting materials for Artifact Evaluation.

## Contact Information

Please contact the Program Chair if you have questions or are concerned about the appropriateness of a topic.
