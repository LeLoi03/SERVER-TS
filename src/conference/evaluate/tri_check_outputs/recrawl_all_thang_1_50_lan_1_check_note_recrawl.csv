## Submission Guidelines

ACISP 2025 will have two rounds of submission.

*   All the submissions must be original, unpublished, and not submitted to another conference or journal for consideration of publication.
*   Submissions must be fully anonymous with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgements, or obvious references.
*   Submissions must be written in English and have at most 20 pages including bibliography using Springer's LNCS package with no changes to the style.
*   Submissions can exceed 20 pages, but any content beyond 20 pages should be placed in the Appendix. Papers should be sufficiently intelligible and self-contained without appendices so that PC members can make decisions without reading appendices.
*   Submissions not meeting the submission guidelines risk rejection regardless of their merits.
*   The proceedings will be published by Springer-Verlag as a volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Accepted papers will be limited to 20 pages (including bibliography and appendices) in LNCS format.

Papers submitted directly to Round 2 will either be accepted or rejected.

## Artifact Evaluation

ESOP 2026 will have a post-paper-acceptance voluntary artifact evaluation. Authors will be encouraged to submit artifacts for evaluation after paper notification. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.

Detailed information will be announced later.

EvoApplications, the International Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation (formerly known as EvoWorkshops), invites high-quality contributions for its 29th edition, which will be held as part of the EvoStar 2026 event. It will be co-located with EuroGP, EvoCOP, and EvoMUSART.

The aim of EvoApplications is to create a friendly environment that can lead to the establishment or strengthening of scientific collaborations and exchanges among attendees.

EvoApplications solicits high-quality original research papers (including significant work-in-progress) on any aspect of applications of Evolutionary Computation, both to real-world or methodological contexts in which Evolutionary Computation can contribute to pushing the limits of the state of the art.

Researchers interested in proposing a special session are invited to do so. Please, read our [Call for Special Sessions](https://www.evostar.org/2026/call-for-evoapplications-special-sessions/).

The Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging (SASHIMI) workshop, a MICCAI 2025 Workshop, is jointly organized with the SynthRAD2025 Challenge ([https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/](https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/)) and held in conjunction with MICCAI 2025 ([https://conferences.miccai.org/2025/en/](https://conferences.miccai.org/2025/en/)). Previous SASHIMI proceedings are available on [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/conference/sashimi).

## About SASHIMI

The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) community needs data with known ground truth to develop, evaluate, and validate computerized image analytic tools, as well as to facilitate clinical training. Synthetic data are ideally suited for this purpose. Another motivation to generate synthetic data is to improve the generalizability of deep learning and machine learning algorithms that are affected by domain shift issues.

The goal of the Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging (SASHIMI) workshop is to bring together all those interested in such problems in order to engage in invigorating research, discuss current approaches, and stimulate new ideas and scientific directions in this field.

## Objectives

The objectives are to:

1.  Bring together experts on image synthesis to raise the state of the art.
2.  Hear from invited speakers outside of the MICCAI community, for example in the areas of transfer learning, generative adversarial networks, or variational autoencoders, to cross-fertilize these fields.
3.  Identify challenges and opportunities for further research.
4.  Identify the suitable approaches to evaluate the plausibility of synthetic data and to collect benchmark data that could help with the development of future algorithms.

## Topics

The workshop focuses on models underpinning image simulation and synthesis, including:

*   Deep learning methods (fully-supervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, unsupervised, transfer, and multi-task learning)
*   Deep learning model architectures (Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), Flows, Transformers, etc.)
*   Machine learning methods using hand-crafted features
*   Detailed mechanistic models (top–down)
*   Complex spatio-temporal computational models of anatomical variability, organ physiology, and morphological changes in tissues or disease progression
*   Applications of synthetic images (improving image quality, segmentation, tracking, detection, registration, etc.)

## Keynote Speaker

**Can Zhao**, senior research scientist at NVIDIA

*   Keynote Title: **MAISI: A Foundation Model for Accelerated, Anatomy-Aware High-Resolution 3D CT Synthesis** ([https://research.nvidia.com/person/can-zhao](https://research.nvidia.com/person/can-zhao))

## SynthRAD2025 Challenge

SASHIMI 2025 will host the SynthRAD2025 Challenge ([https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/](https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/)). The challenge focuses on synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT to enable MRI-only radiation therapy and adaptive MRI- or CBCT-based radiotherapy. Participants will develop AI models using a large multi-center dataset. The winning teams will present their solution at SASHIMI 2025.
