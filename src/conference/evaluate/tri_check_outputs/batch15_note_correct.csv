NSPW 2025 invites three types of submissions:

1.  **Regular submissions:** Present a new approach (paradigm) to a security problem or critique existing approaches. While regular submissions may present research results, the change in approach should be the focus.
2.  **Theme Submissions:** Focused on “**Trusting**” and should explain the connection with the theme in the justification statement. They follow the format of a regular submission.
3.  **Implementation Submissions:** Explore implementing previous NSPW submissions. These submissions should clearly cite which previous work(s) is being referenced and how the current submission extends beyond the original scope.

The theme for NSPW 2025 is **Trusting**.

## Relevant Topics for the Theme ""Trusting""

*   Novel paradigms for conceptualising trust and trusting in computer security
*   Trust decisions in a world of deepfakes and misinformation
*   Detection of breach of trust, intrusion and misinformation
*   Trust boundaries and threat modeling
*   Trust in changing threat landscapes and technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence
*   Trust evaluation
*   Social configuration of trust and mistrust in organisations
*   Trust and mistrust as methodological problems in studies of computer security

## Submission Instructions

*   **Confidentiality:** All submissions are treated as confidential.
*   **Prior Publication:** NSPW does not accept previously published or concurrently submitted papers.
*   **Due Date:** **April 25, 2025, 11:59 PM AoE**
*   **Response Date:** May 30, 2025
*   **Format:** PDF format, **6-15 pages**, ACM “sigconf” formatting.
*   **Submission System:** Submit through EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=nspw2025)

### Special Submission Instructions

Each paper requires two separate EasyChair submissions:

1.  **Cover page:** with authors’ names, affiliation, and the participation statement.
2.  **Anonymous PDF paper:** with a justification statement.

The **participation statement** must specify which author(s) will attend upon acceptance/invitation, that all authors will engage in good faith with the feedback given in the review and revision periods, and that all authors will abide by the NSPW code of conduct.

The **justification statement** (clearly marked as part of the PDF submission) briefly explains why the submission is appropriate for NSPW and the chosen submission category. The justification statement will not appear in the final publication.

To support double-blind reviewing, the cover page should not be part of the PDF submission but will be submitted separately on EasyChair. Submissions that do not include both statements risk rejection without review. In addition, submissions should blind author identity where possible (e.g., using the LaTeX `anonymous=true` option and avoiding self-referencing).

Organizers and Program Committee members are allowed to submit papers, but will not be involved in evaluating their papers.

## Publication

NSPW'25 papers will be published in the International Conference Proceedings Series of the ACM Digital Library. Note: ACM has introduced a new open access publishing model for the International Conference Proceedings Series (ICPS). Authors based at institutions that are not yet part of the ACM Open program and do not qualify for a waiver will be required to pay an article processing charge (APC) to publish their ICPS article in the ACM Digital Library. To determine whether or not an APC will be applicable to your article, please follow the detailed guidance [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/icps/author-guidance).

## Social Contract and Code of Conduct

*   Acceptance to the workshop is conditional on engagement with the revision, presentation, and discussion process.
*   All participants must commit to a “social contract”: no one arrives late, no one leaves early, no electronic distractions (including laptops, tablets, and mobile devices), attend all sessions of the 2.5-day program, share meals in a group setting, and comply with the code of conduct.
*   The workshop is preceded by an evening reception.
*   NSPW is making arrangements for (some) child care during the event. If interested, please email [general-chairs@nspw.org](mailto:general-chairs@nspw.org) for planning purposes.

## Double-blind Review Policy

We will use **double-blind peer review**. All submissions must be anonymous. The purpose of anonymous submissions is to give reviewers the chance to read the paper without being biased by knowing the authors. Authors are permitted to share their submissions through arXiv and other online repositories and give presentations on their work as usual. However, they should make sure not to mention their name or affiliation in the submission, and should not include obvious references that reveal their identity. A reviewer who has not previously seen the paper should be able to read it without accidentally learning the identity of the authors. Moreover, reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for the identity of authors.

## Review Process (New for 2025)

Authors invited to revise their submissions will receive specific revision criteria. Revisions are guided by a revision editor, and accepted revisions for the current issue must be completed within 1 month of notification; revisions accepted between 1-4 months will appear in the following issue. Papers not adequately revised by the following issue's revision deadline will be rejected. More details are available on the href=""reviews-2025.php"" - review process page.

## Resubmission of Rejected Papers (New for 2025)

Authors of rejected papers must skip one full issue before resubmitting to a future issue of PoPETs.

## Scope (New for 2025)

Papers submitted to PETS/PoPETs should present novel practical and/or theoretical research into the requirements, design, analysis, experimentation, or fielding of privacy-enhancing technologies and their contexts. Interdisciplinary research is welcome if it clearly impacts privacy technology design, development, or deployment. Relevance to privacy applications in real systems is crucial; highly theoretical contributions without clear ties to practical privacy are unlikely to be accepted.

## Paper Submission

A submitted paper should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, discuss prior work and its relationship to the paper, explicitly and precisely state the paper’s key contributions, and outline the key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. A submission should strive to be accessible to a broad audience, as well as having sufficient details for experts in the area.

### Regular Papers

A regular paper must report on original research that has not been previously published. It is not permitted to submit the same material concurrently to journals or conferences with proceedings. Format and length requirements for submissions are stated below. All ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in a paper, including full proofs and experimental results, where applicable, should be included in the submission.

### Brief Announcements

A brief announcement may describe work in progress or work presented elsewhere. A brief announcement may also report on original research results that can be fully presented in the limited space available. The title of a brief announcement must begin with `Brief Announcement: `.

## Submission Format

All submissions should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper.

Alternatively, papers can also be submitted by using the official ACM Master article LaTeX template `acmart.cls`, version 1.80 or greater, using the following documentclass instruction:

```latex
\documentclass[acmsmall,nonacm,anonymous]{acmart}
```

The template is available at [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).

The following instructions equally apply in both cases.

Regular submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information (see paragraph on double-blind reviewing below), and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper’s contributions. There is no page limit and authors are encouraged to use the “full version” of their paper as the submission. Each submission should contain within the initial 10 pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. Each submission must contain full proofs of all claims in the paper. Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first 10 pages will be read at the committee’s discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission.

Brief announcement submissions must have a length of at most 5 pages including title, abstract, and the references.

Submissions not conforming to the rules stated in this call, as well as papers outside the scope of the conference, may be rejected without consideration.

## Best practices for citations

Alphabetical orderings of authors can lead to biases. Therefore, authors are encouraged to avoid “et al.” in citations, and instead mention all author names.

## Double-blind reviewing

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear anywhere in the submission. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC chair by email.

## Conflict of Interest

Indications of conflicts of interest will be required in the submission form. A conflict of interest is limited to the following:

*   A family member or close friend.
*   A Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years.
*   A person with the same affiliation.
*   A person involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.)
*   Frequent collaborators, or collaborators who have jointly published papers within the last two years.

If you feel that you have a valid reason for a conflict of interest not listed above, contact the PC chair or one of the Theory of Computing Advocates affiliated with this conference (Faith Ellen and Idit Keidar). The PC chair may request that a ToC advocate confidentially verify the reason for a conflict of interest.

## Publication

Accepted regular papers of up to 10 pages and brief announcements of up to 3 pages in two-column ACM proceedings format will be included in the conference proceedings. They must be formatted with the ACM Master templates using `\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}`.

If more space than available in the proceedings for an accepted paper is needed, a full version must be available publicly, e.g. on arXiv, by the due date for the proceedings version, and the proceedings version must refer to this.

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

It is expected that papers that are published at PODC 2025 are presented by one of the authors in person at the conference. In exceptional circumstances (e.g., because of visa issues), a limited number of exceptions can be approved by the PC chair. A paid conference registration by one of the authors of each accepted paper will be required in any case.

Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of the journal Distributed Computing. Up to two selected papers will be considered for publication in the Journal of the ACM.
