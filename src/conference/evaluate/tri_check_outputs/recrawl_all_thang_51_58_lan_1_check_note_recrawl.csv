The 21st International Conference on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems (SEAMS) will be co-located with [ICSE 2026](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2026) in **Rio de Janeiro, Brazil**. Dates are to be announced. SEAMS is a CORE-A ranked conference.

SEAMS applies software engineering methods, techniques, processes, and tools to support the construction of safe, performant, and cost-effective self-adaptive and autonomous systems that provide self-* properties like self-configuration, self-healing, self-optimization, and self-protection.

## Author Responses

Authors of papers that receive “Revision” decisions will have the opportunity to submit a revised version of their papers. The authors are required to provide a response letter that (1) explains how the comments have been tackled, (2) provides answers to the questions posed by reviewers.

## Paper Submission

All submissions must be in PDF format and conform, at time of submission, to the official “ACM Primary Article Template”, which can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template Page. LaTeX users should use the sigconf option, as well as the review (to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers) and anonymous (omitting author names) options.

All submissions must not exceed the specified page limits. The purchase of additional pages in the proceedings is not allowed.

Submissions must strictly conform to the ACM conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above. Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review.

### Anonymization

The SEAMS 2026 Research Track will use a lightweight double- anonymous review process. No submission may reveal its authors’ identities. In particular:

*   Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission.
*   All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person.
*   While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to SEAMS 2026.
*   During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. They should thus use a different paper title for any pre-print in ArXiV or similar websites.
*   Additional material published online should be anonymized and should not provide references to the paper’s authors.
*   All communication with the program committee must go through the program committee chairs. Do not contact individual program committee members regarding your submission.

## Ethics and Policies

By submitting to SEAMS, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the [ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism) and the [IEEE Plagiarism FAQ](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee/org/about/corporate/governance/p9-26.pdf).

Submissions must follow the latest policies from IEEE and ACM (“IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policy” and “ACM Policy on Authorship”, with associated FAQ), which includes a policy specific to the use of generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT.

In particular, papers submitted to SEAMS 2026 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for SEAMS 2026.

If the research involves human participants/subjects, the authors must adhere to the [ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

## Call for Papers

*   **(New) Future of SAS papers**: 8 pages of content + 2 pages of references

## Review Criteria

Each paper submitted to the Research Track will be reviewed by at least three PC members. Each paper type has its own review criteria, presented in order of relevance.

### Full research papers

*   Novelty
*   Relevance
*   Soundness
*   Presentation
