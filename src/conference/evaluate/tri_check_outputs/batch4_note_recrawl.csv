Papers can range from theoretical contributions to systems and algorithms to experimental research and benchmarking. We invite two types of submissions:

*   **Archival papers:** 8 pages + 2 pages for references.
*   **Non-archival papers:** 2 pages + 1 page references.

Papers submitted to the **Archival track** will undergo a rigorous review process that will judge submissions for the novelty of the described approaches. The goal of the **non-archival track** is to provide authors with a fast-track route to get feedback for any preliminary ideas that show promising results but do not yet have the maturity to be submitted to the archival track.

Papers accepted in the archival track will appear in the conference proceedings and be published. The publication venue will be announced soon. Papers accepted in the non-archival track will be presented in the conference but not published.

**Review Process:** Unlike previous years, CODS 2025 will have a single-stage review process, i.e., there will not be a rebuttal stage and no option to submit revised papers. Authors of all accepted papers (archival and non-archival) must present their work at the conference.

## Ethics Statement

Authors are expected to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out the research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so will result in summary rejection. If research has the potential to cause harm, the paper should include a clear statement about why the benefit of the research outweighs the harms, and how authors have taken measures to ensure safety and minimize harms. Consultation with an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is encouraged if available.

The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research (CPAIOR 2025) will be held in **Melbourne, Australia**, from **November 10 to November 13, 2025**. The conference will be co-located with [ICAPS 2025](https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/) and [KR 2025](https://kr.org/KR2025/).

## Aim of the Conference

The aim of CPAIOR is to bring together researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Operations Research (OR) to present new techniques, applications, and theoretical & practical insights. The conference especially encourages interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative problem-solving by focusing on papers that actively combine, integrate, or contrast approaches from more than one of these areas. High-quality papers from a single area, as well as applications showcasing CP/AI/OR on challenging practical problems, are also welcomed.

## Topics of Interest

The program committee invites submissions that include, but are not limited to, the following topics:

*   New methodologies in the interface between predictive and prescriptive pipelines, such as machine learning techniques applied to tackle optimization problems and, conversely, CP/OR techniques to address AI and machine learning tasks.
*   Novel relaxation and inference methods based on constraint propagation, polyhedral techniques/cutting planes, convex/second-order conic optimization, graph-based algorithms, dynamic programming, and decision diagrams for optimization.
*   New search perspectives involving enumeration/branch-and-bound strategies, innovative decomposition techniques (e.g., based on column generation/Benders), intelligent backtracking, incomplete search, and learning-based heuristics.
*   Advanced integrated methods that expose new model transformations, communication strategies across MIP/CP/SAT solvers, distributed solution techniques, and solver selection (e.g., portfolio approaches).
*   Innovative models and applications of CP/AI/OR techniques.
*   Implementation or evaluation of CP/AI/OR techniques and optimization systems.

## Submission Types

Submissions are of two types:

1.  **Regular Papers:** Submitted for publication and presentation.
2.  **Extended Abstracts:** Submitted for presentation only.

## Awards

The conference will recognize a **Distinguished Paper Award** and a **Student Paper Award**.

## Instructions for Regular Papers

*   **Types:** Regular papers can be **long papers** (at most 15 pages plus references) or **short papers** (at most 8 pages plus references).
*   **Review:** Both types undergo rigorous review and are subject to the same criteria of quality. They are also eligible for the awards. Short papers are particularly encouraged for interesting and novel work in progress.
*   **Review Process:** Submissions to CPAIOR are **single blind**. Author names are visible to reviewers, but reviewer names are hidden from authors.
*   **Publication:** The conference proceedings will be published in the **Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series**. Papers should be prepared using the LNCS format.
