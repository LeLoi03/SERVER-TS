## Policy for Authors' Use of Generative AI Language Tools

AJCAI recognizes that authors of scientific works use a variety of tools to do the science on which they report, and to prepare the report itself, from simple ones to very sophisticated ones. 

In view of this, we:

*   continue to require authors to report in their work any significant use of sophisticated tools, such as instruments and software; we now include in particular text-to-text generative AI among those that should be reported consistent with subject standards for methodology.
*   remind all colleagues that by signing their name as an author of a paper, they each individually take full responsibility for all its contents, irrespective of how the contents were generated. If generative AI language tools generate inappropriate language, plagiarized content, biased content, errors, mistakes, incorrect references, or misleading content, and that output is included in scientific works, it is the responsibility of the author(s).
*   generative AI language tools should not be listed as an author.

## Submission Guidelines

All papers should be submitted electronically in PDF format and formatted using Springer's [manuscript submission guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).

Submitted papers should not exceed **12 pages** (including references). Reviews will be double blind; authors must avoid including anything that can be used to identify them. The authors' information, including the author order, will not be able to be changed after the submission deadline.

### Important for Blind Review

When using LaTeX, please set `\author{Anonymous}` and `\authorrunning{Anon}` to avoid revealing identifying information. For the institution, use `\institute{Anonymous Institution}` to display anonymous affiliation. Please also ensure that acknowledgments, funding information, and any other identifying details are removed from your submission.

AJCAI 2025 uses a single-stage review process (no rebuttal phase).

The deadline for submitting supplementary materials is the same as the deadline for full paper submissions. We recommend using the same template as the paper for supplementary materials. There is no page limit for supplementary materials.

Each accepted paper requires at least one Full Registration. If you have more than one accepted paper, you have to register for each paper individually.

Submissions will be through the OpenReview system at the following URL: [https://openreview.net/group?id=AJCAI/2025](https://openreview.net/group?id=AJCAI/2025)

All accepted papers submitted to the Conference will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for the conference and to present the paper.

The European Symposium on Algorithms (ESA) is one of the premier conferences on algorithms. It is organized in collaboration with the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS) and is a part of ALGO 2025, to be held in Warsaw.

The symposium seeks original algorithmic contributions for problems with relevant theoretical and/or practical applications. Papers with a strong emphasis on the theoretical analysis of algorithms should be submitted to **Track A**, while papers reporting the results of extensive experimental evaluations and/or providing original contributions to the engineering of algorithms for practical applications should be submitted to **Track B**. Submissions that prove or explain results, possibly already known, in a particularly clear, simple or elegant way should be submitted to **Track S**.

There will be a **Best Student Paper Award** as well as a **Best Paper Award**, both sponsored by EATCS. In order for a paper to be considered for the Best Student Paper Award, all of its authors are required to be students (including PhD candidates) at the time of submission.

## Submission Guidelines

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper. Submissions must be formatted in accordance with the LIPIcs proceedings guidelines and may not exceed 500 lines of text. Authors must use the LaTeX class file `socg-lipics-v2021.cls`; for a quick start, duplicate [this Overleaf project](https://www.overleaf.com/project).

Proofs omitted due to the line constraint must be placed in an appendix. This appendix can even comprise an entire full version of the paper. The appendix will be read by the program committee members at their discretion. In particular, appendices of accepted papers are not going to be published in the proceedings. The main part of the submission should therefore contain a clear technical presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims.

These guidelines are strict: submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk being rejected without consideration of their merits.

Papers must be submitted electronically via the [EasyChair submission system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=esa2025).

Results previously published (or scheduled for publication) in another conference proceedings or journal should not be submitted to ESA. Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings, journals, or to multiple tracks of ESA 2025, is also not permitted.

By submitting a paper the authors acknowledge that in case of acceptance, at least one of the authors must register at ALGO 2025, attend the conference on-site and present the paper. Papers with no author fulfilling this requirement may risk being removed from the final conference proceedings (unless there are extenuating circumstances).

## Topics

Papers presenting original research in all areas of algorithmic research are sought, including but not limited to:

*   Algorithm engineering
*   Algorithmic aspects of networks
*   Algorithmic game theory
*   Algorithmic Data Science
*   Approximation algorithms
*   Computational biology
*   Computational finance
*   Computational geometry
*   Combinatorial optimization
*   Data compression

*   Mobile computing
*   Online algorithms
*   Parameterized algorithms
*   Pattern matching
*   Quantum computing
*   Randomized algorithms
*   Scheduling and resource allocation problems
*   Streaming algorithms

## Double-Blind Reviewing

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias.

Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).

Double-blind reviewing is intended to help PC members and reviewers to counter bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. In case there exist publicly available versions of the submission online, the authors might mention this in their submission (without providing references/links), and briefly explain the differences if any. Alternatively, they might communicate the details to the chairs, who will keep them confidential unless revealing them to the PC is needed for a fair judgement.

When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members. A CoI is limited to the following categories:

*   Family member or close friend.
*   Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years.
*   Person with the same affiliation.
*   Involved in an alleged incident of harassment. (It is not required that the incident be reported.)
*   Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter).
*   Frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.

The 30th European Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs, People, and Practices (**EuroPLoP**) will be held from **July 2-6, 2025**, in **Kloster Irsee, Germany**.

This year marks the 30th anniversary of EuroPLoP, featuring special activities and the presence of important figures from its history. As part of this celebration, we welcome submissions that reflect on the history of patterns and look at their future.

## Why Participate in EuroPLoP?

**EuroPLoP** is the premier European conference on patterns and pattern languages, representing practical experience and best practices.

*   **Authors:** Gain visibility by publishing patterns and receive active, high-quality feedback to improve their pattern writing and daily activities.
*   **Practitioners:** Enlarge their network and increase visibility by meeting leading experts and practitioners. They also get trained on how to get and give structured feedback.
*   **Academics:** Benefit from EuroPLoP’s intensive shepherding process, reviews, and peer discussions at Writers’ Workshops, leading to high-quality publications. Accepted papers will be published in the Springer LNCS.
*   **Participants:** Keep up-to-date with contemporary movements in software engineering and related topics through in-depth discussions during EuroPLoP’s Writers’ Workshops.

## Call for Pattern Papers

We encourage you to submit pattern papers on software-related topics, as well as other topics. EuroPLoP is open to synergies with other fields and therefore accepts up to 20% of pattern papers on non-computing topics. EuroPLoP accepts papers containing patterns or pattern languages, as well as papers related to the theory and the practical application of patterns. EuroPLoP also accepts excerpts from Ph.D. theses or book projects.

We particularly welcome submissions on the following topics (theory and practice):

## Call for Focus Group Proposals

Focus Groups at EuroPLoP are an excellent opportunity to collaborate with other passionate pattern writers. They are 1 to 2 hour sessions. Your submission should include a summary of the topic, outcomes you envision, a brief description of how you will organize the session, its time budget, and the required number of participants.

## Paper Submission Process

The submission runs through three quality gates before the final proceedings are published. After the first draft is accepted, your paper will be assigned to a shepherd. Following several iterations of shepherding, your improved second draft will be reviewed again and accepted or rejected for the conference. On acceptance, your paper will be discussed in the writers’ workshop during the conference. Based on the feedback received during the workshops, you must submit a final revised version that will be published. The submission system is available under [https://www.europlop.net/submission/](https://www.europlop.net/submission/) .

## Paper Submission Format

The final submission for publication must be formatted using the Springer template, but for the drafts and intermediate versions, you can use any format. We recommend 10 pages as a guideline and especially welcome shorter papers.

*   You MAY NOT reference the arxiv version of your paper from the paper submitted for review at EWSN.
*   You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN paper in the arxiv paper.
*   You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN paper in any other papers you submit for review at other conferences.
*   Once your paper is accepted, you MAY reference your EWSN paper (you can use ""accepted, to appear"" until the conference actually happens).

Submissions are via HotCRP: [https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/](https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/)

Decisions will be: accept, reject, or one-shot revision; papers receiving a “one-shot revision” for the winter deadline will be invited to submit a revised paper by the summer deadline.

Authors of papers rejected in the winter cycle may submit a revised paper in the summer cycle along with a cover letter. Papers submitted to the summer deadline that are deemed by the program chairs to be too similar to a paper rejected from the winter review cycle will be returned without review.

Pages must use 8.5″ x 11″ (letter) two-column format, using 10-point type on 11-point leading, with a maximum text block of 7″ wide x 9″ deep with an inter-column spacing of .25″. Submissions with a page size of 11.7 x 8.3 ” (297 x 210 mm / A4) will not be accepted. The page limits include figures, tables, and references. Authors may use the EWSN 2025 template adapted from the ACM templates for convenience (on Overleaf here).

All accepted papers will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library, SCOPUS, and other prominent digital libraries.

## Technical Papers - Submission Guidelines

We invite you to submit high-quality work on animation and simulation broadly defined as computation dealing with time-varying phenomena.

Papers can be submitted via the [EasyChair website](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sca2025).

*   Papers should be written and presented in English.
*   There is no strict maximum length for submitted papers. However, we recommend that research papers be up to 16 pages (excluding references), and longer papers should make a very significant contribution.
*   Authors are encouraged to use supplementary documents to provide extra content.
*   A paper submission should describe an original work of the authors.
*   Authors must not use ideas or content originating from others without properly crediting their original sources.
*   Supplementary material such as videos may also be submitted electronically and will be made available to reviewers (size up to 500MB). Videos are required for techniques involving motion or animation.
*   The author(s) of accepted papers must also attend the conference and present their work in-person. At least one (1) author from each accepted paper must register for the conference.
*   Submitted articles will receive two rounds of reviewing by at least three (3) expert reviewers. Technical papers conditionally accepted in the first round will undergo a second round of revision and review and, conditional on final acceptance, will be published in the PACMCGIT issue on SCA 2025. There is no rebuttal process.

### Paper Format

Research papers should be in [ACM article format](https://www.siggraph.org/preparing-your-content/author-instructions/) using the ACM small trim journal size (acmsmall). For the review version, please use the command `\documentclass[acmsmall, screen, review, anonymous]{acmart}`.

### Anonymous Submissions

Paper submissions must be anonymous and include the unique paper ID that will be assigned upon creating a submission using the online system. The review process is double-anonymous, so please remove all personal data, such as author names and affiliation from all your submission files.

Papers should not have previously appeared in, or be currently submitted to, any other conference or journal. SCA follows the same [anonymity policy as SIGGRAPH](https://s2025.siggraph.org/anonymity-policy/). Any case of violation will be determined by the chairs and could result in a desk rejection.

### Awards

Best Paper Awards will be given to exceptional submissions on the cutting edge of computer animation.

## Poster Abstracts

As in previous years, the poster session will be part of the SCA program. However, the poster abstracts will not be included in the conference proceedings.

Poster abstracts should be sent to the poster chair Alexandre Mercier-Aubin at alexandre.mercier-aubin@usherbrooke.ca

*   Submissions must be camera-ready, with author names and affiliations listed. The review process will be single-blind.
*   Poster abstract submissions should consist of a PDF paper according to the ACM article format. Submissions are permitted to be up to two pages in length, written and presented in English.
*   Supplementary material such as videos may also be submitted electronically and will be made available to reviewers. All supplementary materials must be submitted as a single zip file (size up to 500MB).

Authors of accepted papers are also welcome to reserve a spot for a poster presentation. To do so, please email the Poster Chair with your request. All accepted papers are guaranteed to be approved for a poster without the need to submit a poster abstract.
