## Submission Guidelines

*   **Submission Format:** Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper, no author information, and an abstract of a few paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. There is no page limit, and authors are encouraged to use the ""full version"" of their paper as the submission.
*   **Content:** Each submission should contain within the initial ten pages following the title page a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of its importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. This part should be addressed to a broad spectrum of theoretical computer science researchers, not solely to experts in the subarea.
*   **Proofs:** Proofs must be provided that can enable the main mathematical claims of the paper to be fully verified.
*   **Length:** Although there is no bound on the length of a submission, material other than the abstract, table of contents, and the first ten pages will be read at the committee's discretion. Authors are encouraged to put the references at the very end of the submission.
*   **Formatting:** The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
*   **Anonymity:** STOC 2025 will use **double-blind reviewing**. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. This includes authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses. Authors should not include obvious references that reveal their own identity and should ensure any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not ""We build on our previous work…"" but rather ""We build on the work of…""). Important references should not be omitted or anonymized. Authors are free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper (e.g., post on the web, submit to arXiv, give talks).
*   **Confidentiality:** All submissions will be treated as confidential and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees.
*   **PC Member Submissions:** Submissions authored or coauthored by PC members (other than the PC chair) are allowed.
*   **References:** Authors are encouraged to include hyperlink cross-referencing for bibliographic entries, theorems, sections, etc. A table of contents may be added on a page immediately following the title page. Authors are asked to avoid ""et al."" in citations, favoring an equal mention of all authors' surnames. Bibliographic references should preferably be alphanumeric (e.g., the first letters of the authors' surnames, or at least the first three followed by +) followed by the year of publication.
*   **Submission Server:** The submission server is scheduled to open on October 1, 2024. ([https://stoc25.hotcrp.com/](https://stoc25.hotcrp.com/))

## Important Dates

*   **STOC Paper Submission Deadline:** Monday, November 4, 2024 (7:59pm EST)
