## Submission Site

We will use OpenReview to manage the submissions and reviewing.

All listed authors must have an up-to-date OpenReview profile, properly attributed with current and past institutional affiliation, homepage, Google Scholar, DBLP, ORCID, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar (wherever applicable). The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflict of interest and paper matching. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.

Abstracts and papers can be submitted through the OpenReview link: [https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/TheWebConf/2024/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/TheWebConf/2024/Conference).

## Scope

The scope of the conference is the Web and how it has crucially enabled new research and applications. While the Web feeds on and is part of a broader interdisciplinary ecosystem, including technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and many others, it remains a distinct scholarly field, with its own research methods, tools, and challenges.

A typical Web Conference paper should have explicit focus on at least one of the following:

*   understanding, evaluating, and improving the Web as a technical infrastructure; including core Web technologies, standards, and platforms
*   understanding, evaluating, and improving the Web as a socio-economic system;
*   understanding better the impact of the Web and Web technologies;
*   democratizing access to Web content and technologies, making it more accessible, fair, inclusive, and accountable to a wide range of audiences.

> **Relevance Note:** Every submission must clearly state how the work is relevant to the Web and to the track in the first page. Submissions that merely use a Web artifact—e.g., a dataset or a Web Application Programmer Interface (API) or a social network—rather than answering a specific Web-related scientific research challenge, are out of scope and will be desk-rejected.

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Deadlines:** The submission deadlines are strict and no extensions, regardless of circumstances, will be allowed. Placeholder/dummy abstracts are forbidden.
*   **Authorship:** The ACM has an [authorship policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) stating who can be considered an author in a submission as well as the use of generative AI tools. Every person named as the author of a paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the paper and/or to the writing of the paper and must take responsibility for the entire content of a paper.
    *   **Maximum Authorship:** The number of submissions allowed per author is limited to **9 (nine)** maximum, accumulatively across the research tracks. If more than 9 papers are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional papers submitted after the first 9 by submission id, will be desk-rejected.
    *   **Authorship Changes:** The full list of authors, including the ordering, must be finalized at the point of submission. There cannot be any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after submission time. The only changes allowed are the correction of spelling mistakes or new affiliation.
*   **Anonymity:** The review process will be **double-blind**. The submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information. This may include, but is not restricted to acknowledgments, self-citations, references to prior work by the author(s), and so on. Please use the third-person to identify your own prior work. You may explicitly refer in the paper to organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions and tools.
*   **Formatting Requirements:** Submissions must be in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the [ACM template and format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) (also [available in Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty)). Word users may use the Word Interim Template and the recommended setting for LaTeX is:
    ```latex
    \documentclass[sigconf, anonymous, review]{acmart}
    ```
    Submissions must be a single PDF file: **8 (eight) pages as main paper**, with unlimited pages for references and an optional Appendix (that can contain details on reproducibility, proofs, pseudo-code, etc). The first 8 pages should be self-contained, since reviewers are not required to read past that.
*   **Originality and Concurrent Submissions:** Submissions must present original work—this means that papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference/journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted. Submissions that have been previously presented orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in non-archival venues with no formal proceedings, including workshops or PhD symposia without proceedings, are allowed. Authors may submit anonymized work that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv or SSRN) without citing it. The ACM has a strict [policy against plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview) that applies to all publications.
*   **Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent:** Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when appropriate. Authors are subject to all [ACM Publications Policies](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc), including [ACM's Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects) (posted in 2021). Please ensure all authors are familiar with these policies. Consult institution regulations for IRB review. Program committee might raise additional concerns even if IRB approved.

> **Note:** Submissions that do not follow these guidelines or do not view or print properly, will be desk-rejected.

## Reviewing Process

*   **Reviewing:** Each paper is submitted to one of the tracks listed above. Papers that do not conform to the conference scope or submission guidelines will be desk-rejected by the track chair (aka Senior Area Chair, SAC). Each submission will receive at least three independent reviews within each track and the process overseen by an Area Chair (AC). Authors may be requested to serve as reviewers.
*   **Rebuttal:** Authors will have the chance to provide a response to the reviews during an author-reviewer discussion period. The ACs and SACs will consider the authors' responses to the points raised by the reviewers to inform acceptance decisions.
*   **Decision:** A range of factors including technical merit, originality, potential impact, quality of execution, quality of presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics, will be used by the ACs and SACs to make a recommendation. The PC Chairs will make the final decisions.
*   **Transparency:** By submitting paper(s) to The Web Conference 2024, the authors agree that the reviews, meta-reviews, and discussions will be made public in OpenReview for all accepted papers.

## Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy

All authors and reviewers must declare conflicts of interest in OpenReview. You must declare a domain conflict (entered in Education & Career History) for employment at the same institution or company, regardless of geography/location, currently or in the last 12 months. You must declare a personal conflict when the following associations exist:

*   candidate for employment at the same institution or company
*   co-author on book/paper or co-PI on a funded grant/research proposal in the last 24 months
*   active collaborator
*   family relationship or close personal relationship
*   graduate advisee/advisor relationship, regardless of time elapsed since graduation
*   deep personal animosity

In general, authors, PC, the organizing committee, and other volunteers are expected to adhere to [ACM's Conflict of Interest Policy](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/acm-conflict-of-interest-policy) as well as the [ACM's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct).

## Publication and Presentation Policies

*   **Publication:** All accepted papers will be allowed the same maximum page length in the proceedings (**12 pages, of which 8 are content pages**), which will be published by ACM and will be accessible via the ACM Digital Library. Accepted papers will require a further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers can and should include all information to identify authors, and should acknowledge any funding received that directly supported the presented research. In addition, all papers are required to submit a brief pre-recorded video, which will appear on ACM Digital Library, along with the PDF of the papers.
*   **Registration:** To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by a distinct conference registration, e.g., two papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day) or Main Conference (3-day) registration, at the standard (non-student) in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the camera-ready deadline. This registration requirement applies universally, regardless of attendance or presentation mode.
*   **Presentation:** Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings. There will be two forms of presentation:
    *   **Oral Presentation:** Among the accepted papers, a subset will be selected for oral presentation. Generally, oral presentations are expected to be in-person, but a few online presentations may be allowed for authors with significant travel difficulties.
    *   **Poster Presentation:** All papers will be asked to produce a poster on-site. An e-copy will appear on Whova. To facilitate authors in getting their hard-copy posters on-site, the conference offers a local poster printing service for a fee.
*   **Reproducibility:** Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available after the review process. The optional use of the ""Artifacts Available"" badge in ACM's Digital Library is encouraged. If you release any code, dataset, or similar artifact to accompany your paper, and host it in a publicly available, archival repository for research artifacts that provides a Document Object Identifier (DOI), you are welcome to apply for this badge. A special subcommittee will check the artifacts of all accepted papers for availability and relatedness to the paper after the acceptance notification.
