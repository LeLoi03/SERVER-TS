## Journal Papers

Submissions to the journal-track of the ECSCW conference undergo a fully integrated, continuous review process, allowing authors to develop and refine stronger papers over a longer period.

### Description

We invite journal papers documenting original, rich, and in-depth contributions to CSCW. Authors are encouraged to submit papers that improve and extend the CSCW field.

### Relevant Themes

Relevant themes include, but are not limited to:

*   Empirical investigations of collaborative practices.
*   System design focusing on solutions to support cooperative work in increasingly complex, networked, and data-driven settings.
*   Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, and/or toolkits that enable the building of new social and collaborative systems and experiences.
*   Methodologies and tools for investigating human practices, e.g., the nature of ethnography and the role of other innovative research approaches in building systems or studying their use, the application of critical design or design fictions to investigate future possibilities.
*   Critical analysis or theory with clear relevance to study, design, or use of collaborative settings and systems.
*   Domain-specific social and collaborative applications, including applications to digital civics, grassroots movements, healthcare, transportation, ICT4D, sustainability, education, workplace, accessibility, global collaboration, or other domains.
*   Analysis of the ethics and policy implications of socio-technical systems, the values that inform them, and the algorithms that shape them.
*   The changing nature of collaboration and teaming in relation to intelligent machine agents, e.g., human-AI relationships in collaborative practices.
*   Studies, prototypes, or other investigations that explore interactions across disciplines, distances, languages, generations, and cultures, to help understand how to design in relation to social, temporal, and/or spatial boundaries.
*   Discussions and extrapolations of work-practices and technologies, which contribute to the core topics of ECSCW.
