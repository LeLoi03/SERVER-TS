SPLASH 2025, co-located with ICFP/SPLASH 2025, will be held from **Sun 12 - Sat 18 October 2025** in **Singapore**.

## About Onward!

Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.

## The Character of Onward! Papers

Onward! Papers is looking for **grand visions and new paradigms** that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. It is not looking for research-as-usual papers that require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as **compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples**. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

## Selection Process

Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a **double blind manner**. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the **potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation**.

Onward! Papers follows a **two-phase review process**. At the end of the first phase, papers will be either: accepted normally; asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. Authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete them. The program committee may assign a shepherd or provide concrete revision goals. The second phase is to elevate promising papers, not to require additional work on papers already deemed up-to-standard.

Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference, but remote participation is available.

The 22nd USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI '25) will be held on **April 28–30, 2025**, in **Philadelphia, PA, USA**.

NSDI focuses on the design principles, implementation, and practical evaluation of networked and distributed systems. Our goal is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community to foster a broad approach to addressing overlapping research challenges. NSDI provides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further the knowledge and understanding of the networked systems community as a whole, continue a significant research dialog, or push the architectural boundaries of network services.

## Topics

NSDI invites any innovative solution for a significant problem involving networked systems, including topics from within the following list:

*   Highly available and reliable networked systems
*   Security and privacy of networked systems
*   Distributed storage, caching, and query processing systems
*   Sustainable, low-energy, and low-carbon networked systems
*   Cloud/multi-tenant systems
*   Mobile and embedded/sensor applications and systems
*   Systems aspects of networking hardware and physical layer communication technologies*
*   Network and workload measurement systems
*   Self-organizing, autonomous, and federated networked systems
*   Managing, debugging, and diagnosing problems in networked systems
*   Virtualization and resource management for networked systems
*   Experience with deployed networked systems
*   Networked systems for big data
*   Testing and/or verification applied to networked systems
*   Networked systems for machine learning (ML) and ML for networked systems

*Physical and physical-sensing papers with no clear contributions to the design of systems or the networking stack will be considered out of scope.

The preceding list is not exhaustive. That said, the program committee can reject any papers that they consider to be not in scope and relevant to the NSDI community during the review process. Please contact the PC chairs if you have questions about whether your paper would be in scope.

## Important Dates

NSDI '25 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines.

### Spring Deadline

*   Paper titles and abstracts due: **Tuesday, April 30, 2024**
*   Full paper submissions due: **Tuesday, May 7, 2024**
*   Notification to authors: **Wednesday, July 24, 2024**
*   Final paper files due: **Tuesday, October 15, 2024**

### Fall Deadline

*   Paper titles and abstracts due: **Thursday, September 12, 2024**
*   Full paper submissions due: **Thursday, September 19, 2024**
*   Notification to authors: **Tuesday, December 10, 2024**
*   Final paper files due: **Thursday, March 6, 2025**

## Submission Guidelines

### Anonymization

NSDI '25 is double-blind, meaning that authors should make a good faith effort to anonymize papers. Authors' names should be withheld, as usual. However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left de-anonymized if important for a reviewer to evaluate the work. Specific steps include:

*   Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page.
*   Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources.
*   Do not provide links to your own online content; use the submission form for uploads or contact PC chairs.
*   Use care in naming files.
*   Reference past work in the third person, citing anonymously.
*   Reference other submissions as ""[24] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing.""

*Note:* Operational track papers have different rules; content may be de-anonymized as appropriate for the paper.

### Length and Format

*   Submissions—as well as final papers—must be no longer than **12 pages**, including footnotes, figures, and tables. Additional pages are allowed for references and supplementary material.
*   Papers must be in two-column format, using 10-point type on 12-point leading, formatted for 8.5"" x 11"" paper.
*   Pages should be numbered, and figures and tables should be legible when printed without magnification. Color figures are allowed but should be readable in black and white.
*   A template for LaTeX is available on the href=""/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates"" - conference paper templates page .

Papers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review.

### Submission Method

All papers must be submitted via the href=""https://nsdi25fall.usenix.hotcrp.com/"" - submission form . Do not email submissions.

### Generative AI

Authors must not submit papers generated entirely by generative AI. Authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper is not completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP.

## Review Process

### One-Shot Revision

Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. A revision decision includes necessary changes for acceptance. Authors may resubmit a version addressing instructions during the subsequent deadline. This revised paper is reviewed to judge if instructions were met, and on its independent merits. Revised papers can only be accepted or rejected, not revised again. Failure to address revision instructions or introduction of new concerns may lead to rejection.

### Resubmissions

Papers rejected from one deadline cannot be submitted to the immediate next deadline. Papers with one-shot-revision decisions from a prior year can be submitted to the following year's conference, but must provide the previous paper ID. Papers submitted to arXiv or other online repositories must change their title and system name for review to prevent bias.

## Policies

*   **Simultaneous submissions:** Prohibited. Previously published work or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty.
*   **Extensions on workshop papers:** Allowed if the submission includes substantial new material, acknowledges previous work anonymously, and explains differences.
*   **Nondisclosure agreement:** Papers accompanied by NDAs will not be considered.

## Ethical Considerations

Papers describing experiments with users or user data must follow basic principles of ethical research (beneficence, minimal risk, voluntary consent, respect for privacy, limited deception). Authors are encouraged to include a subsection on ethical issues and must attest that their work complies with applicable ethical standards of their institutions.

## Processes for Accepted Papers

*   Invitation letters for visa applications are available upon request.
*   Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process.
*   At least one author must attend the conference to present the paper.
*   Awards will be given for the best paper(s) and a ""Community Award"" for papers with publicly available code and/or datasets.",Có link 2026: https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi26,Yes

Hosted by National Taiwan Normal University and Taipei ACM SIGGRAPH, the conference aims to promote visualization research and technologies, especially in the Asian-Pacific region. PacificVis 2025 accepts various scientific contributions, including full research papers, short papers, posters, and participation in workshops and contests.","# PacificVis 2025: Call for Papers

**IEEE PacificVis 2025** solicits novel research contributions and innovative applications in all areas of visualization. PacificVis is a unified visualization conference covering topics including visualization techniques and systems, interactions, analytics and decision support, theoretical contributions to visualization, empirical studies, and visualization applications in domains such as (but not limited to) biological sciences, education, machine learning, physical sciences, security, and social science.

**IEEE PacificVis 2025** will be held in **Taipei, Taiwan** on **April 22–25, 2025**. The conference accepts a range of scientific contributions ranging from full research papers, short papers, and posters. This year, PacificVis has a **TVCG journal paper track**, a **conference full paper track**, and a **short paper (VisNotes) track** with consecutive deadlines. These tracks have separate calls for papers:

*   Call for papers - [TVCG journal papers](TVCG-journal-papers.html)
*   Call for papers - [conference papers](Conference-papers.html)
*   Call for papers - [short papers (VisNotes)](Short-papers.html)
*   Call for papers - Posters

The deadlines for the tracks are arranged so that papers rejected from an earlier track can be resubmitted to a following track (with optional reviewer continuity). All submitted papers will go through a two-stage review process to guarantee the publication of high-quality papers. Accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference and will also be published by IEEE and included in the IEEE Digital Library. Papers accepted in the journal track will be published directly in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG).

## Important Dates

All below deadlines are at 11:59pm (23:59) AoE (Anywhere on Earth).

Track-specific dates for revisions and camera-ready deadlines are given in the respective CFPs.

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Abstract vs. full deadline:** All tracks except VisNotes have separate abstract (title, abstract, authors, keywords) and full paper deadlines (usually a week apart).
*   **Resubmissions encouraged:** Authors are encouraged to include reviews and responses for previously rejected papers in their submission.
*   **Optional single-blind:** Reviewers’ identities are not revealed. Authors may choose whether to anonymize their submission or not.
*   **Submission System:** IEEE PacificVis uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) to handle the submission and reviewing process. When submitting your manuscript, please make sure that you submit to the intended track.

## Formatting and Language Guidelines

*   **TVCG journal paper track:** TVCG journal format with 9 + 2 pages (with only acknowledgments and references on the last two pages).
*   **Conference paper track:** IEEE VGTC conference format with 9 + 2 pages (with only acknowledgments and references on the last two pages).
*   **VisNotes paper track:** IEEE VGTC conference format with up to 6 pages (including references).

Papers should include full-color figures throughout and we encourage authors to showcase their work with annotated, well described, large, and detailed graphics. We also encourage the placement of a teaser image at the top of the very first page to showcase your work visually. Reviewers appreciate high-quality submissions with correct English spelling and grammar: non-native English speakers may wish to enlist an English language editing service.

## Anonymization

IEEE PacificVis allows both double-blind (anonymized) and single-blind (not anonymized) submissions. Double-blind submissions are intended for those authors who want to submit their work anonymously. Double-blind submissions should NOT include author names or institutions on the cover page of the initial submission, and authors should make an effort to ensure that there is no identity-revealing information (or formulations) in the text. If it is not possible to anonymize without compromising scientific clarity, authors are free to reveal their identities upon submission.

## Originality & Reuse of Text

All submissions must be novel contributions by the authors. This means that they must be original work by the authors that has not been published previously in or submitted concurrently to any conference proceeding, magazine or journal, or the like, in any language, in any form, in whole or in part, by any combination of authors.

A paper is considered published if it has appeared in a peer-reviewed and archived journal, in conference proceedings, or the like, making it available to non-attendees in the form of archives (including digital).

Concurrent submissions (i.e., having the same or a similar paper concurrently under review at another conference or journal/magazine) are strictly forbidden. If it is determined that an identical or substantially similar manuscript is simultaneously under consideration at another publication venue or forum (e.g., conference, journal, edited book), the manuscript will be rejected at an early stage in the review process. Further consequences are possible as well.

Previously published text may not be reused verbatim in a paper submission. Although similarities may be inevitable in discussing background or previous work, the reuse of text can infringe copyright, and is therefore prohibited. Images from published work may only be reused if they are properly cited and the authors have obtained the rights to re-publish the images.

One exception to these prohibitions is non-published preprints (e.g., on arXiv), which do not require citation to preprints. Another exception is theses, which should be cited. The last exception is that preliminary work described in posters, contest entries, or workshops, if not archival, may be resubmitted provided the submission includes substantial additional new material and the previous work is cited.

## Plagiarism Policy

Plagiarism of the work of others is at all times unacceptable and will lead to the submission being removed from the review process. For more information, please see the IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual.

All authors will therefore be required to certify on the submission form that the submitted work is the authors’ own work. All submissions are checked for plagiarism and potential cases inspected in detail by the paper chairs.

## Supplemental Material

We encourage the use of digital video to enhance a submission, particularly if part or all of the work addresses interactive techniques. Submission of code, data, evaluation protocols, empirical results, additional figures, or other supplemental material to improve the scientific review of the work is encouraged. Authors are urged to make available salient parameter settings of pertinent algorithms and ideally obtain results using open source data. If specific datasets are employed, we ask that a version of these be made available where possible. Information or pointers to information that can be changed after the submission deadline should not be used as supplemental material.

While most reviewers will take supplemental material into account when conducting their reviews, the authors should ensure that their submission will stand on its own even without this extra material.

## Resubmissions and Reviewer Continuity

Excellent work sometimes requires addressing issues that preclude acceptance within the scope of a single review cycle. For this reason, IEEE PacificVis welcomes revised, resubmitted papers. In particular, given the consecutive timeline of the three tracks, authors are encouraged to resubmit a revised version of a paper that was rejected to one track to the next track. In doing so, the authors can choose to maintain reviewer continuity if desired, in which case one or more of the original reviewers will be engaged for the new review process.

Authors who are submitting papers that have been rejected from earlier PacificVis cycles, or from other visualization conferences, are given the opportunity to include past reviews and a response letter as supplemental material when they submit the revised version. This is not required, but can add continuity and memory to the process so that authors can demonstrate improvement over time even if reviewers change from cycle to cycle.

Note that it is not acceptable to submit a previously rejected paper without addressing the previous review comments.

Reviewers are instructed to not penalize resubmitted papers for past rejections, but instead view the trajectory of a resubmission based on past reviews and author response. However, as with supplemental material, reviewers are not required to take past reviews and response letters into account when conducting their review. Resubmissions should be submitted with information pertaining to the original submission as supplemental material (PDF format):

*   Past submission - previous version of the paper.
*   Previous reviews - complete reviews from the last submission.
*   Cover letter - responses to past reviews (often as summary plus details).

Authors are responsible for the content of the response letter, but effective letters tend to summarize the main points of criticism in the past reviews and explain how the new version of the paper addresses these points.

## Accessibility

We highly encourage accessible final submissions so that your contribution is readable by broader audiences. There are several resources for how to achieve this:

*   [IEEE VIS 2024 - Making PDF submissions accessible](https://ieeevis.org/year/2024/info/call-participation/make-pdf-accessible)
*   [ACM SIGACCESS - Creating an accessible ACM submission using Microsoft Word](https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/acm-submission-with-ms-word/)
*   [ACM SIGCHI - Guide to an Accessible Submission](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/accessibility/)
*   ACM SIGACCESS - Resources for Accessibility

## Generative AI Policy

You are permitted to use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT or Gemini in preparing your manuscript. However, AI tools cannot serve as authors and the human authors bear full responsibility for any writing produced by such tools. In particular, authors are responsible that there is no plagiarism, misrepresentation, or falsification arising from using these tools. Furthermore, the work itself should be a representation of the human authors' intellectual contributions and not the generative AI.

If you do use generative AI beyond merely editing or improving text or generating small passages, you should disclose its use in the paper (such as the acknowledgments or image captions).

## Open Access Policy

Visualization research is better communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, all paper authors are encouraged to share their accepted paper in an open access repository before the print deadline in accordance with IEEE copyright regulations. Additionally, funding agencies and research organizations may have specific rules such as Plan S compliance and it is the authors’ responsibility to check and comply with their respective organizational rules.

## Ethics Guidelines

IEEE PacificVis adheres to the IEEE VGTC ethics guidelines for reviewers. In all aspects of the paper handling process, any possible violation of these guidelines is taken seriously and may be reported to the paper chairs for further handling within the IEEE PacificVis organization. Special attention is paid to the identification and reporting of plagiarism; possibly unethical paper content is also monitored carefully in the review process. Investigation and processing of reported cases may lead to an escalation to IEEE.","Đúng link chính, không lấy được các loại ngày",Yes

The 13th Workshop on Programming Languages and Operating Systems (PLOS 2025) will be held on **October 13, 2025**, in **Seoul, Republic of Korea**, in conjunction with the **31st ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP '25)**.

## Rationale

Historically, operating system (OS) development and programming language (PL) development went hand-in-hand, fostering cross-fertilization. Challenges in one area were often approached using ideas or techniques developed in the other, and advances in one enabled new capabilities in both. Today, although the systems community at large retains an iron grip on C, modern PL ideas continue to spark innovations in OS design and construction. Conversely, the systems field continues to provide a wealth of challenging problems and practical results that should spark advances in PLs, software designs, and idioms.

This workshop will bring together researchers and developers from the PL and OS domains to discuss recent work at the intersection of these fields. It will be a venue for discussing new visions, challenges, experiences, problems, and solutions arising from the application of advanced programming and software engineering concepts to OSes construction, and vice versa.

## Overview

Welcome to the home page of the 46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 2025)!

PLDI is the premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research, covering the areas of design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance.

PLDI 2025 will be held in-person at the Westin Josun Seoul in Seoul, South Korea.

The main PLDI conference will be held **Wednesday, 18 June through Friday, 20 June**. Workshops and tutorials were held on **Monday, 16 June and Tuesday, 17 June**.

## Scope

PLDI is a premier forum for programming language research, broadly construed. Outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing is welcome. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all in scope for PLDI.

## Submission Process

### Deadlines

All deadlines are **Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12h)**:

*   **Submission Deadline:** **Thursday, November 14, 2024**
*   **Author Response Period:** **Tuesday, 18 - Saturday, 22 February 2025**
*   **Notification to Authors:** **Thursday, 6 March 2025**
*   **Camera-Ready Deadline:** **Thursday, 10 April 2025**

### Submission Site

The submission site will be at [https://pldi25.hotcrp.com/](https://pldi25.hotcrp.com/).

Authors can submit multiple times prior to the (firm!) deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no deadline for submitting abstracts. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Associate Editor.

### Declaring Conflicts

When submitting a paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).

Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to subvert the normal peer-review process by excluding potential reviewers. Listing spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about whether or not a given relationship constitutes a conflict, please consult the Associate Editor.

## Formatting Requirements

### Page Limits and Layout

Each paper should have no more than **20 pages of text**, excluding bibliography, using the ACM Proceedings format. This format is chosen for compatibility with PACMPL. It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent PLDI page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall.

Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection.

### Templates

PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the [SIGPLAN author information page](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/). Authors using LaTeX should use the `sample-acmsmall-conf.tex` file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the `acmsmall` option. We also strongly encourage use of the `review` and `screen` options as well, e.g.:

```latex
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous,nonacm]{acmart}
```

### Citations

Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers may use either the author-year or numeric format for citations.

### File Format

Submissions should be in **PDF** and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Please take care to ensure that figures and tables are legible, even when the paper is printed in gray-scale.

### Late/Incorrect Submissions

Papers that exceed the length requirement, deviate from the expected format, or are submitted late will be rejected.

## Review Process

### Evaluation Criteria

Reviewers will evaluate submissions for accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. Submissions should be organized to communicate clearly to a broad programming-language audience as well as experts on the paper’s topics. Papers should identify what has been accomplished and how it relates to previous work. Authors of empirical papers are encouraged to consider the seven categories of the SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines when preparing submissions.

### Double-Blind Reviewing

Author names and affiliations must be omitted from submissions. If a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. These are firm submission requirements. The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing.

The [FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/faq/FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing) clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Associate Editor than to risk summary rejection.

### Author Response

Authors will be given several days to compose a written response to the reviews received in the first round – e.g., to correct errors and clarify technical concerns. In the second round, authors of conditionally-accepted papers will be given an opportunity to improve specific aspects of the research and the paper, as identified by the reviewers.

### Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their artifacts publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.

## Supplementary Material

Authors are welcome to provide supplementary material if that material supports the claims in the paper. Such material may include proofs, experimental results, and/or data sets. This material should be uploaded at the same time as the submission. Reviewers are not required to examine the supplementary material but may refer to it if they would like to find further evidence supporting the claims in the paper.

Supplemental material cannot be included in the main submission text. All appendices must be submitted as supplemental material, not as part of the main submission PDF.

## Plagiarism and Concurrent Work

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere, as described by the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar venues of publication are disallowed. Prior work must, as always, be cited and referred to in the third person even if it is the authors’ own work, so as to preserve author anonymity.

## Open Access and Copyright

As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support liberal open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license, which grants readers (re-)use rights.

Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide an ORCID for each co-author and choose one of the following publication rights: (1) Author licenses the work with a Creative Commons license, retains copyright, and grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice); (2) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license; (3) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license; (4) Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.

While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication.

## Presentations and Awards

### Presentations

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work at PLDI. Authors who need financial assistance for travel to the conferences should apply for a grant from the SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (PAC) program. If authors are not able to obtain visas to travel to the conference despite making reasonable effort, we will make arrangements to facilitate remote participation or presentation by another attendee on behalf of the authors.

### Distinguished Paper Awards

Up to 10% of the accepted papers may be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee believes should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity.

## Code of Conduct

PLDI follows the ACM Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities. Please familiarize yourself with the policy and guide for reporting unacceptable behavior.

If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, please contact SIGPLAN’s Committee to Aid REporting (CARES) by contacting one of the listed persons, such as Steve Blackburn (steve.blackburn@anu.edu.au).

Sponsored by ACM SIGPLAN in cooperation with ACM SIGACT and ACM SIGLOG, POPL serves as a forum for discussing all aspects of programming languages and programming systems, welcoming both theoretical and experimental papers that make principled, enduring contributions.","# POPL 2025: Call for Papers

POPL 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical.

## Scope

Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.

## Evaluation Criteria

The Review Committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each submission as well as its accessibility to both experts and the general POPL audience. All papers will be judged on significance, originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Each paper must explain its scientific contribution in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

POPL 2025 will use a **full double-blind reviewing process**. This means that identities of authors will not be visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made. Authors must omit their names and institutions from their paper submissions and refer to their own prior work in the third person. Supplementary material must also be fully anonymized. Authors should not reveal their identity when responding to reviews.

## Submission Site Information

The submission site is [https://popl25.hotcrp.com/](https://popl25.hotcrp.com/). Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors must properly declare all potential conflicts of interest for all authors when submitting. This includes marking PC conflicts as well as ""Other Conflicts (external)"". Conflicts include adviser-advisee relationships, co-author relationships, colleagues at the same institution, financial conflicts, and relationships with friends or relatives.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Each paper should have no more than **25 pages of text**, excluding bibliography.
*   Use the **PACMPL format** (acmart LaTeX class with acmsmall option). This is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins.

It serves as a premier annual forum for new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management.","# PODS 2025 CALL FOR RESEARCH PAPERS

The Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management. The 2025 conference will be held in **Berlin, Germany**.

## Mission

The PODS community aims to:

*   Provide a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques, and solutions for data management challenges.
*   Develop new ways of advancing data management to reflect the rich landscape of data requirements in applications.
*   Develop solutions that ensure high levels of efficiency, scalability, usability, expressiveness, robustness, security, clarity, and privacy.
*   Foster an open space for researchers from various areas related to the principles of computer science to discuss, interact, and propose solutions to problems in data management.

## Scope

PODS seeks scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application, and system building in the context of data management. Articles may be based on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks, providing experimental work that sheds light on the scientific foundations, or rigorous analysis of important industry artifacts. PODS pays special attention to papers that help integrate data management techniques within broader computer science.

## Topics of Interest

Topics that fit the interests of the symposium include, but are not limited to:

*   Database processing: Query evaluation, query optimization, schema management, distributed data processing, approximate data processing
*   Database design: Data models, query languages, schemas, constraints
*   Database access: Data structures, access methods, concurrency, transactions
*   Data quality: Data consistency, data cleaning, data discovery, data exploration
*   Data analysis: Data mining, machine learning, information extraction, data streams
*   Uncertainty: Incomplete data, inconsistent data, probabilistic data
*   Interoperability: Mappings and views, data integration, data exchange, ontology-based data access
*   Responsible data management: Access control, privacy, security, verification, ethical aspects of data management
*   Human-database interaction: data summarization, data visualization, explanation for database queries
*   Connections between database principles and other disciplines

## Submission Site

[https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=pods2025)

## Submission Format

*   **Important:** The submission format for PODS 2025 is different from that of previous years, for compatibility with the PACMMOD format of the PODS publications.
*   **LaTex users** must format their submission using the standard ACM ""acmsmall"" proceedings stylesheet: [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)
*   Class declaration: `\documentclass[acmsmall,review,anonymous]{acmart}`
*   A submission can be up to **15 pages**, not including references, plus unlimited space for references.
*   **Appendix:** Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, of unlimited length, that should be incorporated at submission time. However, an appendix will be read at the discretion of the program committee.
*   Papers that are longer than 15 pages or do not cohere with the required format style risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
*   The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere.
*   Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms, and accepted papers will be published in a PODS 2025 issue of the **PACMMOD** (https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod) journal.

## Double-anonymous reviewing

PODS 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous reviewing process. Submissions must adhere to the following:

*   Author names and institutions must be omitted.
*   References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person.
*   Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed.

Authors are encouraged to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would.

## Merit-based acceptance

Paper selection will be merit-based, judged on originality, quality, clarity of presentation, relevance to the field, and technical depth. There is no a priori limit on the number of accepted papers.

## Important Dates

All deadlines end at **5 PM Pacific Time**.
