Papers must include a mandatory section discussing the limitations of the work and, optionally, a section discussing ethical considerations.

Papers can include unlimited pages of references and an unlimited appendix.

Authors should follow the [general instructions for COLING 2025 proceedings](https://coling2025.org/downloads/coling-2025.pdf), which are an adaptation of the general instructions for *ACL proceedings.

To prepare your submission, please use the COLING 2025 style files:

## Submission Routes

### Direct Submission

Papers should be submitted through Softconf/START using the following link: [https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/](https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/)

Each paper will receive a minimum of three reviews. Authors will have the opportunity to provide a short rebuttal. The review process will be **double-blind**.

### ACL Rolling Review (ARR) Papers

Papers reviewed through the ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system can be committed to COLING 2025. These papers will not be re-reviewed. Senior Area Chairs and Program Chairs will make acceptance decisions based on the ARR reviews and meta-reviews.

For additional information, please see the [FAQ for submissions](https://coling2025.org/faqs/submission/).

ARR papers should be committed using [Softconf/START](https://softconf.com/coling2025/papers/).

## Optional Supplementary Materials

Each COLING 2025 submission can be accompanied by a single .tgz or .zip archive containing supplementary materials (e.g., program code, datasets). COLING 2025 encourages the submission of such materials to improve reproducibility. For the main track, supplementary materials must be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.

Additional information, such as preprocessing decisions or model parameters, should be put into the appendix of the main PDF submission. Submissions must remain self-contained.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are 11:59 PM UTC-12:00 (“anywhere on Earth”).

*   Papers must be submitted using the **two-column IEEE Proceedings style** available at the IEEE Conference Publishing Services page.
*   All papers should be at most **12 pages long**, not counting bibliography and well-marked appendices.
*   Anonymized supplementary material such as proof scripts can be uploaded as a tar ball on the submission site.
*   Papers failing to adhere to these instructions will be rejected without consideration of their merits.
*   At least one coauthor of each accepted paper is required to attend CSF to present the paper. Exceptions can be made for visa difficulties.
*   **CSF 2025 will employ double-blind reviewing.** Submitted papers must:
    *   Omit any reference to the authors’ names or the names of their institutions.
    *   Reference the authors’ own related work in the third person (e.g., not ""We build on our previous work…"" but rather ""We build on the work of …"").
*   Submissions should be made via the submission server: [https://hotcrp.csf2025.ieee-security.org/](https://hotcrp.csf2025.ieee-security.org/)

## Ethics

> We expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out the research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so will result in summary rejection of a submission regardless of its quality and scientific value.
>
> Authors are expected to document how they have addressed and mitigated the risks, including considering the impact of their research on deployed systems, understanding costs and risks, safely collecting data, and following responsible disclosure. If the submitted research has the potential to cause harm, the paper should include a clear statement about why the benefit of the research outweighs the harms, and how the authors have taken measures to ensure safety and minimize harms.
>
> If the submitted research has potential to cause harm and authors have access to an Institutional Review Board (IRB), we expect that this IRB is consulted and its approval and recommendations are documented in the paper. IRB approval does not absolve researchers from considering ethical aspects of their work.
>
> We encourage authors to consult with existing documentation, e.g., ""Common Pitfalls in Writing about Security and Privacy Human Subjects Experiments, and How to Avoid Them"" or the Menlo Report and existing Safety consultation entities, e.g., the [Tor Safety Research Board](https://research.torproject.org/safetyboard/).

## Decisions and Revisions

*   The outcome of the review process can be accept, reject, or major revision.
*   Papers with a ""major revision"" decision must be re-submitted within the following two cycles, accompanied by a writeup explaining how the revision meets reviewers’ requirements. These papers may use 16 pages.
*   Rejected papers can be re-submitted at any time. If re-submitted within 11 months of the last deadline, previous reviews and an explanation must be submitted as supplementary material.
