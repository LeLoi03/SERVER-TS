The 22nd Conference on Detection of Intrusions and Malware & Vulnerability Assessment (DIMVA '25) will be held from **July 9 to July 11, 2025**, at **Graz University of Technology, Austria**.

## General Information

The annual DIMVA conference is a premier forum for advancing the state of the art in intrusion detection, malware analysis, and vulnerability assessment. It brings together international experts from academia, industry, and government. DIMVA is organized by the special interest group Security - Intrusion Detection and Response (SIDAR) of the German Informatics Society (GI). The conference proceedings will appear in the **Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series**.

### Intrusions

*   Novel approaches and domains
*   Insider detection
*   Prevention and response
*   Data leakage, exfiltration, and poisoning
*   Result correlation and cooperation
*   Evasion and other attacks
*   Potentials and limitation
*   Operational experiences
*   Privacy, legal, and social aspects
*   Targeted attacks
*   Analysis or detection of cryptocurrency heists

### Malware

*   Automated analyses
*   Behavioral models
*   Prevention and containment
*   Classification
*   Lineage

## Submissions

Submissions should be done via the following web page: [https://disc25.hotcrp.com](https://disc25.hotcrp.com)

### Submission Types

*   **Regular Papers:** Must report on original research that has not previously been published (and may not be concurrently submitted to other journals or conferences with proceedings). All ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in a paper, including experimental results, should be included in the submission.
*   **Brief Announcements:** May describe work in progress or work presented elsewhere. A brief announcement may also present a result that is short and elegant, but does not require a longer paper. It may also be used to announce a software distribution or an experimental result of interest that can be concisely described. The title of a brief announcement should start with the phrase ""Brief Announcement: "".

*A paper that is not accepted as a regular paper may be invited as a brief announcement.* 

## Submission Format

*   Submissions must be in English in pdf format.
*   They must be prepared using the LIPIcs LaTeX style template: `\documentclass[a4paper,anonymous,USenglish]{lipics-v2021}`.
*   Submissions must be anonymous, without any author names, affiliations, or email addresses. The contact information of the authors will be entered separately in the submission metadata.
*   **Regular papers:** No page limit. The initial 15 pages, excluding the title page and a table of contents, should contain a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including a discussion of the paper’s importance within the context of prior work and a description of the key technical and conceptual ideas used to achieve its main claims. Material other than the first 15 pages will be read at the committee’s discretion.
*   **Brief announcements:** Should comply with the above rules, replacing 15 pages with 5 pages.
*   Submissions not conforming to the submission guidelines and papers outside of the scope of the conference will be rejected without consideration.

## Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)

The use of LLMs for submission preparation is permitted, although it is highly recommended that they only be used for cosmetic changes, e.g. proofreading of the text. The use of LLMs in technical parts should be treated in the same way as any other software or system, and thus carefully described and documented in the submission. Ultimately, the authors are responsible for the content of their submission, and mis-use of LLM may result in rejection. Any questions about the LLM use policy should be directed to the PC chair, Dariusz Kowalski (dkowalski@augusta.edu).

## Anonymous Submissions

We will use a relaxed implementation of double-blind peer review. Submissions must not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names and affiliation should not appear in the document itself. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work are in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).

## Conflict of Interest

The submission form provides an opportunity to specify conflicts of interest with any of the PC members and other member of research community. A conflict of interest is limited to the following:

*   A family member or close friend;
*   A Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years;
*   A person with the same affiliation;
*   A person involved in an alleged incident of harassment;
*   Frequent collaborators, or collaborators who have jointly published papers within the last two years.

If you feel that you have a valid reason for a conflict of interest beyond listed above, or any other issues related to the fair treatment of your submission, contact the PC chair, Dariusz Kowalski (dkowalski@augusta.edu), or the SafeTOC representative for DISC, listed at [https://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/](https://safetoc.org/index.php/toc-advisors/).

## Participation at DISC

It is expected that accepted papers and brief announcements be presented in-person at the conference.

## Publication

The proceedings will be published by LIPIcs. The final version of the paper has to be formatted following the LIPIcs guidelines. Regular papers will have 15 pages in the final proceedings (excluding references), and brief announcements will have 5 pages in the proceedings (including everything). If more space is needed, the authors are encouraged to post the full version e.g. on arXiv and refer to it in their paper.

Accepted papers and brief announcements must be presented by one of the authors, with a full registration and according to the final schedule.

Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered for a special issue of the journal Distributed Computing.

The best paper at DISC will be considered for publication in the Journal of the ACM.

## Awards

Awards will be given to the best paper and the best student paper. To be eligible for the best student paper award, at least one of the paper authors must be a full-time student at the time of submission, and the student(s) must have made a significant contribution to the paper.
