The 2025 International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications (ICCSA 2025) will be held from **June 30 to July 3, 2025**, at **Galatasaray University, Istanbul, TÃ¼rkiye**.

ICCSA 2025 offers both **onsite and online participation options**, with virtual registration available at a reduced fee to accommodate researchers in challenging economic and political situations.

## Conference Scope and Goals

Computational science is central to most current research, industrial, and commercial activities, uniquely exploiting innovative ICT technologies. The ICCSA Conference offers an opportunity to bring together scientists from different disciplines, discuss new issues, tackle complex problems, and find advanced solutions that breed new trends in computational science.

## Review Process

Submitted papers will be subject to **stringent peer review** by at least three experts and carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. A **single blind review** method will be used, ensuring the publication of only top-quality contributions.

## Publication

All accepted papers will be included in the **Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS)** series. These proceedings are indexed by Scopus, EI Engineering Index, Thomson Reuters Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in ISI Web of Science), and several other indexing services. Papers will include linked references, XML versions, and citable DOI numbers. Authors of a selected number of top-quality papers will be invited to extend their papers for publication as special issues in highly recognized international journals.

## Warning: Fake ICCSA Conference

Be aware of organizations like WASET that run fake ""conferences"" by spoofing the names of real conferences. The Real ICCSA conference has been organised by the ICCSA Society since 2003. Please spread this news to your contacts and communities to avoid participation in fake conferences.

*   **Length:** Research papers must not exceed **12 pages** not including the references. No appendix is allowed.
*   **File Type:** Only electronic submissions in **PDF format** will be considered.
*   **Originality:** A paper submitted to ICDE 2025 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire time it is considered for ICDE 2025, and it must be substantially different from any previously published work. Submissions must cite prior publications and relevant work.
*   **Author Limit:** Any author of ICDE 2025 should not be a co-author of more than **10 submitted research papers** across the two submission rounds.
*   **Reviewing:** Submissions will be reviewed in a **single-blind manner**.
*   **Revisions:** Papers may be invited to submit a revised version if the PC believes they can be reasonably improved within the allocated revision time frame (five weeks).

*   **No-show Policy:** IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution (e.g., remove it from IEEE Xplore) after the conference if none of the authors attend the conference to present their paper.

## Desk Rejection Policy

ICDE research track submissions that do not meet the following requirements may be rejected without review:

*   Adherence to guidelines, length, and format requirements.
*   Alignment with ICDE 2025 scope (data management, scalability, efficiency aspects).
*   Correct declaration of all conflicts of interest (COI) with members of the program committee. Both not reporting COIs as well as frivolously defining COIs count as a violation.
*   Proper COI declaration in the CMT system is mandatory for all authors.

## Conflict of Interest (COI)

An author X of an ICDE 2025 research paper has a COI with a PC member or Area Chair Y if one or more of the following conditions hold:

*   X is a co-author of another ICDE 2025 submission together with Y.
*   X has been a co-author of Y in a publication in the past three years.
*   X has been a co-author of Y for 4 (or more) publications in the last 10 years.
*   X has been a co-worker of Y in the same company or university within the past three years.
*   X has been a collaborator of Y within the past three years (e.g., held a joint grant).
*   X is or was Yâ€™s primary thesis advisor or vice versa.
*   X is a relative or a close personal friend of Y.

The onus for correctly declaring COIs rests with the authors. Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information are subject to immediate rejection.

## Reviewing Process

Papers will be stringently reviewed with at least 3 reviews per paper, coordinated by a meta-reviewer. Revisions will go through an additional round of reviews before a final decision.

## Inclusions and Diversity in Writing

Authors are encouraged to use mindful language and examples that promote diversity and inclusion, and avoid language or examples that further marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group.",Đã có link 2026: https://icde2026.github.io/,0.00,

*   **Conflict of Interest (COI):** Authors must correctly declare all conflicts of interest with members of the program committee. Failure to do so, or frivolous declaration, will result in desk-rejection.
    *   **Declaration:** It is the responsibility of authors to identify and declare all COIs. A searchable spreadsheet of COIs is provided as a resource.
    *   **CMT Profile:** Each author must create a CMT profile and complete it with domain and individual conflicts. Papers with missing COI profiles for any author will be desk-rejected.

## Reviewing Process

*   Papers will be stringently reviewed with at least **3 reviews per paper**.
*   The review process will be coordinated by a meta-reviewer, leading to a decision (accept, reject, or revise).
*   **Revisions:** Papers may be invited for revision if the PC believes they can be reasonably improved within the allocated time (five weeks).

## Inclusions and Diversity in Writing

We value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and profession. Be mindful in your writing to avoid language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people. Reviewers will monitor and demand changes if such issues arise.

## Conflict of Interest (COI) Definition

An author X of an ICDE 2025 research paper has a COI with a PC member or Area Chair Y if any of the following conditions hold:
*   X is a co-author of another ICDE 2025 submission with Y.
*   X has co-authored publications with Y in the past three years.
*   X has co-authored 4 or more publications with Y in the last 10 years.
*   X has been a co-worker of Y in the same company or university within the past three years.
*   X has been a collaborator of Y within the past three years (e.g., held a joint grant).
*   X is or was Yâ€™s primary thesis advisor or vice versa.
*   X is a relative or a close personal friend of Y (or vice versa).

The onus for correctly declaring COIs rests with the authors.

The 18th International Conference on Interactive Digital Storytelling (ICIDS 2025) will be held from **December 1-5, 2025**, in **Malta**.

## Theme: Kaleidoscopic Machines

This year's conference explores the increasing injection of generative AI into the development, performance, and analysis of Interactive Digital Narratives (IDNs). Inspired by Janet Murray's concept of IDNs as environments fostering multiple contexts and variants of scenarios, the theme ""Kaleidoscopic Machines"" highlights the collaboration between AI and human creators to generate new narrative possibilities. The conference aims to analyze the past, present current thinking, and contemplate future directions in the field, reflecting on AI's influence on creation and creativity.

## Areas of Interest

*   **Theory, History, and Foundations:** Exploring fundamental, theoretical aspects of interactive digital storytelling, narrative structures, interactivity, and conceptual underpinnings of IDNs, including historical context.
*   **Methods and Tools:** Research on frameworks, procedures, and pipelines supporting analysis of principles, methods, rules, and postulates in the field, as well as innovative tools, methodologies, and technical frameworks for creating IDNs.
*   **Applications and Case Studies:** Explorations of interactive digital storytelling in practice, including educational applications, collaborative narrative experiences, virtual worlds, games, and performances, focusing on audience engagement and practical outcomes.
*   **Social, Cultural and Critical Perspectives:** Analysis of sociocultural implications and ethical dimensions of interactive digital storytelling, including representation, accessibility, cultural context, power dynamics, and authorship issues.

## Submission Categories
