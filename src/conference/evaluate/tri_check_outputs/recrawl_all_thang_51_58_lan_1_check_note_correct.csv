## Submission Guidelines

SEAA 2025 encourages the submission of **full research papers** (maximum 8 pages), **short papers**, **tool demo papers** (maximum 4 pages), and **posters** (maximum 2 pages). Papers follow a single-blinded reviewing process and must contain original unpublished work, describe significant novel contributions, and provide evidence about the validation of the results. Reports on industrial applications are also welcome.

Papers submitted to SEAA 2025 must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for SEAA 2025. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases.

Accepted papers will by published by Springer in their Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series: [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs)

As per SEAA tradition, submitted papers shall adhere to the two-column IEEE conference proceedings format, which has historically guided the submission standards for the conference. Please use the available templates. LaTeX users should use the following configuration: `\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}`. Microsoft Word users should use the US Letter format template.

All submissions for all tracks and special sessions at SEAA 2025 must be in PDF format and submitted online by the deadline via the EasyChair conference management system at: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=seaa2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=seaa2025)

Submissions that do not adhere to the required format or fall outside the scope of the conference will be desk-rejected without review. Those that comply with the submission guidelines and align with the conference’s scope will undergo peer review by three program committee members. Each submission will be evaluated based on its significance, originality, clarity of presentation, technical soundness, evaluation (when applicable), and the relevance and quality of comparisons to related work.

It aims to provide a unified, high-impact forum for researchers and industry professionals to present state-of-the-art research, exchange novel ideas, and address key challenges at the intersection of sensing systems and embedded artificial intelligence. SenSys 2026 will be co-located with CPS-IoT Week 2026 in Saint-Malo, France.","# SenSys 2026: Call for Papers

We are excited to announce the International Conference on Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Sensing Systems (SenSys 2026), co-located with the CPS-IoT Week.

SenSys 2026 merges SenSys, IPSN, and IoTDI into a single, top-ranked, flagship event. The original three conferences have driven innovation across multiple disciplines, including sensor networks, embedded systems, mobile computing, machine learning, wireless communications, signal processing, embedded AI, cyber-physical systems, and AI-driven applications. SenSys 2026 unites these communities to foster a high-impact forum that advances research at the intersection of sensing systems and embedded artificial intelligence.

SenSys 2026 is still pending the final approval of ACM and IEEE. Regular technical papers will be published in the ACM conference proceedings, while demos and posters will be published in the IEEE conference proceedings. All content will be cross-indexed.

Authors submitting papers in the last category (Visions, Experiences, Tools, Datasets, and Benchmarks) may choose between a full paper (12 pages) or a short paper (6 pages). Short papers will be judged on originality, potential impact, and clarity, even without extensive evaluation. Both types of papers will be presented orally at the conference.

## Double Deadline

Thanks to the merging of several conferences, SenSys will transition to a new submission process with two deadlines.

Papers rejected in one cycle can be resubmitted to the next, but only with a strong statement justifying in detail how the revised version addresses the reviewers’ concerns. Resubmissions lacking this justification will be desk-rejected.

## Submission Guidelines

Submitted papers must be original, unpublished work, and must not be under review for any other publication at the time of submission. Submissions must be at most **12 pages (full papers)** or **6 pages (short papers)**, and must include all figures and tables within the page limits. References may use as many pages as needed. Both formats should be prepared on single-spaced 8.5” x 11” pages, using a 9-point font size in a two-column layout. Submissions must follow either the LaTeX template (preferred) or Word style files. LaTeX submissions should specifically use the acmart.cls template with the sigconf option.

Authors are expected to make a good-faith effort to anonymize their manuscripts. The presence of non-anonymous preprints (such as those on arXiv or similar repositories) will not result in rejection. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but incidentally discovering such materials will not violate the double-blind policy. Submissions that do not comply with the specified size, formatting, or anonymization guidelines will not be reviewed. All papers must be submitted in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) through the designated conference submission system.

For submissions that involve research with human participants, including those using anonymized data, authors must include a brief description of how ethical considerations were addressed and whether the work received approval from an ethics review board (e.g., IRB). All authors are expected to comply with the policies of their institutions regarding data collection and research involving human subjects.

Submit your paper at [https://sensys26.hotcrp.com](https://sensys26.hotcrp.com).

## Camera-Ready Manuscript Details

Accepted submissions will be available on the ACM digital library. Please note that ACM uses 9-pt fonts in all conference proceedings, and the templates in both LaTeX and Word implicitly define the font size to 9-pt. Please refer to the publication chair's earlier Note and the User Guide of the new class.
