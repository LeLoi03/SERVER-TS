## Overview

Coordination, organizations, institutions, norms, and ethics are five key governance elements for the regulation of open multi-agent systems. COINE is an evolution of the COIN workshop series, aiming to bring together researchers in autonomous agents and multi-agent systems working on the scientific and technological aspects of social coordination, organizational theory, normative MAS, artificial or electronic institutions, and agents aware of norms, policies, and ethics.

The workshop complements the main AAMAS program by allowing a more relaxed and in-depth discussion of MAS from a social perspective, fostering debate and collaboration among researchers.

## Topics of Interest

We invite submissions that address any of the following aspects:

*   Mathematical, logical, computational, philosophical, legal, and pragmatic issues related to coordination, organizations, institutions, norms, and ethics in MAS.
*   Modeling, animation, and simulation techniques for open MAS.
*   Tools, prototypes, and actual working systems.
*   Topics investigating the relationship between COINE and the rapidly evolving AI landscape (e.g., including LLMs and Generative AI).
*   Topics exploring the value-aligned problems within MAS in the COINE domain.
*   Experimental investigation of the effectiveness of COINE technologies.
*   Challenging or innovative ideas relevant to the field.

## Submission

Submission is through the EasyChair conference system, by following the [link](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cpm2025). The submission process requires registration to create an EasyChair account prior to submission.

## Submission Format

The authors should submit an extended abstract not exceeding 12 single-spaced pages on A4 paper, excluding the title page (containing title, authors, affiliations, e-mail addresses, a short abstract, and keywords) and the references. The authors are required to use the [LaTeX style file](https://submission.dagstuhl.de/series/details/LIPIcs#author) supplied by Dagstuhl (LIPIcs). Papers must be submitted as a single file in PDF format.

Additional material intended for the referees but not for publication in the final version - for example details of proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. The program code of experimental papers should be made public, with reasonable documentation, such that the PC may evaluate replicability of experimental results.

Papers submitted for review should represent original, previously unpublished work and surveys of important results. At the time the extended abstract is submitted to CPM, and for the entire review period, the paper (or essentially the same paper) should not be under review by any other conference with published proceedings or by a scientific journal.

At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference as a registered participant. The conference will be held in person at the University of Milano-Bicocca, within easy reach from the city center of Milan, Italy.

Crypto 2025, the 45th annual international cryptology conference, will be held in **Santa Barbara, California, USA on August 17-21, 2025**. The conference is organized by [the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR)](https://iacr.org/).

## General Information

Crypto 2025 is a **hybrid conference**, offering the option for either physical presence or virtual participation. Given recent instances of US visa holders and residents being detained or deported by US immigration authorities, we understand that some members of our community may not feel safe traveling to the US for Crypto this year. We want to assure everyone that we will provide the option to present remotely.

The proceedings will be published by **Springer in the LNCS series**.

## Topics of Interest

Original research papers are welcomed on any cryptographic topic, including but not limited to:

*   Foundational theory and mathematics
*   The design, proposal, and analysis of cryptographic primitives and protocols
*   Secure implementation and optimization in hardware or software
*   Applied aspects of cryptography

## How to Submit

Author instructions for paper submission may be found on the submission page. The submission server is now open.

## Review Process

Submissions must not substantially duplicate published work or work that has been submitted in parallel to any other journal or conference/workshop with published proceedings. Accepted submissions may not appear in any other conference or workshop that has proceedings.

The review process will consist of two rounds with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee will reject some submissions; the rest will proceed to the second round. At the end of the first round, the authors will be either notified of rejection, or invited to submit a response to questions from the program committee (if any). The authors' response will be used to make the final decision in the second round.

The double-blind review process will follow the IACR Conflict of Interest Policy. The authors will be asked, at submission time, to help identify program committee members with potential conflicts of interest.

## Awards

The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall **Best Paper Award**. The Program Committee may also award a prize for the **best paper(s) authored exclusively by students and postdocs** (at the time of submission). Awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.

## Stipends

Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. A limited number of stipends will be available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Application instructions will be posted together with other registration information.

*   Blockchains and distributed ledger security
*   Code based cryptography
*   Cryptanalysis
*   Cryptographic standards
*   Design and security analysis of cryptographic primitives and protocols

## Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers

We also welcome Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. These papers will not be judged on novel research contributions, but on their value to the research community. SoK papers should provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area; support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence; or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate for acceptance.

## Replicability

For submissions including practical evaluations, it is encouraged (but not required) to make implementations available to facilitate replicability and reproducibility.

## Publication

Accepted papers (including SoK papers) will appear in the CT-RSA proceedings, published by **Springer** in its **LNCS series**.

## Presentation Requirements

CT-RSA is scheduled to be an in-person event. It is strongly preferred that authors of accepted papers present their work in-person. Exceptions will be made only in the case of serious extenuating circumstances, such as COVID restrictions, visa delays, and other emergencies. The presenter of each paper will be given a **free Full Pass to RSA Conference**.

## Important Dates

*   **Paper submission:** **October 30, 2024**
*   **Notification of decision:** **January 10, 2025**
*   **Camera-ready versions due:** **January 20, 2025**
*   **Author presentations due:** **April 03, 2025**
*   **Conference:** **April 28â€“May 1, 2025**
