> Note that all submissions will be checked using suitable AI content detectors

## Double-Blind Reviewing

The conference will employ a **lightweight double-blind reviewing process**. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authorsâ€™ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear anywhere in the submission. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. Use the third person to refer to the author's previous work, e.g., replace ""as we have shown before"" with ""as shown before in [X].""

In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC Co-Chairs by email at icdcn2025-tpc-chairs@iit.cnr.it.

The 9th IEEE International Conference on Fog and Edge Computing (ICFEC 2025) is a leading forum to disseminate and discuss research activities and results on a broad range of topics in the fields of fog and edge computing. ICFEC 2025 will take place in conjunction with The 25th International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid 2025) from **May 19-22, 2025**, in **TromsÃ¸, Norway**.

## About Fog and Edge Computing

Fog and edge computing are seen as alternatives to cloud-based computational resources, especially in scenarios with large amounts of data produced in distributed settings (e.g., IoT) requiring near real-time processing or when suboptimal network connectivity hampers data upload to the cloud. Use cases span smart factories, smart grids, and autonomous vehicles. Current challenges include developing new abstractions for programming and storage models, addressing security, privacy, and trust in distributed systems, managing resources of mobile and hardware-constrained devices, processing large data streams, integrating novel communication protocols, and enabling distributed machine learning like federated learning.

## Topics of Interest

The conference seeks high-quality contributions covering both theory and practice in systems research and emerging domain-specific applications related to next-generation distributed systems across the cloud-edge compute continuum. This includes mist computing, edge computing, multi-access edge computing, fog computing, and mobile cloud computing. Some representative topics include:

*   Data centers and infrastructures along the compute continuum
*   Mobility management along the compute continuum
*   Federated learning and distributed machine learning in and for the compute continuum
*   5G/6G for the compute continuum
*   Middleware and runtime systems for the compute continuum
*   Programming models for the compute continuum
*   Storage and data management platforms along the compute continuum
*   Scheduling and resource management for the compute continuum
*   Security, privacy, trust, and provenance issues for the compute continuum
*   Distributed consensus and blockchains in the compute continuum
*   Modeling and simulation for and in the compute continuum

ACM ICMR follows a **double-blind review process** for full paper selection. Authors should not know the names of the reviewers of their papers, and reviewers should not know the name(s) of the author(s). Please prepare your paper in a way that preserves anonymity of the authors:

*   Do not put your names under the title.
*   Avoid using phrases such as â€œour previous workâ€ when referring to earlier publications by the authors.
*   Remove information that may identify the authors in the acknowledgments (e.g., co-workers and grant IDs).
*   Check supplemental material for information that may identify the authorsâ€™ identity.
*   Avoid providing links to Websites that identify the authors.

## Abstract and Keywords

The abstract and the keywords form the primary source for assigning papers to reviewers. So make sure that they form a concise and complete summary of your paper with sufficient information to let someone who has not read the full paper know what it is about.

## Submission Instructions

See the [Paper Submission]( /authors/paper-submissions ) section.

## Presentation Format

ACM ICMR 2025 will be an in-person event. All oral talks and demonstrations must be on-site at the conference venue, otherwise they will be removed from the proceedings and no refund given. This includes full papers, BNI papers and doctoral symposium papers. Posters should be presented at the conference, but we will also facilitate online posters using our online conference platform. This platform requires the upload of a poster and short accompanying video. We will be strictly enforcing this policy across all submission types.

We expect and require that for each accepted paper at least one author fully (non-student) register into the conference before the camera-ready deadline. We are working on a way to allow remote presentation in case authors are unable to join in person.",,100.00,
