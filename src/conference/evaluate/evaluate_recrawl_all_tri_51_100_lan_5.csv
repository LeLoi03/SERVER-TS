## Submissions

[MEMOCODE'25](https://memocode2025.github.io/) calls for three kinds of submissions: Regular Papers, Late-Breaking Results, and Tool Presentations. All papers must be written in English and formatted according to the ACM Sigconf style conference template. A double-blind review process will be enforced, and authors must not reveal their identity directly or indirectly. Submission of papers is handled via [HotCRP](https://memocode25.hotcrp.com/).

### Regular Papers:

Are no longer than ten (10) pages, excluding bibliography and appendices. They should describe original work that does not overlap with another publication or a submission under review or accepted for publication by any other conference or journal. Reviewers will check regular papers for the soundness and novelty of the proposed solutions.

### Tool Papers:

are no longer than eight (8) pages, excluding bibliography and appendices. They should describe an existing and publicly available tool that implements relevant methods. The methods might have been published before, but the tool should not have been described in a tool paper previously. In addition to reviewing the paper, reviewers will assess the tool itself using inputs and a user's manual provided by the authors on the tool's web page.

### Late-Breaking Results (LB):

Papers are no longer than four (4) pages, excluding bibliography and appendices. They should describe a promising and novel idea with a potential to get breakthrough in the field. Reviewers will judge the novelty of the idea, but do not yet expect proofs for the envisioned results.

For questions regarding technical submissions, feel free to contact one of the program committee co-chairs.

All accepted papers (regular papers, late-breaking results, and tool papers) will be submitted for inclusion in ACM Digital Library. Publication in the proceedings is contingent on one author registering for and presenting the paper at the conference.

## Outstanding Paper Award

A selection of papers will be recognized as Outstanding Papers and highlighted on the symposium website.

## Special Journal Edition

Selected accepted papers will be invited to extend their accepted papers (at least 30% additional content) for a special edition in the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (ACM TECS).

Authors must follow the call for submissions for the special edition to check deadlines and the timeline of the review process. The extended version will undergo a separate review process in the journal.",

Papers - Call for Papers

Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.

## The Character of Onward! Papers

Onward! Papers is looking for grand visions and new paradigms that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. But it is not looking for research-as-usual papers—conferences like OOPSLA are the place for that. Those conferences require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, which are necessary for scientific progress, but which typically preclude discussion of early-stage ideas. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

## Selection Process

Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a double-blind manner. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation.

Onward! Papers follows a two-phase review process. This enables us to welcome papers that contain promising ideas and have the potential to meet the conference’s standards, but which may fall short of this in the initial submission. At the end of the first phase, all papers will be either: accepted normally; or asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. The authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete the revisions, at which point the original reviewers decide on the final acceptance of the paper. All papers will thus remain under submission until the authors receive notification of acceptance or rejection.

We expect the typical strong submission to be accepted normally, with authors expected—as is conventional—to revise the paper using the program committee’s feedback.

The program committee may identify certain papers with promising ideas as needing important revisions. These papers will be handled in one of two ways. They may be assigned a shepherd, in the tradition followed by numerous conferences. Otherwise, they will be given a concrete set of goals to accomplish in the revision. In the latter case, the second submission must then be accompanied by a cover letter mapping the revision requests to specific parts of the paper; the program committee will use the cover letter and revised submission to arrive at a final decision.

The second phase will only be used to elevate promising papers to the conference’s standard, not to require additional work of papers already deemed up-to-standard. Now submissions are not allowed for the second phase deadline.

## Instructions for Authors

For fairness reasons, all submitted papers should conform to the formatting instructions (see below). Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the Program Chair.

Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference but that is not required. There will be a remote participation option, the details of which are to be decided.

## Submission Site

[https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/](https://onward2025papers.hotcrp.com/)

## Concurrent Submissions

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy. Submitters should also be aware of ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism.

## Policy on Double Blind Review

Onward! 2025 is using a double-blind submission process. This means that authors will not know who reviewed their papers, and reviewers will not know who authored the papers they review. The aim of double-blind is to treat all papers with minimal bias. Authors must take the following actions to prepare their papers for double-blind reviewing:

*   Remove identifying information (names, institutions, etc) from the author block of the first page of the paper.
*   To the extent possible, when authors cite their own work, they should refer to it in the third person.
*   To the extent possible, authors should remove any other potentially identifying information, such as acknowledgements.

After submitting their review, reviewers will be able to see author identities. When the paper is accepted for publication, the camera-ready copy must not be blinded.

See OOPSLA’s FAQ on double-blind reviewing for more information. Please contact the PC chair if you have any questions.

## Policy on Authorship Changes

Any addition of authors after initial submission of a paper must be cleared with the PC chair. Authors are very strongly advised to list all authors prior to initial submission as the addition of authors may create new conflicts with the PC. In all cases, the PC chair must be provided with a rationale. The PC chair has the authority to reject any requested change.

## Format

Submissions should use [ACM SIGPLAN Conference acmart Format](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/), sigplan sub-format and 10 point font. All submissions should be in PDF format.

If you are formatting your paper using LaTeX, you will need to use the sigplan, anonymous and review options. Note that by default the SIGPLAN template produces two-column, 9 point papers, but you will need to you will need to set the 10pt option in the `\documentclass` command. If you are formatting your paper using Word, you may wish to use the provided Word template that supports this font size. Please include page numbers in your submission. Setting the review option in the LaTeX `\documentclass` command generates page numbers, and the anonymous option hides author names. Please also ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes are legible.

## Page Limit

To ensure that papers stay focused on their core contributions, the main part of the paper (excluding bibliographic references) should be no longer than 13 pages. There is no page limit for bibliographic references and appendices, and, therefore, for the overall submission. However, reviewers are not obligated to read the appendices, so the main part of the paper should be self contained. If the paper is accepted or the authors are asked for revisions, the revised main body of the manuscript and final submission will be limited to 17 pages plus references and supplementary material. (The 13-page limit for the main body of the paper no longer applies.)

## Publication (Digital Library Early Access Warning)

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

The 27th International Symposium on Practical Aspects of Declarative Languages (**PADL**) is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming, including functional and logic programming, databases and constraint programming, and theorem proving.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   Innovative applications of declarative languages
*   Declarative domain-specific languages and applications
*   Practical applications of theoretical results
*   New language developments and their impact on applications
*   Declarative languages and software engineering
*   Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications
*   Practical experiences and industrial applications
*   Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom
*   Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages

PADL 2025 especially welcomes new ideas and approaches related to applications, design, and implementation of declarative languages going beyond the scope of the past PADL symposia, for example, advanced database languages and contract languages, as well as verification and theorem-proving methods that rely on declarative languages.

PADL 2025 encourages students to participate in the symposium by providing some student grants to partially cover the registration and travel costs. The selection process will give preference to students who present their paper in the symposium. Students from underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged to apply.

## Submissions

PADL 2025 welcomes regular papers (max. **15 pages**, excluding references) and short papers (max. **8 pages**, excluding references) that describe original and previously unpublished research results on:

*   complex and/or real-world applications in industry or in other areas of research, that rely on an innovative use of declarative languages,
*   tools and/or systems developed for such applications, and/or to improve practical aspects of declarative languages,
*   technical results related to the practical aspects of declarative languages.

Application and systems descriptions, engineering solutions, and real-world experiences (both positive and negative) are in particular solicited. Regular and short papers will be published in the formal proceedings.

PADL 2025 also welcomes extended abstracts (max. **3 pages**) on the topics above, that describe new ideas, a new perspective on already published work, or work-in-progress that is not yet ready for a full publication. Extended abstracts will be posted on the symposium website but will not be published in the formal proceedings.

All page limits exclude references. Submissions must be written in English and formatted according to the standard Springer LNCS style, see [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines)

The review process of PADL 2025 is double-anonymous. In your submission, please, omit your names and institutions; refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others; do not include acknowledgments that might identify you.

Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version - for example, details of proofs - may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. Reviewers are at liberty to ignore appendices and papers must be understandable without them.

Papers should be submitted electronically via [EquinOCS](https://equinocs.springernature.com/service/padl2025) (registration is required if you do not have an account).

PEPM 2025 will take place in Denver, Colorado, United States, and welcomes submissions in semantics-based program manipulation, including program synthesis, optimization, and techniques for distributed and concurrent programs.","# PEPM 2025: Call for Papers

The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation (PEPM) has a history going back to 1991 and has been held in conjunction with POPL every year since 2006. PEPM 2025 will be part of POPL 2025, taking place in **Denver, Colorado, United States**.

The origin of PEPM is in the discoveries of practically useful automated techniques for evaluating programs with only partial input. Over time, PEPM has broadened its scope to include a variety of research areas centered around semantics-based program manipulation — the systematic exploitation of treating programs not only as subject to black-box execution, but also as data structures that can be generated, analyzed, and transformed while establishing or maintaining important semantic properties.

## Scope

In addition to the traditional PEPM topics, PEPM 2025 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular:

*   Semantics-based and machine-learning-based program synthesis and program optimization.
*   Modeling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications.

More generally, topics of interest for PEPM 2025 include, but are not limited to:

*   Program and model manipulation techniques such as: supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation.
*   Techniques that treat programs/models as data objects including metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages, program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation.
*   Program analysis techniques that are used to drive program/model manipulation such as: abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation.
*   Application of the above techniques including case studies of program manipulation in real-world (industrial, open-source) projects and software development processes, descriptions of robust tools capable of effectively handling realistic applications, benchmarking. Examples of application domains include legacy program understanding and transformation, DSL implementations, visual languages and end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware frameworks and infrastructure needed for distributed and web-based applications, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security.

If you have a question as to whether a potential submission is within the scope of the workshop, please contact the program co-chairs, Guillaume Allais (guillaume.allais@strath.ac.uk) and Annie Liu (liu@cs.stonybrook.edu).

## Submission Types

Three kinds of submissions will be accepted:

*   **Regular Research Papers:** Should describe new results and will be judged on originality, correctness, significance, and clarity. Regular research papers must not exceed 12 pages.
*   **Short Papers:** May include tool demonstrations and presentations of exciting if not fully polished research and of interesting academic, industrial, and open-source applications that are new or unfamiliar. Short papers must not exceed 6 pages.
*   **Talk Proposals:** May propose lectures about topics of interest for PEPM, existing work representing relevant contributions, or promising contributions that are not mature enough to be proposed as papers of the other categories. Talk Proposals must not exceed 2 pages.

References and appendices are not included in page limits. Appendices may not necessarily be read by reviewers. Both kinds of submissions should be typeset using the two-column ‘sigplan’ sub-format of the new ‘acmart’ format available at:

[http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/](http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/)

and submitted electronically via HotCRP:

[https://pepm25.hotcrp.com](https://pepm25.hotcrp.com)

Reviewing will be single-blind.

Submissions are welcome from PC members (except the two co-chairs).

Accepted regular research papers will appear in formal proceedings published by ACM and be included in the ACM Digital Library. Accepted short papers do not constitute formal publications and will not appear in the proceedings.

At least one author of each accepted contribution must attend the workshop (physically or virtually) to present the work. In the case of tool demonstration papers, a live demonstration of the described tool is expected.

## Conference Format

The conference will be fully on-site. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to attend the conference and present the work there.

## Paper Submission

The IFIP Performance 2025 conference accepts submissions in two categories:

*   **Regular papers:** 20 pages
*   **Short papers:** 5 pages in the new PER double-column format (which corresponds to the former 10 pages)

### Format of regular paper submissions

Regular papers should not exceed 20 pages (single-column format) for technical content, including all tables and figures (references are excluded from the page limit). Authors are recommended to use the Elsevier article class `elsarticle.cls` (with the `3p` document class option) to prepare their manuscript and BibTeX to generate their bibliography. See also the guide for authors [here](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/performance-evaluation/0166-5316/guide-for-authors).

Authors may include an appendix (of unrestricted length) but only to justify the technical correctness of the claims stated in the main paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. However, the appendix should serve as supplementary material only, as reviewers will evaluate the novelty and significance of the submission based on the main content of the paper and are not obligated to review the appendix.

### Format of short paper submissions

Short papers are limited to 5 pages (in the new PER double-column format) for technical content, including all tables and figures (references are excluded from the page limit). Authors may include an appendix (of unrestricted length) but only to justify the technical correctness of the claims stated in the main paper, e.g., a subset of the proofs or additional experimental validation. However, the appendix should serve as supplementary material only, as reviewers will evaluate the novelty and significance of the submission based on the main content of the paper and are not obligated to review the appendix.

Accepted short papers will be published in a special ACM Performance Evaluation Review (PER) issue. Please find the style files [here](link_to_style_files).

### Instructions for all submissions

Papers must be submitted through the [hotCRP platform](https://performance2025.hotcrp.com/) in printable PDF form. No changes to margins, spacing, or font sizes are allowed from those specified by the style files. Papers violating the formatting guidelines will be returned without review.

All submissions will be reviewed using a double-blind review process. The identity of authors and referees will not be revealed to each other. To ensure double-blind reviewing, authors’ names and affiliations should not appear in the paper, and bibliographic references should be made in such a way as to preserve author anonymity. Please refer to the anonymity guidelines below in the “Policies” section for more information.

Authors must declare conflicts with TPC members truthfully on the submission page. If a paper is found to have undeclared conflicts or has listed false conflicts, the paper may be rejected.

Performance welcomes manuscripts that are new versions of earlier submissions. Authors of papers previously submitted to Sigmetrics 2023 are required to declare this information during paper registration. They can include a response to the Sigmetrics reviews in a clearly marked appendix that will not count against the page limit. The paper will then be reviewed again as a new submission by at least one of its Sigmetrics reviewers to aid consistency.

## Special Issues

By default, accepted regular papers will be published in a special Performance Evaluation (PEVA) issue. Additionally, an extended abstract will be published in a special ACM Performance Evaluation Review (PER) issue. However, authors may opt-out of publication in PEVA in favor of an expedited review process in journals related to Performance Evaluation and Operations Research.

The following journals will provide an expedited review process of accepted papers:

*   [ACM Transactions on Modeling and Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems (ToMPECS)](https://tompecs.acm.org/)
*   Queueing Systems: Theory and Application (QUESTA)
*   Stochastic Models

## Policies

### Soft tracking

IFIP Performance uses “soft” tracking to better match reviewers with submitted papers and to more clearly define the scope of submissions. Authors must select a track from among the four listed on the submission website when submitting their paper.

The four tracks are:

*   **Learning:**
*   **Measurement & Applied Modelling:**
*   **Systems:**
*   **Theory:**

### Anonymity guidelines

IFIP Performance is double-blind, meaning that authors should make a good-faith effort to anonymize papers. However, only non-destructive anonymization is required.

Publication of a pre-submission version of the submission on your personal website, institutional archive, or the arXiv is allowed. We strongly encourage the authors to do so as far away as possible from the submission deadline.

PC members and other reviewers are expected not to attempt to deanonymize papers actively. If a double-blind review is breached, the author and the reviewer should report it to the PC chairs.

### Further considerations

The list of authors is expected to remain the same for accepted papers between the submission stage and the final camera-ready stage.

The paper must have a substantive title and abstract. 

Submissions must present original research. 

Simultaneous submissions are not allowed.

Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered.

## Ethical Considerations

Papers describing experiments with users or user data should follow the basic principles of ethical research. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues.

## Diversity & Inclusiveness

As part of our efforts to foster diversity and inclusiveness, we provide the following guidelines to assist you when preparing your paper submission and/or conference presentation.

### Inclusivity guidelines

Good technical writing often requires pedagogical examples to explain complex ideas. These provide an opportunity to promote inclusiveness by challenging implicit biases and assumptions.

### Accessibility guidelines

Make sure that the contents of your paper are accessible to all.

## Rebuttal Period

Papers reaching the second round of reviewing will be given an opportunity to write a rebuttal to reviewer questions. The rebuttal period will be interactive.

## Resubmission of Rejected Papers

Rejected papers must wait one year before resubmission to IEEE S&P.

## Instructions for Paper Submission

All submissions must be original work. Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue is not allowed.

### Cap on number of submissions

Any author may not submit more than 6 papers per cycle.

### Anonymous Submission

Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review. Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.

### Conflicts of Interest

It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all and only their potential conflict-of-interest PC members.

### Research Ethics Committee

IEEE S&P 2026 has a research ethics committee (REC) that will check papers flagged by reviewers as potentially including ethically fraught research. Authors are encouraged to review the [Menlo Report](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CSD-MenloReport-July2012-v2.pdf) for general ethical guidelines for computer and information security research.

### Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure

Researchers should act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm to affected users and, where possible, affirmatively protects those users. The committee’s sense is that a disclosure window of 45 to 90 days ahead of publication is consistent with authors’ ethical obligations.

### Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research

Submissions that describe experiments that could be viewed as involving human subjects, that analyze data derived from human subjects (even anonymized data), or that otherwise may put humans at risk should:

*   Disclose whether the research received an approval or waiver from each of the authors’ institutional ethics review boards (IRB) if applicable.
*   Discuss steps taken to ensure that participants and others who might have been affected by an experiment were treated ethically and with respect.

### Financial and Non-financial competing interests

The IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy requires authors and PC members to declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in relation to the work described. More information regarding this policy is available [here](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2022/financial-con.html).

## Page Limit and Formatting

Submitted papers may include up to 13 pages of text and up to 5 pages for references and appendices, totaling no more than 18 pages. All submissions must use the IEEE “compsoc” conference proceedings template.  Papers that fail to use the “compsoc” template, modify margins, font, or line spacing, or use egregious space scrunching are subject to rejection without review.

## Withdrawing Policy

A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper can not be withdrawn.

## Authorship Policy

Changes to the authorship list (adding, removing, reordering authors) are not permitted while the paper is under submission. All authors are required to submit an ORCID number at paper submission time.

## Conference Submission Server

Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf).

*   First deadline: [https://cycle1.sp2026.ieee-security.org/](https://cycle1.sp2026.ieee-security.org/)

## Publication and Presentation

Authors are responsible for obtaining appropriate publication clearances. One of the authors of the accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference.",

The conference invites submissions related to patterns in software, design, and various aspects of the built world.","# PLoP 2025: Call for Submissions

The Pattern Languages of Programs conference (PLoP™) is the premier event for pattern authors and enthusiasts to gather, discuss, and learn more about patterns, design, software development, and the built world in general.

PLoP 2025 welcomes paper authors and nonauthors alike. Writers’ Workshops offer authors the opportunity to improve their papers. Imagination Run Wild sessions offer everyone, including newcomers, an opportunity to learn about patterns and related topics.

## Types of Submissions

PLoP accepts two types of submissions:

*   **Papers**
*   **Imagination Run Wild Submissions**

## Paper Submissions

We welcome papers describing patterns and pattern languages, experience reports, essays, empirical evaluations, reflections, etc. After the initial screening by the program committee, you will get the opportunity to improve your paper under the guidance of a dedicated shepherd. If your paper is accepted at the conference, it will be discussed in a writers’ workshop session with other authors and participants. Based on what you learn at writers’ workshops, you will make final improvements to your paper after the conference and submit it for the proceedings.

If you have any questions about paper submissions, contact Hugo Ferreira, the papers program chair at [ploppapers@hillside.net](mailto:ploppapers@hillside.net).

[SUBMIT YOUR PAPER!](https://submission.plopcon.org/plop/2025/submission/gate.cgi)

## Imagination Run Wild Submissions

We welcome proposals for hour-long presentations that will get all of us thinking as well as 5-minute lightning talks that explore partially formed ideas. Longer sessions may include workshops/focus groups that bring together people interested in exploring a topic. Free format groups may include open spaces or fishbowls. Half-baked ideas could be discussed in a planned or pop-up birds-of-feather.

Let your imagination run wild and propose something! The conference organizers are open to receiving a variety of session types and activities. If you wish to propose an activity that does not fit into any of the formats mentioned in this call, contact Kiyoka Hayashi, the “Imagination Run Wild” program chair to discuss it at [plopirw@hillside.net](mailto:plopirw@hillside.net).

Reports from any of these sessions may be included in the conference proceedings (subject to review).

[SUBMIT YOUR PROPOSAL!](https://submission.plopcon.org/plop/2025/submission/gate.cgi)

## Paper Submission & Review Process

The papers submitted at PLoP are discussed in Writers’ Workshops, where authors work together to improve their papers. Before papers are accepted for a Writers’ Workshop, they are shepherded. Shepherding is an iterative process, in which an experienced author discusses a submission with an author to refine a paper prior to the conference. All paper submissions are peer-reviewed after shepherding. This process does not apply to Imagination Run Wild submissions.

The paper submission process has three stages:

1.  Submissions are assessed for suitability and quality by the program committee. See examples of past [Accepted Submissions](https://www.hillside.net/plop/2022/index.php?nav=program#acceptedpapers).
2.  Each paper found suitable is assigned a shepherd, an experienced (pattern) writer, who helps the author improve the paper. Each paper is also assigned one program committee member to supervise shepherding. Shepherding involves several iterations, each producing a revision of the paper. Each author and shepherd decide the extent of revision.
3.  After shepherding, each paper is assessed once more by the program committee members and program chairs. The decision to accept a paper takes into account the willingness of the author to consider the comments they received from their shepherd (as reported by the shepherd and program committee member who supervised shepherding).

At the conference, the papers are discussed in writers’ workshops with groups of paper authors and possibly other conference participants. Authors are expected to take into account comments they received in the writers’ workshops to improve their papers.

At least one of the authors of accepted papers is expected to register for the conference. Failure to do so will result in acceptance being withdrawn.

## Submission Instructions

Submitted technical and position papers must be original and not submitted concurrently to a journal or another conference. Double-blind reviewing will be provided, so submitted papers must omit author names and affiliations.

Extended abstracts representing previously published work do not need to omit author information. To facilitate the review process, authors should mention on the first page (e.g., in the title) where this paper has been published or accepted for publication. For example, write in the title: ""A fascinating new search algorithm that beats A* (accepted for AAAI-2024)"".

Extended abstracts representing under-reviewed work should omit author names and affiliations. To facilitate the review process, authors should mention on the first page (e.g., in the title) where this paper is currently under review. For example, write in the title: ""A fascinating new search algorithm that beats A* (under review for AAAI-2024)"".

The paper submission is a two-step process. First, the paper abstract needs to be registered in EasyChair by the Paper abstract submission deadline. Then, the full paper in PDF is due by the Paper submission deadline. Remember, without registering your abstract on time, you will not be allowed to submit the paper later.

TAP 2024 is the 18th International Conference on Tests and Proofs. TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability.

Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of dynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic techniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Notable examples that provide evidence for the potential of a combination of static and dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based on symbolic execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking, or the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive enumeration. The verification of systems based on machine learning spurs novel combinations of dynamic and static analyses, e.g., property verification of surrogate models that are generated through testing.

TAP’s scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology, including foundational work, tool development, and empirical research. Topics of interest center around the combination of static techniques such as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.

## Topics of Interest

Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

*   Verification and analysis techniques combining proofs and tests,
*   Static analysis of programs with the aid of dynamic techniques,
*   Deductive techniques supporting the automated generation of test vectors and oracles,
*   Deductive techniques supporting (novel) definitions of coverage criteria,
*   Specification inference by deductive or dynamic methods,
*   Testing and runtime analysis of formal specifications,
*   Search-based techniques for proving and testing,
*   Testing and Verification of systems based on machine learning,
*   Verification of verification tools and environments,
*   Applications of test and proof techniques in new domains,
*   Combined approaches of test and proof in the context of formal certifications (Common Criteria, CENELEC, …), and
*   Case studies, tool and framework descriptions, and experience reports

## Artifact Evaluation

Authors are encouraged (but not required) to make the relevant artifacts available to the reviewers (and whenever possible publicly). Artifacts can be provided at submission time or after notification of acceptance and will go through a lightweight reviewing process, handing out availability badges.

We invite contributions to the research tracks of The Web Conference 2025 (formerly known as WWW). The conference will take place in **Sydney, Australia**, from **28 April to 02 May 2025**.

The Web Conference is the premier conference focused on understanding the current state and the evolution of the Web through the lens of computer science, computational social science, economics, policy, and many other disciplines.

## Important Dates:

*   **Abstract:** October 7, 2024
*   **Full paper:** October 14, 2024
*   **Author and reviewer discussion:** December 3-14, 2024
*   **Notification:** January 20, 2025
*   **Camera-ready:** February 2, 2025

All submission deadlines are end-of-day in the Anywhere on Earth (AoE) time zone.

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## Submission Site:

We will use OpenReview to manage the submissions and reviewing. All listed authors must have an up-to-date OpenReview profile, properly attributed with current and past institutional affiliation, homepage, Google Scholar, DBLP, ORCID, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar (wherever applicable). [Here is information on how to create an OpenReview profile.](https://openreview.net/faq)
The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflict of interest and paper matching. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.

Abstracts and papers can be submitted through the OpenReview link: [https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/TheWebConf/2025/Conference&referrer=%5BHomepage%5D(%2F)](https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/TheWebConf/2025/Conference&referrer=%5BHomepage%5D(%2F)

## Scope:

The scope of the conference is the Web and how it has crucially enabled new research and applications. A typical Web Conference paper should have an explicit focus on at least one of the following:

*   understanding, evaluating, and improving the Web as a technical infrastructure; including core Web technologies, standards, and platforms
*   understanding, evaluating, and improving the Web as a socio-economic system;
*   understanding better the impact of the Web and Web technologies;
*   democratizing access to Web content and technologies, making it more accessible, fair, inclusive, and accountable to a wide range of audiences

Relevance. Every submission must clearly state how the work is relevant to the Web and to the track in the first page. Submissions that merely use a Web artifact rather than answering a specific Web-related scientific research challenge, are out of scope and will be desk-rejected.

## Tracks

Our research interests are organized in the following tracks:

*   **Economics, online markets and human computation**
*   **Graph Algorithms and Modeling for the Web**
*   **Responsible web**
*   **Search and retrieval-augmented AI**
*   **Security and privacy**
*   **Semantics and Knowledge**
*   **Social networks and social media**
*   **Systems and infrastructure for Web, mobile and WoT**
*   **User modeling, personalization and recommendation**
*   **Web mining and content analysis**

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Deadlines:** The submission deadlines are strict and no extensions, regardless of circumstances, will be allowed. Placeholder/dummy abstracts are forbidden.
*   **Authorship:** Every person named as the author of a paper must have contributed substantially to the work described in the paper and/or to the writing of the paper and must take responsibility for the entire content of a paper.
*   **Maximum authorship:** The number of submissions allowed per author is limited to 7 (seven) maximum, accumulatively across the research tracks. If more than 7 papers are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional papers submitted after the first 7 by submission ID, will be desk-rejected after the full paper submission deadline.
*   **Authorship changes:** The full list of authors, including the ordering, must be finalized at the point of submission. There cannot be any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after the abstract submission deadline. The only changes allowed are the correction of spelling mistakes or new affiliations.
*   **Anonymity:** The review process will be double-blind. The submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information.
*   **Formatting Requirements:** Submissions must be in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the ACM template and format ([https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)).
    *   Submissions must be a single PDF file: 8 (eight) pages as main paper, with unlimited pages for references and an optional Appendix.
*   **Originality and Concurrent Submissions:** Submissions must present original work---this means that papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference / journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted.
*   **Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent:** Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when appropriate.

Submissions that do not follow these guidelines or do not view or print properly, will be desk-rejected.

## Reviewing Process

*   Each paper is submitted to one of the tracks listed above. Papers that do not conform to the conference scope or submission guidelines will be desk-rejected by the track chair.
*   Each submission will receive at least three independent reviews within each track and the process overseen by an Area Chair (AC).
*   For each submitted paper, authors will be requested to select one of the authors to serve as reviewer.
*   Authors will have the chance to provide a response to the reviews during an author-reviewer discussion period.

By submitting paper(s) to The Web Conference 2025, the authors agree that the reviews, meta-reviews, and discussions will be made public in OpenReview for all accepted papers.

## Publication and Presentation Policies

*   **Publication:** All accepted papers will be allowed the same maximum page length in the proceedings (12 pages, of which 8 are content pages), which will be published by ACM and will be accessible via the ACM Digital Library.
*   **Registration:** To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by a distinct conference registration.
*   **Presentation:** Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings.
    *   Oral Presentation.
    *   Poster Presentation.
*   Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available after the review process.
