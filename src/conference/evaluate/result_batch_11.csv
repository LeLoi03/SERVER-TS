Authors are automatically offered the option to present their paper at one of the IEEE RAS conferences upon notification of final acceptance.

Please check the webpage of the journals for information on eligibility time window: [RA-L](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ra-l), [T-ASE](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/t-ase), [T-RO](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/t-ro), and [RAM](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/ram).

## Guidelines for Generative AI Usage

Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of a paper submitted to IROS 2025.

The use of content generated by AI in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section.

The AI system used must be identified, and specific sections of the article that use AI-generated content should be specified and accompanied by a brief explanation regarding the manner in which the AI system was used to generate the content.

Information or content contained in or about a manuscript under review shall not be processed through an AI system. Doing so is considered a breach of confidentiality and as such is not permitted.

More information on generative AI usage can be found at the IEEE RAS publication website.

## FAQ

*   **Is the IROS review process single-blind or double-blind?**

    The IROS review process is single-blind (reviewers stay anonymous, but author information is visible). Therefore, manuscripts should include author names and their affiliations.

*   **Will there be an extension to the paper submission deadline?**

    There is no plan to extend the paper submission deadline.

*   **What is the format of the conference?**

    IROS 2025 will be held in person in Hangzhou, China. All accepted paper will be offered oral presentation opportunities. The presentation style will be oral + poster. More details will be posted later.

*   **If I cannot attend IROS in person due to some reasons, can my paper be presented in an alternative way?**

    Yes. We will accommodate authors whose papers are accepted but could not join us in person. Alternative ways to present the paper will be provided, such as video presentation.

*   **How can I transfer an accepted paper from T-ASE/T-FR/RA-P for presentation at IROS?**

    If you want to transfer an accepted paper from one of the journals T-ASE, T-FR, or RA-P to IROS, the paper should be submitted in paperplaza in the relevant submission category of IROS, but not as regular IROS paper. For the paper upload, you will need to enter a code, which can be obtained from the Editor-In-Chief of the journal.

    Notice that papers from T-RO, RA-M, and RA-L follow a different process and do not require a code. Authors of accepted papers will receive an email from PaperCept regarding the transfer of their paper to a conference at which they wish to present their paper.

The symposium fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence. It includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions.","# ISAIM 2026: Call for Papers

The International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics (ISAIM) is a biennial meeting that fosters interactions between mathematics, theoretical computer science, and artificial intelligence (AI). This is the nineteenth Symposium in the series, which is sponsored by Florida Atlantic University.

We seek submissions of recent results with a particular emphasis on the foundations of AI and mathematical methods used in AI. Papers describing applications are also encouraged, but the focus should be on principled lessons learned from the development of the application. Traditionally, the Symposium attracts participants from a variety of disciplines, thereby providing a unique forum for scientific exchange. The three-day Symposium includes invited speakers, presentations of technical papers, and special topic sessions.

Work that will have been published as of January 2026 should not be submitted to ISAIM unless it introduces a significant addition to the previously published work. However, the ISAIM website proceedings are not archival, so papers submitted to ISAIM can be under review elsewhere at the time of submission and can be submitted elsewhere after ISAIM.

Authors of a selected set of papers from the Symposium will be invited to submit full versions of their papers for inclusion in an archival special volume of the Annals of Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence, published by Springer. Those invited submissions will be subject to refereeing at the usual standards of the journal, and authors will receive more details with the acceptance notice. Papers must of course be new and unpublished to be considered for the special volume.

The 2025 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2025) solicits full-length submissions covering new work on all memory management related topics in both software and hardware (and their cooperation), as well as papers presenting confirmations or refutations of important prior results.  ISMM 2025 will be held in-person as part of PLDIâ25, sharing the venue and activities.

## Areas of Interest

Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   Garbage collection algorithms and implementations
*   Memory allocation and de-allocation
*   Memory system design and analysis (both software and hardware)
*   Hardware support for memory management
*   Memory management for large-scale data-intensive systems
*   Memory management at datacenter and cloud scales
*   Formal analysis and verification of memory management algorithms
*   Compiler analyses to aid memory management
*   Tools to analyze memory usage and characteristics of programs

## Submission Types

In addition to regular papers, traditionally submitted to ISMM, we also invite submissions of the following kinds:

*   Surveys and comparative analyses that shed new light on previously published techniques.
*   Practitioner reports, describing experience with memory management in production. Such papers are not expected to provide novel research contributions, but they should not have been previously published.
*   Intellectual abstracts, where researchers share designs, algorithms, or theory that may be interesting to the memory management community, but not yet evaluated.

Please indicate the submission type with a subtitle.

## Submission Link

[https://ismm25.hotcrp.com](https://ismm25.hotcrp.com)

## Formatting Instructions

*   All papers must be submitted on-line in Portable Document Format (PDF).
*   Papers should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format.
*   Each paper should have no more than 12 pages, excluding bibliography, in 10pt font.
*   There is no limit on the page count for references.
*   Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al).
*   The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52].
*   Submissions should be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper.
*   Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected.
*   Make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale.
*   Appendices should not be part of the paper, but should be submitted as supplementary material.
*   Supplementary material should also be anonymized.

As explained in more detail at [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author), authors should use the sigplan subformat of the acmart format. Please note the following: The first two lines should be:

```
\documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart}
\settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}
```
The default citation style is numeric.

Do not mess with the class file or settings to try to sneak in additional space. (Conversely, you may toggle the printccs and printacmref flags if you wish, but these changes will consume space.)

Do not use the PACMPL files or format; ISMM is not using them. However, the template files were designed to make migrating a paper from one format to the other as simple as possible.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

ISMM uses double-blind reviewing. This means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. These are firm submission requirements. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized.

An earlier FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs â [https://pldi23.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2023-pldi#FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2023-pldi#FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing).

## Declaring Conflicts

When submitting the paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).

Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.

## Publication Model: PACM HCI Journal

Full papers are selected using a refereed process, meeting the ACMâs highest requirements for rigorous review. Papers accepted in any round of submission will be published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACM HCI), [https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci).

Accepted papers are invited to present at the ACM ISS 2026 conference in Oct/Nov 2026. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required. ACM ISS 2026 will likely be a hybrid event where both in-person and remote participation is supported.

The conference retains its workshop, poster, and demo tracks, which will have their own publication outlet. The call for workshops, posters, and demos will be included in the second round.

Submissions will be done through [http://new.precisionconference.com](http://new.precisionconference.com)

The ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA) is the leading research symposium on software testing and analysis, bringing together academics, industrial researchers, and practitioners to exchange new ideas, problems, and experience on how to analyze and test software systems. The 35th edition of ISSTA will be held from **October 3-9, 2026 in Oakland, California, United States**, co-located with [SPLASH/ISSTA 2026](https://conf.researchr.org/home/splash-issta-2026).

ISSTA invites high-quality submissions, from both industry and academia, describing original and unpublished results of theoretical, empirical, conceptual, and experimental research on software testing and analysis.

ISSTA invites three kinds of submissions: Research Papers, Experience Papers, or Replicability Studies. All accepted articles will be made Open Access, and Article processing charges may apply.

Submission Link: [https://issta2026.hotcrp.com/](https://issta2026.hotcrp.com/)

## Research Areas

ISSTA welcomes submissions addressing topics across the full spectrum of software analysis. Topics of interest include:

*   AI for Analysis and Testing
*   Analysis and Testing for AI
*   Software Test Generation
*   Software Debugging and Repair
*   Software Verification and Analysis Techniques
*   Analysis and Testing for Security
*   Domain-specific Analysis and Testing
*   Empirical and User Studies of Testing and Analysis Processes

Each submission will need to indicate one primary and optionally a secondary area.

## Submission Categories

### Research Papers

Authors are invited to submit research papers describing original contributions in testing or analysis of computer software. Papers describing original theoretical or empirical research, new techniques, methods for emerging systems, in-depth case studies, infrastructures of testing and analysis, or tools are welcome.

### Experience Papers

Authors are invited to submit experience papers describing a significant experience in applying software testing and analysis methods or tools and should carefully identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience.

### Replicability Studies

ISSTA encourages researchers to replicate results from previous papers. A replicability study must go beyond simply re-implementing an algorithm and/or re-running the artifacts provided by the original paper. It should at the very least apply the approach to new, significantly broadened inputs.

We expect replicability studies to clearly point out the artifacts the study is built on, and to submit those artifacts to the artifact evaluation. Artifacts evaluated positively will be eligible to obtain the prestigious Results Reproduced badge.

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions must be original and should not have been published previously or be under consideration for publication while being evaluated for ISSTA. Authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.

*   **Page Limit:** No more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus unlimited references.
*   **Templates:** [Latex](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) or [Word (Mac)](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) or [Word (Windows)](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions)
*   Authors using LaTeX should use the sample-acmsmall-conf.tex file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the acmsmall option.
*   We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. Use:

```
documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}
```

*   Experience papers and replicability studies should clearly specify their category in the paper title upon submission: â[TITLE](Experience Paper)â, â[TITLE](Replicability Study)â.
*   Papers must be submitted electronically through the [ISSTA 2026 submission site](https://issta2026.hotcrp.com).
*   Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee.
*   Paper submissions must follow the [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship), which includes the policy with respect to the use of generative AI tools and technologies such as ChatGPT.
*   ISSTA 2026 will conduct double-anonymous reviewing.

Authors are asked to make their code, data, etc. available to the program committee (via upload of anonymized supplemental material or a link to an anonymized private or public repository) or to comment on why this is not possible or desirable. Furthermore, we ask authors to provide a supporting statement on the data availability (or lack thereof) in their submitted papers in a section named âData Availabilityâ after the Conclusion section.

Starting 2026, all articles published by ACM will be made Open Access. This is greatly beneficial to the advancement of computer science and leads to increased usage and citation of research.
