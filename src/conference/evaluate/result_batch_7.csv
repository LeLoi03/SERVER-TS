The ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) is a forum for researchers, practitioners, and educators to present and discuss innovations, trends, experiences, and challenges in the field of software engineering. FSE 2026 will be held in **Montreal, Canada from July 5-9, 2026**.

## Tracks

*   [Open Science Policy](https://conf.researchr.org/track/fse-2026/fse-2026-open-science-policy)
*   [Re-routed Presentations from Past Years](https://conf.researchr.org/track/fse-2026/fse-2026-rerouted-presentations-from-the-past-year)
*   [Research Papers](https://conf.researchr.org/track/fse-2026/fse-2026-research-papers)
*   [Software Engineering Education](https://conf.researchr.org/track/fse-2026/fse-2026-software-engineering-education)

This Call for Papers refers to the **Research Track** of FSE 2026.

## How to Submit

Each paper should have no more than **18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references**, using the following templates:

*   [Latex](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)
*   [Word (Mac)](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)
*   [Word (Windows)](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)

Authors using LaTeX should use the `sample-acmsmall-conf.tex` file with the `acmsmall` option. We strongly encourage the use of the `review`, `screen`, and `anonymous` options as well.

```latex
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}
```

Papers may use either numeric or author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review.

Papers must be submitted electronically through the FSE 2026 submission site:

[https://fse2026.hotcrp.com](https://fse2026.hotcrp.com)

## Review Process

Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. The initial decision can be accept, reject or major revision. The revised submission must be accompanied by a response letter, where the authors explain how they addressed each concern expressed by the reviewers. Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of originality, importance of contribution, soundness, evaluation (if relevant), quality of presentation, and appropriate comparison to related work.

### Double-Anonymous Review Process

The FSE 2026 Research Papers Track will employ a double-anonymous review process, where reviewers do not know the identity of authors, and authors do not know the identity of reviewers. The papers submitted must not reveal the authors’ identities in any way:

*   Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission.
*   Authors should ensure that any citation to related work by themselves is written in third person.
*   Authors should not include URLs to author-revealing sites (tools, datasets).
*   Authors should anonymize organization names that might reveal author affiliations.
*   Authors are encouraged to avoid including an acknowledgements section in a paper at submission time.
*   While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they should avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to FSE 2026.
*   During the review period, authors should not publicly use the submission title.

## Submission Policies

The authors must follow the “[ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship)” released April 20, 2023 and its accompanying FAQ. Generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT, may not be listed as authors of an ACM published Work. The use of generative AI tools and technologies to create content is permitted but must be fully disclosed in the Work.

Papers submitted for consideration to FSE should not have been already published elsewhere and should not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere during the reviewing period.

It aims to bring together researchers and practitioners working on formal techniques, tools, and the formal underpinnings of programming languages.","# FTfJP 2025 – Call for Papers

The Formal Techniques for Judicious Programming (FTfJP) workshop is an established workshop which has run annually since 1999 alongside ECOOP, with the goal of bringing together people working in both fields. In 2024 the name of the workshop was changed from “Formal Techniques for Java-like Programs” to “Formal Techniques for Judicious Programming” to properly reflect the broader scope of the workshop.

## Paper Categories

We solicit two categories of papers:

*   **Full Papers** (12 pages, excluding references) present a technical contribution, case study, or detailed experience report. We welcome both complete and incomplete technical results; ongoing work is particularly welcome, provided it is substantial enough to stimulate interesting discussions.
*   **Short Papers** (6 pages, excluding references) should advocate a promising research direction, or otherwise present a position likely to stimulate discussion at the workshop. We encourage e.g. established researchers to set out a personal vision, and beginning researchers to present a planned path to a PhD.

Both types of contributions will benefit from feedback received at the workshop. Submissions will be peer-reviewed and will be evaluated based on their clarity and their potential to generate interesting discussions. Reviewing will be single-blind, i.e, submissions need not be anonymized.

The format of the workshop encourages interaction. FTfJP is a forum in which a wide range of people share their expertise, from experienced researchers to beginning PhD students.

## Submission Guidelines

Papers must be formatted according to [the guidelines for Springer LNCS papers](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). Submissions should be made via EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ftfjp2025](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=ftfjp2025). There is no need to indicate the paper category (long/short).

The accepted papers will be published as post-proceedings in JOT (Journal of Object Technology), though authors will be able to opt out of this publication, if desired. At least one author of an accepted paper must register to the workshop by the early registration date and attend the workshop to present the work and participate in the discussions.

## Important Dates

All dates are AoE (UTC-12h).

The conference presents high-quality research in genetic and evolutionary computation, including areas like genetic algorithms, genetic programming, swarm intelligence, and real-world applications. GECCO is sponsored by ACM SIGEVO.","# Call for Papers - GECCO 2025

The Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO 2025) invites submissions of high-quality results in genetic and evolutionary computation.

## General Information

GECCO 2025 will present the latest high-quality results in genetic and evolutionary computation. Topics include genetic algorithms, genetic programming, ant colony optimization and swarm intelligence, complex systems, evolutionary combinatorial optimization and metaheuristics, evolutionary machine learning, evolutionary multiobjective optimization, evolutionary numerical optimization, neuroevolution, real-world applications, theory, hybrids and more. The [full list of tracks](Tracks) is available.

The GECCO 2025 Program Committee invites the submission of technical papers describing your best work in genetic and evolutionary computation. Full papers of at most 8 pages (excluding references) should present original work that meets the high-quality standards of GECCO. Accepted full papers appear in the ACM digital library as part of the Main Proceedings of GECCO. Any content/appendix beyond the 8 pages limit (excluding references) should be submitted as supplementary material. For full papers, a separate abstract needs to be submitted first by January 22, 2025. Full papers are due by the non-extensible deadline of January 29, 2025.

Each paper submitted to GECCO will be rigorously evaluated in a double-blind review process. Evaluation is done on a per-track basis, ensuring high interest and high expertise of the reviewers. Review criteria include the significance of the work, technical soundness, novelty, clarity, writing quality, relevance and, if applicable, sufficiency of information to permit replication.

Besides full papers, poster-only papers of at most 4 pages (including references) may be submitted. Poster-only papers should present original work that has not yet reached the maturity and completeness of research results that are published as full papers at GECCO. The review of poster-only papers follows the same double-blind process mentioned above. Accepted poster-only papers will appear in the ACM digital library as part of the Companion Proceedings of GECCO. Poster-only papers are due by the non-extensible deadline of January 29, 2025, and no abstract needs to be submitted first.

By submitting a paper, the author(s) agree that, if their paper is accepted, they will:

*   Submit a final, revised, camera-ready version to the publisher on or before the camera-ready deadline
*   Register at least one author before May 15, 2025 to attend the conference (that is, register as an in-person or online PRESENTER)
*   Attend the conference (at least one author)
*   Present the accepted paper at the conference

Each paper accepted needs to have at least one author registered. If an author is presenting more than one paper at the conference, she/he does not pay any additional registration fees.

## Paper Categories

*   **Full papers:** Papers of at most 8 pages (excluding references) that present original new work in genetic and evolutionary computation. Mandatory abstract submissions (at most 200 words) are due by January 22, 2025; full papers are due by January 29, 2025.
*   **Poster-only papers:** Papers of at most 4 pages (including references) presenting original work that has not yet reached the maturity of full papers. Poster-only papers are due by January 29, 2025.

## Submission

Follow [this link](https://ssl.linklings.net/conferences/gecco/) to go directly to the paper submission website. You must use the submission website to submit all kinds of contributions to GECCO (including the abstract of full papers).

## Paper Acceptance Regulations (New)

For each track at GECCO, at most CEILING(40% * N_submitted_to_track) papers shall be accepted as a full paper, where N_submitted_to_track is the number of full papers submitted to that track. Track chairs are encouraged to only accept papers that they feel adhere to the standards of GECCO.

There is no maximum acceptance rate on poster papers submitted as poster paper nor on poster papers submitted originally as full paper. It is up to the track chairs to decide the minimum poster-paper quality. Papers that are deemed by the track chairs and/or the EiC to not be a proper fit within the track they were submitted to nor any other track in the conference, will be desk rejected.

Papers that are deemed by the track chairs and/or the EiC to not be a proper fit within the track they were submitted to, but are a good fit within another track according to all involved track chairs and/or EiC, will be moved to another track before the reviewing process starts unless the authors decide to retract the paper. To this end, upon signalling said misfit, the EiC will reach out to the authors to inform them of their options (be moved or retracted). This holds both for the primary and the secondary track choice for a paper.

## Best Paper Regulations (New)

Any paper that was submitted to a track, but was moved to another track by the GECCO organization, counts toward the track it was moved to, not the one it was originally submitted to. A track for which there are less than 10 full-length submitted papers is fully excluded from the Best Paper Award (BPA) procedure. A track is allowed to have a track-specific BPA if at least 30 full-length papers were submitted to that track (i.e., poster papers do not qualify).

Two or more tracks are allowed to have a joint-track BPA if at least 30 full-length papers were submitted to those tracks combined (i.e., poster papers do not qualify) and there is at least one paper nominated for each of the constituent tracks. The EiC decides upon such groupings in agreement with the involved track chairs. In case no consensus can be reached, the EiC decides.

No track may be in more than one group of tracks with which a joint-track BPA is associated. For any track, there can be at most one BPA. For any group of tracks with which a joint-track BPA is associated, there can be at most one BPA. For any BPA, there may not be less than 2 nominated papers. For any track-specific BPA, there may not be more than 3 nominated papers. For any group of tracks with which a joint-track BPA is associated, there may not be more than 4 nominated papers.

Best paper nominations are decided upon per track and by the track chairs. Any paper for which a secondary track has been assigned shall only be considered for nomination in its primary track. Track chairs may decide not to nominate any paper for their track, even if there are at least 15 unique full-length submitted papers for that track. If any track chair has any conflict of interest (including, but not limited to, co-authorship) with regard to any paper being nominated, that track chair shall be excluded from making the decision for paper nomination and be replaced by the EiC. If the EiC also has a conflict of interest with that paper, the GC shall replace the EiC in this matter. If the GC also has a conflict of interest with that paper, the SIGEVO Officers will take the final decision. Any paper for which the EiC or the GC is a co-author cannot be nominated for a BPA.

## Double-Blind Review Process

Each paper submitted to GECCO will be rigorously reviewed in a double-blind review process. In other words, authors should not know who the reviewers of their work are and reviewers should not know who the authors are. To this end, the following information is very important:

Submitted papers should be ANONYMIZED. This means that they should NOT contain any element that may reveal the identity of their authors. This includes author names, affiliations, and acknowledgments. Moreover, any references to any of the author's own work should be made as if the work belonged to someone else.

If you are using LaTeX, consider using the following header to remove author listing and to remove sections marked as containing identifying information (e.g. Acknowledgements):

```latex
\documentclass[dvipsnames,format=sigconf,anonymous=true,review=true]{acmart}
```

## Publication Policy

All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library. Simultaneously submitting work to another conference or journal that is substantially similar to work also submitted to GECCO, is NOT ALLOWED. Material may later be revised and submitted to a journal, if this is permitted by the journal.

It is also NOT ALLOWED to submit work to GECCO that is substantially similar to work already accepted or published in other conferences or journals. GECCO is however still interested in such related publications. For this reason, researchers are invited to submit abstracts of their work recently published in top-tier conferences and journals to the Hot Off the Press track. Contributions will be selected to be presented at GECCO based on quality and interest to the GECCO community.

A notable exception to the above is the simultaneous submission of work to arXiv. Reviewers will be asked not to actively look for such submissions, but if they are aware of them, this will not constitute a conflict of interest.

The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date will be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

The submitted contributions will be checked using anti-plagiarism systems. Those papers or posters with a high percentage of plagiarism, exceeding the page limit, simultaneously submitted to another conference or journal, or falling out of the scope of the conference will be rejected without review.

As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

## Supplementary Material

It is possible to submit supplementary material (e.g., videos, a PDF appendix, source code, data, mathematical proofs) in addition to the PDF of the paper. In particular, we encourage authors to submit source code to support replication of experiments as described in their paper. At the time of submission, all the supplementary material must also be anonymized.

The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts & Experiences (GPCE) is a programming languages conference focusing on techniques and tools for code generation, language implementation, and product-line development. This is the 24th edition of the conference.

## Topics of Interest:

GPCE seeks conceptual, theoretical, empirical, and technical contributions to its topics of interest, which include but are not limited to:

*   program transformation, staging,
*   macro systems, preprocessors,
*   program synthesis,
*   code-recommendation systems,
*   domain-specific languages,
*   generative language workbenches,
*   language embedding, language design,
*   domain engineering,
*   software product lines, configurable software,
*   feature interactions,
*   applications and properties of code generation,
*   language implementation,
*   AI/ML techniques for generative programming,
*   generative programming for AI/ML techniques,
*   low code / no code approaches.

GPCE promotes cross-fertilization between programming languages and software development and among different styles of generative programming in its broadest sense.

Authors are welcome to check with the PC chair whether their planned papers are in scope.

## Paper Categories

GPCE solicits four kinds of submissions:

*   **Full Papers:** reporting original and unpublished results of research that contribute to scientific knowledge for any GPCE topic. Full paper submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography.
*   **Short Papers:** presenting unconventional ideas or new visions in any GPCE topics. Short papers do not always contain complete results as in the case of full papers, but can introduce new ideas to the community and get early feedback. Note that short papers are not intended to be position statements. Accepted short papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented at the conference. Short paper submissions must not exceed 6 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text “(Short Paper)” appended to their titles.
*   **Tool Demonstrations:** presenting tools for any GPCE topic. Tools must be available for use and must not be purely commercial. Submissions must provide a tool description not exceeding 6 pages excluding bibliography and a separate demonstration outline including screenshots also not exceeding 6 pages. Tool demonstration submissions must have the text “(Tool Demonstration)” appended to their titles. If they are accepted, tool descriptions will be included in the proceedings. The demonstration outline will only be used to evaluate the planned demonstration.
*   **Generative Pearl:** is an elegant essay about generative programming. Examples include but are not limited to an interesting application of generative programming and an elegant presentation of a (new or old) data structure using generative programming (similar to Functional Pearl in ICFP and Pearl in ECOOP). Accepted Generative Pearl papers are included in the proceedings and will be presented at the conference. Generative Pearl submissions must not exceed 12 pages excluding the bibliography, and must have the text “(Generative Pearl)” appended to their titles.

## Paper Selection

The GPCE program committee will evaluate each submission according to the following selection criteria:

*   Novelty. Papers must present new ideas or evidence and place them appropriately within the context established by previous research in the field.
*   Significance. The results in the paper must have the potential to add to the state of the art or practice in significant ways.
*   Evidence. The paper must present evidence supporting its claims. Examples of evidence include formalizations and proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, and case studies.
*   Clarity. The paper must present its contributions and results clearly.

## Best Paper Award

Following the tradition, the GPCE program committee will select the best paper among accepted papers. The authors of the best paper will be given the best paper award at the conference.

## Paper Submission

The submission page will be announced soon.

All submissions must use the [ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”](http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format). Be sure to use the latest LaTeX templates and class files, the SIGPLAN sub-format, and 10-point font. Consult the sample-sigplan.tex template and use the document-class `\documentclass[sigplan,anonymous,review]{acmart}`.

To increase fairness in reviewing, GPCE uses the double-blind review process which has become standard across SIGPLAN conferences:

*   Author names, institutions, and acknowledgments should be omitted from submitted papers, and
*   references to the authors’ own work should be in the third person.

No other changes are necessary, and authors will not be penalized if reviewers are able to infer authors’ identities in implicit ways.

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

For additional information, clarification, or answers to questions, contact the program chair.

## ACM Artifact Badges (New!)

There as been quite some momentum in recent years to improve replication and reproducibility in software engineering. Starting the 2024 edition, we want to give authors the chance to apply for an ACM Artifact Badge. Even though the artifact submission is not mandatory, we recommend authors to submit their artifacts to reach a higher impact with their research.

Authors that want to apply for an ACM Artifact Badge are asked to add a brief paragraph in the ACKs section of their submission. The paragraph should indicate which ACM Badge is the submission aiming for (see ACM page linked below) and what is part of the artifact. The paragraph may be removed for the final version of the paper, if it is clear from the manuscript what constitutes the artifact.

The review of artifact badges will not be available during the author rebuttal period and received artifacts will be announced shortly before the camera ready version is due to by authors of accepted submissions only. Hence, artifacts for rejected submissions may not be reviewed at all.

More information on ACM Artifact Badges: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-and-badging-current)

The 18th ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Haskell will be co-located with ICFP and SPLASH 2025 in Singapore from **October 12-18, 2025**.

The Haskell Symposium presents original research on Haskell, discusses practical experience and future development of the language, and promotes other forms of declarative programming.

This year, in addition to the regular Call for Papers track, there is a separate Call for Talks track.

## Keynotes

*   TBD - Richard A. Eisenberg
*   TBD - Simon Peyton Jones

## Call for Talks

Talk proposals should report work in progress relevant to Haskell language design, theory, tools, or applications. Proposals will be evaluated by the PC for novelty and relevance to the Haskell community. Talk proposals will not be distributed, but authors may provide links to materials.

*   **Submission Deadline:** Tentatively **15 Sept 2025**. Detailed information will be released closer to the deadline.

## Call for Papers

The ACM SIGPLAN Haskell Symposium 2025 will be co-located with the 2025 International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) and the 2025 International Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH).

### Topics of Interest:

*   Language design, with a focus on possible extensions and modifications of Haskell as well as critical discussions of the status quo
*   Theory, such as formal semantics of the present language or future extensions, type systems, effects, metatheory, and foundations for program analysis and transformation
*   Implementations, including program analysis and transformation, static and dynamic compilation for sequential, parallel, and distributed architectures, memory management, as well as foreign function and component interfaces
*   Libraries, that demonstrate new ideas or techniques for functional programming in Haskell
*   Tools, such as profilers, tracers, debuggers, preprocessors, and testing tools
*   Applications, to scientific and symbolic computing, databases, multimedia, telecommunication, the web, and so forth
*   Functional Pearls, being elegant and instructive programming examples
*   Experience Reports, to document general practice and experience in education, industry, or other contexts
*   Tutorials, to document how to use a particular language feature, programming technique, tool or library within the Haskell ecosystem
*   System Demonstrations, based on running software rather than novel research results

Regular papers should explain their research contributions in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and relating it to previous work, and to other languages where appropriate.

Experience reports, functional pearls, and tutorials should make a contribution from which other Haskellers can benefit. System demonstrations should summarize the system capabilities that would be demonstrated.

If your contribution is not a research paper, please mark the title of your experience report, functional pearl, tutorial or system demonstration as such, by supplying a subtitle (Experience Report, Functional Pearl, Tutorial Paper, System Demonstration).

### Formatting:

Submitted papers should be in portable document format (PDF), formatted using the ACM SIGPLAN style guidelines. Authors should use the acmart format, with the sigplan sub-format for ACM proceedings. For details, see: [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format)

It is recommended to use the `review` option when submitting a paper; this option enables line numbers for easy reference in reviews.

Functional pearls, experience reports, tutorials and demo proposals should be labelled clearly as such.

### Lightweight Double-blind Reviewing:

Haskell Symposium 2025 will use a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submitted papers must adhere to two rules:

*   Author names and institutions must be omitted.
*   References to authors’ own related work should be in the third person.

The purpose of this process is to help the reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. A reviewer will learn the identity of the author(s) of a paper after a review is submitted.

### Page Limits:

The length of submissions should not exceed the following limits (list of references is not counted):

*   Regular paper: 12 pages
*   Functional pearl: 12 pages
*   Tutorial: 12 pages
*   Experience report: 6 pages
*   Demo proposal: 2 pages

## Important Dates

Deadlines are end of day Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12).

*   **Paper submission:** 9 June 2025 (Mon)
*   **Author Notification:** 17 July 2025 (Thu)
*   **Camera-ready deadline:** Fri 8 Aug 2025
*   **Call for Talk Proposals:** Mon 15 Sep 2025
*   **Symposium:** Thu 16 - Fri 17 Oct 2025

## Submission

Submissions must adhere to SIGPLAN’s republication policy, and authors should be aware of ACM’s policies on plagiarism. Program Committee members are allowed to submit papers, but their papers will be held to a higher standard.

Papers should be submitted through HotCRP at: [https://haskell25.hotcrp.com/](https://haskell25.hotcrp.com/)

Authors have the option to attach supplementary material (anonymized and non-anonymized) and resubmitted papers (with annotated reviews of previous submissions).

## Proceedings

Accepted papers will be included in the ACM Digital Library. Their authors will be required to choose one of the following options:

*   Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission-to-publish license (and, optionally, licenses the work with a Creative Commons license).
*   Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission-to-publish license.
*   Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.

Accepted proposals for system demonstrations will be posted on the symposium website but not formally published in the proceedings.

## Artifacts

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make auxiliary material (artifacts like source code, test data, etc.) available with their paper. If an accepted paper’s artifacts are made permanently available for retrieval in a publicly accessible archival repository like the ACM Digital Library, that paper qualifies for an Artifacts Available badge.

It aims to bring together researchers to discuss innovative ideas and future research agendas in computer networks and systems. Submissions of short position papers are encouraged, focusing on open questions, new approaches, constructive critiques, or promising but unproven ideas.","# HotNets 2025: Call for Papers

The 24th ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Networks (HotNets 2025) will bring together researchers to engage in a lively debate on the theory and practice of computer networking and networked systems. HotNets provides a venue to discuss innovative ideas and debate future research agendas for the field.

We invite researchers and practitioners to submit short position papers. We encourage submissions that identify fundamental open questions, advocate for new approaches, offer constructive critiques of the state of networking research, re-frame or debunk existing work, report unexpected early results from a deployment, report promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Authors need not support their ideas with full evaluations; we consider well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations sufficient support for the possibility of the paper's claims in HotNets.

We seek interesting ideas over incremental, well-baked systems. An ideal submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry for the networking and adjacent communities. We strongly discourage ""conference papers in the miniature."" The program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion, ideally benefiting the networking community broadly, over incremental work that is ready for publication at a conference.

HotNets takes a broad view of networking research. The scope includes (but is not limited to) new ideas that relate to mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks and that use a variety of link technologies (e.g. wired, wireless, optical, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks and network architecture. HotNets encompasses all aspects of networks, which include (but is not limited to) packet-processing and transmission hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, provisioning and resource management, performance, energy consumption, sustainability, topology, robustness, measurement, diagnosis, verification, privacy, security, economics and evolution, theory, usability, machine learning, and interactions with applications.

This year, the program committee will do an initial fast round of reviewing that will provide early rejection or advancement to later rounds of more traditional, thorough reviewing. The program committee will select papers based on originality, likelihood to stimulate insightful discussion, and technical merit. Accepted papers will be posted online prior to the workshop and will be published in the ACM Digital Library to facilitate wide dissemination of the ideas discussed at the workshop.

## Policy on Concurrent Submissions

Concurrent submissions to HotNets 2025 and any other peer-reviewed venue that cover the same work (differences in the degree of detail given the two venues' length limits notwithstanding) are prohibited and will result in the immediate rejection of the HotNets submission in question. ""Concurrent"" means any other peer-reviewed venue whose reviewing period (i.e., between submission and notification) overlaps with that of HotNets. 

## Ethical Concerns

As part of the submission process, authors must attest that their work complies with all applicable ethical standards of their home institution(s), including, but not limited to privacy policies and policies on experiments involving humans.

## Workshop Participation

HotNets attendance is limited to roughly 90 people in person to facilitate a lively discussion (potentially with additional virtual participants). In-person invitations will be allocated first to one author of each paper, HotNets organizers and committee members, and conference sponsors. We require the paper presentations to be in-person. To promote an inclusive workshop, HotNets will also make a limited number of open registration slots for in-person attendance available to the community.

## Submission and Formatting

Papers should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format. Each paper should have no more than 6 pages, excluding references, in 10 point font. There is no limit on the page count for references, however appendices are not allowed. Papers must contain novel ideas and must differ significantly in content from previously published papers.

All submissions must be blind: they must not indicate the names or affiliations of the authors in the paper. Only electronic submissions in PDF will be accepted. Submissions must be written in English, render without error using standard tools (e.g., Acrobat Reader), and print on US Letter paper. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (i.e., do not use ""et al.""). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]. Please make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale. Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected.

This [archive](/hotnets/2025/docs/hotnets25-template.zip) contains a LaTeX class file that follows the prescribed submission format. The hotnets25-template.tex included in the archive has the correct defaults for HotNets 2025 submissions. Specifically, the first two lines should be:

```latex
\documentclass[sigconf, 10pt, anonymous, nonacm]{acmart}
\settopmatter{printfolios=true, printccs=false, printacmref=false}
```

The template uses these margins and they will be checked in the HotCRP format checker.

```
top=57pt (0.792 inches)
bottom=73pt (1.014 inches)
inner=54pt (0.75 inches)
outer=54pt (0.75 inches)
```

The default citation style is numeric. Please do not modify the acmart.cls file or settings to try to sneak in additional space.

Submit papers on the [HotCRP](https://hotnets25.hotcrp.com/).

## Introduction

With the rapid growth in computing and communications technology, the past decade has witnessed a proliferation of powerful parallel and distributed systems and an ever-increasing demand for practice of high-performance computing and communications (HPCC). HPCC has moved into the mainstream of computing and has become a key technology in determining future research and development activities in many academic and industrial branches, especially when the solution of large and complex problems must cope with very tight timing schedules.

Among a series of highly successful International Conferences on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC), the HPCC-2025 conference is the 27th edition of a forum for engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government to address the resulting profound challenges and to present and discuss their new ideas, research results, applications, and experience on all aspects of high-performance computing and communications. IEEE HPCC-2025 is sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, and IEEE Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC).

The 27th IEEE HPCC follows the tradition of previous successful IEEE HPCC conferences in the years from 2005 to 2024 in Asia, Europe, Australia, and America. It will feature sessions of regular presentations, workshops, tutorials, and keynote speeches. IEEE HPCC-2025 will be hosted in Exeter, the capital city of Devon and provides the county with a central base for education, medicine, religion, commerce, and culture. The city is also home to the magnificent Exeter Cathedral, which dates back to Norman times. Exeter is also ideally placed to base a trip to branch out visiting places such as the famous Dartmoor National Park and the unspoiled beaches of the North and South Devon coastlines.

Prospective authors are invited to submit their papers to HPCC-2025. Accepted papers will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore subject to meeting IEEE Xplore’s scope and quality requirements. The authors of selected best papers will be invited post conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals to be planned in conjunction with the conference.

*   **Camera Ready Deadline:** January 9, 2026, 11:59 pm AoE

## Abstract Submission

All full papers are required to submit an abstract and basic details about the paper a week before the paper submission deadline. Papers that did not submit the abstract on time will not be accepted. The abstract, title, and list of authors’ information that is submitted at that time must be complete. Submissions for which it is obvious that the information submitted by the abstract deadline is merely a placeholder or incomplete will be deleted.

## Format and Submission

Full papers are up to **eight camera-ready pages**, including figures, but excluding references. Accepted full papers will be published in the conference proceedings and presented in an oral session. Submissions longer than eight pages of content excluding references will be desk rejected and not reviewed.

All papers must be submitted in PDF format and conform to ACM Proceedings specifications using the general ACM SIG format (“sigconf”, double column format), not the SIGCHI format. Templates are available at this link (US letter).

ACM has partnered with Overleaf, where you can start writing using [this link](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-primary-article-template/wbvhrhcbdxkr). Ensure the document uses the “sigconf” document class, rather than the “manuscript,screen,review” document class by default.

## Tracks

The HRI 2026 full paper submissions will have five tracks:

*   Theory and Methods
*   Design
*   Technical
*   Systems
*   User Studies

Authors will need to indicate their choice of track (and optionally their second choice) when they submit their abstract. 

### Descriptions of Full Paper Tracks

**Theory and Methods:**
This track focuses on furthering the conceptual foundations of HRI and developing novel evaluation methodologies. Theory papers focus on elucidating or connecting fundamental HRI principles beyond individual interfaces or projects, new theoretical concepts in HRI, literature reviews, etc. Methods papers may include new ways of studying HRI, with focus on developing novel evaluation methodologies (e.g. new questionnaires), or in the analysis of existing research and methods derived from original or surveyed empirical research.

**Design:**
This track brings together design-centric research contributions to HRI. This includes novel design approaches, new robot morphologies, behavior paradigms, interaction techniques, and the exploration of new contexts for interaction that yield unique or improved interaction experiences with or capabilities for robots. 

**Technical:**
The primary knowledge contribution of papers submitted to the technical track is expected to be a novel algorithm (formalized through pseudocode), mathematical model (formalized through a set of equations), tool, hardware element, or human-robot interface, and should provide enough detail to allow reproducibility. 

**Systems:**
Because HRI is by its nature an integrative discipline, the Systems track focuses on contributions which consist of a synthesis of underlying techniques and/or technologies to achieve system-level HRI behavior. 

**User Studies:**
The studies track welcomes submissions that provide new knowledge about human-robot interactions based on studies involving people. This includes laboratory or field studies, ethnographic work, theory-building or replication studies, industry case studies, and so forth.

## ACMs New Open Access Publishing Model

Starting January 1, 2026, ACM will fully transition to Open Access. Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs).

Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC to publish their papers, unless they qualify for a financial or discretionary waiver.

ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more time for institutions to join ACM Open. The subsidy will offer:

*   **$250 APC for ACM/SIG members**
*   **$350 for non-members**

This temporary subsidized pricing will apply to all conferences scheduled for 2026, including HRI.

## New ACM Publication Policies

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.

## Anonymization

The HRI 2026 full papers review process is double-blind; every aspect of all submissions must be properly anonymized. For full details on how to do anonymization, see the [anonymization guidelines](https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2026/authorship-and-anonymization/).

## Sustainability Recognition

If you believe your paper contributes to sustainability in HRI and would like it to be considered for a sustainability recognition, when submitting your paper, you will have the option to describe in 1-2 short paragraphs why and how your paper relates to sustainability.

## Supplementary Materials

Authors have the opportunity to upload up to three supplemental files in conjunction with their full paper submission. These materials may be submitted via the “Supporting File 1,” “Supporting File 2,” and “Supporting File 3” sections within the full papers submission form in the submission system.

## Video Guidelines

Authors may submit a 1-minute video (up to 100 MB) as a supplement to their full paper. Accepted full papers with a video in supplementary material will be considered for Demo Fast Track. More details coming soon. Only MPG, MPEG or MP4 video formats can be used.

## Artifact Guidelines

Across all full paper tracks, we encourage submissions that introduce a novel “artifact” as an enabler to reproducibility, replicability, and recreation of HRI research, and/or to support new lines of HRI research. 

## Appendix Guidelines

Authors may upload an appendix directly or provide a link to supporting appendix material hosted anonymously online. Appendices are only for supplementary materials that would interrupt the flow of the text if presented in the main document.

## Studies with Human Participants

Studies that involve human participants need to include an ethical approval statement. In the case of child users, in addition to consent from legal carers / parents, authors should describe how they obtained the oral assent from minors.

## Policy on Use of ChatGPT or Similar Models

Text, images or any material generated from foundation models (LLMs, VLMs etc.), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text.

## Desk rejects

Desk rejects are made during the initial checks of submissions to save our reviewers’ time. The main reasons for a desk rejections include:

*   Scope: clearly out of scope for conference (e.g., no relevance to robots or to human-robot interaction).
*   Anonymization: any violation of the rules detailed in the anonymization guidelines
*   Incomplete submissions: missing submission information (including an obviously placeholder title or abstract, etc.).
*   Formatting issues:
    *   paper is breaking the full paper limit (eight pages excluding references);
    *   using an incorrect submission format.
*   Other obvious issues, such as paper clearly unfinished, obvious use of foundation models for generating the contents, not written in English, etc.
