## Evaluation Criteria

Technical research papers must not exceed 12 pages (including references). Submissions will be evaluated by at least three program committee members. The evaluation will focus on the novelty, originality, importance to the field, proper use of research methods, and presentation of the submissions.

## Submission Instructions

Submitted papers must have been neither previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop.

All submissions must be in English and must come in A4 paper size PDF format and conform, at the time of submission, to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt font, LaTeX users must use `\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}` without including the compsoc or compsocconf option). Also, papers must comply with the IEEE Policy on Authorship. Submissions must be submitted electronically in PDF before the due date via HotCRP.

The Chairs reserve the right to reject submissions (without reviews) that are not in compliance or out of scope for the conference.

IMPORTANT: The APSEC 2025 technical research track will use a double-blind reviewing process, which means that submissions must not reveal the authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-blind reviewing process. Please read the APSEC 2025 double-blind instructions carefully before preparing your paper.

## Double-Blind Policy

The APSEC 2025 technical research track will use a double-blind reviewing process, which means that submissions must not reveal the authors’ identities. The authors must make every effort to honor the double-blind reviewing process. Submissions must adhere to the following rules:

*   Omit authors’ names and institutions from your title page.
*   References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person. (For example, not “We build on our previous work…” but rather “We build on the work of…”)
*   There may be cases in which the current submission is a clear follow up of one of your previous work, and despite what recommended in the previous point, reviewers will clearly associate authorship of such a previous work to the current submission. In this case, you may decide to anonymize the reference itself at submission time. For example: “based on previous results [10]” .. where the reference is reported as “[10] Anonymous Authors. Omitted for double blind reviewing.” In doing so, however, please make sure that the APSEC 2025 submission is self-contained and its content can be reviewed and understood without accessing the previous paper.
*   Do not include acknowledgements of people, grants, organizations, etc. that would give away your identity. You may, of course, add these acknowledgements in the camera-ready version.
*   In general, aim to reduce the risk of accidental unblinding. For example, if you use an identifiable naming convention for your work, such as a project name, use a different name for your submission, which you may indicate has been changed for the purposes of double-blind reviewing. This includes names that may unblind individual authors and their institutions. For example, if your project is called GoogleDeveloperHelper, which makes it clear the work was done at Google, for the submission version, use the name DeveloperHelper or BigCompanyDeveloperHelper instead.
*   Avoid revealing the institution affiliations of authors or at which the work was performed. For example, if the evaluation includes a user study conducted with undergraduates from the CS 101 class that you teach, you might say “The study participants consist of 200 students in an introductory CS course.” You can of course add the institutional information in the camera-ready. Similar suggestions apply for work conducted in specific organizations (e.g., industrial studies). In such cases, avoid mentioning the organization’s name. Instead, you may just refer to the organization as “Org” or “Company”, etc. When appropriate and when this does not help too much in revealing the company’s name, you might mention the context (e.g., financial organization, video game development company, etc.).

APSEC 2025 believes in open science and that open science aids reproducibility and replicability. To improve these factors we encourage authors to consider disclosing the source code and datasets used within their paper, including extractors, survey data, etc. By sharing this information your contribution will be more impactful because others can follow up on your work and of course cite it. But please avoid linking directly to code repositories or tool deployments which can reveal your identity. Instead of doing so, please consider using services such as zenodo.org, figshare.com, which provide DOIs and support anonymous and semi-anonymous methods of archiving software and datasets. Archive.org is also recommended for the dissemination of larger datasets. These archived and anonymized datasets should be linked within the paper itself.

## Preprint Policy

To ensure a fair and unbiased double-blind review process, authors submitting papers to APSEC 2025 must comply with the following guidelines regarding the handling of non-anonymized versions. A non-anonymized version is considered any publicly available document (e.g., on arXiv) that contains essentially the same scientific content as the submitted paper, even if it differs in minor ways such as the title, paper structure or organization, length or formatting.

**Preprints Posted Before the Anonymity Period**

Authors are permitted to make a non-anonymized version of their paper publicly available before the anonymity period. The anonymity period starts one month before the submission deadline and ends when the paper is accepted, rejected, or withdrawn. However, in such cases, authors are responsible for minimizing the risk that reviewers can trivially link the submitted paper to a public version.

Specifically, authors must:

*   Take care to prevent the submitted manuscript from being associated with the non-anonymized version.
*   Not make the non-anonymized version easily discoverable via search engines by reusing distinctive phrases (e.g., title, keywords) from the submitted manuscript.
*   Not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period.
*   Not actively promote the non-anonymized version (e.g., via social media, blogs, or mailing lists).
*   Not reference, cite, or link to any non-anonymized version within the submitted manuscript.

**Post-Publication Preprint Policy According to IEEE Guidelines**

Upon acceptance and publication of a paper by IEEE, authors must update any publicly available non-anonymized version of the paper in one of the following ways:

*   Replace it with the full IEEE citation, including the Digital Object Identifier (DOI), or
*   Post the accepted version of the paper (i.e., the author’s final version prior to IEEE formatting), along with the DOI. The IEEE-published version must not be posted.

IEEE will provide each author with a preprint version of the article that includes the DOI, the IEEE copyright notice, and a statement confirming that the article has been accepted for publication by IEEE. Authors may post this preprint version in accordance with IEEE’s posting guidelines.

## Important Dates

*   Abstract Deadline (Optional): **July 13, 2025 (Extended)**
*   Paper Deadline: **July 20, 2025 (Extended)**
*   Author Notification: **September 20, 2025 (Extended)**

## Submission Categories

We solicit submissions in two categories:

*   **Technical Research Papers:** Describe innovative research in automating software development or automating support to users engaged in software development activities.
*   **Experience Papers:** Describe a significant experience in applying automated software engineering technology.

## Review Criteria

Each Technical Research paper will be evaluated based on:

*   **Significance:** The extent to which the paper’s contributions can impact the field of software engineering in practice or in research, and under which assumptions (if any).
*   **Novelty:** The extent to which the contributions are sufficiently original with respect to the state-of-the-art.
*   **Soundness:** The extent to which the paper’s key claims are supported by rigorous application of appropriate research methods.

Each Experience paper will be evaluated based on:

*   **Importance and Scope:** The extent to which the paper describes a problem of practical importance, explains how the problem was investigated, and in what context.
*   **Insights and Evidence:** The extent to which the paper’s conclusions are supported by evidence, and new insights, best practices, tools, or software processes are explained.
*   **Perspective:** The extent to which the paper identifies and discusses important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience

Additionally, the following criteria apply for both submission categories:

*   **Verifiability:** The extent to which the paper includes sufficient information to understand how the evidence for key claims in the paper was produced, and how the paper supports independent verification or replication of the paper’s claimed contributions.
*   **Presentation:** The extent to which the paper’s quality of writing meets the high standards of ASE, including clear descriptions, adequate use of the English language, absence of major ambiguity, clearly readable figures and tables, and adherence to the formatting instructions provided below.

The outcome of each paper will be one of the following: Accept, Revision, Reject.

## Originality

Papers submitted to ASE 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere when being considered for ASE 2025. Authors should be aware of the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ.

## Double Anonymous Review Process

The ASE 2025 Research Track will employ a double-anonymous review process. Thus, no submission may reveal its authors’ identities. 

Further advice, guidance, and explanation about the double-anonymous review process can be found on the Q&A page.

## Artifact Availability and Supplementary Material

We actively support and encourage all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility and replicability. 

[Blog post on disclosing data for double-blind review](https://ineed.coffee/5205/how-to-disclose-data-for-double-blind-review-and-make-it-archived-open-data-upon-acceptance/)

## ACM Policy on Research Involving Humans

If work reported in the paper involves human subjects, authors will be required to affirm compliance with the [ACM Policy on Research Involving Humans](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

## Formatting and Submission Guidelines

Abstracts and papers must be submitted electronically through the ASE 2025 HotCRP submission site: [https://ase25.hotcrp.com/](https://ase25.hotcrp.com/). All submissions must be in English.

All submissions must be in PDF format and conform, at time of submission, to the IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt type, LaTeX users must use `\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}` without including the compsoc or compsocconf option).

Submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, including all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Up to two additional pages containing ONLY references are permitted. Submissions that do not adhere to these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review.

Experience papers should contain the phrase “experience paper” prominently in the abstract, to ensure that they are evaluated appropriately.

## Accepted Papers

Accepted papers will be permitted an additional page of content to allow authors to incorporate review feedback. The page limit for published papers will therefore be 11 pages (including all figures, tables, appendices) plus 2 pages containing only references. Note that all submitted papers must conform to the 10+2 requirement, described above.

We strongly encourage authors of accepted papers to archive the research artifacts associated with their ASE papers, including code and data, in a repository with a DOI.

If a submission is accepted, at least one author of the paper is required to register for ASE 2025 and present the paper.

It is a prestigious forum for researchers and practitioners in Business Process Management, embracing interdisciplinary perspectives from computer science, information systems engineering, and management.","# BPM 2025: Call for Research Papers

The International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM) is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners in the field of BPM. The conference embraces the interdisciplinary nature of BPM, bringing together contributions from computer science, information systems engineering, and information systems management.

## Conference Tracks

The BPM conference is structured into three tracks:

*   **Track I: Foundations**
    *   Focuses on the underlying principles of BPM, including formal methods, algorithms, and conceptual models.
    *   Empirical evaluation is not mandatory, but technical quality and the potential to lay out new ways of modeling, analyzing, and improving BPM systems are essential.
*   **Track II: Engineering**
    *   Deals with engineering aspects of BPM research, including the development and investigation of artifacts and systems that aim to solve concrete problems in business environments.
    *   Requires rigorous and reproducible empirical evaluations to demonstrate the merits of the introduced artifact.
*   **Track III: Management**
    *   Focuses on the empirical, socio-technical, cognitive, psychological, managerial, and societal aspects of BPM.
    *   Seeks contributions that propose novel organizational and technology-enabled modes of BPM or advance our understanding of how organizations can develop process-oriented capabilities.

Submitting author teams are advised to pay special attention to the typical audiences for the contributions from each of the tracks. This will help them to select the right track for their work and shape their work according to the expectations from that audience.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

The BPM community is committed to the promotion of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in all aspects of our professional activities. We celebrate the diversity in our community and welcome everyone regardless of age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic background, country of origin, religion, sexual orientation, physical ability, education, and work experience.

## Open Science Principles

The BPM conference encourages authors of research papers to follow the principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability. In particular, the conference supports the adoption of open data and open source principles and encourages authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data in order to increase reproducibility and replicability.

Authors are asked to include in their manuscript links to private or public repositories where reviewers can find the research artifacts associated with the paper.

Those accepted papers that include research artifacts or datasets available on a publicly accessible archival repository with a DOI will be awarded with an “Artifacts Available” badge that will be included in the camera-ready version of the paper.

Authors are encouraged to self-archive their pre- and post-prints in open, preserved repositories, such as their institutional preprint repository, arXiv or other non-profit services, in line with Springer’s copyright agreement (see License to Publish form for LNCS, CCIS or LNBIP, §3)

## Submission Guidelines

*   Each paper must be submitted to exactly one track.
*   Papers must be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS formatting guidelines.
*   Submissions must be in English and cannot exceed 16 pages including references and appendices.
*   The title page must contain a short abstract clarifying the relation of the paper with the topics above.
*   Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the [BPM 2025 EasyChair submission site](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2025).
*   Submissions must be original contributions that have neither been published previously nor submitted to other conferences or journals while being submitted to BPM 2025.

## Double-Blind Review

BPM 2025 reviews are double blind. Thus, neither reviewers nor authors should be able to identify each other.

Papers including information that allows the identification of authors may be rejected at the discretion of the PC chairs.

## Awards

The BPM conference will recognize the best papers submitted to the conference with an award in two different categories:

*   Best paper award
*   Best student paper award

Papers eligible for the best student paper award are those whose contribution is carried out mainly by one or more (Ph.D.) student(s).

## BPM Forum

Papers that do not fully meet the quality criteria for the main conference, but make a significant contribution to the community, will be invited for presentation at the BPM Forum. Those papers make interesting contributions and will be published in full length in a separate post-proceedings volume in the Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP) series.

## Key Dates

*   **Paper Abstract submission:** 4 March 2025
*   **Paper submission:** 18 March 2025

## Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers

This year, CC will offer a second category of papers called “**Tools and Practical Experience**”. Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies. The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper.

The selection criteria for papers in this category are:

*   **Originality**
*   **Usability**
*   **Documentation**
*   **Benchmark Repository**
*   **Availability**
*   **Foundations**
*   **Artifact Evaluation**

## Double-Blind Reviewing Process

CC uses a double-blind reviewing process. Authors will need to identify any potential conflicts of interest with PC, as defined in the SIGPLAN policy.

To facilitate the double-blind reviewing process, submissions (including supplementary material) should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).

## Artifact Evaluation

Authors are encouraged to submit their artifacts for the Artifact Evaluation (AE). The Artifact Evaluation process begins after the acceptance notification and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers.

## Important Dates

All Deadlines are AoE (UTC-12h)

*   **Submission deadline:** Tue 5 Nov 2024
*   **Abstract deadline:** Tue 12 Nov 2024
*   **Author notification:** Wed 11 Dec - Fri 13 Dec 2024
*   **Artifact Submission Deadline:** Fri 17 Jan 2025

## Submission Guidelines

ATVA welcomes submissions in the following two categories:

*   Regular research papers (**18 pages**, excluding references, must be anonymized)
*   Tool papers (**10 pages**, excluding references, not anonymized)

Submissions in both categories must be in Springer’s LNCS format. Formatting style files and further guidelines for formatting can be found at the Springer website [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs). Adding line numbers (LaTeX package lineno) is highly recommended.

Papers must be submitted through EasyChair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atva2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=atva2025)

Accepted papers in both categories will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. A few outstanding papers will be selected for a distinguished paper award. At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference.

### Regular Papers

Regular papers at ATVA 2025 will follow a full double-blind review process, which means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, the reference should be made in the third person. These are firm submission requirements, and any regular paper that does not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.

Authors of accepted regular papers will be invited (but are not required) to submit a relevant artifact for evaluation by the artifact evaluation committee. 

### Tool Papers

Tool papers will follow a single-blind review process. They do NOT need to be anonymized.

Each tool paper submission must be followed by a separate artifact submission via EasyChair. Papers describing tools that have already been presented (in any conference) will be accepted only if significant and clear enhancements to the tool are reported and implemented.

## Paper Types

Papers submitted to CGO can be standard research papers, tools papers or practical experience papers. All must be written in the IEEE conference format (use the conference mode), and may have up to **10 pages**, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 10 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. In other words, papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an [ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/), so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.

## Tool Papers

Tool paper authors should prepend their paper title with **‘Tool:’** to provide clarity that this is a tools paper during the review process (this can be removed for the final camera-ready paper).

The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper. Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.

## Practical Experience Papers

Practical experience paper authors should prepend their paper title with **‘Practical:’** to provide clarity that this is a practical experience paper during the review process (this can be removed for the final camera-ready paper).

Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.

## Submission Information

Papers can be submitted at [https://cgo26-first-round.hotcrp.com/](https://cgo26-first-round.hotcrp.com/).

Your submission is limited to **ten (10) letter-size (8.5″x11″), single-spaced, double-column pages, using 10pt or larger font, not including references.** There is no page limit for references. We strongly encourage the use of the IEEE Conference Template.  Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be outright rejected at the discretion of the program chairs. 

## Conflict of Interest

Please read these guidelines on conflicts of interest carefully before submission.

Authors must register all their conflicts on the paper submission site. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers.

## ACM Open

All CHI 2026 papers will be published under ACM Open.

Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs).

Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC to publish their papers, unless they qualify for a financial or discretionary waiver. To find out whether an APC applies to your article, please consult the list of participating institutions in ACM Open and review the APC Waivers and Discounts Policy.

Understanding that this change could present financial challenges, ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition:

*   **$250 APC for ACM/SIG members**
*   **$350 for non-members**

## Publication Policies & Requirements

Authors must review ACM’s publications policies. Please read [this separate page](https://chi2026.acm.org/acm-publication-policies/) for them.

## Policy on Use of Large Language Models

Text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, must be marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text. Please review the [April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) before using these tools. The [SIGCHI blog post](https://medium.com/sigchi/acm-publications-policy-guidance-for-sigchi-venues-87332173aad1) describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools, which we refer to for guidance.

## Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects

Any research in submitted manuscripts that involves human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. Please also see the 2021 ACM Publications policy on [research involving humans](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects) before submitting.

## Video Presentations

Authors can optionally upload a video presentation (a presentation video of your accepted work) by the video presentation deadline of **Thursday, March 12, 2026.** See [technical requirements for video content at CHI](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/videos/) for guidance when preparing a video presentation.

Submissions in both categories will be evaluated to the same standards in terms of novelty, scientific value, demonstrated usefulness, and potential impact on the field. The chosen category at the time of the submission cannot be changed after the submission deadline.

## ACM Publication

Papers accepted and presented at HPDC 2025 will be published in the ACM Digital Library at no additional cost to the authors. (The transition to ACM OPEN publication fees will take place in 2026.)

## Submission Guidelines

Authors are invited to submit technical papers of at most **11 pages** in PDF format, excluding references. Accepted papers will have the flexibility to use an additional page in the camera-ready to incorporate feedback from the reviewers. Papers should be formatted in the ACM Proceedings Style (using sigconf from [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)) and submitted via the conference submission website.

Submitted papers must be original work that has not appeared in and is not under consideration for another conference or a journal.

## Anonymizing Submissions

HPDC uses dual-anonymous (identities of reviewers and authors are not shared) reviewing. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of the author names.

## Important Dates

*   **(Firm) Paper Submission Deadline (Technical Papers):** February 6, 2025
*   **Notification of Acceptance (Technical Papers):** April 4, 2025
*   **Camera-ready Version (Technical Papers):** May 1, 2025

## HPDC Policy on the use of AI

HPDC permits the use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly, or other AI assistants) to help improve the submission text. We recommend that you use these services merely for language rectification. The authors should verify whether the results are accurate before submission. Only the authors are fully responsible and accountable for the contents of their papers. AI tools are not eligible for authorship.

The use of any AI-generated text must be disclosed in the acknowledgments section. The sections of the paper that use AI-generated text should have a citation to the AI system used in the acknowledgments section. The acknowledgment section should still follow the dual-anonymous submission guideline (i.e., any author-related information should not be included).

The International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) is the premier forum for new research results on the theory and applications of planning and scheduling technology. The 35th edition of the ICAPS conference series will be held in **Melbourne, Victoria (Australia), from November 9th to 14th, 2025**.

The program committee of ICAPS 2025 invites paper submissions on all aspects of automated planning and scheduling.

Contributions are welcome in each of the following categories:

*   Theoretical papers
*   Algorithmic papers
*   Modelling papers
*   Position papers
*   Tools papers

All submissions to the main technical track must be classified in terms of one or more high-level topics, and one or more relevant subject-matter keywords, which are available from the [ICAPS 2025 homepage](organisation/paper_classification_system).

## Key Dates

The reference timezone for all deadlines is UTC-12. That is, the deadline has not passed as long as there is still time anywhere in the world.

*   **October 1, 2024** - Submission site opens
*   **October 25, 2024** - Abstracts due
*   **November 1, 2024** - Full papers due (electronic submission, PDF)
*   **November 15, 2024** - Desk reject notification
*   **December 16, 2024** - Phase 1 author notification
*   **January 27-31, 2024** - Author feedback period
*   **February 28, 2025** - Phase 2 author notification

## Author Guidelines

All types of papers can be submitted as either long (8 pages AAAI style plus one page of references) or short (4 pages plus one page of references). Whether the paper is long or short must be indicated at submission time.

Over-length papers will be rejected without review. A paper is over-length whenever content other than the ethical impacts statement or acknowledgements section appears on page 9 (resp. Page 5) of long (resp. short) papers.

All papers that satisfy length and formatting requirements will be reviewed against standard criteria such as relevance, originality, significance, clarity, and soundness. Submissions are expected to meet the high standards of publication expected by ICAPS.

The review process has three possible outcomes:

1.  acceptance for oral presentation and inclusion in the archival proceedings of the ICAPS conference series;
2.  acceptance for poster presentation and non-archival extended abstract, for dissemination via the ICAPS 2025 website;
3.  rejection.

Papers submitted to ICAPS 2025 may not be submitted to other conferences or journals during the ICAPS 2025 review period, nor may they be already under review, accepted, or published in other conferences or journals.

Authors making multiple submissions must ensure that each submission has significant, unique content. Papers sharing co-authors and substantial overlap will be rejected. In case of doubt, please contact the program chairs of ICAPS 2025 before submission.

The format of ICAPS 2025 will be in-person. As such, we expect at least one author of each accepted paper to register for the conference and present their work in person, unless exceptional circumstances prevent this.

## Use of Generative AI

ICAPS 2025 continues the policy adopted in 2024 regarding using large-scale language models (LLMs) and other so-called “Generative AI” tools. Papers that include text generated from an LLM are prohibited unless the produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. We stress that this policy DOES NOT prohibit authors from using these technologies for editing or polishing author-written text.

This policy is in line with [standing AAAI policy](https://aaai.org/conference/aaai/aaai-25/policies-for-aaai-25-authors) in that no AI system satisfies the criteria for authorship of papers published by AAAI Press (ICAPS’ publisher) and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in such papers.

Authors assume full responsibility for the content of submitted work, including checking for plagiarism and authenticity of all text.

## Ethical / Societal Impact

Authors are encouraged to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. This statement can be included in either the main body pages or the reference page.

## Best Paper Awards and Journal Fast Track

Following the ICAPS tradition, we will award the best non-student and student papers. These papers may also receive an invitation to submit an extended version to a top AI journal, such as the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) or the Artificial Intelligence Journal (AIJ).

## Submission Instructions

All submissions will be made electronically via [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=icaps-conference.org/ICAPS/2025/Conference). Submitted papers must be anonymous for double-blind reviewing, must adhere to the page limits of the relevant submission type (long or short), and must follow the author kit instructions for formatting. We use a slightly modified version of the AAAI 2025 author kit that can be found [following this link](/files/icaps2025-author-kit.zip).

Authors can submit supplementary material (videos, technical proofs, additional experimental results) in addition to the PDF paper they submit.

Failure to comply with the submission instructions above will result in desk rejection.

## Double-blind requirements

Double-blind requirements are satisfied whenever authors omit their names and institutions, refer to prior work by themselves or others in the third person, and ensure that the acknowledgement notices or ethics statements do not include information that may identify them. We do not discourage authors from posting their manuscripts onto Arxiv.org or other similar repositories.
