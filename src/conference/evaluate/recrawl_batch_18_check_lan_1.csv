## Rebuttal Period

Papers reaching the second round of reviewing will have an opportunity to write a rebuttal to reviewer questions. This period will be interactive, enabling communication between authors and reviewers via HotCRP’s anonymous communication feature.

## Symposium Event Changes

Due to venue limitations and costs, each accepted paper will have:
*   A short talk presentation (e.g., 5-7 minutes).
*   A poster presentation immediately following the talk session.
All accepted papers are required to present both a short talk and a poster.

## Instructions for Paper Submission

*   Submissions must be original work, with any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers clearly documented.
*   Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed.
*   Any author may not submit more than 6 papers per cycle.

## Anonymous Submission

*   Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review. No author names or affiliations should appear on the title page, and authors should avoid revealing their identity in the text.
*   Avoid references to your university or institution by name, use generalities like ""our university"".
*   Do not include acknowledgments that help identify authors.
*   Refer to previous work in the third person, without identifying yourselves. If a third-person reference is infeasible, blind the reference itself.
*   Artifacts repositories should not identify authors.
*   Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors must identify any potential conflicts of interest with PC members during submission. Conflicts include co-authorship, working in the same company/university within the past two years, collaboration within the past two years, being a thesis advisor/advisee, or close personal friendship.

## Research Ethics Committee (REC)

Papers flagged by reviewers for potentially ethically fraught research will be reviewed by the REC. The REC may suggest rejection on ethical grounds.

## Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure

Where research identifies a vulnerability, authors are expected to act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm. Disclosure to vendors is encouraged, with a typical disclosure window of 45 to 90 days ahead of publication.

Submitted papers must discuss steps taken to address vulnerabilities. CVE identifiers should not be included in the submitted paper to preserve anonymity.

## Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research

Submissions involving human subjects must disclose IRB approval/waiver status and discuss steps taken to ensure ethical treatment of participants.

## Financial and Non-financial Competing Interests

Authors must declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in the camera-ready versions of their papers.

## Page Limit and Formatting

*   Submitted papers may include up to **13 pages of text** and up to **5 pages for references and appendices** (totaling no more than 18 pages).
*   All text and figures past page 13 must be clearly marked as part of the appendix.
*   Papers must be formatted for US letter size paper.
*   Submissions must use the IEEE “compsoc” conference proceedings template. LaTeX submissions must use `IEEEtran.cls` version 1.8b with options “conference,compsoc.”.
*   Papers that fail to use the correct template, modify margins, font, or line spacing, or use egregious space scrunching are subject to rejection without review.

## Withdrawing Policy

A paper can be withdrawn at any point before reviews are sent to authors. After reviews are sent, withdrawal is not permitted.

## Authorship Policy

Changes to the authorship list are not permitted during submission. Post-acceptance changes require TPC Chair approval.

## ORCID Requirement

All authors are required to submit an ORCID number at paper submission time. Papers without ORCID numbers for all authors will be desk rejected.

## Conference Submission Server

Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf).

*   First deadline submissions: [https://cycle1.sp2026.ieee-security.org/](https://cycle1.sp2026.ieee-security.org/)

## Publication and Presentation

One of the authors of an accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference.

## Topics

SOSP takes a broad view of systems and solicits contributions from many fields of systems practice, including: operating systems, file and storage systems, distributed systems, cloud computing, mobile and edge systems, secure and reliable systems, systems aspects of big data and machine learning, embedded and real-time systems, virtualization, networking as it relates to operating systems, and management and troubleshooting of complex systems. We also welcome work that explores the interaction of computer systems with related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, verification, and databases. In keeping with SOSP tradition, we will favor work that explores new territory, continues a significant research dialogue, or reflects on experience with or measurements of state-of-the-art implementations.

## Submission Criteria

Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. A good paper will:

*   Motivate a significant problem;
*   Propose and implement an interesting, compelling solution;
*   Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution;
*   Draw appropriate conclusions;
*   Clearly describe the paper's contributions; and
*   Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work.

We encourage submission of groundbreaking work in significant new directions, with the understanding that the evaluation criteria for papers addressing new problems may be different from those continuing a line of work in a more established area.

## Artifact Evaluation

SOSP will continue the successful tradition of running an optional Artifact Evaluation process. Authors have a few days after acceptance notifications to register their artifact, then a few more days to polish them for evaluation. The artifact evaluation process is cooperative. Authors have the opportunity to fix problems found by evaluators during the evaluation period, and are thus expected to reply within reasonable time.

## Originality

Submissions should contain original, unpublished material. Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism is not allowed. Submissions that extend the authors' previous work are welcome, but authors must explain the differences between the SOSP submission and the prior work, much in the same way that the authors are expected to articulate the contributions of their submission as they relate to prior work by others. Self-comparisons should be properly anonymized, as described below. Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in SOSP. The online submission form will require authors to submit a copy of the related workshop paper and a short explanation of the new material in the conference paper beyond that published in the workshop version. As long as there is significant additional content in the submission compared to the prior workshop publication, the PC will evaluate the submission's entire contribution, not just the delta. Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, technical reports, talks, and social media posts, is explicitly permitted.

## Resubmissions

Submitting a paper that had been previously submitted to and not accepted by another conference is permitted, although authors are expected to have improved the paper to address substantive issues raised in previous reviews. Authors should provide information regarding the previous submission(s) and a summary of the subsequent revisions to the paper. This description, which will be supplied to reviewers after they’ve completed their reviews, helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit the description of changes to one page. All information should be properly anonymized, as described below, and should be uploaded via the submission form.

## Anonymity

SOSP will use double-blind reviewing. Please make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission. Avoid identifying yourself or your institution explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments). The first page should use the paper ID assigned during registration in place of the author names. If the name of your project or system is already known to the community (e.g., through arXiv, technical reports, talks, social media posts, or other uses), your SOSP submission must use an anonymized name. Use care in referring to your own related work. Do not omit references to your prior work, as this would make it difficult for reviewers to place your submission in its proper context. Instead, reference your past work in the third person, just as you would any other piece of related work. For example, you might say ""Our system modifies the XYZ operating system built by Lee et al. [Lee17]"". For concurrent submissions on related topics, cite an anonymized version of the concurrent submission and discuss the relation between the submissions. Additionally, please email the PC chairs (program@sosp26.cit.tum.de) a copy of your other concurrent submission. If your submission reports on experiences with a system at your institution or organization, you should refer to the system anonymously but describe the properties of the system that are needed to appreciate the work (e.g., size of the user base, volume of requests, etc.). We recognize that, in some cases, these properties may allow a reviewer to identify your institution or organization. Check with the program chairs (program@sosp26.cit.tum.de) if you are uncertain about the anonymity rules.

## Supplementary Material

Authors may optionally include supplementary material as a separate document. Supplementary material is intended for items that are not critical for evaluating the paper but may be of interest to some readers. Examples include: formal proofs that are only sketched in the submission, additional analyses, and methodological details that aren’t essential for the PC’s assessment but are important for reproducibility. PC members are not required to read this optional supplementary material, so the submission must stand alone without it.

## Formatting

Papers will be submitted electronically in PDF format via the [web submission form](https://sosp26.hotcrp.com/) (TBD).

Submissions may have at most **12 pages** of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit. Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by 8 mm (0.33 in) of whitespace. Use 10-point font (typeface Times Roman, Linux Libertine, etc.) on 12-point (single-spaced) leading. Graphs and figures should be readable without magnification; they are encouraged to be in color, but should remain readable if printed in grayscale. All pages should be numbered, and references within the paper should be hyperlinked.

Submissions violating these rules will not be considered for publication, and there will be no extensions for fixing violations. We encourage you to upload an early draft of the paper well before the deadline to check if the paper meets the formatting rules. Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the [official SIGPLAN LaTeX](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) or [MS Word templates](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) from the ACM.

For Latex, we recommend you use:
```latex
\documentclass[sigplan,10pt]{acmart}
\renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{}
... (other preamble settings)
\settopmatter{printfolios=true}
\maketitle
\pagestyle{plain}
...
```

## Confidentiality

Reviewing will be done mostly by members of the program committee, with limited use of outside reviewers. Submissions will be treated as confidential; however, papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered for publication.

## Conflicts

To avoid conflicts of interest in the review process, when you register and submit your paper, we ask that you provide information about conflicts between any of the authors of your submission and PC members. Use the following guidelines to determine conflicts:

*   **Institutional:** You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years (since April 2024), or are going to begin employment at the same institution. Former interns should list their internship supervisor(s) and collaborator(s) as conflicts, not the entire institution where they interned.
*   **Advisor:** You have a past or present association as PhD thesis advisor or advisee.
*   **Collaborator:** You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years (April 2024 or later).
*   **Personal:** You are close family relatives (e.g., spouses, domestic partners, parents, children, or siblings).

The PC chairs will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. Similarly, if there is no basis for conflicts provided by authors, such conflicts may be removed (e.g., do not improperly identify a PC member as a conflict in an attempt to avoid having the individual review your paper). If you have any questions about conflicts, please contact the program co-chairs (program@sosp26.cit.tum.de).

PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the ""conflict chair"". Any paper with a PC chair co-author will be held to a higher standard of being a “clear accept”.

## Author Response Period

SOSP will provide an opportunity for authors to respond to reviews prior to final consideration of the papers at the program committee meeting. Authors must limit their responses to (a) correcting factual errors in the reviews or (b) directly addressing questions posed by reviewers. Responses should be limited to clarifying the submitted work. In particular, responses must not include new experiments or data, describe additional work completed since submission, or promise additional work to follow. As PC members are not required to review supplementary materials, responses must not rely on the existence of those materials. Submission of a response is optional. There is no explicit limit to the response, but authors are strongly encouraged to keep responses under 500 words; reviewers are neither required nor expected to read excessively long responses.

## Accepted Papers

Papers selected by the program committee will be subject to revision and approval by a program committee member acting as a shepherd. Authors of accepted papers will be expected to supply electronic versions of their papers and encouraged to supply source code and raw data to help others replicate and understand their results, as part of an artifact evaluation process. To facilitate broad technical discussion, all accepted papers will be made available online in advance of the conference. The official publication date will be the date the proceedings are made publicly accessible. For more information about the ACM OpenSurround Service, please go to [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/free-access](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/free-access). Papers of particular merit will be forwarded to the ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS) and the Communications of the ACM's Research Highlights (CACM RH) for possible publication.

## About TechDebt 2026

Technical Debt stands as a pivotal metaphor in the realm of software evolution, representing development shortcuts taken for expediency that cause the degradation of internal software quality. A critical element of the technical debt metaphor is its ability to bridge the communication gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders within software development teams. The International Conference on Technical Debt (TechDebt) is the flagship conference dedicated to discussing how to identify, address, and manage technical debt in software projects. This premier event unites leading researchers and practitioners in software engineering to explore diverse strategies for managing various forms of technical debt, share experiences and best practices, and identify the most pressing challenges faced by both industry and academia.

The 9th International Conference on Technical Debt will be held on **April 12-13, 2026**, in **Rio de Janeiro, Brazil**. As with the previous editions, TechDebt will be co-located with the **48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)**.

As computer systems, communication networks, and artificial intelligence (AI) undergo rapid development, accompanied by increasing complexity, user expectations for trust, security, and privacy have grown considerably. This presents a significant challenge, as traditional security technologies and measures may struggle to meet evolving demands in open, dynamic, heterogeneous, mobile, wireless, and distributed computing environments. Consequently, the imperative is to construct systems and networks that enable users to access more comprehensive services while concurrently upholding trust, security, and privacy. In response, trusted computing and communications have emerged as pivotal and innovative technologies, capturing heightened researcher interest.

The IEEE TrustCom-2024 (23rd IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications) is a forum for presenting leading works on trusted computing, communications, networking, and machine learning, with regard to trust, security, privacy, reliability, dependability, survivability, availability, and fault tolerance aspects of computer systems and networks, as well as AI.

TrustCom-2024 will be hosted in Sanya, China, and will feature sessions of regular presentations, workshops, tutorials, and keynote speeches. Accepted papers will be submitted for possible inclusion into IEEE Xplore, subject to meeting IEEE Xplore's scope and quality requirements. Authors of selected best papers will be invited post-conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals.
