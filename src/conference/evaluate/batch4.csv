The conference brings together researchers and academics from industry and academia, featuring keynote talks, research and applied data science tracks, tutorials, poster sessions, system demonstrations, and a Young Researchers Symposium, with a recent focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.","# Call for Research Track Papers

We invite the submission of papers describing innovative and original research contributions in the areas of data science, data management, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, as well as papers describing the design, implementation and results of solutions of such advances to real-world problems. Papers can range from theoretical contributions to systems and algorithms to experimental research and benchmarking. We invite two types of submissions:

*   **Archival papers:** 8 pages + 2 pages for references.
*   **Non-archival papers:** 2 pages + 1 page references.

Papers submitted to the **Archival track** will undergo a rigorous review process that will judge submissions for the novelty of the described approaches. The goal of the **non-archival track** is to provide authors with a fast-track route to get feedback for any preliminary ideas that show promising results but do not yet have the maturity to be submitted to the archival track.

Papers accepted in the archival track will appear in the conference proceedings and be published. The publication venue will be announced soon. Papers accepted in the non-archival track will be presented in the conference but not published.

**Review Process:** Unlike previous years, CODS 2025 will have a single-stage review process, i.e., there will not be a rebuttal stage and no option to submit revised papers. Authors of all accepted papers (archival and non-archival) must present their work at the conference.

At the time the extended abstract is submitted to CPM, and for the entire review period, the paper (or essentially the same paper) should not be under review by any other conference with published proceedings or by a scientific journal.

At least one author of an accepted paper is expected to present the paper at the conference as a registered participant. The conference will be held in person at the University of Milano-Bicocca, within easy reach from the city center of Milan, Italy.

## Ethics Statement

Authors are expected to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out the research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so will result in summary rejection. If research has the potential to cause harm, the paper should include a clear statement about why the benefit of the research outweighs the harms, and how authors have taken measures to ensure safety and minimize harms. Consultation with an Institutional Review Board (IRB) is encouraged if available.

Submissions must not substantially duplicate published work or work that has been submitted in parallel to any other journal or conference/workshop with published proceedings. Accepted submissions may not appear in any other conference or workshop that has proceedings.

The review process will consist of two rounds with a rebuttal phase. In the first round, the program committee will reject some submissions; the rest will proceed to the second round. At the end of the first round, the authors will be either notified of rejection, or invited to submit a response to questions from the program committee (if any). The authors' response will be used to make the final decision in the second round.

The double-blind review process will follow the IACR Conflict of Interest Policy. The authors will be asked, at submission time, to help identify program committee members with potential conflicts of interest.

## Awards

The Program Committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall **Best Paper Award**. The Program Committee may also award a prize for the **best paper(s) authored exclusively by students and postdocs** (at the time of submission). Awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.

## Stipends

Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. A limited number of stipends will be available to those unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply.

The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research (CPAIOR 2025) will be held in **Melbourne, Australia**, from **November 10 to November 13, 2025**. The conference will be co-located with [ICAPS 2025](https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/) and [KR 2025](https://kr.org/KR2025/).

## Aim of the Conference

The aim of CPAIOR is to bring together researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Operations Research (OR) to present new techniques, applications, and theoretical & practical insights. The conference especially encourages interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative problem-solving by focusing on papers that actively combine, integrate, or contrast approaches from more than one of these areas. High-quality papers from a single area, as well as applications showcasing CP/AI/OR on challenging practical problems, are also welcomed.

## Topics of Interest

The program committee invites submissions that include, but are not limited to, the following topics:

*   New methodologies in the interface between predictive and prescriptive pipelines, such as machine learning techniques applied to tackle optimization problems and, conversely, CP/OR techniques to address AI and machine learning tasks.
*   Novel relaxation and inference methods based on constraint propagation, polyhedral techniques/cutting planes, convex/second-order conic optimization, graph-based algorithms, dynamic programming, and decision diagrams for optimization.
*   New search perspectives involving enumeration/branch-and-bound strategies, innovative decomposition techniques (e.g., based on column generation/Benders), intelligent backtracking, incomplete search, and learning-based heuristics.
*   Advanced integrated methods that expose new model transformations, communication strategies across MIP/CP/SAT solvers, distributed solution techniques, and solver selection (e.g., portfolio approaches).
*   Innovative models and applications of CP/AI/OR techniques.
*   Implementation or evaluation of CP/AI/OR techniques and optimization systems.

## Submission Types

Submissions are of two types:

1.  **Regular Papers:** Submitted for publication and presentation.
2.  **Extended Abstracts:** Submitted for presentation only.

## Awards

The conference will recognize a **Distinguished Paper Award** and a **Student Paper Award**.
