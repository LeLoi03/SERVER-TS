The 20th ACM ASIA Conference on Computer and Communications Security (ACM ASIACCS 2025) seeks paper submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of security and privacy. We seek articles presenting accessible and compelling results to general computer security researchers. Purely theoretical (e.g., cryptography-focused, with no security/application connections) submissions are not encouraged. The same goes for submissions focusing primarily on blockchains or machine learning.

Like in previous years, we will also be accepting “Systemisation of Knowledge” (SoK) papers. SoK submissions need to add the prefix “SoK: ” in the title. They will be accepted based on the value to the community. Survey papers without insights evaluating, systematizing and contextualizing current knowledge will be rejected.

## Submission Instructions

Please read the instructions below before submitting your paper. Please get in touch with the PC chairs at [asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org](mailto:asiaccs2025-pc-chairs@acm.org) for any questions regarding the submissions.

[SUBMIT YOUR PAPER HERE](https://asiaccs2025b.hotcrp.com/)

## Paper Formatting

*   Technical papers submitted for ASIACCS must be written in English.
*   Papers must be in PDF format and at most **12 pages double-column**. We will allow up to **10 additional pages** for the bibliography and well-marked appendices, but note that reviewers are not expected to read the appendices.
*   Authors should prepare the submissions using the latest ACM Sigconf style conference template.
*   All fonts, images, tables, and figures must comply with common standards and not generate problems for reviewers.
*   Titles of SoK papers must begin with “SoK:”
*   Submissions not meeting the formatting requirements risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

## Conflicts of Interest

When submitting the paper, authors must declare the conflict of interest (COI) with the Program Committee members, including the chairs. Those who are considered COI include:

*   Anyone who shares an institutional affiliation with an author of the paper at the time of submission.
*   Anyone who was the advisor or advisee of an author at any time in the past.
*   Anyone the author has collaborated with or published within the prior two years.

PC members, including chairs with a conflict of interest with a paper, will be entirely excluded from the evaluation of that paper. Failure to declare COI or declaring fake COI can lead to the paper being rejected. If a PC member with COI reviews a paper, it will be rejected.

## Anonymous Submissions

ASIACCS employs a double-blind reviewing process. All submissions should be appropriately anonymized.

*   Author names and affiliations should not appear in the paper. The authors should avoid obvious self-references and should appropriately blind them if used.
*   The list of authors cannot be changed (but the order can be) after the submission is made unless approved by the Program Chairs.
*   Publishing the submission on a preprint repository, such as arXiv, is allowed but authors should refrain from broadly advertising their results (e.g., social media, seminars, etc.) and may not contact TPC members regarding their submitted work.

## Double and Concurrent Submissions

Submissions to ASIACCS 2025 must not substantially overlap with papers that are published or simultaneously submitted to other venues with proceedings (including journals or conferences/workshops). Double submission will result in immediate rejection. We may report detected violations to other conference chairs and journal editors.

## Ethical Considerations

The authors should clarify any potential ethical and legal concerns to their results, highly critical vulnerabilities or exploits, etc. The authors should provide evidence (beyond approval of the experiment by their institution) elaborating how they have thoroughly considered such issues. The Program Committee reserves the right to reject a submission if the authors present insufficient evidence that the study appropriately addressed ethical or relevant legal concerns.

## Early Rejection and Appeals

There will be no conventional rebuttal process. Papers that receive substantially negative initial reviews will be rejected early.

The authors of early-rejected papers, and only such papers, will receive a copy of their initial reviews. Authors who substantively disagree with the reviews can appeal to the PC chairs within 72 hours upon receipt of the notification email. Authors’ appeals must clearly and explicitly identify substantial disagreements with factual statements in the initial reviews that should be adjudicated by a particular arbitration reviewer who the PC chairs may recruit. Appealing a submission that was rejected early will keep it under consideration, and it cannot be withdrawn or resubmitted elsewhere until the final notification of acceptance or rejection.

## Paper Revision and Resubmission

Rejected papers in the Cycle 1 cannot be resubmitted in the Cycle 2.

A small number of the Cycle 1 submissions may receive a Revise decision, rather than Accept or Reject and may be revised and resubmitted together with the response to reviewers’ comments into the same HOTCRP submission server. The revision may include running additional experiments, improving the paper’s presentation, or other improvements. Papers meeting the expectations will typically be accepted. We will request additional revisions only in exceptional circumstances.

## Camera-Ready and Conference Presentation

If a paper is accepted, the author list in the submission cannot be changed when preparing the camera-ready version.

Authors of accepted papers must also guarantee that their papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of the paper must be registered at the appropriate full conference rate.

The ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS) is the premier academic forum for multidisciplinary applied computer systems research spanning hardware, software, and their interaction. ASPLOS 2026 will be held in **Pittsburgh, USA – March 22-26, 2026**.

## Synopsis

ASPLOS focuses on practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and associated areas such as networking and storage. Key changes for this year include:

*   **Two submission cycles**
*   **Limit on the number of submissions by the same author**
*   **Explicit assessment of Interdisciplinary research**
*   **Unlimited appendix**

## Program Chairs

*   Benjamin C. Lee, University of Pennsylvania
*   Harry Xu, University of California Los Angeles
*   Mark Silberstein, Technion – Israel Institute of Technology

## Important Dates

ASPLOS 2026 features two submission deadlines: Spring and Summer.

### Spring Cycle

*   **Abstract submission:** March 05, 2025 (11:59pm Eastern)
*   **Full paper submission:** March 12, 2025
*   **Author response:** June 09 — 13, 2025
*   **Notification:** June 24, 2025

### Summer Cycle

*   **Abstract submission:** August 13, 2025 (11:59pm Eastern)
*   **Full paper submission:** August 20, 2025
*   **Author response:** November 10 — 14, 2025

*   **Notification:** November 24, 2025

## Submission Website

*   [Spring Cycle HotCRP](https://asplos26-spring.hotcrp.com/)

## Scope and Expectations

ASPLOS 2026 covers all practical aspects related to computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems, as well as closely-related associated areas. This includes topics such as:

*   Existing, emerging, and nontraditional compute platforms at all scales
*   Heterogeneous architectures and accelerators
*   Internet services, cloud computing, and datacenters
*   Memory, storage, networking, and I/O
*   Power, energy, and thermal management
*   Profiling, debugging, and testing
*   Security, reliability, and availability
*   Systems for enabling parallelism and computation on big data
*   Virtualization and virtualized systems

We seek original, high-quality research submissions that improve and further the knowledge of applied computer systems, with emphasis on the intersection between the main ASPLOS disciplines: Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Computer Architecture and Emerging Hardware. Submissions may target diverse goals such as throughput, latency, energy, and security. We value submissions accompanied by clearly defined artifacts and encourage new ideas and approaches.

## Explicit Assessment of Interdisciplinary Research

This interdisciplinary nature will be a significant factor in acceptance decisions. Authors must identify and justify the core disciplines their paper contributes to. Papers with only a single specified discipline are less likely to be accepted, and low relevance scores from reviewers will affect acceptance chances. Papers deemed to not fit the selected disciplines may be rejected without review.

## Resubmissions

*   Papers rejected from ASPLOS'25 Spring may be submitted to ASPLOS'26 Spring.
*   Papers rejected from ASPLOS'25 Summer may be submitted to ASPLOS'26 Summer.
*   Papers rejected from ASPLOS'25 Fall may be submitted to ASPLOS'26 Summer.
*   Papers withdrawn after reviews are considered ""rejected"" and are subject to resubmission rules.

## Limit on Submissions

The number of submissions by the same author is limited to **5 submissions per submission cycle**.

## Major Revisions

Some submissions may receive a ""Major Revision"" decision. Authors will have the opportunity to revise their work based on reviewer feedback and resubmit within 6 weeks. Revised submissions can use up to 13 pages (2 more than the original submission limit).

## Declaring Areas and Topics

Authors should indicate up to 3 relevant topics on the submission form to aid reviewer assignment. Incorrect selection may lead to less competent reviewers.

## Anonymization

ASPLOS employs a **double-blind review process**. Authors must anonymize their submissions by avoiding explicit or implicit identification of themselves or their institutions in the submitted documents, including metadata. Cite your own work as if by a third party or use anonymized supplemental material. Contact the program chairs for exceptions.

## Anonymized Supplemental Material and Appendixes

Supplemental material and appendixes may be submitted with no page limit but are not required reading for reviewers and should not be used to circumvent the main page limit.

## Declaring Conflicts of Interest (COI)

Authors must register all conflicts in the HotCRP submission page. Failure to declare or false declaration of conflicts may result in summary rejection. Specific guidelines for declaring COIs with institutions, individuals, and collaborations are provided.

## Declaring Authors

All authors must be declared upfront. Additions or removals after acceptance require program chair approval.

## Originality and Concurrent Submissions

Submitted manuscripts must be original and not substantially similar to prior publications or under review elsewhere. Technical reports and arXiv.org uploads are not considered prior publications.

## Ethical and Other Obligations

Authors must not break anonymity, contact reviewers/PC members inappropriately, advertise their work during certain periods, or post reviews publicly before results are announced. Adherence to the ACM ethics policy and ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects is mandatory.

## Formatting and Editing

*   Submissions must be PDF files, using the ACM's acmart Latex class with the sigplan proceedings template.
*   **Page Limit:** 11 pages (excluding references and appendices).
*   **Page Size:** US Letter (8.5in x 11in).

The conference is a prestigious forum for researchers and practitioners in BPM, embracing an interdisciplinary approach with tracks in Foundations, Engineering, and Management.","# BPM 2025: Call for Research Papers

The International Conference on Business Process Management (BPM) is the premier forum for researchers and practitioners in the field of Business Process Management (BPM).

BPM 2025 will be held in Seville, Spain, from **August 31 to September 5, 2025**.

## Conference Tracks

The BPM conference is structured into three tracks:

### Track I: Foundations

This track invites papers that have a **foundational, formal, mathematical, algorithmic, or conceptual nature**. It focuses on:

*   Investigating the underlying principles of BPM, computational theories, formal methods, and algorithms for modeling, automating, analyzing, and optimizing business processes.
*   Identifying novel problems, novel modeling languages, architectures, and other concepts underlying process-aware information systems.
*   Conceptual papers on frameworks, taxonomies, and patterns that investigate problems in the design of BPM systems.

Empirical evaluation is not mandatory, but technical quality standards and the degree to which foundations lay out new ways of modeling, analyzing, and improving BPM systems are key.

### Track II: Engineering

This track invites papers that deal with **engineering aspects of BPM research**, focusing on the development and investigation of artifacts and systems that aim to solve concrete problems in business environments. This includes:

*   Tools and techniques for process modeling, the enactment of process models, and process monitoring and analytics (including process mining techniques).
*   Usage of artifacts and systems in particular domains (e.g., digital health, smart mobility, logistics, smart government).
*   Aspects related to the interaction between processes and software infrastructure and services.

All papers in this track must include rigorous and reproducible empirical evaluations. Contributions based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques must provide adequate justification for adaptations to BPM contexts.

### Track III: Management

This track invites papers that focus on the **empirical, socio-technical, cognitive, psychological, managerial, and societal aspects of BPM**. This includes techniques, tools, and methods employed in organizations to better govern business processes. Research papers aim to advance the understanding of how process management (and mining) concepts deliver business value.

Areas of interest include strategic alignment, governance, methods, information technology, people, and culture, as long as they have a significant link to BPM. All levels of analysis (individual, team, organization, or ecosystem) are welcome.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Each paper must be submitted to exactly **one track**.
*   Papers must be formatted according to **Springer’s LNCS formatting guidelines**.
*   Submissions must be in English and **cannot exceed 16 pages** including references and appendices.
*   The title page must contain a short abstract clarifying the relation of the paper with the topics.
*   Submissions must be original contributions that have neither been published previously nor submitted to other conferences or journals.
*   Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF format via the [BPM 2025 EasyChair submission site](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bpm2025).

## Key Dates

*   **Paper Abstract submission:** March 4, 2025
*   **Paper submission:** March 18, 2025
*   **Notification to authors:** May 8, 2025
*   **Camera-ready submission:** June 13, 2025

All deadlines correspond to Anywhere on Earth (AoE or UTC-12).

## Awards

The conference will recognize outstanding contributions with a **Best Paper Award** and a **Best Student Paper Award**. Papers eligible for the Best Student Paper Award must be marked as such during submission and presented by a student author.

## BPM Forum

Papers that do not fully meet the quality criteria for the main conference but make a significant contribution to the community will be invited for presentation at the BPM Forum. These papers will be published in a separate post-proceedings volume (LNBIP series) and presented during the main conference.

## Open Science Principles

BPM encourages authors to follow principles of transparency, reproducibility, and replicability, supporting open data and open source principles. Authors are encouraged to disclose research artifacts and datasets, potentially earning an ""Artifacts Available"" badge.

## Double-Blind Review

BPM 2025 reviews are double blind. Authors must ensure that no identifying information is included in the submission, including meta-data. References to the authors' previous work should be in the third person, or blinded. Supplementary material and code must also be anonymized.",lần này lấy được ít ngày hơn lần trước

## Submission Guidelines

Submitted papers must have been neither previously accepted for publication nor concurrently submitted for review in another journal, book, conference, or workshop.

### Technical Track Paper Requirements

*   Technical research papers must not exceed **12 pages (including references)**.
*   All submissions must be in **English** and must come in **A4 paper size PDF format**.
*   Submissions must conform to the **IEEE Conference Proceedings Formatting Guidelines** (title in 24pt font and full text in 10pt font). LaTeX users must use `\documentclass[10pt,conference]{IEEEtran}` without including the `compsoc` or `compsocconf` option.
*   Papers must comply with the IEEE Policy on Authorship.
*   The Chairs reserve the right to reject submissions (without reviews) that are not in compliance or out of scope for the conference.

### Submission System

Papers must be submitted electronically in PDF before the due date via HotCRP: [https://apsec25.hotcrp.com](https://apsec25.hotcrp.com)

### Double-Blind Policy

The APSEC 2025 technical research track will use a **double-blind reviewing process**, which means that submissions must not reveal the authors’ identities. Authors must make every effort to honor this process by adhering to the following rules:

*   Omit authors’ names and institutions from your title page.
*   References to authors’ own related work must be in the third person. Example: *Not* “We build on our previous work…” but rather “We build on the work of…”.
*   If the current submission is a clear follow-up to previous work, and reviewers might associate authorship, you may anonymize the reference. For example: “based on previous results [10]” where `[10]` is reported as “`[10] Anonymous Authors. Omitted for double blind reviewing.`”. Ensure the submission is self-contained.
*   Do not include acknowledgements of people, grants, organizations, etc., that would give away your identity. These can be added in the camera-ready version.
*   Aim to reduce the risk of accidental unblinding (e.g., identifiable project names should be changed for submission, e.g., `GoogleDeveloperHelper` becomes `DeveloperHelper`).
*   Avoid revealing institutional affiliations or where the work was performed. Generalize descriptions (e.g., “The study participants consist of 200 students in an introductory CS course.”). For industrial studies, refer to the organization as “Org” or “Company”.
*   While open science is encouraged (disclosing source code/datasets), avoid linking directly to code repositories or tool deployments that can reveal your identity. Use services like [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org) or [figshare.com](https://figshare.com) for anonymous archiving, or [archive.org](https://archive.org) for larger datasets. Link these archived and anonymized datasets within the paper itself.

> **Important Note:** Submissions that allow the author to be identified may be returned for editing at short notice or may be rejected outright.

### Preprint Policy

To ensure a fair and unbiased double-blind review process, authors submitting papers must comply with guidelines regarding non-anonymized versions. A non-anonymized version is any publicly available document (e.g., on arXiv) with essentially the same scientific content as the submitted paper, even if it differs in minor ways such as the title, paper structure or organization, length or formatting.

#### Preprints Posted Before the Anonymity Period

Authors are permitted to make a non-anonymized version publicly available *before* the anonymity period. The anonymity period starts **one month before the submission deadline** and ends when the paper is accepted, rejected, or withdrawn. However, authors are responsible for minimizing the risk of trivial linking between the submitted paper and a public version. Specifically, authors must:

*   Prevent the submitted manuscript from being associated with the non-anonymized version.
*   Not make the non-anonymized version easily discoverable via search engines by reusing distinctive phrases (e.g., title, keywords).
*   Not update the non-anonymized version during the anonymity period.
*   Not actively promote the non-anonymized version (e.g., via social media, blogs, or mailing lists).
*   Not reference, cite, or link to any non-anonymized version within the submitted manuscript.

#### Post-Publication Preprint Policy According to IEEE Guidelines

Upon acceptance and publication by IEEE, authors *must* update any publicly available non-anonymized version of the paper by:

1.  Replacing it with the full IEEE citation, including the Digital Object Identifier (DOI), **OR**
2.  Posting the accepted version of the paper (i.e., the author’s final version prior to IEEE formatting), along with the DOI. The IEEE-published version must **not** be posted.

IEEE will provide each author with a preprint version including the DOI and IEEE copyright notice. Authors may post this preprint version in accordance with IEEE’s posting guidelines.

*   **Programming tools**, including refactoring editors, checkers, verifiers, compilers, debuggers, and profilers.
*   **Techniques**, ranging from programming languages to micro-architectural support, for specific domains such as secure, parallel, distributed, embedded or mobile environments.
*   **Design and implementation of novel language constructs**, programming models, and domain-specific languages.
*   **Implications to compiler construction from emerging or non-conventional applications** (e.g., deep learning, quantum computing, DNA computing, etc.).

## Submission Guidelines

All submissions must be made electronically through the conference submission website: [https://cc25.hotcrp.com](https://cc25.hotcrp.com).

1.  **Abstract:** Submissions must include an abstract (100–400 words), author contact information, the full list of authors and their affiliations.
2.  **Format:** Full paper submissions must be in PDF formatted printable on US letter size paper.
    *   Papers must be prepared in **ACM Conference Format** using the 2-column `acmart` format.
    *   For LaTeX, use the options `\documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart}`.
    *   For Word, use `interim-layout.docx`. *Important note:* The Word template on the ACM website uses 9pt font; you need to increase it to **10pt**.
3.  **Page Limit:** Papers should contain a maximum of **10 pages** of text or figures, *NOT INCLUDING references*.
4.  **References:** There is no page limit for references, and they must include the name of all authors (do not use `et al.`).
5.  **Supplementary Material:** Appendices are not allowed. Authors may submit anonymous supplementary material, such as proofs, source code, or data sets; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.
6.  **Resubmission:** Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed.
7.  **Rejection Criteria:** Papers that exceed the length requirement, deviate from the expected format, or are submitted late will be rejected.

> Prospective authors should be aware of [ACM’s Copyright Policies](https://authors.acm.org/main.html), adhere to [SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/), and to [ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-detection).

> By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including [ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

> Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an [ORCID ID](https://orcid.org/), as this will be a requirement for the publishing process.

## Double-Blind Reviewing Process

CC uses a double-blind reviewing process. Authors will need to identify any potential conflicts of interest with the Program Committee (PC), as defined in the SIGPLAN policy.

To facilitate the double-blind reviewing process, submissions (including supplementary material) should **not reveal the identity of the authors in any way**.

*   Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission.
*   Any references to authors’ own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”).
*   Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized.

## Artifact Evaluation (AE)

Authors of accepted CC 2025 papers are invited to formally submit their supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation (AE) process. This submission is voluntary and does not influence the final decision regarding paper/poster acceptance. The AE process begins after the acceptance notification and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers.

To ease the organization of the AE committee, authors are kindly asked to indicate their interest in submitting an artifact at the time of paper submission.

*   **Single-Blind:** The artifact evaluation process is single-blinded. Authors are requested to disable any form of analytics, tracking, and logging on sites and services used to share the artifact with reviewers.
*   **Communication:** During the process, authors and evaluators are allowed to anonymously communicate with each other through Hotcrp to overcome technical difficulties. Authors should be available to resolve clarifications within **24 hours**.
*   **Public Availability:** Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.

### Badge Types

CC follows ACM’s artifact reviewing and badging policy. The AE committee will award two types of badges:

*   **Red badge (Artifact Usable):** Awarded based on the usability and robustness of the artifact. The **Light-red badge** is for functional artifacts, while the **Dark-red badge** is granted when the artifact far exceeds usability expectations. For red badges, your artifact must be: Documented, Consistent, Complete, and Exercisable.
*   **Blue badge (Results Replicated):** Awarded if the main paper results can be reproduced with the authors' provided artifact. If applying for this badge, include scripts to execute, gather, and plot the main results, and the README must include a statement describing the criteria for deeming results similar enough.
*   **Green Artifact Available Badge:** This badge is awarded if the artifact is publicly available. This badge is awarded directly by the publisher if authors provide a link to the deposited artifact.

### Artifact Submission Guidelines

**Components of the Artifact:**

1.  The submission version of your paper/poster.
2.  A `README` file (PDF or plaintext format) that explains your artifact.
3.  The artifact itself, packaged as a single archive file (ZIP, TGZ, TBZ2). For artifacts larger than 600MB, provide a URL pointing to the artifact, ensuring reviewer anonymity.

**General Guidelines:**

*   **Simplify Installation:** Provide a “push-button approach” (virtual machine or Docker image) or scripts that automate dependency installation, compilation, and build commands. Admin or superuser privileges should not be necessary.
*   **Include Data:** Try to include all datasets and benchmarks used.
*   **Specialized Hardware:** If experimental test-bed requires specialized hardware, consider providing open access to a non-tracked testbed.

**Artifact Documentation Guidelines (in `README`):
**

*   **Brief description:** One or two paragraphs describing the artifact, its type, and overall behavior (inputs and outputs).
*   **Hardware requisites:** Specify compute cores, memory (DRAM), GPU(s), FPGAs, etc.
*   **Software pre-requisites:** Operating system and version (e.g., Ubuntu Linux LTS 2020); compiler and runtime versions (e.g., GCC 8.1, OpenMP 5.1, CUDA 9.0). Do not assume tools like CMake or Python are installed.
*   **Expectations:** Approximate time to install, run/use the artifact, and reproduce results.

> **NOTE:** The AE will not invest substantial time or effort on debugging the installation and use process. The information provided will be for internal use.

## Call for Tool and Practical Experience Papers

This year, CC will offer a second category of papers called “Tools and Practical Experience”.

*   Papers in this category must either give a clear account of a tool’s functionality or summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies.
*   The successful evaluation of an artifact is **mandatory for a Tool Paper**.
*   Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.
*   These papers abide by the same limit of **10 pages** in the ACM format, references excluded, and are not distinguished in the final proceedings. Shorter submissions accounting for scientific ideas in practice are encouraged.

**Selection Criteria:**

*   **Originality:** Present CC-related technologies applied to real-world problems with unique scope or characteristics.
*   **Usability:** Broad usage or applicability, assisting CC-related research or extensible to new technologies. Significant unimplemented components will result in rejection.
*   **Documentation:** Tool or compiler must be presented on a website with documentation.
*   **Benchmark Repository:** A suite of benchmarks for testing should be provided.
*   **Availability:** The tool or compiler should be available for public use.
*   **Foundations:** Incorporate Compiler Construction principles; thorough discussion of theoretical foundations is not required, a summary suffices.
*   **Artifact Evaluation:** The submitted artifact must be functional and support paper claims. Mandatory for tool papers.

The 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy. CCS has two review cycles in 2025.

## Review Cycles and Decisions

For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:

*   **Accept:** Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference, possibly after making minor changes with the oversight of a shepherd.
*   **Minor revision:** Papers in this category are considered promising but need some minor additional work. Authors will be given the opportunity to resubmit such papers, with appropriate revisions. The revised paper will then be re-evaluated.
*   **Reject:** Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Papers rejected from the first review cycle may not be submitted again to the second review cycle.

Authors of each accepted paper must ensure that at least one author registers for the conference, and that their paper is presented in-person at the conference if at all possible.

## Paper Submission Information

*   All submissions must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the corresponding deadline.
*   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings.
*   All submissions should be properly anonymized. Papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   Authors may submit up to a maximum of 7 papers for Cycle B.
*   Submitted papers will be evaluated based on their merits, particularly their importance to practical aspects of computer and communications security and privacy, novelty, quality of execution, and presentation.
*   For papers that might raise ethical concerns, authors are expected to convince reviewers that proper procedures (such as IRB approval or responsible disclosure) have been followed.
*   No modifications to the author list on a paper may be made after submission.

## Mandatory Reviewing

Authors submitting 3 papers or more may be required to submit reviews for other papers at CCS 2025. Failure to provide requested information may result in desk rejection.

## Withdrawing Policy

A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent, the paper cannot be withdrawn.

## Paper Format

*   Submissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format using ""sigconf"" 2-column format.
*   Maximum length: 12 pages, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material.
*   Reviewers are not required to read the appendices or any supplementary material.
*   Authors should not change the font or the margins of the ACM format.
*   Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.

## Providing Artifacts at Submission Time

Submissions whose claimed contributions rely on artifacts (e.g., code, models, data sets) are expected to make these accessible to the reviewers, unless there are good reasons not to.

## Optional Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to submit artifacts for an optional Artifact Evaluation (AE) process.

## Conference Tracks

CCS features a multi-track format. Authors must select one track at the time of submission.

## Paper Submissions

Authors are invited to submit original, full-length research papers that are not previously published, accepted to be published, or being considered for publication in any other forum. Full-length papers should satisfy the standard requirements of top-tier international research conferences.

*   **Format:** Manuscripts should be submitted to CIKM 2025 Easychair site in PDF format, using the [2-column ACM sigconf template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
*   **Page Limit:** Full papers cannot exceed **9 pages**, including an appendix, plus unlimited pages for the GenAI Usage Disclosure section and references.
*   **Anonymity:** The review of manuscripts will be double-blind. Submissions not properly anonymized will be desk-rejected without review.
*   **Usage of Generative AI:**
    *   Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, are prohibited unless this produced text is presented as part of the paper’s experimental analysis.
    *   AI tools may be used to edit and polish authors’ work (e.g., grammar checks, word autocorrect), but text “produced entirely” by generative/AI models is not allowed.
    *   A “GenAI Usage Disclosure” section must be included at the end of the main contents and appendix, right before the references. This section, together with the references, will not be counted toward the page limit.
    *   Authors must provide full disclosure of all use of GenAI tools in all stages of the research (including the code and data).
    *   All submissions must comply with the ACM policy on the usage of GenAI.

> Please check our attendance policy in case of severe travel restrictions.

> At least one author of each accepted paper must register to present the work on-site in Seoul, Korea as scheduled in the conference program.

> The official publication date is when the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## Dual Submission Policy

Submitting papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences is not allowed. However, it is allowed to make an abstract submission by May 16, 2025 (without uploading the paper PDF) for a paper that is still under review as long as the ongoing review process ends by the full paper final deadline of May 23, 2025. You need to withdraw your submission in case the paper is accepted or still under review by May 23, 2025.

Authors are allowed to submit papers that have been presented or are to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Authors may also submit anonymized work already available as a preprint (e.g., in arXiv). In this case, the authors must modify the title and abstract while refraining from citing the manuscript to preserve anonymity.

## Authorship Policy

Before paper submission, authors are advised to review [ACM’s authorship policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) carefully. The full list of author names, including the ordering, must be finalized by the paper submission deadline.

## Conflict of Interest Policy

All authors must adhere to the ACM Conflict of Interest policy. For full details, please visit this site: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest).

## Desk Rejection Policy

Submissions that fail to adhere to the anonymity, length, or formatting requirements, or violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty—such as plagiarism, author misrepresentation, or falsification—may be subject to desk rejection by the chairs.

## ACM Policy Against Harassment

All authors and participants must adhere to the ACM Policy Against Harassment. For full details, please visit this site: [https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment).
