The 2025 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2025) is soliciting full-length submissions covering new work on all memory management related topics in both software and hardware.

ISMM 2025 encourages submissions and participation from related fields such as computer architecture and computer systems in addition to our core PL community! ISMM 2025 will be colocated with [PLDI 2025](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/).

## Submission Types:

In addition to regular papers, traditionally submitted to ISMM, we also invite submissions of the following kinds:

*   Surveys and comparative analyses that shed new light on previously published techniques.
*   Practitioner reports, describing experience with memory management in production. Such papers are not expected to provide novel research contributions, but they should not have been previously published.
*   Intellectual abstracts, where researchers share designs, algorithms, or theory that may be interesting to the memory management community, but not yet evaluated.

Please indicate whether the paper is a regular paper, a survey, a practitioner report, or an intellectual abstract, by using a subtitle.

## Areas of Interest:

Areas of interest include but are not limited to (in no particular order):

*   Garbage collection algorithms and implementations
*   Memory allocation and de-allocation
*   Memory system design and analysis (both software and hardware)
*   Hardware support for memory management
*   Memory management for large-scale data-intensive systems
*   Memory management at datacenter and cloud scales
*   Formal analysis and verification of memory management algorithms
*   Compiler analyses to aid memory management
*   Tools to analyze memory usage and characteristics of programs
*   Empirical analysis of memory intensive programs
*   Formal analysis and verification of memory intensive programs
*   Memory management for machine learning systems
*   Programming and management of emerging or persistent memories
*   Caches, memory controllers, memory hierarchies and their management
*   Cache coherence and memory consistency
*   Processing in memory (including processing near and using memory)
*   Memory technology and architecture (SRAM, DRAM, flash, NVM, emerging technologies)
*   Security and privacy of memory systems
*   Robustness of memory systems
*   Low-latency and low-energy memory systems

The symposium welcomes industry practitioners presenting their recent practice and findings in memory management related to real-world deployments.

## Formatting Instructions:

All papers must be submitted on-line in Portable Document Format (PDF).

Papers should be formatted according to the two-column ACM proceedings format. Each paper should have no more than 12 pages, excluding bibliography, in 10pt font. There is no limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al). The citations should be in numeric style, e.g., [52]. Submissions should be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper. These requirements are all the same as in the previous years.

Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected.

Make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale.

Appendices should not be part of the paper, but should be submitted as supplementary material. Supplementary material should also be anonymized, as described below.

As explained in more detail at [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author) , authors should use the sigplan subformat of the acmart format. Please note the following: The first two lines should be:

```
\documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart}
\settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}
```

The default citation style is numeric.

Do not mess with the class file or settings to try to sneak in additional space. (Conversely, you may toggle the printccs and printacmref flags if you wish, but these changes will consume space.)

Do not use the PACMPL files or format; ISMM is not using them. However, the template files were designed to make migrating a paper from one format to the other as simple as possible.

## Double-Blind Reviewing:

ISMM uses double-blind reviewing. This means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. These are firm submission requirements. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized.

An earlier FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs – [https://pldi23.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2023-pldi#FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2023-pldi#FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing) . If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, or any cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ, please contact the Program Chairs. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Program Chairs than to risk summary rejection.

## Declaring Conflicts:

When submitting the paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).

Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.

## Publication Date:

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)

## Author Response:

The author response process will occur in April 2025, and will give the authors an opportunity to respond to factual errors in reviews before the Program Committee meets to make its decisions. The committee may, but need not, respond to the author response or revise reviews at or after the committee meeting.

## Important Dates (AoE (UTC-12h)):

*   **Conference day:** Tue 17 Jun 2025
*   **Camera-ready papers due:** Thu 15 May 2025
*   **Author notification:** Sat 3 May 2025

## Review Process

The review process will have two cycles.

### Review Cycle I (Submission to Initial notification)

Submissions will be assigned to two members of the VR 2026 International Program Committee (IPC): a coordinator (primary) and a secondary reviewer. Submissions that violate the submission guidelines or that receive low review scores from the coordinator and the secondary reviewer will be early rejected. This stage of the review process will be double-blind. We will strive to have all other submissions receive a total of at least three reviews. Based on the reviews and in consultation with a subset of the IPC, the Program Chairs will make one of the following initial recommendations for each submission:

*   Conditionally accept as IEEE TVCG paper
*   Conditionally accept as conference paper
*   Recommend as a two-page poster
*   Reject

### Review Cycle II (Initial notification to Final decision)

The revision of each conditionally accepted paper will be reviewed by its coordinator, who will make a final recommendation regarding acceptance. Should the conditions for acceptance not be met, the paper will be rejected.

## Additional Guidelines

### Abstract Submission

Note that a paper abstract must be uploaded seven days prior to the actual paper submission deadline. This facilitates the process of assigning reviewers, as the review process operates on a very tight schedule.

### Ethics and Responsibility

All submissions describing research experiments with human participants must follow the appropriate ethical guidelines required by the authors’ institution(s), and authors are required to secure and report their approval by the relevant ethics committee prior to collecting data.

### Participant Diversity

To support high-quality research, all submissions describing research with human participants should strive for participant diversity. As first steps toward this goal, VR 2026 is encouraging the following:

*   Research that aims to benefit a general population should be representative of that population.
*   Research that claims to benefit a specific population should clearly state and justify its focus on that population (e.g., pilots, surgeons).
*   All submissions must report participant demographics (gender, age, etc.).

### Review Duties for Authors

For each submitted paper, one author will be required to register to review up to three papers through PCS at the time of submission.

### Presentation at the Conference

All accepted submissions must be presented orally at the conference. An in-person presentation is expected, and online presentations will be accommodated only in exceptional cases.

### Submission Language

All paper submissions must be in English.

### Previous Publication and Plagiarism

Submitted manuscripts must not have been previously published.

Submissions will be checked for plagiarism using IEEE Crosscheck. Detection of significant plagiarism will lead to rejection.

### AI-generated Text

In accordance with IEEE guidelines, the use of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) in an article (including but not limited to text, figures, images, and code) shall be disclosed in the acknowledgments section.

### Submission Anonymity

IEEE VR uses a **DOUBLE-BLIND** review process. This means that both the authors and the reviewers must remain anonymous to each other. Failure to adhere to the double-blind policy will result in desk rejection.

### Pre-dissemination through public online repositories

Uploading the submitted manuscript to an online repository (e.g., arXiv) before the end of the review process does not constitute a reason for rejecting the manuscript. However, the authors should be advised that doing so can compromise the anonymity of their manuscript and therefore bias its double-blind review.

### Videos

Videos must be submitted according to the instructions on the submission website.

## Submission Information

Submissions should not exceed **17 pages**, excluding bibliography, in the Springer LNCS format. The LaTeX template is available at [Springer’s Information for Authors](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). The accepted papers will be allowed one extra page to accommodate reviewers’ feedback.

Additional material intended for reviewers but not for publication in the final version -– for example, details of proofs -– may be placed in a clearly marked appendix that is not included in the page limit. However, the paper must be understandable without the appendix. Reviewers are not obligated to review it.

Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers must be written in English. Accepted papers must be presented at the conference. For further details, please consult [Springer Nature Code of Conduct for Authors](https://www.springernature.com/gp/authors/book-authors-code-of-conduct).

Papers should be submitted via HotCRP: [https://aplas25.hotcrp.com/](https://aplas25.hotcrp.com/)

## Reviewing process

APLAS uses a light double-blind reviewing process, with a rebuttal phase, to address factual errors and minor misunderstandings. Reviewers will not see author names until they submit a review. Therefore, the authors must adhere to the following rules:

*   omit your names and institutions;
*   refer to your prior work in the third person, just as you refer to prior work by others;
*   omit the acknowledgments.

This process aims to help the reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their papers as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. For more details, see the FAQ (on the OOPSLA submission site): [https://2025.splashcon.org/track/OOPSLA#faq](https://2025.splashcon.org/track/OOPSLA#faq).

The proceedings will be published as a volume in Springer’s LNCS series. Previous APLAS proceedings [https://link.springer.com/conference/aplas](https://link.springer.com/conference/aplas) can be found on SpringerLink. Authors interested in making their contributions Open Access, please refer to Springer’s webpage [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/open-access-publishing-in-computer-proceedings](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/open-access-publishing-in-computer-proceedings) for additional information, or contact the organizers.

## Best Paper Award

APLAS continues the tradition of the best paper award. The award will be announced on this website, and printed certificates will be issued to the authors at the conference.

## Papers

Papers are the main medium for conveying new research results at UIST and must describe original, unpublished work. For questions, please email the program chairs at [program2025@uist.org](mailto:program2025@uist.org).

### Submission Information

*   **Submission Platform:** All required materials must be submitted electronically to PCS.
*   **Submission Format and Length:**
    *   Required Paper PDF and source files
    *   We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow.
    *   For LaTeX authors, submissions are strongly recommended to be in the double-column format ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) using \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}. (please use the downloadable LaTex template or the Overleaf template ).
    *   For Word authors, submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) or the single-column template ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.pdf) ).
    *   UIST papers are of variable length.
    *   **Short Papers** submissions of 5,000 words or less.
    *   **Standard Length Papers** submissions between 5,000 and 12,000 words.
    *   References and appendices are excluded from the word count.
    *   Size: < 20 MB (compressed PDF files are encouraged during submission)
*   **Accompanying Video:**
    *   Optional, but highly encouraged
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   No more than 5 minutes long
    *   Size: < 250 MB
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
*   **Anonymity:** Anonymous, i.e. authors must remove their names and affiliations throughout all submission materials (paper, videos, supplementary material) ( [anonymity policy](https://uist.acm.org/2025/author-guide/#anonymity) )
*   **Selection Process:** Refereed, i.e. the program committee and two external reviewers will review submitted papers
*   **Publication:** Archival, i.e. accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library and distributed in digital form to conference attendees
*   **Quick rejection / Desk rejection policy:** Papers, where the length is incommensurate with contribution or the stated length of the submission (i.e., short paper vs. standard length papers), will be desk rejected. Submissions of more than 5,000 words for short papers or 12,000 words for standard papers will be desk rejected if their length is not justified. In very exceptional cases, such submissions may be considered for full review, but authors must provide clear and strong justification for why submissions are required to be longer than the word limit.
*   **Anonymization Policy:** Authors are expected to anonymize their identities in the body of the paper but leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. Authors are required to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], …” and use instead “As described by Chetty et al. [10], …”. Papers that violate the anonymization policy by explicitly and unequivocally identifying the authors (i.e., beyond allowing the reviewers to simply ""guess""), including within the supplemental materials or external links to datasets, code repositories, etc., will be desk rejected. Any supplementary material (including the video) should also adhere to the anonymity rule.
*   Your submission must be original; it cannot be published or under concurrent review elsewhere. If you have any concurrent submissions to UIST or other venues that are closely related – i.e., are based on the same study, artifact, or dataset – you must include an anonymized version of that submission to the concurrent submissions field. Failure to do so will result in desk rejection. Please see [ACM guide on prior and simultaneous submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions) .
*   Research Quality and Lack of Relevant Context: Papers must include sufficient detail for reviewers to evaluate research quality according to the norms and expectations of the UIST community. Papers should demonstrate clear connections to existing research literature in HCI and related fields, showing how the work builds upon or relates to prior work. Papers that lack adequate methodological details for proper evaluation, or that fail to engage with relevant prior research, may be desk rejected.
*   Your paper must be stand alone. Authors are encouraged to provide supplementary materials to support practices around research reproducibility as much as possible, however all important information to understand the contributions of your work must be in the main paper PDF. Heavy reliance on appendices and/or supplementary materials can be a ground for rejection including desk rejection.
*   Please ensure that you use the correct template and correct formatting of references. We strongly recommend submitting papers in the 2-column format, but will accept papers for review in either 1- or 2-column paper format if you are authoring in Word. Use of other templates or formats, including different citation styles, may result in desk rejection.
*   **Final Publication Format:**
    *   For LaTeX authors, your source files will be used to auto-generate (1) a double-column PDF ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ), and (2) an accessible and responsive webpage (example HTML ) that will be placed in the Digital Library.
    *   For Word authors, you will need to submit your paper in single-column format to correctly auto-generate (1) a double-column PDF ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ), and (2) an accessible and responsive webpage (example HTML ) in the Digital Library.
*   **Presentation Format:** Talk at the conference delivered by one or more authors of the paper
*   **Video Preview:**
    *   Video previews are mandatory.
    *   Recommended resolution: 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   Length: 30 seconds
    *   Size: < 150 MB
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
    *   Please see the [video guide](https://uist.acm.org/2025/video-guide) for more information on producing a video preview.
    *   We strongly recommend that authors make their videos accessible through following the guidelines under [Making Video Figures Accessible](https://uist.acm.org/2025/accessibility) .
*   **Demo Fast Track:** Authors of accepted papers will be invited to participate in the UIST demo session. Details about this special/fast track of demos will be found on the demo page.
    *   Please note that a DOI will not be provided for invited demo papers. Authors interested in having a DOI for their demo paper should consider submitting to the regular demo track.
*   **Additional Notes:**
    *   Accessibility: Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. To this end, we allow 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline to provide alt-text for all figures and tables and upload video subtitles to make your optional video accessible. Allowing additional time for your paper and video submissions to be accessible will help increase the quality of the conference overall and enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. If the authors have difficulties with making their submission materials accessible, they are encouraged to contact the UIST 2025 Accessibility Chairs by emailing [accessibility2025@uist.org](mailto:accessibility2025@uist.org) and volunteers with questions or for assistance to ensure that all accessible materials are submitted by the deadline. We strongly recommend that authors read the [SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission](https://sigchi.org/conferences/author-resources/accessibility-guide/) which describes the process to make a paper submission accessible, as well as the [SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/videos/), which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning.
    *   The author list must be complete by the abstract submission deadline. Late author changes (i.e., additions or changes of order) require approval from program chairs and may be declined or might require paper withdrawal. Ensure all authors are listed in the correct order by the abstract deadline.
    *   We will continue to put the papers up publicly on the ACM DL a week in advance of the conference.
    *   Authors may submit a rebuttal after the reviews are released. Though the ACs may indicate if the rebuttal is likely to help the paper being accepted (based on reviews and internal discussions), any author may choose to respond. A rebuttal response by Associate Chairs and external reviewers will be enforced by the Program Chairs as much as possible.
    *   The video has traditionally been due the same day as paper submissions and this has always been stressful. We will allow for 2 more grace days after the paper submission deadline for uploading your optional video.
    *   Open source: Our community welcomes open source and encourages the practice of creating software/hardware and sharing it through open-source and public repositories. However, open source is not a requirement or prerequisite for acceptance. Open source, as well as many other types of artifacts (e.g., videos, datasets, raw data, appendices), is recommended but completely optional, and will not be used for evaluation criteria. The paper should be evaluated on its own merits, not depending on supporting artifacts that are not submitted by the authors.

## Posters

Posters provide an interactive forum in which authors can present their work to conference attendees during special poster sessions.

### Submission Information

*   **Submission Platform:** All materials must be submitted electronically to PCS before the submission deadline.
*   **Submission Format and Length:** The extended abstract should not exceed 2 pages (excluding references).
*   **We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow.**
*   For LaTeX authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format ([example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/UIST2025_Poster_Example.pdf)) using \documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}
*   For Word authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ).
*   **Accompanying Poster:** Recommended physical size is equal to or less than 841 mm x 1189 mm (A0 size) in either portrait or landscape
*   **Accompanying Video:**
    *   Optional, but highly encouraged
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   No more than 5 minutes long
    *   Size: < 250 MB
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
*   **Maximum File Size:** Maximum total size for all files < 300 MB
*   **Anonymity:** IMPORTANT: Anonymous, i.e. authors must remove their names and affiliations throughout all submission materials (paper, videos, supplementary material) ( [anonymity policy](https://uist.acm.org/2025/author-guide/#anonymity) )
*   **Selection Process:** Reviewed
    *   Less rigorous than a paper review and does not include an author’s rebuttal. Authors may expect to receive only light feedback
    *   The submitted content is generally not required to make the same level of lasting and significant contribution as refereed content
*   **Publication:** Semi-archival, i.e., authors may re-use and re-submit the content to other peer-reviewed venues (e.g., could be reused in a future UIST full paper submission).
    *   The 2-page extended abstracts will be included in the ACM Digital Library as adjunct proceedings and distributed digitally to conference attendees. The poster design will not be included in the ACM Digital Library
*   **Presentation Format:** At least one author is requested to register and stand by their poster during the poster session to speak with conference attendees
*   **Concurrent UIST Demo Submission:** The same work cannot be submitted to both the UIST Demo and Posters tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as demo submissions and will be rejected from the Posters track
*   **Novelty of Work:** Resubmission of posters previously shown at other venues is allowed
*   Please state previous poster venues and differences from previous posters in the appropriate box in PCS
*   **Online Presentation:** UIST '25 will be held in person only. It is recommended that authors consider this before submitting their work. However, accepted submissions will not be rejected if none of the authors can travel due to unavoidable issues (e.g., visa problems). Recording options may be considered for these cases, but we anticipate them being rare.
*   In-person registration is required. We do not plan to offer any virtual or online registration options. Even if no authors can attend in person, at least one author of each accepted poster must register at the in-person attendance rate. Failure to register will result in withdrawal from the accepted posters program.
*   Authors must contact the Posters Chairs [posters2025@uist.org](mailto:posters2025@uist.org) and the Program Chairs [program2025@uist.org](mailto:program2025@uist.org) as soon as physical attendance becomes difficult.

## Demos

Demos are one of the highlights of the UIST conference. Accepted authors show implementations of novel and compelling interaction concepts, techniques, devices, and systems. We particularly encourage highly interactive demos— from novel web systems and prototype devices, to new materials, fabrication methods, XR, and large interactive installations.

### Submission Information

*   **Submission Platform:** All materials must be submitted electronically to PCS before the submission deadline.
*   **Submission Format and Length:**
    *   Demo Abstract
    *   We will adopt the ACM TAPS Workflow.
    *   For LaTeX authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format ( [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/latex-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) using \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}.
    *   For Word authors, submissions should be made using either the double-column format ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-two-column-submission-sample.pdf) ) or the single-column template ( [submission template](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.docx) , [example PDF](https://uist.acm.org/2025/assets/files/word-one-column-submission-sample.pdf) ).
    *   We do not have a strong page limit, but we recommend that authors prepare a manuscript of ~1,500-2,000 words to equate to the double column 2-page length, often 4-5 pages in the single column (plus references). Submissions could be both single-column or double-column format in PDF. We strongly encourage to use the double-column format.
*   **Floor Plan:** The demo submission should include a PDF document describing the envisioned setup and interaction (demo hardware components, tables, chairs, lights, and other equipment) so that organizers get a good understanding of your setup. This will also allow the organizers to better consider your requirements when organizing the demonstration space at the venue. [Recommended submission template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rf91u5ioLQ0npQAIIkaOmwiP5J-fZjz61M19ezs5uSI/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.h223k5sfeu1w)
*   **Demo Video:**
    *   This video should be a standalone demonstration of the work
    *   It shows the working demo in appropriate detail
    *   It will be published ahead of time (~2 weeks before the conference) on the conference website
    *   Length: up to 5 min
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
*   **Preview Video:**
    *   Video previews are mandatory (7 days grace period after camera-ready deadline)
    *   Resolution of 1080p (1920 x 1080) or 4k (3840 x 2160 px), encoded as MP4 using the H.264 codec
    *   Size: < 150 MB
    *   Length: 30 seconds
    *   Subtitles are required using a separate .srt or .sbv file
*   **Anonymity:** Demo submissions are not anonymous. Author names and institutions will be visible to the reviewing committee throughout the submission process.
*   **Selection Process:** Demos are juried by the UIST demo chairs, and there is no rebuttal phase. Due to the nature of the juried process, authors will not receive review feedback and will only be informed about the decision.
*   **Publication:** Non-archival, ideas presented as a UIST demo can be resubmitted as an extended full paper in subsequent years. Authors may choose whether demo abstracts will be included in the ACM Digital Library as Adjunct Proceedings and distributed in digital form to conference attendees. Demos that accompany a UIST paper submitted as a fast-track submission will not be included in the ACM Digital Library as Adjunct Proceedings.
*   **Presentation Format:** At least one author is required to be physically present at the conference and present their demo during demo sessions
*   **Lab Demos:** If the authors have multiple demo submissions from the same lab/company, we can group these demos together at the venue. Please indicate the submission IDs of all demos from the same lab on the PCS submission page.
*   **Concurrent UIST Poster Submission:** The same work cannot be submitted to both the UIST demo and poster tracks. Double submissions will only be considered as a demo submission and will be rejected from the poster track
*   **Novelty of Work:** Resubmission of demos previously shown at other venues is allowed
*   **Demos of Accepted UIST 2025 Papers:**
    *   Authors of accepted full papers who also want to present a demo must submit an entry into the demos track. They have two choices:
    *   Demos that accompany accepted papers will follow a fast-track process with an abbreviated submission. Although no demo abstract is required, authors are still required to submit a video preview and other relevant data (e.g., title, abstract, floorplan). Demos accompanying full papers will not receive a separate DOI. Note that unlike in previous years, there will be no option for a fast-track submission with a DOI. Authors who wish to have their demo abstract published with a DOI in the proceedings are welcome to submit a full demo submission by the demo track deadline.
*   **Changes in author list and affiliations:**
    *   Please make sure that all authors and their affiliation are correct before submitting in PCS
    *   It is not possible to add or remove any author from a demo abstract after submission
    *   It is not possible to change the affiliation of any author after the submission
