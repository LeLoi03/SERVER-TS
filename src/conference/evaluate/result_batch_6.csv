## How to Submit

Don't forget to read [our policy on the use of AI tools by authors](aipolicy.php).

[Submit a paper](papersubmission.php)

Original research papers are welcomed on any cryptographic topic, including but not limited to:

*   foundational theory and mathematics
*   the design, proposal, and analysis of cryptographic primitives and protocols
*   secure implementation and optimization in hardware or software
*   applied aspects of cryptography

Please note more generally that a topic for any IACR area conference is a topic for Eurocrypt. Program committee members are no longer allowed to issue reviews such as ""This topic is more suitable for [area conference]"".

## Important Dates

*   **2 Oct 2025:** Submission deadline at 23:59 AoE (anywhere on Earth)
*   **6 Dec 2025:** Affiliated events submission deadline at 23:59 AoE (anywhere on Earth)

## Schedule

Eurocrypt 2026 will operate a two-round review system with a rebuttal phase. Before the first round, submissions that do not abide by the rules set out on the [paper submission page](papersubmission.php) (anonymity, formatting, etc) will be desk-rejected, without consideration of their merits. In the first round, the program committee selects the submissions that will proceed to the second round, and the authors receive the first round notification. The authors of the selected submissions are invited to submit a text-based rebuttal letter to respond to the reviews. Furthermore, in cases where this is considered useful by the PC chairs and/or the reviewers, additional communication between authors and reviewers may be initiated (in both rounds).

The submissions that have not been selected during the first round of reviews (early rejects) may be submitted to other conferences after the first round notification date.

In the second round, the program committee further reviews the selected submissions by taking into account the rebuttal letters. The committee then makes the final decision of acceptance or rejection.

## Early Withdrawal

Until final decisions have been made, authors can only withdraw their paper with the express approval of the program chairs.

## PC Member Submissions

Program committee members and area chairs are restricted to submit either 1 single-author paper, up to 2 papers if at least one of them is with a co-author, or up to 3 papers if all are with co-authors and at least two are with student co-authors. The program committee co-chairs are not allowed to submit any papers.

## Awards

The program committee may choose one or more papers to receive an overall Best Paper Award. In a continuing effort to promote independent work by researchers at early stages of their careers, the program committee may also award a prize for the best paper(s) authored exclusively by early-career researchers. As usual, awards will only be given if deserving papers are identified.

## Stipends

Students whose papers have been accepted and who present their talks at the conference will have their registration fees waived. Furthermore, a limited number of stipends are available to students that are unable to obtain funding to attend the conference. Students in underrepresented groups are especially encouraged to apply. Application instructions will be posted together with other registration information.

## Artifacts

To encourage open and reproducible research, authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts associated with their papers, such as software or datasets, for review. The artifact review will be a collaborative process between authors and the artifact review committee. The goal of the process is not just to evaluate artifacts, but also to improve them for reproduction and reusability by the scientific community. Artifacts that pass successfully through the artifact review process will be archived on IACR's artifact archive. Please see the detailed call for artifacts (available later).

The conference seeks papers on all aspects of computer systems.","# EuroSys 2026: Call for Papers

The European Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys) is a premier international forum for presenting computer systems research. EuroSys 2026 seeks papers in all areas of computer systems research, including:

*   Operating systems
*   Distributed systems
*   Cloud computing and datacenter systems
*   File and storage systems
*   Networked systems
*   Language support and runtime systems
*   Systems security and privacy
*   Dependable systems
*   Analysis, testing and veriﬁcation of systems
*   Database systems and data analytics frameworks
*   Virtualization and virtualized systems
*   Systems for machine learning/machine learning for systems
*   Mobile and pervasive systems
*   Parallelism, concurrency, and multicore systems
*   Real-time, embedded, and cyber-physical systems
*   Systems for emerging hardware

We encourage papers that span multiple topics and communities. Papers will be judged on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity.

Separately from the preceding criteria for evaluating research papers, we are also inviting industry researchers to submit well-written, informative Industrial Experience papers relating their experience deploying, evolving, and/or operating their systems. These papers will also be judged based on novelty, significance, correctness, and clarity, but vis-a-vis the lessons obtained from these deployments and how valuable they are likely to be for the systems research community. When submitting an Industrial Experience paper, please select the ""Deployment/industrial experience"" keyword among the paper topics.

Regardless of paper type, rigorous evaluation is a hallmark of a good systems paper. We strongly recommend reading Gernot Heiser's write-up on Systems Benchmarking Crimes and ensuring you avoid these ""crimes"" in your evaluation.

## Important Dates

## Two Deadlines

EuroSys 2026 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines. Any paper submitted to one of these deadlines and accepted during the associated reviewing period will be presented at the conference and will appear as part of the proceedings.

A paper submitted at the Spring deadline for EuroSys 2026 and rejected may not be submitted again until the Spring deadline for EuroSys 2027. A paper submitted at the Fall deadline for EuroSys 2026 and rejected may not be submitted again until the Fall deadline for EuroSys 2027.

## Revision

Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of a one-shot revision. If offered a revision option, authors can choose to revise and resubmit the paper for the subsequent EuroSys deadline.

Authors offered a revision option will be given a list of necessary conditions for the paper to be accepted.

A revision option is not a guarantee of acceptance. The revised and resubmitted paper will be re-evaluated by the PC.

## Resubmission and Concurrent Submissions

Authors submitting to EuroSys must adhere to ACM's policy on [Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions).

If a paper initially submitted to the Spring deadline of EuroSys 2026 is rejected after a revise-and-resubmit, it may not be submitted to EuroSys until the Fall deadline of EuroSys 2027. If a paper initially submitted to the Fall deadline of EuroSys 2026 is rejected after a revise-and-resubmit, it may not be submitted to EuroSys until the Spring deadline of EuroSys 2028.

## Submission Instructions

Spring Submission URL: [https://eurosys26-spring.hotcrp.com/](https://eurosys26-spring.hotcrp.com/)
Fall Submission URL: [https://eurosys26-fall.hotcrp.com/](https://eurosys26-fall.hotcrp.com/)

Anonymity: Reviewing is double-blind, meaning that the authors' identities will be hidden from the reviewers and vice versa. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions.

Authors are permitted to post drafts of their submission on e.g. arXiv or as technical reports on their institution's website. However, the submitted version should have a substantially different title, and a different system/tool name (if it uses one) from the draft version.

Authors are welcome to include links to code repositories in their papers. However, authors should ensure that following the link and exploring the repository does not reveal any information about the names of the authors or their affiliations.

Submissions violating the detailed formatting and anonymization rules will not be considered for review.

Industry authors are particularly encouraged to contact the PC chairs (pc-chairs-2026@eurosys.org) about anonymization, as in some cases, company names may be difficult or counter-productive to anonymize.

Generative AI: Please review the ACM Policy on Authorship ([https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship)), which contains information on the use of generative AI when preparing submissions.

Conflicts: When registering and submitting your paper, you will need to provide information about conflicts with PC members.

## Page limit and formatting

Submissions must have at most 12 pages of technical content, including all text, figures, tables, appendices, etc. Bibliographic references are not included in the 12-page limit. In addition, submissions may include as many additional pages as needed for supplementary material in a separate file, which can be uploaded separately on the submission site. The paper should stand alone without the supplementary material.

Use A4 or US letter paper size, with all text and figures fitting inside a 178 x 229 mm (7 x 9 in) block centered on the page, using two columns separated by ≥8 mm (0.33"") of whitespace. Use ≥10-point font (typeface Times Roman, Linux Libertine, etc.) on ≥12-point (single-spaced) leading for all text including figure and table captions. Graphs and figures should be readable when printed in grayscale, without magnification. All pages should be numbered.

Most of these rules are automatically applied when using the official SIGPLAN Latex (\documentclass[sigplan, … ]) or MS Word templates from [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions).

Papers that deviate significantly from the formatting instructions will be administratively rejected.

## Revision Submissions

If you are submitting a revised paper because you received a revise-and-resubmit decision from the previous deadline, you should already have received instructions by email on how to prepare the revision submission.

## Author Response

Author responses will be strictly limited to 1000 words.

## Accepted Papers and Artifact Evaluation

Papers selected by the program committee will be subject to revision and approval by a program committee member acting as a shepherd.

NOTE: For each accepted paper, at least one full registration fee (ACM member or non-member) will be required, even if the presenter is eligible for a student fee.

## Open Access

Important update on ACMs new open access publishing model for 2026 ACM Conferences!

Starting January 1, 2026, ACM will fully transition to Open Access. All ACM publications, including those from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be 100% Open Access. Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs).

Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC to publish their papers, unless they qualify for a financial or discretionary waiver.

Understanding that this change could present financial challenges, ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more time for institutions to join ACM Open. The subsidy will offer:

*   $250 APC for ACM/SIG members
*   $350 for non-members

This represents a 65% discount, funded directly by ACM. Authors are encouraged to help advocate for their institutions to join ACM Open during this transition period. This temporary subsidized pricing will apply to all conferences scheduled for 2026.

## Submission Instructions

### Two Deadlines

New for FAST '26, we are offering authors the option to submit to one of two submission deadlines. Papers accepted during either deadline will be presented at the conference and will be published in the proceedings. Pre-publication PDFs will be available after the Spring review cycle.

Please submit your short and long papers by one of the submission deadlines listed above, in PDF format via the [submission form](https://fast26spring.usenix.hotcrp.com/). Do not email submissions. There is no separate deadline for abstract submissions.

*   The complete submission must be no longer than **12 pages for long papers** and no longer than **6 pages for short papers**, excluding references. The program committee values conciseness: if you can express an idea in fewer pages than the limit, do so.
*   Supplemental material is optional and may be added (if deemed really necessary) as a single separate PDF file without page limits. However, the reviewers are not required to read or consider such material. All content that should be considered to judge the paper is not supplemental and should be part of the main submitted file.
*   Papers must be typeset on U.S. letter-sized pages in two columns using 10-point Times Roman font on 12-point leading (single-spaced), within a text block 7"" wide by 9"" deep.
*   Labels, captions, and other text in figures, graphs, and tables must use font sizes that, when printed, do not require magnification to be legible. References must not be set in a smaller font. Submissions that violate these requirements will not be reviewed. Limits will be enforced strictly. No extensions will be given for reformatting.
*   A LaTeX template and style file are available on the [USENIX templates page](/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates).
*   Double-blind policy: Authors must not be identified in the submissions, either explicitly or by implication. To refer to your previous work, consider it as written by a third party. Do not say ""reference removed for blind review."" Supplemental material must be anonymized. Submissions violating anonymization rules will not be considered for review.
*   Prior Workshop Paper Policy: If a submission extends a prior workshop paper, please include an anonymized copy of the workshop paper as supplemental material. This should be the same as the published version, with any identifying information removed.
*   Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud. USENIX, like other scientific and technical conferences and journals, prohibits these practices and may take action against authors who have committed them. See the [USENIX Conference Submissions Policy](/conferences/author-resources/submissions-policy) for details.
*   Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement forms will not be considered.
*   Submissions should abide by the Conflict Identification guidelines (see below).

## Author Response Period

FAST '26 will allow authors to respond to reviews prior to final decision, according to the schedule above. Authors must limit their response to correcting factual errors in the reviews, to addressing questions posed by reviewers, and to clarifying the ideas in the paper. Responses may include new experiments and data in response to a reviewer's request. Responses are optional and limited to 1000 words.

## Conflict Identification

Upon submitting your paper, authors must indicate conflicts with PC members. A conflict exists in one of the following cases:

*   Institution: You are currently employed at the same institution, have been previously employed at the same institution within the past two years, or are going to begin employment at the same institution.
*   Advisor/Advisee: Doctoral thesis advisor and post-doctoral advisor (if relevant) are conflicts for life.
*   Collaboration: You have a collaboration on a project, publication, grant proposal, or editorship within the past two years.
*   Close friends and family: Close family relations (e.g., spouse, parent/child, sibling) and close friends are conflicts forever if they are potential reviewers.

The PC will review paper conflicts to ensure the integrity of the reviewing process, adding conflicts if necessary. If there is no basis for conflicts indicated by authors, such conflicts will be removed. Do not identify PC members as a conflict solely to avoid having them as reviewers.

## Author Notification and Beyond

Authors will be notified of paper acceptance or rejection according to the schedule above.

For the first time at FAST '26, a few papers that cannot be accepted immediately but which are likely to be accepted with a revision will be given the opportunity to submit a one-shot revision (see below).

We expect that one author of each accepted paper will physically attend the conference and present the work in a dedicated time slot.

Early Rejection Notification: We will notify authors of papers that are rejected early in the process, prior to the author response period.

Paper Availability: All accepted papers will be listed on our website and made available online to registered attendees before the conference.

## One-Shot Revision

A one-shot revision decision includes a summary of the paper's merits and a list of necessary changes that are required for the paper to be accepted at FAST. Authors given a one-shot-revision decision will be sent, within a few days of the decision, detailed instructions about how to resubmit. Authors may then submit a version of their work addressing all revision instructions during the subsequent deadline.

## Policy on FAST Resubmissions

As described above, the FAST '26 conference offers two submission deadlines: spring and fall. Papers rejected at the spring deadline cannot be resubmitted at the FAST '26 fall deadline. However, both papers rejected at the spring and fall deadlines may be resubmitted at either deadline for FAST '27.

## Submission Details

Any paper submitted to EWSN 2025 must be original (i.e., not previously published) and should not have been published, accepted for publication, or be under review by any other venue (including other conferences, workshops, or journals). All submissions within the scope of EWSN are equally welcome, and all submissions will be evaluated based on the same criteria.

The conference will accept two types of papers – **Full Papers (max 12 pages)** and **Short Papers (max 6 pages)**. Short papers are intended to present preliminary research results or advocate for new research directions; their titles should be prepended with “Vision paper: / Position paper: / WiP paper” when they are submitted for review as well as in the final proceedings. Authors should carefully consider the distinction between Full Papers and Short Papers; papers submitted in one category will not be considered in the other category.

EWSN 2025 will use a double-anonymous review policy during the paper review process. Authors are instructed to not include their names, affiliations, and contact information on the manuscript they submit for review. Authors should also anonymize the content of their paper to hide their identity. Reviewers will not know the identity of the authors until an outcome is decided for the paper.

Only PC chairs will know the identity of the authors and be able to interact with them during the review process, should the need arise. Submissions which are not properly anonymized will be rejected without being reviewed. To promote early dissemination, submission to arXiv (or similar) is allowed, provided cross-citations are not made. I.e.,

You MAY post a version of your paper on arxiv that lists the names of authors.

You MAY NOT reference the arxiv version of your paper from the paper submitted for review at EWSN (this is one half of the cross-citation restriction).

You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN paper in the arxiv paper (this is the other half of the cross-citation restriction).

You MAY NOT reference your submitted EWSN paper in any other papers you submit for review at other conferences.

Once your paper is accepted, you MAY reference your EWSN paper (you can use ""accepted, to appear"" until the conference actually happens).

Submissions are via HotCRP: [https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/](https://ewsn25.hotcrp.com/)

Decisions will be: accept, reject, or one-shot revision; papers receiving a “one-shot revision” for the winter deadline will be invited to submit a revised paper by the summer deadline.

Authors of papers rejected in the winter cycle may submit a revised paper in the summer cycle along with a cover letter explaining how/why the new revision addresses all the concerns raised by the reviewers. Should the program chairs deem this revision to be sufficient, the paper will be considered as a new submission for the summer cycle. Papers submitted to the summer deadline that are deemed by the program chairs to be too similar to a paper rejected from the winter review cycle will be returned without review.

Pages must use 8.5″ x 11″ (letter) two-column format, using 10-point type on 11-point leading, with a maximum text block of 7″ wide x 9″ deep with an inter-column spacing of .25″. Submissions with a page size of 11.7 x 8.3 ” (297 x 210 mm / A4) will not be accepted. The page limits include figures, tables, and references. Authors may use the EWSN 2025 template adapted from the ACM templates for convenience (on Overleaf [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-template/wcrmmxrztnpw)).

All accepted papers will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library, SCOPUS, and other prominent digital libraries.

## Important Dates

EWSN 2025 will have two submission deadlines, one in the winter and one in the spring.

## Satoshi Grace Period

On October 4th, 2024, we project that the Ethereum's Beacon Chain will publish a random number in slot 10100000 denoted ""RANDAO Reveal"". Based on the last (least significant) hex character of this number, we will offer a possible extension to the paper deadline as follows:

| Number        | Paper submission deadline |
| ------------- | ------------------------- |
| 0, 1          | 8 October (original deadline) |
| 2, 3, 4       | 9 October                  |
| 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | 10 October                 |
| A, B, C, D, E, F | 11 October                |

The random number in slot 10100000 is `0x8fbc79eb733d3fef8d218a0924bda4a0ff676317790dc58c278a462f7d9c03aed1618be49df1fd77e44f0c8ef260e0ea14c7bda670d0262cc473a6a87b67eb21dcef93e75dd29d98f1c3872432e9de58e2b20f602795baa551c082cea435d52e` and the FC25 submission deadline is thus **11 October 2024**.

## Submission

Contributions are sought in the following categories:

*   Research papers
    *   regular papers (15 pages + references and appendices)
    *   short papers (8 pages + references; no appendices)
    *   systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers (20 pages + references and appendices)
*   Workshop proposals (2 pages)
*   Tutorial proposals (2 pages)

Research paper submissions must be uploaded through the [conference submission website](https://crypto.unibe.ch/fc25/).

Workshop and tutorial proposals should be sent by email to [fc25workshops@ifca.ai](mailto:fc25workshops@ifca.ai), and should not be anonymized. For more details, see the corresponding sections below.

## General Information

For each accepted paper the conference requires at least one registration at the general or academic rate, and paper authors must sign the [IFCA copyright form](http://ifca.ai/documents/copyright.html) when submitting the final version. Alternatively, individual papers can be published as fully open access—the publisher charges authors a fee for this.

## Format

Papers must be formatted in standard LNCS format (templates) and submitted as PDF files. Submissions in other formats will be rejected. All papers must be submitted electronically according to the instructions and forms found here and at the submission site.

## Anonymous Submission

Regular and short research paper submissions as well as SoKs must be anonymized with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. Failure to properly anonymize submitted papers is grounds for a desk rejection without review. It is acceptable (but by no means required) for submitted papers to be published online in non-anonymous form (e.g., on authors' websites or archives like the Cryptology ePrint Archive or arXiv.org). Program committee members will be instructed not to actively seek to de-anonymize papers.

## Original Submissions

Authors may submit only work that does not substantially overlap with work that is currently submitted or has been accepted for publication to any other peer-reviewed conference/workshop with proceedings or a journal. We consider double submission serious research fraud and will treat it as such. Note that it is acceptable for papers to appear in non-peer-reviewed formats (for example, as technical reports or in online archives such as ePrint). In case of doubt contact the program chairs for any clarifications.

## Ethics and Etiquette

Authors are required to read and follow this information on ethics and etiquette.

## Conflict of Interest

Authors must report in the submission site any conflicts with program committee members. A conflict exists if an author has the same affiliation as a committee member, has ever acted as their PhD supervisor or been supervised by them, has a close personal relationship with them, or if they have been co-authors on a paper within the past two years. PC chairs are not allowed to submit papers where they appear as (co-)authors.

PC members will not be able to review, read the reviews of, or participate in discussions of papers they are conflicted with. The review process for papers conflicted with both PC chairs will be managed by another PC member designated as the ""conflict chair"".

## Evaluation Criteria

### Regular Research Papers

Research papers should describe novel, previously unpublished scientific contributions to the field, and they will be subject to rigorous peer review. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings to be published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series. Submissions are limited to 15 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible without them.

### Short Papers

Short papers are also subject to peer review; however, the intention is to encourage authors to introduce work in progress, novel applications, and corporate/industrial experiences. Short papers will be evaluated with a focus on novelty and potential for sparking participants' interest and future research avenues. Short paper submissions are limited to 8 pages in standard LNCS format, excluding references. The title for short papers must begin with the text ""Short Paper:"". Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. The authors of some submissions not accepted as regular research papers may be offered the option of acceptance as a short paper.

### Systematization of Knowledge Papers

We also solicit Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers. To be suitable for publication, SoK articles must provide an added value beyond a literature review, such as novel insights, identification of research gaps, or challenges to commonly held assumptions. SoK paper submissions are limited to 20 pages in standard LNCS format excluding references and appendices. Accepted submissions will be included in the conference proceedings. A total page restriction may apply for the printed proceedings version. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, so the full papers should be intelligible without them. The paper title for systematization of knowledge papers must begin with the text ""SoK:"".

### Workshop Proposals

Proposals for workshops to be held in connection with the conference are solicited. A workshop can be a full day or half day in length.

Workshop proposals should include:

*   Title
*   (Draft) Call for papers
*   Brief summary and justification, including how it would fit into the greater FC scope
*   (Tentative) Program Committee and its chair(s)
*   One-paragraph biographies for key organizers, the expected (or previous, if the workshop has been held in previous years) number of submissions, participants and acceptance rates

Workshop proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to [fc25workshops@ifca.ai](mailto:fc25workshops@ifca.ai). Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots.

### Tutorials

Proposals for tutorials to be given in connection with the conference are solicited. A tutorial can be a full day or half day in length.

Tutorial proposals should include:

*   Title
*   Description
*   Name(s) of presenter(s)
*   Brief biographies for all presenters
*   Information about previous tutorials given by the presenter(s)

Tutorial proposals must not be anonymous and should be sent to [fc25workshops@ifca.ai](mailto:fc25workshops@ifca.ai) (the same address as for workshop proposals). Proposals received after the submission deadline will be considered on a rolling basis for any remaining slots.

## Rump Session

The conference will also include the popular ""rump session"" held on one of the evenings in an informal, social atmosphere. The rump session is a program of short (5 minutes), informal presentations on works in progress, off-the-cuff ideas, and any other matters pertinent to the conference. Any conference attendee is welcome to submit a presentation to the Rump Session Chair (to be announced at the conference). This submission should consist of a talk title, the name of the presenter, and, if desired, a very brief abstract. Submissions may be sent via e-mail or submitted in person in the morning on the day of the session.

This requires authors to:

*   Be affiliated with an institution which has made an institutional agreement with ACM concerning these fees (called ACM Open, see list of participating institutions here: [https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/open-participants](https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/open-participants)).
*   Pay the Article Processing Charge

For 2025 ACM is providing a subsidy on APC pricing for ICPS, as follows:

*   The 2025 subsidized APC rate for ICPS papers will be **$350**.
*   For papers where any of the authors is a member of ACM, the APC rate will be **$250**.
*   For ICPS papers whose corresponding author is based in a lower-middle-income country, the APC rate will be **$175**.
*   For ICPS papers whose corresponding author is based in a lower-middle-income country and where any of the authors is a member of ACM, the APC rate will be **$125**.
*   For ICPS papers whose corresponding author is based in a low-income country, no APC is required.

### Abstract Only Submissions

This year FDG is also providing the option for “Abstract Only” submissions.

*   Accepted abstracts will not be published in the conference proceedings, but abstract authors will be given an opportunity to give an oral presentation of their work at the conference

### Submission Link

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions must be made electronically in PDF format via Easychair: [https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fmcad2025](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fmcad2025)

Two categories of papers are invited: **Regular papers**, and **Tool & Case Study papers**.

*   **Regular papers** are expected to offer novel foundational ideas, theoretical results, or algorithmic improvements to existing methods, along with experimental impact validation where applicable.
*   **Tool & Case Study papers** are expected to report on the design, implementation or use of verification (or related) technology in a practically relevant context (which need not be industrial), and its impact on design processes.

Both Regular and Tool & Case study papers must use the IEEE Transactions format on letter-size paper with a 10-point font size; preferably, use the [FMCAD template for papers](https://fmcad.or.at/latex/fmcad.cls). Papers in both categories can be either 8 pages (long) or 4 pages (short) in length excluding references. Short papers that describe emerging results, practical experiences, or original ideas that can be described succinctly are encouraged. Authors will be required to select an appropriate paper category at abstract submission time. Submissions may contain an optional appendix, which will not appear in the final version of the paper. The reviewers should be able to assess the quality and the relevance of the results in the paper without reading the appendix.

Submissions in all categories must contain original research that has not been previously published, nor is concurrently submitted for publication. Any partial overlap with published or concurrently submitted papers must be clearly indicated.

FMCAD employs a rigorous peer-review process and each submission will be reviewed by at least four members of the program committee. The review process is single-blind. The review process will incorporate a feedback and rebuttal period during which authors will have the opportunity to formally respond to reviewer comments.

### Artifact Evaluation

FMCAD 2025 introduces optional artifact evaluation to enhance transparency and the usability of research outcomes. Authors reporting experimental results are strongly encouraged to publish their final data in a long-term repository (e.g. zenodo). Details on artifact evaluation are available on the [artifacts page](https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/cfa).

Accepted papers are published by TU Wien Academic Press under a Creative Commons license (the authors retain the copyright) and distributed through the IEEE XPlore digital library. IEEE CEDA is a technical co-sponsor of FMCAD. There are no publication fees. Authors of accepted contributions will be required to sign the FMCAD copyright transfer form found here: [https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf](https://fmcad.or.at/pdf/copyright.pdf). For each accepted paper, at least one unique author must register for the conference. Moreover, authors of accepted papers ensure that at least one of them will attend the conference and present the work.

## Student Forum

Continuing the tradition of the previous years, FMCAD 2025 will host a Student Forum that provides a platform for graduate students at any career stage to introduce their research to the wider Formal Methods community, and solicit feedback. Details on the student forum are available on the [student forum page](https://fmcad.org/FMCAD25/student_forum)."

*   **Paper notification:** July 8, 2025
*   **Early registration deadline:** November 21, 2025
*   **Conference dates:** December 14–17, 2025

## Submission Format

Full submissions should contain the abstract and the complete paper. There is no page limit. The submission should contain, within the initial ten pages following the title page, a clear presentation of the merits of the paper.

The submission should be typeset using 11-point or larger fonts, in a single-column, single-space (between lines) format with ample spacing throughout and 1-inch margins all around, on letter-size (8 1/2 x 11 inch) paper. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection.

FOCS 2025 will use double-blind reviewing, and as such, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission.

Authors are required to submit their papers electronically, in PDF (without security restrictions on copying or printing). Please submit using this link: [https://focs25.hotcrp.com/](https://focs25.hotcrp.com/)

## Submission Instructions

The submission process will include a declaration of conflicts of interest.

Authors are encouraged to also make full versions of their submissions freely accessible in an online repository such as the arXiv, ECCC, or the Cryptology ePrint archive. It is expected that authors of accepted papers will make their full papers, with proofs, publicly available by the camera-ready deadline.

## Prior and Simultaneous Submission

The conference will follow SIGACT’s policy on prior publication and simultaneous submissions. Work that has been previously published in another conference proceedings or journal will not be considered. Simultaneous submission of the same abstract to FOCS 2025 and to another conference is not allowed.

## Machtey Award

The Machtey award will be given to the best paper or papers written solely by one or more students. An abstract is eligible if all authors are full-time students at the time of submission. This should be indicated at the time of submission.

## Presentation of Accepted Papers

One author of each accepted paper will be expected to present the work at the conference. Authors are expected to contact the program chair before submission in case insufficient travel funds, family circumstances or external travel restrictions could prevent them from attending the conference.

### *NEW* Industrial Track

This year, the conference is introducing an industrial track and invites authors from industry to submit their work through this track. Industrial papers can present existing or future FPGA devices and tools, including canceled ones, discuss unique challenges that face the FPGA industry in the design, planning, and implementation of its products, and introduce real-world applications ideal for FPGA solutions.

Please refer to the [Industrial Track’s Call for Papers](https://www.isfpga.org/call-for-papers-industrial-track/) for details regarding the scope of the industrial track.

## Submission Guidelines and Processes

Research submissions can be in either of two categories:

*   **Long** — at most 10 pages (excluding references), for a regular presentation at the conference.
*   **Short** — at most 6 pages (excluding references), for a brief presentation at the conference.

Submissions will be considered for acceptance as long or short papers. A paper submitted to the long or short category will only be considered in that category and may include artifacts if desired. Long or short submissions will also be considered for acceptance as a poster. Once a paper has been submitted, its author list is considered to be final.

## Submission Template

Submissions of all types should be made in the form of an English language PDF file. Papers should use the sigconf ACM format template.

*   LaTeX users should use the format of the sample-sigconf.pdf file which can be found in the Samples folder of the zipped master file.
*   Microsoft Word users can download the file Interim layout.docx under the Word Authors section of the template page.

## Originality of Submissions

Papers submitted are guaranteed by the authors to be unique manuscripts and not previously published, currently accepted or under consideration for acceptance at another venue. They cannot be substantially similar to any other current/future conference, journal, or workshop submission(s) unless the content appeared at a venue that does not have archived proceedings.

## Rebuttal Process

The conference review process includes a rebuttal phase for authors to provide an optional response to reviewers’ questions. The rebuttal response will be considered during the final deliberation stage.

## Author Participation

For inclusion in the ACM digital library, at least one of the authors of each accepted submission is required to present the work. Accommodations will be made for authors who face documented visa issues due to travel restrictions.

## Artifact Evaluation

The conference encourages authors to submit accompanying artifacts for their paper submissions, once accepted, for evaluation. This process will allow ACM recognized badges to be associated with the final publication. The inclusion of artifacts with a submission is not required for a paper submission nor will any preference be given to submissions with artifacts over those without. Papers and artifacts will be subjected to separate and independent review processes. All authors will be required at the time of paper submission to indicate if there will also be associated artifacts for evaluation.

For more information, please check the [Artifact Evaluation page](https://isfpga.org/artifact-evaluation/).

## Best Paper Award

The best submitted manuscripts will be eligible for the conference’s Best Paper Award. The authors of these top manuscripts will also be invited to extend their work for consideration in a special issue of ACM’s Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS).

## Conference Policies

### Double Blind Policy

The FPGA Symposium uses a double-blind reviewing system. Manuscripts must not identify authors or their affiliations; those that do will not be considered.

### Reviewer Conflict Policy

During paper submission, all author(s) conflicts must be declared for all possible program committee members.

## *NEW* Important Update on ACM’s New Open Access Publishing Model for 2026 ACM Conferences

Starting January 1, 2026, ACM will fully transition to Open Access. All ACM publications, including those from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be 100% Open Access. Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs).

Understanding that this change could present financial challenges, ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026 to ease the transition and allow more time for institutions to join ACM Open. With the subsidy, the costs will be:

*   **$250 APC for ACM/SIG members**
*   **$350 for non-members.**

This represents a 65% discount, funded directly by ACM. Authors are encouraged to help advocate for their institutions to join ACM Open during this transition period.

For additional information, please check the ACM Open Access Model’s FAQ.

## Important Dates

All submission deadlines are with respect to 11:59 pm Anywhere on Earth (UTC -12).

*   **Abstracts Due (All Papers):** September 24, 2025 (No Extensions)
*   **Submissions Due (All Papers):** October 1, 2025 (No Extensions)
*   **Rebuttal Period (All Papers):** November 2 – 9, 2025

The 28th Forum on Specification and Design Languages (FDL) will be held in **Schloß Rheinfels, St. Goar, Germany** from **September 10-12, 2025**.

FDL is an international event where academics and industrials exchange their results, experiences, advances, and new trends related to languages, tools, and techniques for developing software and hardware systems. Targeted systems encompass cyber-physical systems, distributed systems, real-time systems, embedded systems, mechatronics, IoT, and reactive systems.

## Scientific Areas

FDL focuses on the following scientific areas:

*   **Languages:** Domain-specific languages for software, execution platforms, allocations, environment, contracts, abstractions, and refinements.
*   **Semantics:** formal definitions, compilers, interpreters, typing, abstraction/refinement.
*   **Verification and Analysis:** innovative static analysis, testing, debugging, model checking, machine learning-based analysis, or design space exploration.
*   **Simulation:** innovative simulation techniques, virtual prototypes, digital twins, collaborative simulation, hybrid simulations, or runtime abstraction/refinement.

Cross-fertilization between the above areas, in particular in the context of system engineering, is of great interest. Topics include, but are not limited to:

*   languages and formalisms in model-based system design for modeling, testing, verification, and simulation;
*   languages for knowledge representation about system designs;
*   models of computations considering concurrency and time;
*   modeling languages and tools for modelling (cyber-)physical environments or networks;
*   formal methods and languages for modeling, specification, and verification;
*   system design for modern hardware architectures;
*   high-level hardware and software synthesis, virtual prototyping, and design space exploration;
*   modeling and programming languages for smart contracts and distributed ledger technologies;
*   case studies from typical application areas like healthcare, automotive, Industry 4.0, etc.

## Paper Categories

The following categories of papers are presented orally at the conference and will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore:

*   **Research Papers:** original papers with clear research contributions and evaluation (8 pages plus references).
*   **Special Session Papers:** call for organizing special sessions on a specific topic (2-page session proposals). Papers within the special session follow the same peer reviewing and publishing process as for research papers (8 pages plus references).
*   **Wild-and-Crazy-Idea Papers:** papers with well-explained fundamentally new ideas without rigorous evaluation (4 pages plus references).
*   **Tool Papers:** papers about new tools, their methods and successful case studies (6 pages plus references).
*   **Work-in-progress Extended Abstracts:** submission of 2-page papers (extended abstracts) describing ongoing work where final results are not yet available.

In addition to the above categories of papers, there will be a category of papers that are not published with IEEE but are instead presented orally and distributed informally at the conference:

*   **Ph.D. Forum Extended Abstracts:** submission of 2-page papers (extended abstracts, single blind) about planned and ongoing work on Ph.D. thesis that can be discussed at the conference.

## Submission Guidelines
