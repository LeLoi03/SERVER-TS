CCS 2025 will be held in Taipei, Taiwan, from October 13-17, 2025, and seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to real-world aspects of computer security and privacy. The conference features a multi-track format, and authors must select one track most relevant to their paper's topic at the time of submission. CCS 2025 requires a mandatory abstract submission prior to the full paper submission.","# ACM CCS 2025: Call for Papers

The 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy. Theoretical papers must make a convincing case for the relevance of their results to practice. Authors are encouraged to write the abstract and introduction of their paper in a way that makes the results accessible and compelling to a general computer-security researcher.

CCS has two review cycles in 2025. For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:

*   Accept
*   Minor revision
*   Reject

Authors of each accepted paper must ensure that at least one author registers for the conference, and that their paper is presented in-person at the conference if at all possible.

## Paper Submission Information

All submissions must be received by **11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12)** on the day of the corresponding deadline. Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers that have been published or accepted for publication, or that are simultaneously in submission to a journal, conference, or workshop with published proceedings. All submissions should be properly anonymized.

Papers should avoid revealing authors’ identity in the text. When referring to their previous work, authors are required to cite their papers in the third person, without identifying themselves.

Authors may submit up to a maximum of 7 papers for Cycle B.

## Mandatory Reviewing (New!)

Authors submitting 3 papers or more may be required to submit reviews for other papers at CCS 2025. Authors failing to provide the requested information may see their paper desk-rejected.

## Withdrawing Policy (New!)

A paper can be withdrawn at any point before the reviews have been sent to the authors. Once the reviews have been sent to the authors the paper can not be withdrawn.

## Paper Format

Submissions must be a PDF file in double-column ACM format using `sigconf` 2-column format, no more than 12 pages long, excluding the bibliography, well-marked appendices, and supplementary material. Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.

Please refer to the [sample-sigconf.tex](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/sample-sigconf.tex) and [sample-sigconf.pdf](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/sample-sigconf.pdf) in the ACM package as an example.

## Providing Artifacts at Submission Time

Submissions whose claimed contributions rely on artifacts (e.g., code, models, data sets) are expected to make these accessible to the reviewers.

## Optional Artifact Evaluation

All authors of accepted papers are encouraged to submit artifacts for AE.

## Paper Types

Papers submitted to CGO can be standard research papers, tools papers or practical experience papers. All must be written in the IEEE conference format (use the conference mode), and may have up to 10 pages, references excluded. Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 10 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. In other words, papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.

### Tool Papers

Tool papers must give a clear account of a new tool’s functionality. They must describe the problem that the tool helps to solve, how the tool works and provide an evaluation of the tool. Tool paper authors should prepend their paper title with ‘Tool:’ to provide clarity that this is a tools paper during the review process (this can be removed for the final camera-ready paper).

The successful evaluation of an artifact is mandatory for a Tool Paper. Therefore, authors of work conditionally accepted as Tool Papers must submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation Committee. The successful evaluation of the artifact is a requirement for final acceptance.

### Practical Experience Papers

Practical experience papers should summarize a practical experience with realistic case studies. They must make it clear where the novelty in the work comes from. Practical experience paper authors should prepend their paper title with ‘Practical:’ to provide clarity that this is a practical experience paper during the review process (this can be removed for the final camera-ready paper).

Practical experience papers are encouraged, but not required, to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.

## Geographic Diversity and Inclusion

Authors of papers accepted for CGO 2026 are encouraged to present their work in person. However, to foster the participation of students and professionals from everywhere, CGO 2026 will allow the remote presentation of papers.

## Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings.

## Submission Information

Papers can be submitted at [https://cgo26-first-round.hotcrp.com/](https://cgo26-first-round.hotcrp.com/).

Your submission is limited to ten (10) letter-size (8.5″x11″), single-spaced, double-column pages, using 10pt or larger font, not including references. There is no page limit for references. We strongly encourage the use of the IEEE Conference Template.

Supplementary materials may be included as an Appendix at the end of the submitted paper. The Appendix has no page limit, but the text of the full paper excluding the Appendix must fit within 10 pages. Reviewers are not required to read the Appendix and may do so at their discretion. So papers must be self-contained without needing to read any material in the Appendix.

Papers are to be submitted for double-blind review. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed from the submitted paper.

## Papers

*Note: CHI 2026 has no hybrid or remote attendance. Authors will be allowed to present remotely.*

*   You must submit the abstract/metadata by the **4th Sept 2025 AoE** to submit the full paper by the **11th Sept 2025 AoE**.

### Submission

Please submit papers through the [Precision Conference Submission Portal](https://new.precisionconference.com/).

CHI 2026 papers will follow the same revise & resubmit process from CHI 2024 and CHI 2025. Authors can read more about the rationale behind CHI 2024’s updates in this post by the CHI 2024 Papers Chairs.

### Important Facts

*   **Revise and Resubmit:** CHI 2026 Papers will continue with a revise and resubmit phase for papers above a certain threshold, where authors can respond to reviewer feedback and improve their paper as part of our review cycle.
*   **Paper Length:** Concise and succinct writing is strongly encouraged.
    *   Short Papers: Submissions of 5,000 words or less.
    *   Standard-Length Papers: Submissions between 5,000 and 12,000 words (about 7,000-8,000 words on average).
    *   Submissions with Excessive Length: Submissions of more than 12,000 words will be desk-rejected if their length is not justified.
*   **Accessibility:** Paper submissions must follow the [SIGCHI Guide to an Accessible Submission](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/accessibility/).
*   **Inclusivity:** Authors should ensure their work and writing are as inclusive as possible.

### Optional Video Presentation

All accepted authors can upload a video presentation by the video presentation deadline, Thursday, March 12, 2026.

### Preparing and Submitting Your Paper

1.  **Step 1. Write Your Paper**
    *   Your submission must be original; it cannot have been published or be under concurrent review elsewhere. If you make multiple submissions to CHI 2026 Papers, they must be distinct from each other.
    *   Please ensure you use the correct [template](https://chi2026.acm.org/chi-publication-formats/); a single-column format must be used for the reviewing phase.
    *   Your submission must be anonymized; please ensure that your submission conforms to the [Anonymization Policy](https://chi2026.acm.org/chi-anonymization-policy/).
    *   Concise and succinct writing is strongly encouraged in any submission.
    *   Authors are encouraged to submit a paper of length proportional to its contribution. The average length of CHI papers is approximately 7,000–8,000 words, excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Submissions above 12,000 words will be desk-rejected, except in circumstances where the authors can provide a strong justification.
    *   Your paper must be stand-alone. You may use appendices and/or supplementary materials to share additional information about your work. Still, all important information to understand the contributions of your work must be in the main paper PDF.
    *   If you have any concurrent submissions to CHI or other venues that are closely related – i.e., are based on the same study, artifact, or dataset – you must include an anonymized version of that submission to the concurrent submissions field.
    *   Research Quality: Papers must include enough detail that the research can be reviewed for research quality.
    *   Reproducibility: Where relevant, authors are strongly encouraged to provide supplementary materials to support practices around research reproducibility as much as possible.
    *   Accessibility: Accessible submissions are essential for reviewers and are good practice. Authors are expected to follow [SIGCHI’s Guide to an Accessible Submission](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/accessibility/).
    *   Inclusivity: Authors should ensure their work and writing are as inclusive as possible; where this is not possible, it should be acknowledged.
    *   Questions regarding the submission templates can be addressed by the Publications Chairs at [publications@chi2026.acm.org](mailto:publications@chi2026.acm.org). All additional questions regarding the paper submission process should be directed to the Papers Chairs at [papers@chi2026.acm.org](mailto:papers@chi2026.acm.org).
    *   You can find more information about the publication process and paper templates on the [CHI publication formats and templates page](https://chi2026.acm.org/chi-publication-formats/).
2.  **Step 2. Prepare Supplementary Materials (Optional)**
    *   All video figures and supplementary material must be anonymized throughout the review process. Non-anonymized supplemental materials will result in desk rejection of the entire submission.
    *   Video figures (optional) do not have a specified time limit for the duration, although we recommend staying within 5 minutes. Details are available in the [Guide to Submitting a Video](https://chi2026.acm.org/guide-to-a-successful-video-submission/).
    *   Other supplementary material may include, for example, survey text, experimental protocols, source code, and data, all of which can help reviewers assess your work and allow other researchers to replicate your work. Any non-video supplementary material should be submitted as a single .zip file, including a README file with a description of the materials.
    *   Reviewers should be able to access the contribution of the paper solely based on the main submission file. That is, the paper submission must stand independently without the supplementary material.
3.  **Step 3. Select a Subcommittee**
    *   CHI 2026 expects to receive over 5,000 submissions as of 2025. The CHI program committee is divided into topical subcommittees to provide high-quality expert reviews for all submissions. When you submit a paper, you can state a preference of up to two subcommittees whose mandates you believe your topic fits into.
4.  **Step 4. Complete Submission**
    *   Make your submission. Authors may submit and edit their materials via [Precision Conference Submission Portal](https://new.precisionconference.com/) until the deadlines.
    *   **Abstract/Metadata Submission Deadline:** Authors must submit their title, abstract (150 words max), list of authors, subcommittee selections, and other metadata before this deadline. Only the contact author can edit the submission files. No new submissions will be allowed after this deadline. Placeholder metadata (e.g., ‘abstract todo’) are not acceptable and will be desk-rejected.
    *   **Listed authors cannot be changed after the abstract/metadata deadline.** No new authors can be added even during the revise and resubmit period or for the camera-ready version. Making changes to the author list can be used to manipulate a paper’s selected reviewers, introduce conflicts with previously assigned reviewers, and be used for unethical publication practices. Thus, please make sure a) that you have added all authors, including yourself, and b) that your PCS account email address is valid. There are no exceptions.

## Important Dates

(all times are 23:59 Anywhere on Earth or AoE)

*   **February 19, 2025:** Submission deadline
*   **April 14, 2025:** Notifications given (accept with minor revisions/revise and resubmit/reject)
*   **June 2, 2025:** Revisions due
*   **July 4, 2025:** Final notifications given

## Submission Process

*   PACMHCI GAMES uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) 2.0: [https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions](https://new.precisionconference.com/submissions). Select “SIGCHI” as the Society and “CHI PLAY” as the Conference/Journal to make a new submission.
*   Authors submitting papers for peer-review to ACM publications must comply with the [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship).

## Formatting and Length

*   PACMHCI GAMES uses ACM Journals Primary Article Template found here: [https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates](https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates), which is available for LaTeX (and Overleaf), and Word.
*   No minimum or maximum page length is imposed on papers. Reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Typical papers are under 10,000 words, or about 17-20 pages in the single column ACM Master Article Template, excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Papers that are widely over the typical length (i.e., above 12,000 words) will be examined carefully to ensure that the size of the contribution warrants the length of the paper. Papers whose lengths are incommensurate with their contributions will be rejected.

## Anonymous Review Policy

*   Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed, and avoid obvious identifying statements.
*   Citations to authors’ own relevant work should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work.”
*   PACMHCI GAMES does not have a policy against uploading preprints to preprint servers, such as SSRN or arXiv, before they are submitted for review at the conference.

## Revision Cycles and Decisions

PACMHCI GAMES will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, after the first review cycle:

*   **Accept with Minor Revisions:** Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted by the revisions deadline for verification by the corresponding editorial board member.
*   **Revise and Resubmit:** Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, and then re-reviewed. Authors should submit their revised manuscript at the revision deadline, along with a summary explaining how they addressed the reviewers’ comments and incorporated changes in the revision. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same editorial board member and reviewers for re-review.
*   **Reject:** Submissions that receive this decision have been determined to be not acceptable in their current form and also not able to complete the needed revisions within the 6-week revision period. Rejected papers are not able to submit a revision to the 2025 edition of PACMHCI GAMES, and will not be invited to present at CHI PLAY 2025.
*   **Desk Reject:** Authors should only submit completed work of publishable quality and within the scope of the GAMES track of PACMHCI. The Track Chairs and Editorial Board may Desk Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. Papers may be desk rejected for various reasons.

## Contribution Type for Review Handling

When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be able to indicate the primary and secondary contribution type of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment:

*   Empirical-Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, qualitative user studies.
*   Empirical-Quantitative, e.g., quantitative user studies, statistical methods, data modelling.
*   Empirical-Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research.
*   Artefact-Technical, e.g., building novel systems, algorithms, visualizations, architectures, implementing novel features in existing systems.
*   Artefact-Design, e.g., research through design, envisionments, guidelines, methods, techniques.
*   Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning interactive play studies/domains, theoretical analysis, and essays.
*   Meta-Research, e.g., meta-analyses, systematic reviews

## Open and Transparent Science

Authors are encouraged to submit supplementary material when possible and when aligned with their methods. For example, interview guides, additional illustrations of their designs, or videos that further describe their systems, and to submit links to pre-registrations on the Open Science Framework (OSF) when appropriate for their work. Authors should further consider using open access repositories and make their data and other material available when appropriate for their work. Authors are encouraged to upload data, analysis scripts, and method artefacts as supplementary material to be accessed by reviewers during the review process; these materials will not be made public.

## ACM Policy on Use of Generative AI in Submissions

All authors should be aware of the [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship), which articulates the authorised use of generative AI in submitted works. In particular, it notes that the use of generative AI tools (such as ChatGPT) is permitted, but all authors are responsible for the content created by these tools, the use of the tools must be disclosed (e.g., in the acknowledgements), and the tool cannot be listed as an author of the submission. As such, authors are responsible for plagiarism, misrepresentation, fabrication or falsification of content and/or references generated through the use of generative AI tools, and could be sanctioned with penalties, such as a publication ban.

## ACM Publications Policy

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects.

## Video Figures

Video figures are mandatory for submissions that draw from custom-built games or systems that are not freely available (e.g., novel systems, interaction techniques, game designs, mechanics, or envisionments). Submissions that do not include such a figure (or sufficient detail in text) may be desk rejected if it is impossible to assess the game or system. Figures should showcase the game or system comprehensively (i.e., demonstrate core game mechanics or offer a playthrough) so that reviewers can explore all relevant aspects. Please note that this applies to submissions that contribute systems (i.e., artefacts) and those that study systems (i.e., empirical work). Generally, authors of all papers should consider submitting a video that illustrates their work as part of the submission if appropriate. Videos should be no more than three minutes long.

## Presenting at the CHI PLAY Conference

Accepted papers will be invited to present at the ACM CHI PLAY conference in Fall 2025. Presenting at the conference is strongly recommended but not required for publication in PACM HCI.

## Paper Submission and Proceedings

Authors are invited to submit an extended abstract or full paper with at most **15 pages**, excluding the title page and the references. The title page consists of the title of the paper and the abstract. The first section of the paper should start on the next page.

The usage of the LNCS style file is mandatory. LNCS templates are available here: [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines). No changes to font size, page geometry, etc. are permitted. Submissions should be anonymized according to the double-blind review policy. Late submissions and submissions not in the correct format will not be considered.

Submissions will be through EasyChair ([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ciac2025))

The paper should contain a succinct statement of the issues and their motivation, a summary of the results, a brief explanation of their significance, and a comparison to related work, accessible to non-specialists. Proofs omitted due to space constraints must be put into an appendix, to be read by the PC members at their discretion.

Simultaneous submission to other conferences with published proceedings or to journals is not allowed.

At least one author of each accepted paper will have to register for the conference. For authors who cannot present their paper in person for a significant reason, the possibility of remote presentation may be offered.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

CIAC 2025 will implement a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way; in particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission.

The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. Authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would (e.g., making early drafts available on their webpage, or through pre-print dissemination websites such as arXiv).

When submitting a paper, please indicate Conflict of Interest (CoI) with PC members.

## PC Submissions

Submissions authored or co-authored by (non-chair) members of the program committee are allowed.

## Proceedings

Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the symposium. As in previous editions, the proceedings will be published as a volume in Springer LNCS.

## Best Paper Award

Two selected papers will receive the **Best Paper Award**, sponsored by Springer.

## Paper Submissions

Authors are invited to submit original, full-length research papers that are not previously published, accepted to be published, or being considered for publication in any other forum. Full-length papers should satisfy the standard requirements of top-tier international research conferences.

Manuscripts should be submitted to CIKM 2025 Easychair site in PDF format, using the 2-column ACM sigconf template, see [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). Full papers cannot exceed 9 pages, including an appendix, plus unlimited pages for the GenAI Usage Disclosure section and references.

Papers that include text generated from a large-scale language model (LLM), such as ChatGPT, are prohibited unless this produced text is presented as a part of the paper’s experimental analysis. AI tools may be used to edit and polish authors’ work, such as using LLMs for light editing of their text, but text “produced entirely” by generative/AI models is not allowed.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register to present the work on-site in Seoul, Korea as scheduled in the conference program.

The official publication date is when the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## Usage of Generative AI

As of 2025, technical papers submitted to CIKM are required to include a “GenAI Usage Disclosure” section at the end of the limited pages of main contents and appendix, right before the references. In this section, authors are required to provide full disclosure of all use of GenAI tools in all stages of the research (including the code and data) and the writing. This section, together with the references, will not be counted toward the page limit.

All submissions must comply with the ACM policy on the usage of GenAI: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/frequently-asked-questions#h-can-i-use-generative-ai-software-tools-to-prepare-my-manuscript](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/frequently-asked-questions#h-can-i-use-generative-ai-software-tools-to-prepare-my-manuscript)

## Dual Submission Policy

Submitting papers that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other conferences is not allowed. However, it is allowed to make an abstract submission by May 16, 2025 (without uploading the paper PDF) for a paper that is still under review as long as the ongoing review process ends by the full paper final deadline of May 23, 2025.

Authors are allowed to submit papers that have been presented or are to be presented at conferences or workshops without proceedings, or with only abstracts published. Authors may also submit anonymized work already available as a preprint (e.g., in arXiv). In this case, the authors must modify the title and abstract while refraining from citing the manuscript to preserve anonymity.

## Authorship Policy

Before paper submission, authors are advised to review [ACM’s authorship policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) carefully. The full list of author names, including the ordering, must be finalized by paper submission deadline.

Submissions will be checked for potential plagiarism both by plagiarism detection systems and manually– including against concurrent conference submissions.

## ACM Conflict of Interest Policy

All authors must adhere to the [ACM Conflict of Interest policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/conflict-of-interest).

## Desk Rejection Policy

Submissions that fail to adhere to the anonymity, length, or formatting requirements, or violate ACM’s policies on academic dishonesty may be subject to desk rejection by the chairs.

## ACM Policy Against Harassment

All authors and participants must adhere to the [ACM Policy Against Harassment](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/policy-against-harassment).

*   Topics exploring the value-aligned problems within MAS in the COINE domain
*   Experimental investigation of the effectiveness of COINE technologies
*   Challenging or innovative ideas relevant to the field

## Submission Instructions

For preparation of papers, please follow the instructions for authors available at the Springer LNCS Web page.

We solicit three types of papers in the LNCS format:

*   **Full research papers:** (16 pages, excluding references)
*   **Short research papers:** (10 pages, excluding references) – These ‘early-innovation’ papers are work-in-progress papers and these will be reviewed with an emphasis on novelty/originality of the idea.
*   **Blue sky ideas:** (up to 16 pages, excluding references) – These papers have the same scope as the blue sky ideas track of AAMAS 2025 ([https://aamas2025.org/index.php/conference/calls/call-for-blue-sky-ideas/](https://aamas2025.org/index.php/conference/calls/call-for-blue-sky-ideas/)), focusing on the COINE topics

All papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format. Information about the paper type should be included at the end of the title of the paper – (Full), (Short) or (Blue Sky ideas).

For submission of papers, please use the OpenReview.net site at: [https://openreview.net/group?id=ifaamas.org/AAMAS/2025/Workshop/COINE](https://openreview.net/group?id=ifaamas.org/AAMAS/2025/Workshop/COINE)

Submitted papers will be reviewed on a “single-blind” basis by at least two PC members.

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the workshop to present the work. Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work in person by default. Exceptions may be granted by the organizing committee on a case-by-case basis, and authors who receive such exceptions may present their work online, provided they register for the workshop. Presentations will be delivered in the Eastern Time Zone.

## Proceedings

COINE intends to publish post-proceedings in Springer’s LNCS series (pending confirmation). Authors will be invited to submit revised and extended versions of their paper for consideration in these post-proceedings.

Revised papers must take into account the discussion held during the workshop; hence, only papers that are presented during the workshop will be considered for inclusion in the post-proceedings volume."

The 38th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2025) will take place **June 30th-July 4rd, 2025** in **Lyon, France**. We invite submissions of papers addressing theoretical aspects of machine learning, broadly defined as a subject at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and applied mathematics. We strongly support an inclusive view of learning theory, including fundamental theoretical aspects of learnability in various contexts, and theory that sheds light on empirical phenomena.

## Topics

The topics include but are not limited to:

*   Design and analysis of learning algorithms
*   Statistical and computational complexity of learning
*   Optimization methods for learning, including online and stochastic optimization
*   Theory of artificial neural networks, including deep learning
*   Theoretical explanation of empirical phenomena in learning
*   Supervised learning
*   Unsupervised, semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation
*   Learning geometric and topological structures in data, manifold learning
*   Active and interactive learning
*   Reinforcement learning
*   Online learning and decision-making
*   Interactions of learning theory with other mathematical fields
*   High-dimensional and non-parametric statistics
*   Kernel methods
*   Causality
*   Theoretical analysis of probabilistic graphical models
*   Bayesian methods in learning
*   Game theory and learning
*   Learning with system constraints (e.g., privacy, fairness, memory, communication)
*   Learning from complex data (e.g., networks, time series)
*   Learning in neuroscience, social science, economics, and other subjects

Submissions by authors who are new to COLT are encouraged.

While the primary focus of the conference is theoretical, authors are welcome to support their analysis with relevant experimental results.

Accepted papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper should present the work at the conference. Accepted papers will be published electronically in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR). Authors of accepted papers will have the option of opting out of the proceedings in favor of a 1-page extended abstract, which will point to an open access archival version of the full paper reviewed for COLT.

## Paper Awards

COLT will award both best paper and best student paper awards. To be eligible for the best student paper award, the primary contributor(s) must be full-time students at the time of submission. The program committee may decline to make these awards or may split them among several papers.

## Dual Submissions Policy

Conferences: In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings may not be submitted to COLT.

Journals: In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to journals may not be submitted to COLT.

## Rebuttal Phase

As in previous years, there will be a rebuttal phase during the review process. Initial reviews will be sent to authors before final decisions have been made. Authors will have an opportunity to address the issues brought up in the reviews.

## Reviewing Philosophy

We strongly encourage constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work. The aim of the reviewing process is to assess whether the work is close to being ready for publication; as such, the interaction between authors and referees is meant to both figure this out and guide the paper into a publishable state.

We recommend the following video for a thoughtful discussion of such aims and related issues: IACR Distinguished Lecture: Caught in Between Theory and Practice

## Important Dates

(All dates are in 2025.)

*   **Submission deadline:** February 6, 5:00 PM EST
*   **Author notification:** On or before May 2
*   **Conference dates:** June 30–July 4

## Submission Instructions

### Formatting and Anonymization

Formatting: This year, the submissions are limited to **12 PMLR formatted pages**, excluding references. An additional supplementary file may be uploaded that can include unlimited appendices. Please note that, in a change from previous years, appendices must be uploaded as a separate file, and the main submission file is limited to 12 pages of text (excluding references).

All details, proofs, and derivations required to substantiate the results must be included in the submission, possibly in the appendices. However, the contribution, novelty, and significance of submissions will be judged primarily based on the main paper (without appendices), and so enough details, including proof details, must be provided in the main text to convince the reviewers of the submissions’ merits.

Anonymization: Submissions should be suitable for double-blind reviewing; in particular, submissions should NOT include author names or other identifying information. To the extent possible, you should avoid including directly identifying information in the text. You should still include all relevant references, discussion, and scientific content, even if this might provide significant hints as to the authors’ identity. But you should generally refer to your own prior work in the third person. Do not include acknowledgments in the submission. They can be added in the camera-ready version of accepted papers.

While submissions are anonymized, and author names are withheld from reviewers, they are known to the area chair overseeing the paper’s review. The assigned area chair is allowed to reveal author names to a reviewer during the rebuttal period, upon the reviewer’s request if they deem such information is needed in ensuring a proper review.

### Style files

Please use the following style files. The ""[anon]"" option in the LaTeX template should be used to suppress author names from appearing in the submission.

[LaTeX style files and template](COLT2025_style.zip)

### Submitting your paper

Papers should be submitted through CMT; the deadline for submissions is **February 6, 2025, 5 pm EST**.

CMT submission site: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/COLT2025](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/COLT2025)

Please contact the COLT program chairs if you have any questions about the policy or technical issues with the submission process.

## Call for Open Problems

The Conference on Learning Theory (COLT) 2025 will feature a session devoted to the presentation of open problems. A description of these problems will also appear in the COLT proceedings. The deadline for submission is **June 6, AoE**. The problems should be related to the COLT range of topics and should have a theoretical nature.

The write-up of an open problem should include:

*   A clearly defined problem.
*   The motivation for studying the problem, including why it is important to the COLT community.
*   The current state of this problem, including any known partial or conjectured solutions and relevant references.

Open problems can either be problems that have not been previously stated publicly and investigated theoretically, or problems that have already been suggested in published work. In the first case, the submission should provide convincing arguments for the interest in addressing them. In the second case, the submission should include enough new content to merit a renewed discussion. You will be expected to clearly express the problem in a short presentation during the open problems session to stimulate interest in solving it.

Submissions should be at most 4 pages long, excluding references, and should be in the [COLT 2025 format](https://learningtheory.org/colt2025/COLT2025_style.zip). The title should start with “Open Problem:”. Submissions are non-anonymous; that is, they should contain authors’ names (do not use the “anon” option).

Submissions should be made to the Open Problems track on the CMT Website [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/COLT2025/Submission/Index](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/COLT2025/Submission/Index)

Examples of open problems from past years (search for “Open Problem”):

*   2024
*   2023
*   2022
*   2021
*   2020

Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent out by **June 15**.
