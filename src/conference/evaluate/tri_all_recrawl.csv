*   Design and analysis of learning algorithms
*   Statistical and computational complexity of learning
*   Optimization methods for learning, including online and stochastic optimization
*   Theory of artificial neural networks, including deep learning
*   Theoretical explanation of empirical phenomena in learning
*   Supervised learning
*   Unsupervised, semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation

Submissions by authors who are new to COLT are encouraged.

While the primary focus of the conference is theoretical, authors are welcome to support their analysis with relevant experimental results.

## Publication

Accepted papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper should present the work at the conference. Accepted papers will be published electronically in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR). Authors of accepted papers will have the option of opting out of the proceedings in favor of a 1-page extended abstract, which will point to an open access archival version of the full paper reviewed for COLT.

## Paper Awards

COLT will award both best paper and best student paper awards. To be eligible for the best student paper award, the primary contributor(s) must be full-time students at the time of submission. The program committee may decline to make these awards, or may split them among several papers.

## Dual Submissions Policy

*   **Conferences:** In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings may not be submitted to COLT.
*   **Journals:** In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to journals may not be submitted to COLT.

## Rebuttal Phase

As in previous years, there will be a rebuttal phase during the review process. Initial reviews will be sent to authors before final decisions have been made. Authors will have an opportunity to address the issues brought up in the reviews.

## Reviewing Philosophy

We strongly encourage constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work. The aim of the reviewing process is to assess whether the work is close to being ready for publication; as such, the interaction between authors and referees is meant to both figure this out and guide the paper into a publishable state.

## Important Dates (2025)

*   **Submission deadline:** February 6, 5:00 PM EST
*   **Reviews released:** March 28
*   **Initial author response due:** April 4
*   **Discussion period:** April 4–11
*   **Author notification:** May 2
*   **Conference dates:** June 30–July 4

## Submission Instructions

### Formatting and Anonymization

*   **Formatting:** Submissions are limited to **12 PMLR formatted pages**, excluding references. An additional supplementary file may be uploaded that can include unlimited appendices. Appendices must be uploaded as a separate file, and the main submission file is limited to 12 pages of text (excluding references).
*   All details, proofs, and derivations required to substantiate the results must be included in the submission, possibly in the appendices. However, the contribution, novelty, and significance of submissions will be judged primarily based on the main paper (without appendices), so enough details must be provided in the main text to convince reviewers of the submissions’ merits.
*   **Anonymization:** Submissions should be suitable for double-blind reviewing; do NOT include author names or other identifying information. Avoid including directly identifying information in the text. Refer to your own prior work in the third person. Do not include acknowledgments in the submission; they can be added in the camera-ready version of accepted papers.

The conference focuses on coordination models and languages for modern information systems, addressing the complexity of concurrent, distributed, mobile, and adaptive components.","# Call for Papers: COORDINATION 2025

The **27th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages (COORDINATION 2025)** is one of the three conferences of [DisCoTec 2025](https://www.discotec.org/2025/). It will be held from **June 16-20, 2025**.

Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today’s software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, providing abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, thus increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and enhancing software development. This conference provides a well-established forum for researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) coordination related aspects of:

*   Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: component composition, concurrency, distribution, mobility; dynamic, spatial and probabilistic aspects of coordination; logic, types, semantics.
*   Coordination of multi-agent and collective systems: models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour.
*   Coordination and modern distributed computing: web services, microservices, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing, reversible computing.
*   Session-based programming: models, languages, behavioural types, and tools.
*   Models, languages, verification techniques and tools for interacting smart contracts and (blockchain-based) decentralised applications.
*   Languages, methodologies and tools for secure coordination.
*   Cybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to cybersecurity.
*   Nature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination.
*   Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties, including performance and security aspects.
*   Dynamic software architectures: distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, parallel, high-performance and cloud computing.
*   Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application domains, like IoT, fog- and edge-computing.
*   Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the development and verification of coordinated applications, including DevOps approaches.
*   Coordination in business process management: coordination models for business process management, process mining techniques and tools for coordination models.
*   Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and coordination models, industry-driven efforts in coordination and case studies.
*   Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination.

## Submission Categories

*   **Regular papers** (12-18 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission. Companion artefacts to regular submissions will be reviewed by the Artefact Evaluation Committee, but the acceptance of the paper is decoupled from the acceptance of the artefact (does not depend on it). The acceptance of the artefact, however, is conditional to the acceptance of the paper.
*   **Survey papers** (16-25 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing important results and success stories related to the topics of COORDINATION.
*   **Tool papers** (4-15 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. Tool papers should provide a clear account of the tool’s functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities possibly with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle, and, when applicable, report on realistic case studies (possibly providing a rigorous experimental evaluation). Tool papers may also provide an account of the theoretical foundations, including relevant citations, and present design and implementation concerns, possibly including software architecture and core data structures. Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly describe the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool, possibly providing data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. In addition, the tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation. Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted. The artefact will be evaluated by a dedicated committee. Papers may contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes length.

## Artefact Submission Instructions

We invite you to also submit an associated artefact for evaluation (AE). Artefacts such as ancillary data, tools, and software will be assessed for availability, functionality, and reusability badges.

*   Instructions on how to upload artefacts can be found [here](https://www.discotec.org/2025/COORDINATION_Artefact_Evaluation_Guidelines.pdf).
*   Artefact submissions are mandatory for tool papers and optional for regular papers. Tool papers must submit an artefact that, at least, satisfies the requirements for the **Functional badge**. Papers not meeting this clause are rejected. Moreover, the acceptance of artefacts is conditional on the tool paper being accepted.
*   A selection of artefacts may be invited for submission to a special issue of Science of Computer Programming (SCP).

## Paper Submission Guidelines

*   **Language:** All paper submissions must be in **English**.
*   **Review Process:** All papers will undergo a **double-blind review** process by the Program Committee based on technical quality, relevance to DASFAA, originality, significance, and clarity.
*   **Electronic Submission:** All paper submissions will be handled electronically through the paper submission system: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DASFAA2025/Submission/Index](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DASFAA2025/Submission/Index).
    *   Please select the appropriate track during your submission.
*   **Formatting Requirements:**
    *   Submissions must include an abstract of up to **200 words**.
    *   Papers should be no longer than **16 pages** (including references, appendices, etc.) in **LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) format**.
    *   Accepted short research papers should be revised to a maximum of **10 pages** in the camera-ready version.
    *   Please use one of the following templates for the LNCS format: [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).
    *   Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be rejected without review.
*   **Originality:** Submitted papers must not have been previously published in a refereed journal or conference and must not be under consideration by any other conference or journal during the DASFAA review process.
*   **Citation:** Authors are encouraged to cite related work comprehensively. When citing conference papers, please also consider citing their extended journal versions if applicable.
*   **Presentation Requirement:** If a paper is accepted, at least one author must complete the **regular registration** and attend the conference to present the paper. Papers from no-show authors will not be included in the proceedings.
*   **Publication:** Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings.

## Double-Blind Review Policy

DASFAA-2025 will employ a double-blind reviewing process, meaning that the PC members and referees will not know the identity of the authors.

To ensure anonymity, authors **must** prepare their manuscript as follows:

*   **Author Information:** Author's names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.
*   **Funding Sources:** Funding sources must not be acknowledged on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.
*   **Acknowledgments:** Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.
*   **File Naming:** Source file naming must be done with care to avoid identifying the author's names in the paper's associated metadata (e.g., avoid `Jane-Smith.pdf`).
*   **Self-Citations:** Authors should refer to their prior work in the third person and include all relevant citations. Authors should make every effort to anonymize their work and, hence, **cannot cite their own arXiv work** (or other unrefereed pre-prints).
*   **Pre-prints:** Submissions having unrefereed pre-prints such as arXiv are allowed, but self-citation of such pre-prints is forbidden for anonymization.

> Submissions that do not follow the guidelines mentioned above, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection.

> Because of the double-blind review policy, the submission of an extended version of a short paper that has been published elsewhere is **strongly discouraged** in DASFAA-2025.

## Conflicts of Interest (COI)

Authors are required to use CMT's conflict management system to flag conflicts with members of the Program Committee (reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs) prior to the submission deadline.

**A conflict of interest exists if any of the following applies to X (an author) and Y (a PC member):**

*   **Employment:** X and Y have worked in the same university or company in the past two years, or will be doing so in the next six months on account of an accepted job offer. (Different campuses within the same university system do not count as the same university for this purpose).
*   **Co-authorship:** X has been a co-author of a paper with Y in the last three years.
*   **Collaboration:** X has been a collaborator within the past two years, as evidenced in a joint publication, joint research project, or co-organizing events (e.g., co-chairs of conferences), or are collaborating now (including co-authorship on papers not yet resulted in final publication).
*   **Advisor/Advisee:** X is the master's/PhD thesis advisor of Y or vice versa, irrespective of how long ago this was.
*   **Personal Relationship:** X is a relative or close personal friend of Y.

> It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify and declare all COIs with members of the Program Committee prior to the submission deadline. Submissions with undeclared conflicts or spurious conflicts will be desk-rejected.

## Paper Acceptance

A paper can be accepted as either a **full research paper** or a **short research paper**.

*   **Full Research Papers:** Authors are given the opportunity to present their work in oral sessions, and they also have the option to present in poster sessions.
*   **Short Research Papers:** Authors exclusively present their work in poster sessions. Additionally, the accepted short research papers should be revised to a maximum of **10 pages** in the camera-ready version.

## Anti-harassment Policy

EACSL strives to provide a welcoming, safe, and productive environment for all who attend our events, regardless of their personal characteristics. We do not tolerate any form of intimidation, harassment, or disrespectful conduct at our events. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. The event organisers may take further action, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, contact an event organiser immediately.

## Accommodation Notes

⚠️ **Important Warning:** It appears that CSL 2025 authors are receiving emails from reservation@g-travelexperts.com regarding travel to Amsterdam. Please be aware that this is **spam**, and there are no arrangements with this organisation.

Hotel rooms in Amsterdam are scarce due to the CISCO Live 2025 event taking place in the same week as CSL 2025. There are no hotels in the close vicinity of the conference site.

Three possible suggestions for booking a hotel:

1.  Take a hotel in the city center, close to the central railway station. From there, take a train to Amsterdam Science Park railway station (4 times per hour, takes 9 minutes), which is within walking distance of the conference site.
2.  Take a hotel close to Amstel railway station or Muiderpoort railway station, and use bus 40, which stops right in front of the conference site.
3.  Act like the Dutch, and rent a bike.

A good website for public transport information is `ov9292`.

## Journal Papers

Submissions to the journal-track of the ECSCW conference undergo a fully integrated, continuous review process, allowing authors to develop and refine stronger papers over a longer period.

### Description

We invite journal papers documenting original, rich, and in-depth contributions to CSCW. Authors are encouraged to submit papers that improve and extend the CSCW field.

### Relevant Themes

Relevant themes include, but are not limited to:

*   Empirical investigations of collaborative practices.
*   System design focusing on solutions to support cooperative work in increasingly complex, networked, and data-driven settings.
*   Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, and/or toolkits that enable the building of new social and collaborative systems and experiences.
*   Methodologies and tools for investigating human practices, e.g., the nature of ethnography and the role of other innovative research approaches in building systems or studying their use, the application of critical design or design fictions to investigate future possibilities.
*   Critical analysis or theory with clear relevance to study, design, or use of collaborative settings and systems.
*   Domain-specific social and collaborative applications, including applications to digital civics, grassroots movements, healthcare, transportation, ICT4D, sustainability, education, workplace, accessibility, global collaboration, or other domains.
*   Analysis of the ethics and policy implications of socio-technical systems, the values that inform them, and the algorithms that shape them.
*   The changing nature of collaboration and teaming in relation to intelligent machine agents, e.g., human-AI relationships in collaborative practices.
*   Studies, prototypes, or other investigations that explore interactions across disciplines, distances, languages, generations, and cultures, to help understand how to design in relation to social, temporal, and/or spatial boundaries.
*   Discussions and extrapolations of work-practices and technologies, which contribute to the core topics of ECSCW.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Manuscripts must be prepared in accordance with the [IEEE format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
*   Research papers must not exceed **12 pages** not including the references. No appendix is allowed.
*   Only electronic submissions in **PDF format** will be considered.
*   A paper submitted to ICDE 2025 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire time it is considered for ICDE 2025. It must be substantially different from any previously published work. If an ICDE 2025 submission has overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication.
*   Any author of ICDE 2025 should not be a co-author of more than **10 submitted research papers** across the two submission rounds.
*   Submissions will be reviewed in a **single-blind manner**. Submissions that are rejected in the first round are not eligible for re-submission to the second round.
*   The best papers will be selected for submission as an extended version to be published in the **IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)**.
*   IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution if none of the authors attend the conference to present their paper.

## Desk Rejection Policy

Submissions that don’t meet the following requirements may be rejected without review:

*   Following the guidelines and length requirements specified in the ICDE 2025 Call for Papers.
*   Being in scope of ICDE 2025 (aligning with at least one of the topic areas and relating to data management aspects).
*   Correctly declaring all conflicts of interest (COI) with members of the program committee. Both not reporting COIs as well as frivolously defining COIs count as a violation.

## Conflict of Interest (COI)

Authors must correctly declare all conflicts of interest with members of the program committee. The submission site will request information about COIs. Each author must create a CMT profile and complete it with domain and individual conflicts. Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information may be desk-rejected.

A paper submitted to ICDE 2025 must present original work not described in any prior publication that is more than 4 double-column pages in length. A prior publication is a paper that has been accepted for presentation at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings; or an article that has been accepted for publication in a refereed journal. If an ICDE 2025 submission has overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication, along with all other relevant published work.

The definition of a COI includes co-authorship in the past three years, co-working in the same company or university within the past three years, collaborators within the past three years, thesis advisor relationships, and being a relative or close personal friend. A searchable spreadsheet of COIs is provided for convenience.

## Reviewing Process

Papers will be stringently reviewed with at least 3 reviews per paper, coordinated by a meta-reviewer. Papers may be invited to submit a revised version if the PC believes they can reasonably be improved within the allocated revision time frame. Revisions will go through an additional round of reviews before a final decision.

## Inclusions and Diversity in Writing

We value Diversity and Inclusion. Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Paper should be submitted using the Conference Management Tool: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICDE2025](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/ICDE2025).
*   Manuscripts must be prepared in accordance with the IEEE format available at [https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
*   Research papers must not exceed **12 pages** not including the references. No appendix is allowed.
*   Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered.
*   A paper submitted to ICDE 2025 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire time it is considered for ICDE 2025, and it must be substantially different from any previously published work.
*   Any author of ICDE 2025 should not be a co-author of more than 10 submitted research papers across the two submission rounds.
*   Submissions will be reviewed in a **single-blind manner**.
*   Submissions that were desk rejected in Round 1 due to COI violations, failure to follow length and formatting instructions, or being out of scope for ICDE may be resubmitted in Round 2. The responsibility rests with the authors to ensure their paper meets all submission requirements.

## Desk Rejection Policy

ICDE research track submissions that don’t meet the following requirements may be rejected without review:

*   Submissions must follow the aforementioned guidelines and length requirements specified in the ICDE 2025 Call for Papers.
*   Submissions must be in scope of ICDE 2025, aligning with at least one of the topic areas and situating itself within the state of the art of current and past research in the database community.
*   Authors must correctly declare all conflicts of interest (COI) with members of the program committee. Both, not reporting COIs as well as frivolously defining COIs, count as a violation of this requirement.

## Conflict of Interest (COI)

An author X of an ICDE 2025 research paper has a COI with a PC member or Area Chair Y if and only if one or more of the following conditions hold:

*   X is a co-author of another ICDE 2025 submission together with Y.
*   X has been a co-author of Y in a publication in the past three years.
*   X has been a co-author of Y for 4 (or more) publications in the last 10 years.
*   X has been a co-worker of Y in the same company or university within the past three years.
*   X has been a collaborator of Y within the past three years (e.g., held a joint grant).
*   X is or was Y’s primary thesis advisor or vice versa, no matter how long ago.
*   X is a relative or a close personal friend of Y (or vice versa).

The onus for correctly declaring COIs rests with the authors who must submit their complete set of COIs for a submission to be considered for review.

## Reviewing Process

*   ICDE 2025 papers will be stringently reviewed with at least 3 reviews per paper.
*   Papers may be invited to submit a revised version if the PC believes the papers can reasonably be improved within the allocated revision time frame (authors will have five weeks to prepare revisions).

## Diversity and Inclusion

We value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and profession. Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing. Reviewers will be empowered to monitor and demand changes if such issues arise. Consider actively raising the representation of URGs in your writing.",,Old conference,
