## Submission

**Deadlines:** Papers must be submitted electronically via submission server [here](https://ccc2025.hotcrp.com/), and received by **Friday, February 7, 2025, 23:59 AoE**. Notification of acceptance will be sent by **Friday, May 2, 2025**, and final camera-ready copies of accepted papers will be due end of **May, 2025**.

**Format:**

Submissions should start with a title page consisting of the title of the paper and an abstract of 1-2 paragraphs summarizing the paper's contributions. A submission must contain within its first 10 pages a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including discussion of its importance, prior work, and an outline of key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims (similar to the content of a brief oral presentation). There is no bound on the total length of a submission, but material other than the abstract, references, and the first 10 pages is considered as supplementary and will be read at the committee's discretion.

Submissions should include proofs of all central claims.

The submission should be in single-column format, use at least 11-point font, at least 1-inch margins, and at least single-spacing between lines. Submissions deviating significantly from these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Instructions for formatting camera-ready versions will be communicated to the authors of accepted papers.

The conference will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. (Author and institution information will be uploaded separately on the submission site.) The purpose of this double-blind process is to help PC members and external reviewers come to a judgment about the paper without unconscious bias, and is not intended to make it impossible for them to discover who the authors are. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may (and are in fact encouraged to) post their papers to arXiv/ECCC/IACR etc.

Additional remarks: In addition to the submission, authors may optionally send a short email to the program committee (PC) chair at [ccc2025chair@gmail.com](mailto:ccc2025chair@gmail.com) containing any additional remarks for the PC, such as the relationship with independent/concurrent work, differences from prior versions, conflict of interest statements, or clarifications concerning prior reviews of the work. Submissions involving PC members are not allowed.

**Conflict of interest:** We expect PC members and reviewers to recuse themselves from the evaluation of any submission, if they would not be able to give an objective opinion due to some conflict of interest (COI). Some examples why a COI may arise are being a thesis advisor, being an immediate family member or close friend, sharing a recent institutional affiliation or being a close collaborator. Any author may write to the PC chair at [ccc2025chair@gmail.com](mailto:ccc2025chair@gmail.com) if there is a COI that may not be covered by the above measure, such as significant interactions that would suggest the inability to assess a paper objectively. They need only give the names and affiliations of the people with whom a COI exists; no explanation is required. The COI will be held in confidence by the PC chair.

**Simultaneous submission policy:** Material which has been previously published in a journal or another conference proceedings, or which is scheduled for publication prior to September 2025, will not be considered for acceptance. Simultaneous submission of the same or essentially the same material to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed.

**Confidentiality:** All submissions will be treated as confidential, and will only be disclosed to the committee and their chosen sub-referees.

## Publication

**Online posting:** Authors are encouraged to post full versions of their submissions in a freely accessible on-line repository such as the [Electronic Colloquium on Computational Complexity](http://eccc.hpi-web.de/eccc) or the arXiv. It is hoped that authors of accepted papers will make full versions of their papers publicly available by the camera-ready deadline.

**Proceedings:** The conference proceedings will be published under a Creative Commons BY license in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series. Publication in the conference proceedings does not preclude subsequent journal publication.

**Presentation:** Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the conference. The program committee will determine time allocations for presentations (between 15 and 45 minutes).

## Awards

*   **EATCS Luca Trevisan award for the CCC best student paper:** This award will be given to the best paper written solely by one or more students as judged by the program committee. A paper is eligible if all authors are full-time students on the day of the submission deadline. Authors should indicate their eligibility by using the check-box for this on the submissions page. The program committee may decline to make the award or may split it among several papers. Funding for the best student paper award is provided by EATCS.
*   **Best paper award:** This award will be given to the best paper submitted to the conference as judged by the program committee. The program committee may decline to make the award or may split it among two or more papers. Full versions of the papers chosen by the program committee to receive the best paper award will be invited for submission to the Journal of the ACM.
*   **Special journal issue:** The program committee will invite full versions of a select number of conference submissions to a special issue of the journal Computational Complexity.

## Conference Information

*   **Dates and location:** The conference will be held from Tuesday, August 5 to Friday, August 8, 2025 in Toronto, Canada. The details of the conference format will be posted in due course.
*   **Travel allowances:** In order to defray the costs of attending the conference, travel allowances will be offered to students and post-doctoral fellows. More information will be made available on the conference webpage in due time.
*   **Visas:** A visa for Canada may be needed for attending the conference, e.g., for citizens of China, India, and Russia. See the [visa website of the Canadian government](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada.html) for the exact rules for short-term stay visas. If a visa is needed, please get in touch with your local Canadian consulate as soon as possible; the whole process may take several months. Feel free to contact the local arrangements committee if you need a letter to obtain your visa.
*   **Code of conduct:** CCC 2025 is a participant in the SafeTOC initiative. The open exchange of ideas and the freedom of thought and expression are central to the aims and goals of CCC. These require an environment that recognizes every person and group's inherent worth; fosters dignity, understanding, and mutual respect; and embraces diversity. The CCC'25 organizers are committed to providing an environment free of discrimination and harassment and expect all participants to honor that commitment.

## Instructions for Authors

A paper submitted to TCHES must be written in English and be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or any identifying citations. It should begin with a title, a short abstract, and a list of keywords. The introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Submissions should be typeset in the LaTeX style available at [https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/submission](https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/submission), noting that TCHES only accepts electronic submission in PDF format. Please use the submission mode (`\documentclass[submission]{iacrtrans}`) that displays line numbers to ease the review process.

The page limit is up to **20 pages**, including all figures, tables, and appendices, but excluding the bibliography. Appendices are also reviewed, and should appear before the bibliography. Authors are encouraged to include additional supplementary material needed to validate the content (e.g., test vectors or source code) as separate files. In exceptional cases, where extra details, such as proofs or experimental results, are deemed essential, long papers of up to **40 pages** may be allowed. Submission of long papers requires pre-approval by the Editors-in-Chief. Authors need to request pre-approval no later than a week before the submission deadline. The request should specify the number of additional pages required, a justification for a long paper, and a draft of the paper. When submitted, long papers need to be marked as such by checking the respective box in the submission system and by annotating the title with ""Long Paper:"". Authors also need to include the justification for long papers in the supplementary material. Long papers submitted without pre-approval will be returned without review. Authors of long papers should be aware that the review process may take longer: a decision may, at the discretion of the editor(s)-in-chief, be deferred to the subsequent volume.

TCHES solicits submission of Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, i.e., papers whose goal is to review and contextualize existing literature in a particular area in order to systematize existing knowledge. To be considered for publication, SoK papers must provide significant added value beyond prior work, such as novel insights or reasonably questioning previous assumptions. Authors should highlight SoK papers by annotating the title with ""SoK:"".

Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.

## Regulations

The review process for TCHES, Volume 2026, Issues 1–4, will be governed by the following regulations:

TCHES follows IACR policy, i.e., [https://www.iacr.org/docs/irregular.pdf](https://www.iacr.org/docs/irregular.pdf) with respect to irregular submissions: any submission deemed to be irregular (e.g., which has been submitted, in parallel, to another conference with proceedings), will be instantly rejected. IACR reserves the right to share information about submissions with other program committees and editorial boards to ensure strict enforcement of the policy.

TCHES follows IACR policy with respect to conflicts of interest that could prevent impartial review. For an interpretation of the above reasons, please refer to the IACR policy on CoIs ([https://www.iacr.org/docs/conflicts.pdf](https://www.iacr.org/docs/conflicts.pdf)).

At the time of submission, authors are required to make a declaration regarding any conflicts of interest (including reasons for the conflict), and guarantee they will deliver a presentation at the associated CHES conference if their submission is accepted for publication in TCHES.

Each paper will be double-blind reviewed by at least three members of the TCHES editorial board.

In order to improve the quality of the review process, authors are given the opportunity to submit a rebuttal (between the indicated dates) after receiving the associated reviews.

The review process outcome is either an outright accept or reject decision, or one of two deferred decision types. Specifically, ""minor revision"" means the paper is conditionally accepted, and assigned a shepherd to verify the revision is adequate, ""major revision"" means the authors are invited to submit a revision of their article to one of the following two submission deadlines; a later re-submission will be treated as a new paper.

Resubmission of papers that have previously been rejected from TCHES is only allowed after major modifications and approval by the Editors-in-Chief prior to submission.

Authors of submitted papers are also highly encouraged to check the TCHES FAQ [https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/faq](https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/faq) for answers to questions related to policy and procedures governing CHES.

ASPLOS (the ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems) is the premier academic forum for multidisciplinary applied computer systems research spanning hardware, software, and their interaction. It focuses on practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and associated areas such as networking and storage. ASPLOS 2026 will be held in **Pittsburgh, USA, from March 22-26, 2026**.

## Program Chairs

*   Benjamin C. Lee, University of Pennsylvania
*   Harry Xu, University of California Los Angeles
*   Mark Silberstein, Technion – Israel Institute of Technology

## Important Dates

ASPLOS 2026 has moved to two submission deadlines – spring and summer – which are meant to encourage authors to submit their papers when they are ready.

### Spring Cycle

*   **Abstract submission:** March 05, 2025 (11:59pm Eastern)
*   **Full paper submission:** March 12, 2025
*   **Author response:** June 09 — 13, 2025

*   **Full paper submission:** Aug 20, 2025
*   **Author response:** Nov 10 — 14, 2025
*   **Notification:** Nov 24, 2025

## Submission Website

*   [Spring Cycle HotCRP](https://asplos26-spring.hotcrp.com/)

## Scope and Expectations

The scope of ASPLOS 2026 covers all practical aspects related to computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems, as well as closely-related associated areas. We seek original, high-quality research submissions that improve and further the knowledge of applied computer systems, with emphasis on the intersection between the main ASPLOS disciplines:

*   Operating Systems
*   Programming Languages
*   Computer Architecture
*   Emerging Hardware

Research submission may be applicable to computer systems of any scale, ranging from small, ultra-low power wearable devices to large scale parallel computers and data centers.

Alphabetically sorted areas of interest related to practical aspects of computer architecture, programming languages, and operating systems include but are not limited to:

*   Existing, emerging, and nontraditional compute platforms at all scales
*   Heterogeneous architectures and accelerators
*   Internet services, cloud computing, and datacenters
*   Memory, storage, networking, and I/O
*   Power, energy, and thermal management
*   Profiling, debugging, and testing
*   Security, reliability, and availability
*   Systems for enabling parallelism and computation on big data
*   Virtualization and virtualized systems

## Explicit Assessment of Interdisciplinary Research

The interdisciplinary nature of the paper will serve a significant factor when considering paper acceptance. At the time of the submission we will ask the authors to identify and briefly justify the core disciplines the paper contributes the most. Papers with a single specified discipline are less likely to appear in the conference. In addition, reviewers will be asked to assess the paper relevance to the declared disciplines and low relevance scores will affect the chances of acceptance. If the PC decides that the paper does not fit the selected disciplines at all, it will be rejected without review.

## Resubmissions

Authors of resubmitted work from ASPLOS or other venues must describe in a separate note the changes since the previous submission(s). This description helps reviewers who may have reviewed a previous draft of the work to appreciate any improvements to the currently submitted work. Please try to limit this document to one page.

Submissions rejected from ASPLOS must not be submitted to the next subsequent review cycles and will be desk-rejected otherwise. Thus

*   The papers rejected from ASPLOS’26 Spring may be submitted to ASPLOS’27 Spring
*   The papers rejected from ASPLOS’26 Summer may be submitted to ASPLOS’27 Summer

## Limit on the Number of Submissions by the Same Author

The number of submissions by the same author will be limited to 5 submissions per submission cycle. The submissions will be screened after the deadline, and violating authors will be requested to withdraw their submissions until the limit is met.

## Major Revisions

In addition to Accept and Reject outcomes, ASPLOS 2026 will offer some submissions a “Major Revision” decision. The authors of such submissions will be given the opportunity to apply a major revision to their work and resubmit it at the camera ready deadline (6 weeks from notification).

Revised submissions can use 13 pages (the same length as camera-ready versions, and 2 pages more than the original submission). The additional length is intended to let authors address the revision requirements.

Notifications of  major revisions will occur no later than two months after the revision submission deadline.

## Declaring Areas and Topics

Authors should indicate on the submission form the focused topics matching their work. The selection should be as accurate as possible, and include at most 3 topics. These will be used for reviewer assignments. Incorrect topic selection will result in assigning the paper to less competent reviewers.

## Anonymization

ASPLOS employs a double-blind review process, keeping author identities concealed from reviewers and vice versa. You must therefore make a good faith attempt to anonymize your submission.

## Anonymized Supplemental Material and Appendixes

Supplemental material and Appendixes may be submitted as part of the submission file and have no  page limit. The submission must be self-contained within the page limit, and the supplemental material/appendixes should not be used as a way to circumvent this limit. The reviewers are neither required nor encouraged to read such material when making their decision.

## Declaring Conflicts of Interest

Authors must register all their conflicts in their HotCRP submission page. Conflicts are needed to ensure appropriate assignment of reviewers. If a submission is found to have an undeclared conflict that causes a problem or if a paper is found to declare false conflicts in order to abuse or “game” the review system, the submission will be summarily rejected.

## Declaring Authors

Declare all the authors of the submission upfront. Addition/removal of authors once the submission is accepted will have to be approved by the program chairs, since it potentially undermines the goal of eliminating conflicts for reviewer assignment.

## Originality and Concurrent Submissions

By submitting a manuscript to ASPLOS, the authors guarantee that the manuscript has not been previously published or accepted for publication in a substantially similar form in any conference, journal, or workshop.

## Ethical and Other Obligations

Authors are not allowed to break anonymity when interacting with known ASPLOS PC/ERC members, e.g., by mentioning/identifying work that they plan to submit to ASPLOS or have already submitted and is currently under review.

Authors must abide by the ACM ethics policy ([https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)).

## Formatting and Editing

Submissions must be printable PDF files. When creating your submission, you must use the sigplan proceedings template of ACM’s acmart Latex class available on the official ACM site.

## Page Layout and Limit

Full submissions must not exceed 11 pages of single-spaced two-column text. This page limit applies to all text, figures, tables, and footnotes. The only exceptions are the bibliographic references section and the appendices, which are not included in the page limit.

## Page Limit of Accepted Papers and Major Revisions

The authors of an accepted paper are allowed to use +2 pages in the camera-ready version beyond the aforementioned page limit. The same applies to major revisions, to accommodate added experiments and such.

## Font Size, Tables, and Figures

The submission’s text must use a 10pt font (not 9pt) or bigger. Labels, captions, and text within figures, graphs, and tables must use reasonable font sizes that, as printed, do not require extra magnification beyond “100%” to be legible.

## References

Because references do not count against the page limit, the space they occupy should not be “optimized” away. Notably, the full, non-abbreviated first and last names of all co-authors of all citations must be specified (no “et al.”). The reference citations within the submission (numbers in square brackets) should be hyperlinked to the corresponding items in the references section, to ease the job of reviewers.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Full papers are up to **eight camera-ready pages**, including figures, but excluding references. Submissions longer than eight pages of content excluding references will be desk rejected.
*   All papers for the conference must be submitted in **PDF format** and conform to IEEE Proceedings specifications. Templates are available at this [link](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html) (use US letter format). In addition, the IEEE has partnered with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), so you can start writing directly.
*   The HRI 2026 full papers review process is **double-blind**; every aspect of all submissions must be properly anonymized. See the anonymization guidelines (coming soon).

## Abstract Submission

All full papers are required to submit an abstract and basic details about the paper a week before the paper submission deadline. Papers that did not submit the abstract on time will not be accepted.

In addition, the abstract, title, and list of authors’ information that is submitted at that time must be complete. Submissions for which it is obvious that the information submitted by the abstract deadline is merely a placeholder or incomplete will be deleted.

## Supplementary Materials

Authors have the opportunity to upload up to three supplemental files in conjunction with their full paper submission. These materials may be submitted via the “Supporting File 1,” “Supporting File 2,” and “Supporting File 3” sections within the full papers submission form in the submission system.

In general, there are three main types of supplemental materials that may be submitted: videos, appendices, and artifacts (e.g., software, hardware, data sets, etc.).

## Video Guidelines

Authors may submit a **1-minute video (up to 100 MB)** as a supplement to their full paper. Videos are not mandatory but may be helpful to visibly showcase a working system, experimental conditions, environment context, results, etc. Only MPG, MPEG or MP4 video formats can be used. Ensure that videos are properly anonymized prior to submission (more information coming soon).

Accepted full papers with a video in supplementary material will be considered for Demo Fast Track. More details coming soon.

## Artifact Guidelines

Across all full paper tracks, we encourage submissions that introduce a novel “artifact” as an enabler to reproducibility, replicability, and recreation of HRI research, and/or to support new lines of HRI research.

Authors submitting artifacts must include with it a text file providing relevant details regarding any aspects related to artifact clearance and release (e.g., obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) clearance for releasing data collected by human participants, organizational clearances for the release of software/hardware, etc.).

## Appendix Guidelines

Authors may upload an appendix directly or provide a link to supporting appendix material hosted anonymously online. Appendices are only for supplementary materials that would interrupt the flow of the text if presented in the main document. Examples may be questionnaires used as measurements, tables of supplementary data, or figures of experimental apparatus. 

## Studies with Human Participants

To support building a strong evidence base in HRI, and encourage future reproducibility of published work, all submissions involving studies with human participants clearly outline their methodology regardless of the theme they are submitted to.

Studies that involve human participants need to include an ethical approval statement.

## Policy on Use of ChatGPT or Similar Models

Text, images or any material generated from foundation models (LLMs, VLMs etc.), such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text. Please carefully review the April 2023 ACM Policy on Authorship before you use these tools. The SIGCHI blog post describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance.

Any AI system, including Generative Models, such as ChatGPT, BARD, or DALL-E, do not satisfy the criteria for authorship of papers and, as such, also cannot be used as a citable source in papers published by ACM and IEEE. Authors assume full responsibility for content, including checking for plagiarism and veracity of all text.

## Desk Rejects

Desk rejects are made during the initial checks of submissions to save our reviewers’ time. The main reasons for a desk rejections include:

*   Scope: clearly out of scope for conference (e.g., no relevance to robots or to human-robot interaction).
*   Anonymization: any violation of the rules detailed in the anonymization guidelines
*   Incomplete submissions: missing submission information (including an obviously placeholder title or abstract, etc.).
*   Formatting issues:
    *   paper is breaking the full paper limit (eight pages excluding references);
    *   using an incorrect submission format.
*   Other obvious issues, such as paper clearly unfinished, obvious use of foundation models for generating the contents, not written in English, etc.

## Full Paper Tracks

*   **Theory and Methods**
    *   The primary contribution for the Theory and Methods track is to further the conceptual foundations of HRI. This work helps us to expand upon the ways we think about human-robot interaction (theory) and upon the ways we engage in doing human-robot interaction research (methods).
*   **Design**
    *   The Design track brings together design-centric research contributions to human-robot interaction (HRI). This includes novel design approaches, new robot morphologies, behavior paradigms, interaction techniques, and the exploration of new contexts for interaction that yield unique or improved interaction experiences with or capabilities for robots.
*   **Technical**
    *   The primary knowledge contribution of papers submitted to the technical track is expected to be a novel algorithm (formalized through pseudocode), mathematical model (formalized through a set of equations), tool, hardware element, or human-robot interface, and should provide enough detail to allow reproducibility.
*   **Systems**
    *   Because HRI is by its nature an integrative discipline, the Systems track focuses on contributions which consist of a synthesis of underlying techniques and/or technologies to achieve system-level HRI behavior.
*   **User Studies**

The 16th International Workshop on the Algorithmic Foundations of Robotics (WAFR) will be held in **Chicago, USA, October 7-9 2024.**

WAFR is a biannual multi-disciplinary single-track meeting of international researchers presenting the latest advances on algorithmic problems in robotics.  In 2024, we celebrate **30 years of WAFR** and are planning some special events related to this milestone.

The focus of WAFR is on the design and analysis of robot algorithms from both theoretical and practical angles.  These algorithms process inputs from noisy sensors, build geometric and physical models of the world, plan high-and low-level actions at different time horizons, and execute these actions on actuators with limited precision.

## Topics of Interest

The design and analysis of robot algorithms raise a unique combination of questions from many fields, including but not limited to:

*   Algorithmic approaches to human-robot interaction,
*   Computational geometry and topology,
*   Control theory and optimization,
*   Distributed and parallel methods,
*   Decision theory and game theory,
*   Geometrical and physical modeling,
*   Machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, representation learning, imitation learning
*   Planning and reasoning under uncertainty,
*   Probabilistic and sampling-based algorithms,
*   Sensing and perception,
*   Task and motion planning, and
*   Theoretical computer science.

In addition to these topics, we also encourage papers on applications of robot algorithms to important or new domains, including those beyond the traditional scope of robotics, such as:

*   Assistive and service robotics,
*   Brain-controlled robots,
*   Computational biology,
*   Computer animation, graphics and animation, VR/AR,
*   Legged locomotion,
*   Manufacturing and automation,
*   Multi-agent systems,
*   Sensor networks and IoT devices,
*   Surgical robots, intelligent prosthetics, rehabilitation robots,

[https://new.precisionconference.com/vrst2025](https://new.precisionconference.com/vrst2025)

## Submission Guidelines

All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library in the VRST collection.

### Format

Paper submissions must be anonymous for a double-blind review process.

All submissions should be prepared using the Word or LaTeX templates from the official ACM Master article template packages and TAPS (see [https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow](https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/word-template-workflow)).

*   For LaTeX authors, submissions should be made using the double-column format using `\documentclass[sigconf,review,anonymous]{acmart}`.
*   For Word submissions, please use the linked single-column template.
*   Authors should prepare their materials using numbered citations and references. See the TAPS webpage for guidance on how content length corresponds to the page limits for the final version.

### Submission Lengths

*   Latex: 4 to 9 pages, double column, excluding references
*   Word: approx. 8,000 words including space for figures, tables, etc.

### Anonymity Guidelines

For initial Paper submissions, authors are asked to remove all author and institution information and remove any clues that would directly identify any of the authors (such as the name of the data collecting institution, ethical board/IRB institution names, or acknowledgments). Please anonymize all PDF files. Note that PDF creator programs may automatically include author information in the file metadata. Citations of the authors’ own published work (including online) must be in the third person, in a manner that is not traceable to the identity of the authors. For example, the wording “in [3], Mountain and River proposed…” is acceptable, whereas “in [3], we proposed…” is not. Here, reference [3] is listed explicitly as “Mountain, A. and River, A., Detecting Mountains and Rivers, In Proc. XYZ ’16, 721-741.” We welcome authors to extend their own existing non- or semi-archivable, as well as not-yet-peer-reviewed publications, such as extended abstracts. To avoid accusations of (self)plagiarism in these cases, we ask the authors to upload their work in a special field in PCS. These works can only be viewed by the submission coordinator.

Please note that failure to comply with any of the above requirements and guidelines will result in an automatic desk rejection of the paper!

## Contribution Types

We invite many types of research contributions, including interactive systems. However, evaluating systems that are built using existing techniques can be difficult. For example, a system can be built using a known machine-learning technique but it can enable entirely new functionality. In this case, reviewers will need to judge the novelty of the new functionality that the system enables without penalizing the work for leveraging an existing technique.

For reference, here’s a paper about evaluating interactive systems that reviewers and authors should both be familiar with:

James Fogarty (2017): Code and Contribution in Interactive Systems Research

We further accept studies that replicate known findings systematically to confirm or contradict previously found results.

## Supplementary Materials

Submissions may be (optionally) accompanied by additional materials such as images, videos, or electronic documents. These materials do not form a part of the official submission. They will be viewed only at the discretion of the reviewers. All content should be in a portable format that is unlikely to require the user to download additional programs. For example, you may prefer PDF or HTML for documents, PNG or JPEG for images, and QuickTime or MPEG for videos. The total file size for supplementary materials should not exceed a total of 50MB. To the extent possible, accepted papers should stand on their own, with the additional material providing supplementary information or confirmation of results. It is, however, appropriate to refer to video footage in the paper.

## Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

When designing and presenting user evaluations, please consider the following: User evaluations using non-representative or homogeneous participant populations can introduce biases in the results and conclusions. We recommend that researchers strive to use samples that are representative of the population for which the technology is being designed. If representative samples are not possible to collect, we recommend that the limitations of the population studied should be discussed within the paper and care must be taken when making claims about the findings. We recommend that participant demographic information should be reported for user evaluations so that future researchers understand the results based on the population studied.

## Accessibility

We ask authors to try to be as inclusive as possible when preparing a submission. For instance, please provide alt-text for figures and tables and make supplemental videos accessible with subtitles to enable us to facilitate accessible reviewing. We recommend that authors read the SIGCHI Guidelines for an Accessible Submission, as well as the SIGCHI Technical Requirements and Guidelines for Videos (especially the section “What accessibility considerations should I pay attention to when recording my video?”), which describes the process of accessible video creation and captioning. If authors have difficulties with making their submissions accessible, they are encouraged to contact the VRST 2025 Accessibility Chairs by emailing [accessibility@vrst2025.org](mailto:accessibility@vrst2025.org).

## Policies

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference, and present their work in person at the conference. As the conference is in-person only, there will not be any opportunity to present remotely. Besides, it’s just so much better to meet your fellow XR enthusiasts in person!

All standing ACM policies apply to ACM VRST 2025.

*   [ACM Policy on Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) (which also contains statements regarding the use of generative AI)
*   [ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions)

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper.  ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently committed to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors.  We are committed to improving author discoverability, ensuring proper attribution, and contributing to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

AUTHOR’S TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work. (For those rare conferences whose proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library after the conference is over, the official publication date remains the first day of the conference.)
