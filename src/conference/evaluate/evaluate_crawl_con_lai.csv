## Scope

The main focus of EOMAS is on the role, importance, and application of modeling and simulation within the extended organizational and enterprise context. This context implies that systems and software applications are designed to enable certain business processes, and to facilitate interaction of the actors, the system, and the environment. Thus, application of modeling and simulation in this extended context involves several number of socio-technical aspects (Information Systems (IS), Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), Software Systems, and Business Systems, Business Processes, Human Interaction, etc.), as well as technical challenges such as security, big data, and approaches to develop these artifacts such as Agile methods and frameworks etc.

## Suggested Topics

*   Enterprise Modeling and Simulation
*   Information Systems Modeling and Simulation
*   Business Processes Modeling and Simulation
*   Organizational Modeling and Simulation
*   Ontological and Conceptual  Modeling

*   The use of AI (e.g. language models like Chat GPT) in software engineering and modeling and how to use these new ideas and tools
*   Modeling and simulation applied to support Agile methods and frameworks
*   Information modeling as a support for Digital Twins
*   Usage of information modeling and simulation in new areas and their application in fields other than software engineering or informational technologies

> It is possible to accept articles that do not directly fit the above topics if judged attractive. We support new and not yet-popular ideas – because we want to be a platform or incubator and motivate the professional public, our colleagues and doctoral students. But we will only take such papers if there is some innovation in the text.

## Paper Formats

*   **Standard papers:** max. 15 pages long presenting mature research results
*   **Short papers:** max. 8 pages long presenting preliminary research results and case studies
*   **Flash talks:** (5-10 mins) “Show us your project”

Authors may indicate to submit their papers into one of the categories by themselves, or chairs may decide, based on the reviews, to accept a standard paper as a short paper or a flash talk.

Both standard and short papers will be published in the Springer volume proceedings and indexed.

Papers should be submitted in PDF format. Submissions must conform to Springer‚ LNCS format and should not exceed 15 pages, including all text, figures, references, and appendices. Submissions not conforming to the LNCS format, exceeding 15 pages, or being obviously out of the workshop’s scope will be rejected without review.

## Stream A: Decision making and public participation in environmental modelling

This stream through its various sessions seeks to bring together academic experts, action researchers and practitioners to explore recent developments in participatory decision making, modelling, design and research to solve complex problems of today. We will focus on questions related to the latest trends in participatory research, what role AI and Machine Learning can play in advancing participatory methods, how to organise, support and promote stakeholder participation, as well as how diversity among stakeholder groups can help and related areas.

### A1. Applications of integrated models to support participatory scenario processes in sustainability science
Objective of this session is to present and to discuss methods and case studies for the application of simulation models that integrate social and environmental components in participatory scenario processes. Focus is on research related to sustainability science. This may include questions of identifying the relevant scale level and domain of modelling, incorporation of stakeholder knowledge and qualitative scenario components into models in an iterative manner as well as communication of model results and inherent uncertainties.

### A2. Come to the table! Stakeholder engagement in modelling for agricultural transformation
We seek recent methods and applications of modelling/optimization approaches with strong stakeholder involvement that aim at solving real-world problems in agricultural landscapes. Submissions focused on applications are encouraged; they may be related to water and agri-environmental management, land use allocations, biodiversity protection, and the adoption of sustainable technology and management.

### A3. Connecting stakeholder engagement to governance processes and decision making for climate adaptation and sustainability
This session examines the policy, governance, and societal conditions that affect, and are affected by, participatory processes and stakeholder engagements. We are also interested in the approaches, knowledgebases, or tools that can provide greater transparency and accountability to science/policy governance and outcomes. We are particularly interested in presentations and case studies relating to climate adaptation and sustainability.

### A4. Tools and software for participatory modeling and decision support
We encourage submissions discussing advances in openly developed software and tooling for participatory modeling and decision support across various fields. These include environmental and climate policymaking, resource planning, and climate change adaptation. Recent issues around research reproducibility and transparency have led to a general preference for openly developed computational tools to address, or otherwise mitigate, concerns around the trifecta of reproducibility, reusability, and replicability.

### A5. How Data Science and Machine Learning can help Participatory Modeling
We invite papers that illuminate ways in which data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence can support the specific goals of participatory modeling. We also invite papers that address how PM could be used to contribute to the creation of more responsible AI models.

### A6. Improving participatory processes through analysis of narratives, knowledge sources, emotions, values, biases and schema
Our session will focus on methods that can be used to:
(1) Elicit and analyze narratives and their influence on decision-making and participatory processes.
(2) Identify benefits and pitfalls to participatory processes; and roles for narratives in improving facilitation.
(3) Create Records of Engagement and Decision-making (RoED) to improve facilitation, and for broader, longer-term, dissemination/use of the efforts and outcomes of participatory processes.

### A7. Education and capacity building for complex systems modelling
This session aims to promote a scholar-based approach for teaching complex systems modelling. We welcome theoretical and empirical studies from various fields of applications related to complex modelling (e.g. environment, health, business…etc).

### A8. Modelling with Stakeholders 2.0: more than a next-generation
This session aims to incite academic discussions, oral presentations, paper/workshop showcases, and symposiums that provoke the use of participatory modelling (or modelling with stakeholders) as key to tackling current challenges in different disciplines.
