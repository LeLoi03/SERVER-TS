The workshop aims to advance computerized image analytic tools, improve the generalizability of deep learning algorithms, and evaluate the plausibility of synthetic data.","# SASHIMI 2025: Call for Papers

The Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging (SASHIMI) workshop, a MICCAI 2025 Workshop, is jointly organized with the SynthRAD2025 Challenge ([https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/](https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/)) and held in conjunction with MICCAI 2025 ([https://conferences.miccai.org/2025/en/](https://conferences.miccai.org/2025/en/)). Previous SASHIMI proceedings are available on [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/conference/sashimi).

## About SASHIMI

The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) community needs data with known ground truth to develop, evaluate, and validate computerized image analytic tools, as well as to facilitate clinical training. Synthetic data are ideally suited for this purpose. Another motivation to generate synthetic data is to improve the generalizability of deep learning and machine learning algorithms that are affected by domain shift issues.

The goal of the Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging (SASHIMI) workshop is to bring together all those interested in such problems in order to engage in invigorating research, discuss current approaches, and stimulate new ideas and scientific directions in this field.

## Objectives

The objectives are to:

1.  Bring together experts on image synthesis to raise the state of the art.
2.  Hear from invited speakers outside of the MICCAI community, for example in the areas of transfer learning, generative adversarial networks, or variational autoencoders, to cross-fertilize these fields.
3.  Identify challenges and opportunities for further research.
4.  Identify the suitable approaches to evaluate the plausibility of synthetic data and to collect benchmark data that could help with the development of future algorithms.

## Topics

The workshop focuses on models underpinning image simulation and synthesis, including:

*   Deep learning methods (fully-supervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, unsupervised, transfer, and multi-task learning)
*   Deep learning model architectures (Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), Flows, Transformers, etc.)
*   Machine learning methods using hand-crafted features
*   Detailed mechanistic models (top–down)
*   Complex spatio-temporal computational models of anatomical variability, organ physiology, and morphological changes in tissues or disease progression
*   Applications of synthetic images (improving image quality, segmentation, tracking, detection, registration, etc.)

## Keynote Speaker

**Can Zhao**, senior research scientist at NVIDIA

*   Keynote Title: **MAISI: A Foundation Model for Accelerated, Anatomy-Aware High-Resolution 3D CT Synthesis** ([https://research.nvidia.com/person/can-zhao](https://research.nvidia.com/person/can-zhao))

## SynthRAD2025 Challenge

SASHIMI 2025 will host the SynthRAD2025 Challenge ([https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/](https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/)). The challenge focuses on synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT to enable MRI-only radiation therapy and adaptive MRI- or CBCT-based radiotherapy. Participants will develop AI models using a large multi-center dataset. The winning teams will present their solution at SASHIMI 2025.

## Author Responses

Authors of papers that receive “Revision” decisions will have the opportunity to submit a revised version of their papers. The authors are required to provide a response letter that (1) explains how the comments have been tackled, (2) provides answers to the questions posed by reviewers.

## Paper Submission

All submissions must be in PDF format and conform, at time of submission, to the official “ACM Primary Article Template”, which can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template Page. LaTeX users should use the sigconf option, as well as the review (to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers) and anonymous (omitting author names) options.

All submissions must not exceed the specified page limits. The purchase of additional pages in the proceedings is not allowed.

Submissions must strictly conform to the ACM conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above. Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review.

### Anonymization

The SEAMS 2026 Research Track will use a lightweight double- anonymous review process. No submission may reveal its authors’ identities. In particular:

*   Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission.
*   All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person.
*   While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to SEAMS 2026.
*   During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. They should thus use a different paper title for any pre-print in ArXiV or similar websites.
*   Additional material published online should be anonymized and should not provide references to the paper’s authors.
*   All communication with the program committee must go through the program committee chairs. Do not contact individual program committee members regarding your submission.

## Ethics and Policies

By submitting to SEAMS, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the [ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism) and the [IEEE Plagiarism FAQ](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee/org/about/corporate/governance/p9-26.pdf).

Submissions must follow the latest policies from IEEE and ACM (“IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policy” and “ACM Policy on Authorship”, with associated FAQ), which includes a policy specific to the use of generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT.

In particular, papers submitted to SEAMS 2026 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for SEAMS 2026.

If the research involves human participants/subjects, the authors must adhere to the [ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

## Publication

Accepted papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper should present the work at the conference. Accepted papers will be published electronically in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR). Authors of accepted papers will have the option of opting out of the proceedings in favor of a 1-page extended abstract, which will point to an open access archival version of the full paper reviewed for COLT.

## Paper Awards

COLT will award both best paper and best student paper awards. To be eligible for the best student paper award, the primary contributor(s) must be full-time students at the time of submission. The program committee may decline to make these awards, or may split them among several papers.

## Dual Submissions Policy

*   **Conferences:** In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings may not be submitted to COLT.
*   **Journals:** In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to journals may not be submitted to COLT.

## Rebuttal Phase

As in previous years, there will be a rebuttal phase during the review process. Initial reviews will be sent to authors before final decisions have been made. Authors will have an opportunity to address the issues brought up in the reviews.

## Reviewing Philosophy

We strongly encourage constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work. The aim of the reviewing process is to assess whether the work is close to being ready for publication; as such, the interaction between authors and referees is meant to both figure this out and guide the paper into a publishable state.

## Important Dates (2025)

*   **Submission deadline:** February 6, 5:00 PM EST
*   **Reviews released:** March 28
*   **Initial author response due:** April 4
*   **Discussion period:** April 4–11
*   **Author notification:** May 2
*   **Conference dates:** June 30–July 4

## Submission Instructions

### Formatting and Anonymization

*   **Formatting:** Submissions are limited to **12 PMLR formatted pages**, excluding references. An additional supplementary file may be uploaded that can include unlimited appendices. Appendices must be uploaded as a separate file, and the main submission file is limited to 12 pages of text (excluding references).
*   All details, proofs, and derivations required to substantiate the results must be included in the submission, possibly in the appendices. However, the contribution, novelty, and significance of submissions will be judged primarily based on the main paper (without appendices), so enough details must be provided in the main text to convince reviewers of the submissions’ merits.
*   **Anonymization:** Submissions should be suitable for double-blind reviewing; do NOT include author names or other identifying information.

The conference focuses on coordination models and languages for modern information systems, addressing the complexity of concurrent, distributed, mobile, and adaptive components.","# Call for Papers: COORDINATION 2025

The **27th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages (COORDINATION 2025)** is one of the three conferences of [DisCoTec 2025](https://www.discotec.org/2025/). It will be held from **June 16-20, 2025**.

Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today’s software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, providing abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, thus increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and enhancing software development. This conference provides a well-established forum for researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) coordination related aspects of:

*   Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: component composition, concurrency, distribution, mobility; dynamic, spatial and probabilistic aspects of coordination; logic, types, semantics.
*   Coordination of multi-agent and collective systems: models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour.
*   Coordination and modern distributed computing: web services, microservices, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing, reversible computing.
*   Session-based programming: models, languages, behavioural types, and tools.
*   Models, languages, verification techniques and tools for interacting smart contracts and (blockchain-based) decentralised applications.
*   Languages, methodologies and tools for secure coordination.
*   Cybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to cybersecurity.
*   Nature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination.
*   Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties, including performance and security aspects.
*   Dynamic software architectures: distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, parallel, high-performance and cloud computing.
*   Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application domains, like IoT, fog- and edge-computing.
*   Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the development and verification of coordinated applications, including DevOps approaches.
*   Coordination in business process management: coordination models for business process management, process mining techniques and tools for coordination models.
*   Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and coordination models, industry-driven efforts in coordination and case studies.
*   Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination.

## Submission Categories

*   **Regular papers** (12-18 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission. Companion artefacts to regular submissions will be reviewed by the Artefact Evaluation Committee, but the acceptance of the paper is decoupled from the acceptance of the artefact (does not depend on it). The acceptance of the artefact, however, is conditional to the acceptance of the paper.
*   **Survey papers** (16-25 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing important results and success stories related to the topics of COORDINATION.
*   **Tool papers** (4-15 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. Tool papers should provide a clear account of the tool’s functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities possibly with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle, and, when applicable, report on realistic case studies (possibly providing a rigorous experimental evaluation). Tool papers may also provide an account of the theoretical foundations, including relevant citations, and present design and implementation concerns, possibly including software architecture and core data structures. Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly describe the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool, possibly providing data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. In addition, the tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation. Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted. The artefact will be evaluated by a dedicated committee. Papers may contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes length.

## Artefact Submission Instructions

We invite you to also submit an associated artefact for evaluation (AE). Artefacts such as ancillary data, tools, and software will be assessed for availability, functionality, and reusability badges.

*   Instructions on how to upload artefacts can be found [here](https://www.discotec.org/2025/COORDINATION_Artefact_Evaluation_Guidelines.pdf).
*   Artefact submissions are mandatory for tool papers and optional for regular papers. Tool papers must submit an artefact that, at least, satisfies the requirements for the **Functional badge**. Papers not meeting this clause are rejected. Moreover, the acceptance of artefacts is conditional on the tool paper being accepted.
*   A selection of artefacts may be invited for submission to a special issue of Science of Computer Programming (SCP).

## Paper Submission Guidelines

*   **Language:** All paper submissions must be in **English**.
*   **Review Process:** All papers will undergo a **double-blind review** process by the Program Committee based on technical quality, relevance to DASFAA, originality, significance, and clarity.
*   **Electronic Submission:** All paper submissions will be handled electronically through the paper submission system: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DASFAA2025/Submission/Index](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DASFAA2025/Submission/Index).
    *   Please select the appropriate track during your submission.
*   **Formatting Requirements:**
    *   Submissions must include an abstract of up to **200 words**.
    *   Papers should be no longer than **16 pages** (including references, appendices, etc.) in **LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) format**.
    *   Accepted short research papers should be revised to a maximum of **10 pages** in the camera-ready version.
    *   Please use one of the following templates for the LNCS format: [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).
    *   Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be rejected without review.
*   **Originality:** Submitted papers must not have been previously published in a refereed journal or conference and must not be under consideration by any other conference or journal during the DASFAA review process.
*   **Citation:** Authors are encouraged to cite related work comprehensively. When citing conference papers, please also consider citing their extended journal versions if applicable.
*   **Presentation Requirement:** If a paper is accepted, at least one author must complete the **regular registration** and attend the conference to present the paper. Papers from no-show authors will not be included in the proceedings.
*   **Publication:** Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings.

## Double-Blind Review Policy

DASFAA-2025 will employ a double-blind reviewing process, meaning that the PC members and referees will not know the identity of the authors.

To ensure anonymity, authors **must** prepare their manuscript as follows:

*   **Author Information:** Author's names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.
*   **Funding Sources:** Funding sources must not be acknowledged on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.
*   **Acknowledgments:** Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.
*   **File Naming:** Source file naming must be done with care to avoid identifying the author's names in the paper's associated metadata (e.g., avoid `Jane-Smith.pdf`).
*   **Self-Citations:** Authors should refer to their prior work in the third person and include all relevant citations. Authors should make every effort to anonymize their work and, hence, **cannot cite their own arXiv work** (or other unrefereed pre-prints).
*   **Pre-prints:** Submissions having unrefereed pre-prints such as arXiv are allowed, but self-citation of such pre-prints is forbidden for anonymization.

> Submissions that do not follow the guidelines mentioned above, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection.

> Because of the double-blind review policy, the submission of an extended version of a short paper that has been published elsewhere is **strongly discouraged** in DASFAA-2025.

## Conflicts of Interest (COI)

Authors are required to use CMT's conflict management system to flag conflicts with members of the Program Committee (reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs) prior to the submission deadline.

**A conflict of interest exists if any of the following applies to X (an author) and Y (a PC member):**

*   **Employment:** X and Y have worked in the same university or company in the past two years, or will be doing so in the next six months on account of an accepted job offer. (Different campuses within the same university system do not count as the same university for this purpose).
*   **Co-authorship:** X has been a co-author of a paper with Y in the last three years.
*   **Collaboration:** X has been a collaborator within the past two years, as evidenced in a joint publication, joint research project, or co-organizing events (e.g., co-chairs of conferences), or are collaborating now (including co-authorship on papers not yet resulted in final publication).
*   **Advisor/Advisee:** X is the master's/PhD thesis advisor of Y or vice versa, irrespective of how long ago this was.
*   **Personal Relationship:** X is a relative or close personal friend of Y.

> It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify and declare all COIs with members of the Program Committee prior to the submission deadline. Submissions with undeclared conflicts or spurious conflicts will be desk-rejected.

## Paper Acceptance

A paper can be accepted as either a **full research paper** or a **short research paper**.

*   **Full Research Papers:** Authors are given the opportunity to present their work in oral sessions, and they also have the option to present in poster sessions.
*   **Short Research Papers:** Authors exclusively present their work in poster sessions. Additionally, the accepted short research papers should be revised to a maximum of **10 pages** in the camera-ready version.

## Anti-harassment Policy

EACSL strives to provide a welcoming, safe, and productive environment for all who attend our events, regardless of their personal characteristics. We do not tolerate any form of intimidation, harassment, or disrespectful conduct at our events. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. The event organisers may take further action, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, contact an event organiser immediately.

## Accommodation Notes

⚠️ **Important Warning:** It appears that CSL 2025 authors are receiving emails from reservation@g-travelexperts.com regarding travel to Amsterdam. Please be aware that this is **spam**, and there are no arrangements with this organisation.

Hotel rooms in Amsterdam are scarce due to the CISCO Live 2025 event taking place in the same week as CSL 2025. There are no hotels in the close vicinity of the conference site.

Three possible suggestions for booking a hotel:

1.  Take a hotel in the city center, close to the central railway station. From there, take a train to Amsterdam Science Park railway station (4 times per hour, takes 9 minutes), which is within walking distance of the conference site.
2.  Take a hotel close to Amstel railway station or Muiderpoort railway station, and use bus 40, which stops right in front of the conference site.
3.  Act like the Dutch, and rent a bike.

A good website for public transport information is `ov9292`.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Manuscripts must be prepared in accordance with the [IEEE format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html).
*   Research papers must not exceed **12 pages** not including the references. No appendix is allowed.
*   Only electronic submissions in **PDF format** will be considered.
*   A paper submitted to ICDE 2025 cannot be under review for any other conference or journal during the entire time it is considered for ICDE 2025. It must be substantially different from any previously published work. If an ICDE 2025 submission has overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication.
*   Any author of ICDE 2025 should not be a co-author of more than **10 submitted research papers** across the two submission rounds.
*   Submissions will be reviewed in a **single-blind manner**. Submissions that are rejected in the first round are not eligible for re-submission to the second round.
*   The best papers will be selected for submission as an extended version to be published in the **IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering (TKDE)**.
*   IEEE reserves the right to exclude a paper from distribution if none of the authors attend the conference to present their paper.

## Desk Rejection Policy

Submissions that don’t meet the following requirements may be rejected without review:

*   Following the guidelines and length requirements specified in the ICDE 2025 Call for Papers.
*   Being in scope of ICDE 2025 (aligning with at least one of the topic areas and relating to data management aspects).
*   Correctly declaring all conflicts of interest (COI) with members of the program committee. Both not reporting COIs as well as frivolously defining COIs count as a violation.

## Conflict of Interest (COI)

Authors must correctly declare all conflicts of interest with members of the program committee. The submission site will request information about COIs. Each author must create a CMT profile and complete it with domain and individual conflicts. Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information may be desk-rejected.

A paper submitted to ICDE 2025 must present original work not described in any prior publication that is more than 4 double-column pages in length. A prior publication is a paper that has been accepted for presentation at a refereed conference or workshop with proceedings; or an article that has been accepted for publication in a refereed journal. If an ICDE 2025 submission has overlap with a prior publication, the submission must cite the prior publication, along with all other relevant published work.

The definition of a COI includes co-authorship in the past three years, co-working in the same company or university within the past three years, collaborators within the past three years, thesis advisor relationships, and being a relative or close personal friend. A searchable spreadsheet of COIs is provided for convenience.

## Reviewing Process

Papers will be stringently reviewed with at least 3 reviews per paper, coordinated by a meta-reviewer. Papers may be invited to submit a revised version if the PC believes they can reasonably be improved within the allocated revision time frame. Revisions will go through an additional round of reviews before a final decision.

## Inclusions and Diversity in Writing

We value Diversity and Inclusion. Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing.

*   X has been a co-author of Y for 4 (or more) publications in the last 10 years.
*   X has been a co-worker of Y in the same company or university within the past three years.
*   X has been a collaborator of Y within the past three years (e.g., held a joint grant).
*   X is or was Y’s primary thesis advisor or vice versa, no matter how long ago.
*   X is a relative or a close personal friend of Y (or vice versa).

The onus for correctly declaring COIs rests with the authors who must submit their complete set of COIs for a submission to be considered for review.

## Reviewing Process

The International Conference on Model-Based Software and Systems Engineering provides a platform for participants from all over the world to present research results and application experience in using model-based techniques for developing all sorts of systems. Model-based software engineering has emerged over many years as an approach for developing IT systems in which models take a central role, not only for the analysis of these systems but also for their construction. More recently, a similar approach has become increasingly widely used not only for software systems, but also for physical, cyber-physical and business systems. This model-based software and systems engineering approach relies on an increasingly rich ecosystem of techniques, languages and tools. MODELSWARD is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners alike to come together and discuss, moving this ecosystem forward.

It focuses on new ideas, paradigms, and reflections on programming and software, welcoming radical and visionary concepts with a degree of validation.","# Onward! Papers: Call for Papers

Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software, including processes, methods, languages, communities, and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching, and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.

## The Character of Onward! Papers

Onward! Papers seeks **grand visions and new paradigms** that could significantly impact future software development. Unlike conferences like OOPSLA, which require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

## Selection Process

Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a **double-blind manner**. Submissions will be judged on the potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation. A two-phase review process is employed, allowing for revisions to promising papers.

## Introduction

Declarative languages, including functional, logic, and constraint programming, have sound theoretical bases and attractive frameworks for application development, with successful applications in various real-world situations. PADL is a well-established forum for researchers and practitioners to present original work emphasizing novel applications and implementation techniques for all forms of declarative programming.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   Innovative applications of declarative languages
*   Declarative domain-specific languages and applications
*   Practical applications of theoretical results
*   New language developments and their impact on applications
*   Declarative languages and software engineering
*   Evaluation of implementation techniques on practical applications
*   Practical experiences and industrial applications
*   Novel uses of declarative languages in the classroom
*   Practical extensions such as constraint-based, probabilistic, and reactive languages

The ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial Evaluation and Program Manipulation (PEPM) has a history going back to 1991 and has been held in conjunction with POPL every year since 2006. PEPM focuses on semantics-based program manipulation, covering automated techniques for evaluating programs with partial input, and broader areas of systematic program generation, analysis, and transformation while maintaining semantic properties.

PEPM 2025 is co-located with POPL 2025 and will be held on **January 21, 2025**, in **Denver, Colorado, United States**.

## Scope

In addition to traditional PEPM topics, PEPM 2025 welcomes submissions in new domains, in particular:

*   Semantics-based and machine-learning-based program synthesis and program optimization.
*   Modeling, analysis, and transformation techniques for distributed and concurrent protocols and programs, such as session types, linear types, and contract specifications.

More generally, topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   **Program and model manipulation techniques:** supercompilation, partial evaluation, fusion, on-the-fly program adaptation, active libraries, program inversion, slicing, symbolic execution, refactoring, decompilation, and obfuscation.
*   **Techniques treating programs/models as data objects:** metaprogramming, generative programming, embedded domain-specific languages (DSLs), program synthesis by sketching and inductive programming, staged computation, and model-driven program generation and transformation.
*   **Program analysis techniques for manipulation:** abstract interpretation, termination checking, binding-time analysis, constraint solving, type systems, automated testing and test case generation.
*   **Applications:** case studies of program manipulation in real-world projects, descriptions of robust tools, DSL implementations, visual languages, end-user programming, scientific computing, middleware, embedded and resource-limited computation, and security.

Questions regarding the scope can be directed to the program co-chairs: Guillaume Allais (guillaume.allais@strath.ac.uk) and Annie Liu (liu@cs.stonybrook.edu).

## Symposium Event Changes

Due to venue limitations and costs, each accepted paper will have:
*   A short talk presentation (e.g., 5-7 minutes).
*   A poster presentation immediately following the talk session.
All accepted papers are required to present both a short talk and a poster.

## Instructions for Paper Submission

*   Submissions must be original work, with any overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers clearly documented.
*   Simultaneous submission of the same paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal is not allowed.
*   Any author may not submit more than 6 papers per cycle.

## Anonymous Submission

*   Papers must be submitted in a form suitable for anonymous review. No author names or affiliations should appear on the title page, and authors should avoid revealing their identity in the text.
*   Avoid references to your university or institution by name, use generalities like ""our university"".
*   Do not include acknowledgments that help identify authors.
*   Refer to previous work in the third person, without identifying yourselves. If a third-person reference is infeasible, blind the reference itself.
*   Artifacts repositories should not identify authors.
*   Papers that are not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors must identify any potential conflicts of interest with PC members during submission. Conflicts include co-authorship, working in the same company/university within the past two years, collaboration within the past two years, being a thesis advisor/advisee, or close personal friendship.

## Research Ethics Committee (REC)

Papers flagged by reviewers for potentially ethically fraught research will be reviewed by the REC. The REC may suggest rejection on ethical grounds.

## Ethical Considerations for Vulnerability Disclosure

Where research identifies a vulnerability, authors are expected to act in a way that avoids gratuitous harm. Disclosure to vendors is encouraged, with a typical disclosure window of 45 to 90 days ahead of publication.

Submitted papers must discuss steps taken to address vulnerabilities. CVE identifiers should not be included in the submitted paper to preserve anonymity.

## Ethical Considerations for Human Subjects Research

Submissions involving human subjects must disclose IRB approval/waiver status and discuss steps taken to ensure ethical treatment of participants.

## Financial and Non-financial Competing Interests

Authors must declare any competing financial and/or non-financial interests in the camera-ready versions of their papers.

## Page Limit and Formatting

*   Submitted papers may include up to **13 pages of text** and up to **5 pages for references and appendices** (totaling no more than 18 pages).
*   All text and figures past page 13 must be clearly marked as part of the appendix.
*   Papers must be formatted for US letter size paper.
*   Submissions must use the IEEE “compsoc” conference proceedings template. LaTeX submissions must use `IEEEtran.cls` version 1.8b with options “conference,compsoc.”.
*   Papers that fail to use the correct template, modify margins, font, or line spacing, or use egregious space scrunching are subject to rejection without review.

## Withdrawing Policy

A paper can be withdrawn at any point before reviews are sent to authors. After reviews are sent, withdrawal is not permitted.

## Authorship Policy

Changes to the authorship list are not permitted during submission. Post-acceptance changes require TPC Chair approval.

## ORCID Requirement

All authors are required to submit an ORCID number at paper submission time. Papers without ORCID numbers for all authors will be desk rejected.

## Conference Submission Server

Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf).

*   First deadline submissions: [https://cycle1.sp2026.ieee-security.org/](https://cycle1.sp2026.ieee-security.org/)

## Publication and Presentation

One of the authors of an accepted paper is expected to register and present the paper at the conference.

The event will feature regular presentations, workshops, tutorials, and keynote speeches.","# Call for Papers: TrustCom 2024

As computer systems, communication networks, and artificial intelligence (AI) undergo rapid development, accompanied by increasing complexity, user expectations for trust, security, and privacy have grown considerably. This presents a significant challenge, as traditional security technologies and measures may struggle to meet evolving demands in open, dynamic, heterogeneous, mobile, wireless, and distributed computing environments. Consequently, the imperative is to construct systems and networks that enable users to access more comprehensive services while concurrently upholding trust, security, and privacy. In response, trusted computing and communications have emerged as pivotal and innovative technologies, capturing heightened researcher interest.

The IEEE TrustCom-2024 (23rd IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications) is a forum for presenting leading works on trusted computing, communications, networking, and machine learning, with regard to trust, security, privacy, reliability, dependability, survivability, availability, and fault tolerance aspects of computer systems and networks, as well as AI.

TrustCom-2024 will be hosted in Sanya, China, and will feature sessions of regular presentations, workshops, tutorials, and keynote speeches. Accepted papers will be submitted for possible inclusion into IEEE Xplore, subject to meeting IEEE Xplore's scope and quality requirements. Authors of selected best papers will be invited post-conference to extend their contributions for special issues of prestigious journals.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

CSF 2026 employs double-blind reviewing. Submissions must:

1.  Omit author names and affiliations.
2.  Reference the authors’ own related work in the third person (e.g., ""We build on the work of ..."" instead of ""We build on our previous work ..."").
*   Do not omit or anonymize important background references.
*   Refer to the [FAQ](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/conferences/csf2018/faq.html) for more information.

## Major Revisions

Papers with a ""major revision"" decision must be resubmitted within the following two cycles with a writeup explaining how revision requirements are met. These papers can use 16 pages and must still be anonymized. They should be submitted as a new paper marked ""major revision"", referencing the previous submission. Decisions for resubmitted revisions are ""accept"" (possibly with shepherding) or ""reject"".

## Resubmissions of Rejected Papers

Rejected papers can be resubmitted. If resubmitted within 11 months of the last deadline, reviews and an explanation of how concerns were addressed must be submitted as supplementary material. Otherwise, they are reviewed as new submissions. All resubmissions must follow regular submission instructions, including page limits and anonymization.

## Submission Categories

MPLR accepts three types of submissions:

1.  **Regular research papers:** Describing novel contributions involving managed language platforms. Papers will be evaluated based on their relevance, novelty, technical rigor, and contribution to the state-of-the-art. (Format: up to **12 pages**, excluding bibliography and appendix).
2.  **Work-in-progress research papers:** Describing hot topics or promising new ideas, with perhaps less maturity than full papers. Papers will be evaluated with an emphasis on novelty and the potential of new ideas. (Format: up to **6 pages**, excluding bibliography and appendix).
3.  **Industry and tool papers:** Presenting technical challenges and solutions for managed language platforms in the context of deployed applications and systems. Papers will be evaluated on their relevance, usefulness, and results. Suitability for demonstration and availability will also be considered. (Format: up to **6 pages**, excluding bibliography and appendix; up to **12 pages** allowed if justified).

Accepted submissions will be published in the ACM Digital Library, unless authors prefer not to be included.

MPLR 2025 submissions must conform to the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions and to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy. See http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication

## Author Instructions

*   Submissions need to use the ACM SIGPLAN format with the `sigplan` style.
*   Use the `acmart` document class with the `sigplan` option (not `sigconf`). Refer to `samples/sample-sigplan.tex` for guidance. On Overleaf, change the documentclass option `manuscript` to `sigplan`.
*   For ease of reviewing, please include page numbers in your submission using `\settopmatter{printfolios=true}`.
*   All submissions need to be in **PDF format**.
*   MPLR uses **double-blind reviewing**. Authors should not show their names on a submission and should refer to their own work in the third person. Avoid publicizing the work while it is under review.
*   Ensure legibility when printed on a black and white printer (distinct colors, legible font sizes).

The OOPSLA issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (PACMPL) welcomes papers focusing on all practical and theoretical investigations of programming systems, languages, and environments. Papers may target any stage of software development, including requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, and reuse of software systems. Contributions may include the development of new tools, techniques, principles, and evaluations.

OOPSLA 2025 will have **two rounds of reviewing**. New papers may be submitted to either round. Papers accepted in either round will be published in the 2025 volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA) and invited to present at the SPLASH conference in 2025.

## What’s New

*   **Reserve Reviewer Policy**
*   **Data-Availability Statement**

## Contact

You can reach the two Review Committee Chairs (Shriram and Sukyoung) through this email: [oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com](mailto:oopsla-2025-rc-chairs@googlegroups.com). Please allow 1–2 working days for a response, and longer right around deadlines. In your email, please mention the number of the paper you are writing about (if you have one) to facilitate tracking.

## Review Process

PACMPL(OOPSLA) employs two rounds of reviewing. Each paper will typically receive three or more reviews, and authors will have an opportunity to respond to these reviews before decisions are finalized.

At the end of each round, each paper will receive one of the five following decisions:

*   **Accept:** Your paper will appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA).
*   **Reject:** Your paper will not appear in the upcoming volume of PACMPL(OOPSLA). A resubmission in less than a year from the original submission is not guaranteed a review if judged substantially similar.
*   **Conditional Accept:** Specific required revisions are needed.
*   **Minor Revision:** Several concerns need to be addressed, potentially requiring specific revisions and broader comments.
*   **Major Revision:** Significant concerns requiring substantial revisions and broader comments, potentially taking longer to execute.

If you receive a Conditional Accept, Minor Revision, or Major Revision decision:

*   There is no restriction on when you can submit your revision.
*   You must submit a clear explanation of how your revision addresses comments, and, if possible, a diff of the PDFs.
*   Submissions will be reviewed by the same reviewers to the extent possible.
*   Unless explicitly withdrawn, your paper is considered under review, and submitting it elsewhere would violate policy.
*   Maintain submission anonymity. If violation is necessary to respond to reviews, discuss with the Chairs first.
*   Conditionally Accepted papers will be invited to submit artifacts for evaluation. Acceptance of artifacts has no impact on paper acceptance.
*   Only **Accepted** and **Conditionally Accepted** papers can submit artifacts for evaluation, as revisions often affect artifacts.

## Reserve Reviewer Policy

To uphold high review standards and manage review loads, for each paper, at least one **senior author** must register as a reserve reviewer on [TPMS](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/TPMS/), unless exempt.

**Instructions:** Log into TPMS with your HotCRP email. Upload or provide URLs for 5-10 of your previous papers to inform reviewer matching, prioritizing depth, breadth, and rare expertise.

**Definition of Senior Author:** Completed their PhD five or more years ago.

**Exemptions:** A paper is exempt if:

*   It has no senior authors.
*   At least one senior author is already in the RC for this conference.
*   Every senior author satisfies one or more of these criteria:
    *   Is new to SIGPLAN (never published in it before).
    *   Is chairing a SIGPLAN conference with 150+ submissions last year, this year, or next year.
    *   Has other exceptional circumstances preventing reviewing, cleared with RC Chairs at least three days before submission.

One person may serve as a reserve reviewer for multiple papers; enter their information identically for each.

## Submission Guidelines

### Template

Use SPLASH’s PACMPL templates and instructions available on the [SIGPLAN author information page](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/). Papers should begin with:

```
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review]{acmart}
```

### Page Limit

*   **Initial submissions** must be at most **23 pages** using the template. This limit excludes required statements, references, or supplementary material. Papers must be self-contained; reviewers are not obliged to read supplementary material.
*   **Revisions** (including papers from 2024, and final camera-ready papers) can go up to a maximum of **25 pages**. There will be no option to purchase additional pages.

### Anonymity

PACMPL uses **double-blind reviewing**, meaning authors’ identities are only revealed if a paper is accepted. Your papers must:

*   Omit author names and institutions.
*   Use the third person when referencing your own work (e.g., ""We extend Smith’s [2004] work on statically typed toads."" instead of ""We extend our earlier work on statically typed toads [Smith 2004]"").
*   Anonymize supplementary material.
*   Suppress acknowledgments entirely until camera-ready.
*   Avoid linking to webpages in your anonymized paper.
*   Disguise or remove document properties (e.g., author name) from PDF files.

> Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs.

> If your system is not new and likely known, refer to it as if created by a third party.

> If your submission is based on code in a public repository, cite the code but replace the URL with ""link removed for double-blind review"". For reviewer access during author response, contact the Review Committee Chairs.

> If submitting an extension of a workshop paper, anonymize references to that work and change the paper title to break a direct link.

### Novelty

Papers must describe unpublished work not currently submitted for publication elsewhere, as per [SIGPLAN’s Re-Publication Policy](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/). Submitters should also be aware of [ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-detection-policy) and comply with [ACM’s Policies for Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship).

### Data-Availability Statement

Add a section titled **""Data-Availability Statement""** just before references in the initial submission. This will not count towards the page limit but should be limited to at most a few paragraphs (usually one suffices).

In this statement, indicate whether an artifact exists, its nature and limitations, and whether it will be submitted for Artifact Evaluation. This section can include links to preliminary versions of (anonymized) artifacts, datasets, etc., that reviewers *may* find useful (but are not obligated to follow).

> It is understood that some papers have no artifacts; in such cases, explain why. The absence of such an explanation can be cause for rejection.

> Accepted papers that fail to provide an artifact after promising one will be asked to explain the omission.

Artifact Evaluation submission will closely follow paper notification, so review the [Artifact Call](https://2025.splashcon.org/track/splash-2025-oopsla-artifacts) as soon as you submit your paper.

### Procedure

Submit your paper using [HotCRP](https://oopsla2425.hotcrp.com/).

## Publication

PAPMPL is a **Gold Open Access journal**, meaning all papers will be freely available to the public. Authors can voluntarily cover the article processing charge (**USD 400**), but payment is not required.

The official publication date is when the journal is available in the ACM Digital Library. Round 1 accepted papers (OOPSLA1) will be published no earlier than **April 1, 2025**, and Round 2 accepted papers (OOPSLA2) no earlier than **October 1, 2025**. This date affects patent filings related to published work.

## ACM Policies

By submitting, you acknowledge that you and your co-authors are subject to all [ACM Publications Policies](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies), including ACM’s new [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects). Alleged violations may lead to paper retraction and other penalties.

Ensure you and your co-authors obtain an [ORCID iD](https://authors.acm.org/author-resources/orcid-faqs) to complete the publishing process, aiding author discoverability and attribution.

The [updated ACM Authorship Policy](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship) addresses the use of generative AI, clarifies authorship criteria and responsibilities, and defines prohibited behaviors like gift, ghost, or purchased authorship.

## FAQ

### What are reviewers looking for?

Reviewers consider the following criteria:

*   **Novelty:** Presents new ideas and results, properly contextualized within existing research.
*   **Importance:** Contributes to the advancement of knowledge in the field, including work that diverges from dominant trajectories.
*   **Evidence:** Provides sufficient support for claims (e.g., proofs, implemented systems, experimental results, statistical analyses, user studies, case studies, anecdotes).
*   **Clarity:** Contributions, methodology, and results are presented clearly.

### How are papers from previous years handled?

For resubmissions from previous OOPSLA years, the same timeline applies. The organizers attempt to assign the same reviewers and strongly discourage reviewers from issuing another ""major revision"" decision.

### Are artifacts required?

No. It is understood that some papers have no artifacts. However, if the paper's content and claims suggest an artifact should exist, authors must explain why one will not be provided. Lack of such an explanation can lead to rejection.

### Can a paper be accepted if the artifact is rejected?

Yes. Artifacts may be rejected for reasons unrelated to research results (e.g., packaging issues).

### Am I allowed to post my paper on my web page or arXiv, send it to colleagues, give a talk about it, mention it on social media, …?

The goal is to balance scientific communication with preventing potential reviewers from learning author identities. You may discuss work under submission, but avoid broadly advertising it through media likely to reach your reviewers. When in doubt, contact the Review Committee Chairs for guidance.

**Things you may do:**

*   Put your submission on your home page, arXiv, or other pre-publication sites.
*   Discuss your work with anyone not on the review committees or reviewers with whom you already have a conflict.
*   Present your work at professional meetings, job interviews, etc.
*   Submit work previously discussed at an informal workshop, previously posted on a pre-publication site, or previously submitted to a conference not using double-blind reviewing.

**Things you should not do:**

*   Contact members of the review committee about your work, or deliberately present your work where you expect them to be.
*   Publicize your work on social media in an identifiable way with broad settings (e.g., describing the work or giving its title). A general post about paper submission is acceptable.

Work that explores the interface to related areas such as computer architecture, networking, programming languages, analytics, and databases is also welcome. Contributions with highly original ideas, new approaches, and groundbreaking results are encouraged.

## Submitting a Paper

Submissions will be judged on novelty, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness. Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process by a member of the program committee.

A good paper will:

*   Motivate a significant problem
*   Propose an interesting and compelling solution
*   Demonstrate the practicality and benefits of the solution
*   Draw appropriate conclusions
*   Clearly describe the paper's contributions
*   Clearly articulate the advances beyond previous work

### Submission Scope and Relevance

The OSDI steering committee, in maintaining a three-decade tradition of a single-track program, is committed to deepening discussions on key computer systems topics. Starting from OSDI '25, there will be a deliberate focus on selecting papers that offer significant contributions to computer systems research and align with community interests. Reviewers will evaluate submissions based on the topic relevance to computer systems and their potential to impact future research and practices in computer systems. Additionally, submissions must demonstrate relevance and offer unique insights to capture the interest of a substantial portion of OSDI attendees. By adhering to these criteria, OSDI aims to continue its legacy by focusing on innovative research that addresses pressing needs in the computer systems field.

## Submission Instructions

*   **Paper Length:** No longer than 12 single-spaced 8.5"" x 11"" pages, including figures and tables, plus as many pages as needed for references. Use 10-point type on 12-point (single-spaced) leading, two-column format, Times Roman or a similar font, within a text block 7"" wide x 9"" deep.
*   **Accepted Paper Length:** Accepted papers will be allowed 14 pages in the proceedings, plus references.
*   **Formatting:** Papers not meeting the criteria will be rejected without review. Pages should be numbered, and figures and tables should be legible in black and white, without requiring magnification.
*   **Supplementary Material:** Authors may upload supplementary material in files separate from their submissions. PC members are not required to read supplementary material. Each paper must stand alone without it.
*   **Anonymity:** The paper review process is double-blind. Authors must make a good-faith effort to anonymize their submissions and should not identify themselves or their institutions either explicitly or by implication.
*   **Abstract Registration:** Registering abstracts a week before paper submission is essential for PC members to identify qualified reviewers. Abstracts that do not provide sufficient information will be rejected, precluding paper submission.
*   **Conflicts:** Authors must provide information about conflicts with PC members when registering their abstract.
*   **Simultaneous Submission:** Simultaneous submission of the same work to multiple venues, submission of previously published work, or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty or fraud.
*   **Prior/Concurrent Publication:** Prior or concurrent workshop publication does not preclude publishing a related paper in OSDI. Prior or concurrent publication in non-peer-reviewed contexts, like arXiv.org, is permitted, but your OSDI submission must use an anonymized name for your project or system.
*   **Remote Presentation:** For very special circumstances, USENIX may provide the possibility of remote presentation and Q&A.
*   **Visa Applications:** If you need an invitation letter for a visa, contact conference@usenix.org as soon as possible.

**Submit papers via the [submission system](https://osdi25.usenix.hotcrp.com/).**

*   Papers must be at most **9 pages** of technical content (10pt font, 2-column format), including text, figures, and tables, and up to **1 additional page for references only**.

## Review Process

*   PerCom 2026 introduces a **rebuttal phase**. Authors are offered the opportunity to respond to the initial reviews. Particularly, they are encouraged to briefly clarify points, explain misunderstandings, etc.
*   Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous review process handled by the Technical Program Committee.

## Publication and Awards

*   The best paper will receive the prestigious **Mark Weiser Best Paper Award**.
*   Selected papers will be invited to submit extended versions for a **special issue of the Pervasive and Mobile Computing Journal**.
*   Accepted papers will be published in **IEEE Xplore**.
*   All accepted papers will be invited to submit an artifact abstract providing the code, data, results, etc. associated with the contribution.

## Community Engagement

*   All accepted papers **must be presented** in person by one of the authors, in addition to having an associated full registration.
*   Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the exclusion of the paper from the final proceedings and from the IEEE Digital Library, and the paper will not be eligible for the Best Paper Award.
*   Authors are strongly advised to be prepared to apply for their visa (if required for entry into Italy) as soon as their paper is accepted.
*   Remote presentations and pre-recorded videos are not allowed unless all authors of an accepted paper are under special circumstances that prevent them from attending the conference in person. Requests for such exceptions will be considered carefully by the organizing committees. We are sympathetic to concerns and sentiments about our in-person focus. We will accommodate remote authors/speakers if they have Visa-related travel or COVID/health-related travel issues on case-by-case basis.

## Publication and Open Access

ACM's upcoming transition to Open Access, effective January 1, 2026, means all ACM publications, including those from ACM-sponsored conferences, will be 100% Open Access. Authors will have two primary options for publishing Open Access articles with ACM: the ACM Open institutional model or by paying Article Processing Charges (APCs).

*   **ACM Open Participants:** Most ACM-sponsored conference papers will not require APCs from authors or conferences.
    *   List of participating institutions in ACM Open: [https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/open-participants](https://libraries.acm.org/acmopen/open-participants)
*   **Non-ACM Open Participants:** Authors from institutions not participating in ACM Open will need to pay an APC, unless they qualify for a waiver.
    *   APC Waivers and Discounts Policy: [https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/policy-on-open-access-apc-waivers-and-discounts](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/policy-on-open-access-apc-waivers-and-discounts)

## Temporary Subsidy for 2026

To ease the transition, ACM has approved a temporary subsidy for 2026:

*   **$250 APC for ACM/SIG members**
*   **$350 for non-members**

This represents a 65% discount, funded directly by ACM. Authors are encouraged to advocate for their institutions to join ACM Open.

## Anti-Harassment Policy

SIGMOD 2026 adheres to the ACM Policy Against Harassment. Any participant who experiences unacceptable behavior may contact any current member of the SIGMOD Executive Committee, the PODS Executive Committee, or DBCares. Concerns will be kept in strict confidence.
