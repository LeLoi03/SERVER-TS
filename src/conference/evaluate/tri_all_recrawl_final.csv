The 28th ACM SIGCHI Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing (CSCW) will be held in **Bergen, Norway on October 18 â€” 22, 2025**. CSCW is the premier venue for human-centered research in the design, use, and evaluation of technologies that support or affect social, cooperative, and collaborative practices in groups, organizations, communities, and networks.

## Scope

CSCW invites contributions across a variety of human-centered research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains. Papers are expected to report on novel results from human-centered research discussing the design, development, use, and/or analysis of CSCW and social computing systems; or introduce new human-centered approaches to the conceptualization or critical analysis of such systems. Submissions exploring how computing technologies â€” including those linked to recent developments in AI, machine learning, robotics, and AR/VR â€” relate to questions of race, indigeneity, gender, and the environment are particularly encouraged, providing they are properly contextualized within cooperative, collaborative, or social computing issues.

Key areas of interest include:

*   Social and crowd computing.
*   CSCW and social computing system development.
*   Methodologies and tools.
*   Critical, historical, ethnographic analyses.
*   Empirical investigations.
*   Domain-specific social, cooperative, and collaborative applications.
*   Ethics and policy implications.
*   CSCW and social computing systems based on emerging technologies.
*   Crossing boundaries.
