The conference focuses on coordination models and languages for modern information systems, addressing the complexity of concurrent, distributed, mobile, and adaptive components.","# Call for Papers: COORDINATION 2025

The **27th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages (COORDINATION 2025)** is one of the three conferences of [DisCoTec 2025](https://www.discotec.org/2025/). It will be held from **June 16-20, 2025**.

Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today’s software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, providing abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, thus increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and enhancing software development. This conference provides a well-established forum for researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) coordination related aspects of:

*   Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: component composition, concurrency, distribution, mobility; dynamic, spatial and probabilistic aspects of coordination; logic, types, semantics.
*   Coordination of multi-agent and collective systems: models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour.
*   Coordination and modern distributed computing: web services, microservices, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing, reversible computing.
*   Session-based programming: models, languages, behavioural types, and tools.
*   Models, languages, verification techniques and tools for interacting smart contracts and (blockchain-based) decentralised applications.
*   Languages, methodologies and tools for secure coordination.
*   Cybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to cybersecurity.
*   Nature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination.
*   Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties, including performance and security aspects.
*   Dynamic software architectures: distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, parallel, high-performance and cloud computing.
*   Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application domains, like IoT, fog- and edge-computing.
*   Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the development and verification of coordinated applications, including DevOps approaches.
*   Coordination in business process management: coordination models for business process management, process mining techniques and tools for coordination models.
*   Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and coordination models, industry-driven efforts in coordination and case studies.
*   Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination.

## Submission Categories

*   **Regular papers** (12-18 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission. Companion artefacts to regular submissions will be reviewed by the Artefact Evaluation Committee, but the acceptance of the paper is decoupled from the acceptance of the artefact (does not depend on it). The acceptance of the artefact, however, is conditional to the acceptance of the paper.
*   **Survey papers** (16-25 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing important results and success stories related to the topics of COORDINATION.
*   **Tool papers** (4-15 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. Tool papers should provide a clear account of the tool’s functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities possibly with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle, and, when applicable, report on realistic case studies (possibly providing a rigorous experimental evaluation). Tool papers may also provide an account of the theoretical foundations, including relevant citations, and present design and implementation concerns, possibly including software architecture and core data structures. Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly describe the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool, possibly providing data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. In addition, the tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation. Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted. The artefact will be evaluated by a dedicated committee. Papers may contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes length.

## Artefact Submission Instructions

We invite you to also submit an associated artefact for evaluation (AE). Artefacts such as ancillary data, tools, and software will be assessed for availability, functionality, and reusability badges.

*   Instructions on how to upload artefacts can be found [here](https://www.discotec.org/2025/COORDINATION_Artefact_Evaluation_Guidelines.pdf).
*   Artefact submissions are mandatory for tool papers and optional for regular papers. Tool papers must submit an artefact that, at least, satisfies the requirements for the **Functional badge**. Papers not meeting this clause are rejected. Moreover, the acceptance of artefacts is conditional on the tool paper being accepted.
*   A selection of artefacts may be invited for submission to a special issue of Science of Computer Programming (SCP).

The ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW) is the premier venue for human-centered research in the design, use, and evaluation of technologies that support or affect social, cooperative, and collaborative practices in groups, organizations, communities, and networks.

CSCW 2026 will explore topics across sociotechnical domains including work, home, education, healthcare, the arts, design, entertainment, and ethics, with a particular focus on social computing and social media, crowdsourcing, and technologies for co-located or remote collaboration, communication, education, work articulation, coordination, awareness, and information sharing.

Submissions are expected to report on novel results from human-centered research discussing the design, development, use, and/or analysis of CSCW and social computing systems. New human-centered approaches to the conceptualization or critical analysis of such systems are also welcome.

Submissions exploring how computing technologies—including AI, machine learning, robotics, and AR/VR—relate to questions of race, indigeneity, gender, and the environment are particularly encouraged, provided they are properly contextualized within cooperative, collaborative, or social computing issues.

## Scope Guidelines

*   Contributions must have a focus on **social aspects of technology mediation** and be properly contextualized in the CSCW literature, referencing CSCW concepts and/or theories.
*   Papers whose research contributions are primarily of relevance or benefit to **individual users** will be considered out of scope.
*   Systems-based or algorithmic research not explicitly involving aspects of cooperative, collaborative, or social computing are also out of scope.

Authors should clearly state how their work builds upon, bridges, discusses, or cites prior CSCW work and offers new knowledge for the CSCW community, and how the results are useful for thinking about the design of computing technologies to support cooperative/collaborative work or social interactions.

## Topics of Interest

*   **Social and crowd computing:** Social media, social networking, wikis, blogs, online gaming, crowdsourcing, collective intelligence, virtual worlds, collaborative information behaviors.
*   **CSCW and social computing system development:** Hardware, architectures, infrastructures, interaction design, technical foundations, algorithms, toolkits for building social and collaborative systems.
*   **Methodologies and tools:** Novel human-centered methods, approaches, and tools for building or studying collaborative systems.
*   **Critical, historical, ethnographic analyses:** Studies of technologically enabled social, cooperative, and collaborative practices, including their political or ethical dimensions.
*   **Empirical investigations:** Findings, guidelines, and studies of social practices, communication, cooperation, collaboration, or use related to CSCW and social technologies.
*   **Domain-specific applications:** Healthcare, transportation, design, manufacturing, gaming, ICT4D, sustainability, education, accessibility, global collaboration.
*   **Ethics and policy implications:** Analysis of the implications of sociotechnical systems and algorithms.
*   **Emerging technologies:** Mobile and ubiquitous computing, game engines, virtual worlds, multi-touch, novel display technologies, vision and gesture recognition, big data, MOOCs, crowd labor markets, SNSs, computer-aided or robotically-supported work, sensing systems.
*   **Crossing boundaries:** Studies exploring interactions across fields of research, disciplines, distances, languages, generations, and cultures.

The Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging (SASHIMI) workshop, a MICCAI 2025 Workshop, is jointly organized with the SynthRAD2025 Challenge ([https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/](https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/)) and held in conjunction with MICCAI 2025 ([https://conferences.miccai.org/2025/en/](https://conferences.miccai.org/2025/en/)). Previous SASHIMI proceedings are available on [SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/conference/sashimi).

## About SASHIMI

The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) community needs data with known ground truth to develop, evaluate, and validate computerized image analytic tools, as well as to facilitate clinical training. Synthetic data are ideally suited for this purpose. Another motivation to generate synthetic data is to improve the generalizability of deep learning and machine learning algorithms that are affected by domain shift issues.

The goal of the Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging (SASHIMI) workshop is to bring together all those interested in such problems in order to engage in invigorating research, discuss current approaches, and stimulate new ideas and scientific directions in this field.

## Objectives

The objectives are to:

1.  Bring together experts on image synthesis to raise the state of the art.
2.  Hear from invited speakers outside of the MICCAI community, for example in the areas of transfer learning, generative adversarial networks, or variational autoencoders, to cross-fertilize these fields.
3.  Identify challenges and opportunities for further research.
4.  Identify the suitable approaches to evaluate the plausibility of synthetic data and to collect benchmark data that could help with the development of future algorithms.

## Topics

The workshop focuses on models underpinning image simulation and synthesis, including:

*   Deep learning methods (fully-supervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, unsupervised, transfer, and multi-task learning)
*   Deep learning model architectures (Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), Flows, Transformers, etc.)
*   Machine learning methods using hand-crafted features
*   Detailed mechanistic models (top–down)
*   Complex spatio-temporal computational models of anatomical variability, organ physiology, and morphological changes in tissues or disease progression
*   Applications of synthetic images (improving image quality, segmentation, tracking, detection, registration, etc.)

## Keynote Speaker

**Can Zhao**, senior research scientist at NVIDIA

*   Keynote Title: **MAISI: A Foundation Model for Accelerated, Anatomy-Aware High-Resolution 3D CT Synthesis** ([https://research.nvidia.com/person/can-zhao](https://research.nvidia.com/person/can-zhao))

## SynthRAD2025 Challenge

SASHIMI 2025 will host the SynthRAD2025 Challenge ([https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/](https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/)). The challenge focuses on synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT to enable MRI-only radiation therapy and adaptive MRI- or CBCT-based radiotherapy. Participants will develop AI models using a large multi-center dataset. The winning teams will present their solution at SASHIMI 2025.

## Author Responses

Authors of papers that receive “Revision” decisions will have the opportunity to submit a revised version of their papers. The authors are required to provide a response letter that (1) explains how the comments have been tackled, (2) provides answers to the questions posed by reviewers.

## Paper Submission

All submissions must be in PDF format and conform, at time of submission, to the official “ACM Primary Article Template”, which can be obtained from the ACM Proceedings Template Page. LaTeX users should use the sigconf option, as well as the review (to produce line numbers for easy reference by the reviewers) and anonymous (omitting author names) options.

All submissions must not exceed the specified page limits. The purchase of additional pages in the proceedings is not allowed.

Submissions must strictly conform to the ACM conference proceedings formatting instructions specified above. Alterations of spacing, font size, and other changes that deviate from the instructions may result in desk rejection without further review.

### Anonymization

The SEAMS 2026 Research Track will use a lightweight double- anonymous review process. No submission may reveal its authors’ identities. In particular:

*   Authors’ names must be omitted from the submission.
*   All references to the author’s prior work should be in the third person.
*   While authors have the right to upload preprints on ArXiV or similar sites, they must avoid specifying that the manuscript was submitted to SEAMS 2026.
*   During review, authors should not publicly use the submission title. They should thus use a different paper title for any pre-print in ArXiV or similar websites.
*   Additional material published online should be anonymized and should not provide references to the paper’s authors.
*   All communication with the program committee must go through the program committee chairs. Do not contact individual program committee members regarding your submission.

## Ethics and Policies

By submitting to SEAMS, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the [ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism) and the [IEEE Plagiarism FAQ](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee/org/about/corporate/governance/p9-26.pdf).

Submissions must follow the latest policies from IEEE and ACM (“IEEE Submission and Peer Review Policy” and “ACM Policy on Authorship”, with associated FAQ), which includes a policy specific to the use of generative AI tools and technologies, such as ChatGPT.

In particular, papers submitted to SEAMS 2026 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for SEAMS 2026.

If the research involves human participants/subjects, the authors must adhere to the [ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

## Call for Papers

We invite submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results on software engineering for self-adaptive and self-managing systems, across the broad spectrum of topics of interest listed below.

To celebrate 20 successful past editions of SEAMS, we are inviting submissions to a special category of papers called Future of Self-Adaptive Systems (SAS). Submissions are encouraged for papers that reflect on past SEAMS research and present a bold, ambitious vision for the field in the next 10 to 20 years.
