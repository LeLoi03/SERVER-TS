Hosted by National Taiwan Normal University and Taipei ACM SIGGRAPH, the conference aims to promote visualization research and technologies, especially in the Asian-Pacific region. PacificVis 2025 accepts various scientific contributions, including full research papers, short papers, posters, and participation in workshops and contests.","# PacificVis 2025: Call for Papers

**IEEE PacificVis 2025** solicits novel research contributions and innovative applications in all areas of visualization. PacificVis is a unified visualization conference covering topics including visualization techniques and systems, interactions, analytics and decision support, theoretical contributions to visualization, empirical studies, and visualization applications in domains such as (but not limited to) biological sciences, education, machine learning, physical sciences, security, and social science.

**IEEE PacificVis 2025** will be held in **Taipei, Taiwan** on **April 22–25, 2025**. The conference accepts a range of scientific contributions ranging from full research papers, short papers, and posters. This year, PacificVis has a **TVCG journal paper track**, a **conference full paper track**, and a **short paper (VisNotes) track** with consecutive deadlines. These tracks have separate calls for papers:

*   Call for papers - [TVCG journal papers](TVCG-journal-papers.html)
*   Call for papers - [conference papers](Conference-papers.html)
*   Call for papers - [short papers (VisNotes)](Short-papers.html)
*   Call for papers - Posters

The deadlines for the tracks are arranged so that papers rejected from an earlier track can be resubmitted to a following track (with optional reviewer continuity). All submitted papers will go through a two-stage review process to guarantee the publication of high-quality papers. Accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference and will also be published by IEEE and included in the IEEE Digital Library. Papers accepted in the journal track will be published directly in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG).

## Important Dates

All below deadlines are at 11:59pm (23:59) AoE (Anywhere on Earth).

Track-specific dates for revisions and camera-ready deadlines are given in the respective CFPs.

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Abstract vs. full deadline:** All tracks except VisNotes have separate abstract (title, abstract, authors, keywords) and full paper deadlines (usually a week apart).
*   **Resubmissions encouraged:** Authors are encouraged to include reviews and responses for previously rejected papers in their submission.
*   **Optional single-blind:** Reviewers’ identities are not revealed. Authors may choose whether to anonymize their submission or not.
*   **Submission System:** IEEE PacificVis uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) to handle the submission and reviewing process. When submitting your manuscript, please make sure that you submit to the intended track.

## Formatting and Language Guidelines

*   **TVCG journal paper track:** TVCG journal format with 9 + 2 pages (with only acknowledgments and references on the last two pages).
*   **Conference paper track:** IEEE VGTC conference format with 9 + 2 pages (with only acknowledgments and references on the last two pages).
*   **VisNotes paper track:** IEEE VGTC conference format with up to 6 pages (including references).

Papers should include full-color figures throughout and we encourage authors to showcase their work with annotated, well described, large, and detailed graphics. We also encourage the placement of a teaser image at the top of the very first page to showcase your work visually. Reviewers appreciate high-quality submissions with correct English spelling and grammar: non-native English speakers may wish to enlist an English language editing service.

## Anonymization

IEEE PacificVis allows both double-blind (anonymized) and single-blind (not anonymized) submissions. Double-blind submissions are intended for those authors who want to submit their work anonymously. Double-blind submissions should NOT include author names or institutions on the cover page of the initial submission, and authors should make an effort to ensure that there is no identity-revealing information (or formulations) in the text. If it is not possible to anonymize without compromising scientific clarity, authors are free to reveal their identities upon submission.

## Originality & Reuse of Text

All submissions must be novel contributions by the authors. This means that they must be original work by the authors that has not been published previously in or submitted concurrently to any conference proceeding, magazine or journal, or the like, in any language, in any form, in whole or in part, by any combination of authors.

A paper is considered published if it has appeared in a peer-reviewed and archived journal, in conference proceedings, or the like, making it available to non-attendees in the form of archives (including digital).

Concurrent submissions (i.e., having the same or a similar paper concurrently under review at another conference or journal/magazine) are strictly forbidden. If it is determined that an identical or substantially similar manuscript is simultaneously under consideration at another publication venue or forum (e.g., conference, journal, edited book), the manuscript will be rejected at an early stage in the review process. Further consequences are possible as well.

Previously published text may not be reused verbatim in a paper submission. Although similarities may be inevitable in discussing background or previous work, the reuse of text can infringe copyright, and is therefore prohibited. Images from published work may only be reused if they are properly cited and the authors have obtained the rights to re-publish the images.

One exception to these prohibitions is non-published preprints (e.g., on arXiv), which do not require citation to preprints. Another exception is theses, which should be cited. The last exception is that preliminary work described in posters, contest entries, or workshops, if not archival, may be resubmitted provided the submission includes substantial additional new material and the previous work is cited.

## Plagiarism Policy

Plagiarism of the work of others is at all times unacceptable and will lead to the submission being removed from the review process. For more information, please see the IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual.

All authors will therefore be required to certify on the submission form that the submitted work is the authors’ own work. All submissions are checked for plagiarism and potential cases inspected in detail by the paper chairs.

## Supplemental Material

We encourage the use of digital video to enhance a submission, particularly if part or all of the work addresses interactive techniques. Submission of code, data, evaluation protocols, empirical results, additional figures, or other supplemental material to improve the scientific review of the work is encouraged. Authors are urged to make available salient parameter settings of pertinent algorithms and ideally obtain results using open source data. If specific datasets are employed, we ask that a version of these be made available where possible. Information or pointers to information that can be changed after the submission deadline should not be used as supplemental material.

While most reviewers will take supplemental material into account when conducting their reviews, the authors should ensure that their submission will stand on its own even without this extra material.

## Resubmissions and Reviewer Continuity

Excellent work sometimes requires addressing issues that preclude acceptance within the scope of a single review cycle. For this reason, IEEE PacificVis welcomes revised, resubmitted papers. In particular, given the consecutive timeline of the three tracks, authors are encouraged to resubmit a revised version of a paper that was rejected to one track to the next track. In doing so, the authors can choose to maintain reviewer continuity if desired, in which case one or more of the original reviewers will be engaged for the new review process.

Authors who are submitting papers that have been rejected from earlier PacificVis cycles, or from other visualization conferences, are given the opportunity to include past reviews and a response letter as supplemental material when they submit the revised version. This is not required, but can add continuity and memory to the process so that authors can demonstrate improvement over time even if reviewers change from cycle to cycle.

Note that it is not acceptable to submit a previously rejected paper without addressing the previous review comments.

Reviewers are instructed to not penalize resubmitted papers for past rejections, but instead view the trajectory of a resubmission based on past reviews and author response. However, as with supplemental material, reviewers are not required to take past reviews and response letters into account when conducting their review. Resubmissions should be submitted with information pertaining to the original submission as supplemental material (PDF format):

*   Past submission - previous version of the paper.
*   Previous reviews - complete reviews from the last submission.
*   Cover letter - responses to past reviews (often as summary plus details).

Authors are responsible for the content of the response letter, but effective letters tend to summarize the main points of criticism in the past reviews and explain how the new version of the paper addresses these points.

## Accessibility

We highly encourage accessible final submissions so that your contribution is readable by broader audiences. There are several resources for how to achieve this:

*   [IEEE VIS 2024 - Making PDF submissions accessible](https://ieeevis.org/year/2024/info/call-participation/make-pdf-accessible)
*   [ACM SIGACCESS - Creating an accessible ACM submission using Microsoft Word](https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/acm-submission-with-ms-word/)
*   [ACM SIGCHI - Guide to an Accessible Submission](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/accessibility/)
*   ACM SIGACCESS - Resources for Accessibility

## Generative AI Policy

You are permitted to use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT or Gemini in preparing your manuscript. However, AI tools cannot serve as authors and the human authors bear full responsibility for any writing produced by such tools. In particular, authors are responsible that there is no plagiarism, misrepresentation, or falsification arising from using these tools. Furthermore, the work itself should be a representation of the human authors' intellectual contributions and not the generative AI.

If you do use generative AI beyond merely editing or improving text or generating small passages, you should disclose its use in the paper (such as the acknowledgments or image captions).

## Open Access Policy

Visualization research is better communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, all paper authors are encouraged to share their accepted paper in an open access repository before the print deadline in accordance with IEEE copyright regulations. Additionally, funding agencies and research organizations may have specific rules such as Plan S compliance and it is the authors’ responsibility to check and comply with their respective organizational rules.

## Ethics Guidelines

IEEE PacificVis adheres to the IEEE VGTC ethics guidelines for reviewers. In all aspects of the paper handling process, any possible violation of these guidelines is taken seriously and may be reported to the paper chairs for further handling within the IEEE PacificVis organization. Special attention is paid to the identification and reporting of plagiarism; possibly unethical paper content is also monitored carefully in the review process. Investigation and processing of reported cases may lead to an escalation to IEEE.","Đúng link chính, không lấy được các loại ngày",,,Yes

## Research Track

SYSTOR accepts both full-length and short papers. A short paper is intended for an idea that can be described and evaluated in fewer pages; the goal of the short paper is not for preliminary work or workshop-style position papers.

A good SYSTOR paper should present a novel, compelling solution to a well-motivated problem. The evaluation should demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the solution in settings that are as realistic as possible, including test applications workloads, system parameters, and assumed constraints. Authors should clearly describe their contribution in the context of prior work, and draw meaningful conclusions from their work.

The program committee also encourages submissions that describe lessons learned from operational (especially large-scale) system deployments. Such submissions are expected to include sufficient details of the system, its design goals, and the methods used for evaluating whether these goals were met.

The program committee will value submissions accompanied by supplemental material such as traces and open-source code that can help reproduce the reported results, and advance additional research in the field.

A small set of outstanding papers will be forwarded to a suitable journal, such as ACM journal Transactions on Storage (TOS) or Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS), for a fast-tracked review process for an expanded version of the paper.

As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

## Posters Track

SYSTOR also welcomes academic and industrial posters. See “Call for Papers” above for focus and relevant areas.

A good poster submission will articulate and motivate an interesting problem and describe a new insight or approach to addressing this problem. It will clearly present the work in progress (or attained results), and the expected outcomes from future work. The poster should present these details in a manner that is clear and captivating.

Poster submissions should include a one-page extended abstract, and a draft of the poster. The extended abstracts of accepted posters will be included in the online conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. The program committee will review poster submissions in a single-blind manner.

As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

Please follow the [poster formatting instructions](https://www.systor.org/2024/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/06/sample-systor2024-poster.pdf). The author kit, which contains the Latex style and template, is [available here](https://www.systor.org/2024/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/06/systor2024_poster_template.zip).

Accepted posters can opt-in for physical presentation at the Israeli Systems & AI Workshop in person.

## Submission Instructions

*   Research papers (full and short) should be submitted through: [https://systor25.hotcrp.com/](https://systor25.hotcrp.com/)
*   Posters should be submitted through: [https://systor25posters.hotcrp.com/](https://systor25posters.hotcrp.com/)
*   ISW-only posters (physical presence required) can be submitted by August 15. Send a title, abstract and name of presenter to Lior Shafir and Sarel Cohen.

## Review Process

The program committee will review submissions in a **double-blind manner**. All submissions should be properly anonymized, and all identifiable information should be removed whenever possible, including obvious self-references. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.

Any submissions accompanied by a non-disclosure agreement will be returned without review.

## Copyright and Originality of the Work

SYSTOR will enforce ACM’s plagiarism policy regarding copying and resubmitting prior work. Simultaneous submissions are not allowed: any work submitted to SYSTOR must not be under consideration for another workshop, conference, or journal.

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the earlier of either the first day of the conference or the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks before the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## Formatting Instructions

Submissions must be printable PDF files. When creating your submission, you must use the sigplan proceedings template of ACM’s acmart Latex class, which is available on the official ACM site. Your main LaTeX file should have the following structure:

```latex
% use the base acmart.cls

% use the sigplan proceeding template with the default 10 pt fonts

% nonacm option removes ACM-related text in the submission. 
\documentclass[sigplan,nonacm]{acmart}

% enable page numbers
\settopmatter{printfolios=true}
\begin{document}

\title{…}

\begin{abstract}

…
\end{abstract}

\maketitle % should come after the abstract

% Add the paper content here

% use the ACM bibliography style
\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{…}
\end{document}
```

Please ensure that your paper satisfies all the above requirements for content and formatting before submission; if you have a question about any of these issues, please email the program chairs.

Additional instructions regarding camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be sent directly to the corresponding authors and will appear here after the authors have been notified.

## Arxiv

A paper submitted to SYSTOR can be submitted simultaneously to Arxiv, with some changes. We would like the authors to make an honest effort to preserve anonymity. Please ensure the SYSTOR submission uses a different title and a different system name from the Arxiv version. It would be useful to let the chairs know if there is an Arxiv paper so that we can intervene if PC members find it accidentally and think the submission is plagiarizing the Arxiv paper.

## Open Source

The authors of a SYSTOR submission are encouraged to associate a source code repo with their submission, but this repo must be completely anonymized. It is alright if a named (= not anonymized) source code repo exists, so long as it isn’t associated/linked with the submission in any way. An anonymized repo can be a clone of the named repo, which is modified to be anonymous. Another way to do this is https://anonymous.4open.science/ .

## Camera-Ready Submission

Kindly review and finalize the title of your submission and the author list (including their order). Please use the “edit” version on the HotCRP submission site to make updates. Note the deadline for completing this action is prior to the Camera-ready date.

This information is needed to generate ACM copyright forms, which you need to sign *before* submitting your final camera-ready version. After completing the rights management form, you will be sent rights text and DOI info to add to the paper before the final PDF is generated and submitted.

Note that all accepted papers will be shepherded. Authors must address all reviewers’ comments and submit the final version. Following this, the shepherd will provide final approval for the camera-ready version within a week.

**Camera-Ready Submission Instructions**

These instructions apply to papers, short papers, and posters (extended abstracts). Contact proceeding publication chair Surbhi Palande for questions.

When authors submit their eRights forms to ACM, they receive confirmation messages that include the appropriate copyright text & DOI (document identifier) for their papers. Once complete, the camera-ready paper should be submitted through HotCRP.

Please follow these guidelines:

*   Make sure fonts are type 1 (scalable), NOT Type 3 (bit-mapped), and embedded within the document. More details can be found in General Instructions for Proceedings Volumes at www.acm.org/publications/gi-proceedings-current, item #8.
*   Authors must use the ACM classification system. For details see https://dl.acm.org/ccs and instructions in the paper template.
*   Please include paper keywords (specified with the \keywords command in (La)TeX).
*   Please include a short ABSTRACT section for posters. Do not put your entire extended abstract under this section.
*   Papers/posters must not include page numbers in the final manuscript and there is no need to include the “ACM Reference” (to remove these, you may need to use \settopmatter{printacmref=false,printfolios=false}.
*   Be sure that there are no bad page or column breaks, meaning no widows (last line of a paragraph at the top of a column). Section and subsection headings should remain with at least 2 lines of body text when near the end of a page or column.
*   Include the DOI in your paper that you received from ACM (use \acmDOI{####}) and update the ISBN data: \acmISBN{979-8-4007-1181-7}
*   The camera-ready version must include the updated copyright text you received from ACM. If you did not see an email referring to the ACM right management form, please check your SPAM folders. If this form is not received for a paper before the deadline, then that paper cannot be included in the proceedings.

Notes on adding copyright text:

*   Author(s) receive their copyright text upon completing the eRights form. This information is necessary and must be added to your publication.
*   Depending on this copyright text, the authors can take the following action:
    *   If authors use LaTeX they only need to set the correct option to \setcopyright (follow the eRights system option):
        *   `acmcopyright` ==> The authors transfer the copyright to the ACM (the “traditional” choice).
        *   `acmlicensed` ==>The authors retain the copyright but license the publication rights to ACM.
        *   `rightsretained` ==> The authors retain the copyright and publication rights to themselves or somebody else.
    *   If author(s) use Word they can copy the text they received (the full copyright text is included in the eRights reply)
*   Additionally note that the author can access the correct copyright under their paper edit submission link. At the top there is ‘Final version preparation’, which include the copyright text message. There is also a ‘Latex Instruction’ (collapsed) section with exact LaTeX instructions.
*   You should use the default class without font size and without the anonymous flag – `\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart,10pt}` – this would set 10pt font. Page count remains unchanged.
*   Alongside the camera-ready PDF, you will be required to *submit the source files* for your paper, including ALL files which were used to create the final output (PDF), be they Word, LaTeX, image files, etc. This is mandatory.

The following template contains the required settings: [Concise-Paper-Template.zip](https://www.systor.org/2024/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/08/SYSTOR-2024-Concise-Paper-Template.zip)

**Camera-Ready Submission Checks**

*   Verify all mandatory fields are filled in both HotCRP and the paper itself (title, authors, abstract, keywords, classification, refs)
*   Verify that the correct copyright text is inserted
*   Check formatting, margins, font sizes/types etc.
*   For additional information, refer to: ""www.acm.org/publications/gi-proceedings-current"".
