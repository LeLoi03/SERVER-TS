The conference brings together researchers and academics from industry and academia, featuring keynote talks, research and applied data science tracks, tutorials, poster sessions, system demonstrations, and a Young Researchers Symposium, with a recent focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.","# Call for Research Track Papers

We invite the submission of papers describing innovative and original research contributions in the areas of data science, data management, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, as well as papers describing the design, implementation and results of solutions of such advances to real-world problems. Papers can range from theoretical contributions to systems and algorithms to experimental research and benchmarking. We invite two types of submissions:

*   **Archival papers:** 8 pages + 2 pages for references.
*   **Non-archival papers:** 2 pages + 1 page references.

Papers submitted to the **Archival track** will undergo a rigorous review process that will judge submissions for the novelty of the described approaches. The goal of the **non-archival track** is to provide authors with a fast-track route to get feedback for any preliminary ideas that show promising results but do not yet have the maturity to be submitted to the archival track.

Papers accepted in the archival track will appear in the conference proceedings and be published. The publication venue will be announced soon. Papers accepted in the non-archival track will be presented in the conference but not published.

**Review Process:** Unlike previous years, CODS 2025 will have a single-stage review process, i.e., there will not be a rebuttal stage and no option to submit revised papers. Authors of all accepted papers (archival and non-archival) must present their work at the conference.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of Interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

*   **AI, ML, and Data Mining:** Classification and regression; Knowledge discovery; Knowledge representation and knowledge-based systems; Data preprocessing and wrangling; Feature engineering; Reinforcement learning; Deep learning; Bayesian methods; Time series analysis; Optimization; Graphical models; Statistical relational learning; Matrix and tensor methods; Parallel and distributed learning; Semi- and unsupervised learning; Graph mining; Network analytics; Text analytics and NLP; Information retrieval; Learning-based computer vision; Multimodal learning and analytics; Human-in-the-loop learning; Planning and reasoning; ML for mobiles and other resource-constrained environments; Federated learning; AutoML; Causality; Weak supervision and data augmentation; New benchmark tasks and datasets for AI/ML/data mining.

Algorithms and resources used in a paper should be described as completely as possible to enable reproducibility. This includes model parameters, experimental methodology, hardware and software platforms used during empirical evaluations, and results. The reproducibility factor will play an important role in the assessment of each submission. In the case where data cannot be released publicly, authors are encouraged to include experiments on relevant public datasets and/or create simulated data with the same properties.

## Policies and Guidelines

*   Please read the [Dual submission, Plagiarism, and Conflict of Interest policies](https://ikdd.acm.org/cods-2025/common-instructions-and-policies.php) before finalizing your submission.
*   **Double Anonymity Requirement:** CODS 2025 will be using double-anonymous reviewing for Research Track papers (but not the ADS Track papers). Authorsâ€™ names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or anywhere else in the submission. Funding sources and research group members must not be acknowledged. File names and metadata must also be anonymized. Self-references must be in the third person. Papers that do not follow these guidelines are subject to Desk Rejection.
*   **Sharing and Reproducibility:** Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly accessible during the review process. This will play an important role in the assessment of each submission.

## Awards and Grants

*   Several technical awards are available for best paper, etc. The awards will be announced during the conference.

The conference will be co-located with [ICAPS 2025](https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/) and [KR 2025](https://kr.org/KR2025/).

## Aim of the Conference

The aim of CPAIOR is to bring together researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Operations Research (OR) to present new techniques, applications, and theoretical & practical insights. The conference especially encourages interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative problem-solving by focusing on papers that actively combine, integrate, or contrast approaches from more than one of these areas. High-quality papers from a single area, as well as applications showcasing CP/AI/OR on challenging practical problems, are also welcomed.

## Topics of Interest

The program committee invites submissions that include, but are not limited to, the following topics:

*   New methodologies in the interface between predictive and prescriptive pipelines, such as machine learning techniques applied to tackle optimization problems and, conversely, CP/OR techniques to address AI and machine learning tasks.
*   Novel relaxation and inference methods based on constraint propagation, polyhedral techniques/cutting planes, convex/second-order conic optimization, graph-based algorithms, dynamic programming, and decision diagrams for optimization.
*   New search perspectives involving enumeration/branch-and-bound strategies, innovative decomposition techniques (e.g., based on column generation/Benders), intelligent backtracking, incomplete search, and learning-based heuristics.
*   Advanced integrated methods that expose new model transformations, communication strategies across MIP/CP/SAT solvers, distributed solution techniques, and solver selection (e.g., portfolio approaches).
*   Innovative models and applications of CP/AI/OR techniques.
*   Implementation or evaluation of CP/AI/OR techniques and optimization systems.

## Submission Types

Submissions are of two types:

1.  **Regular Papers:** Submitted for publication and presentation.

The 28th ACM SIGCHI Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing (CSCW) will be held in **Bergen, Norway on October 18 â€” 22, 2025**. CSCW is the premier venue for human-centered research in the design, use, and evaluation of technologies that support or affect social, cooperative, and collaborative practices in groups, organizations, communities, and networks.

## Scope

CSCW invites contributions across a variety of human-centered research techniques, methods, approaches, and domains. Papers are expected to report on novel results from human-centered research discussing the design, development, use, and/or analysis of CSCW and social computing systems; or introduce new human-centered approaches to the conceptualization or critical analysis of such systems. Submissions exploring how computing technologies â€” including those linked to recent developments in AI, machine learning, robotics, and AR/VR â€” relate to questions of race, indigeneity, gender, and the environment are particularly encouraged, providing they are properly contextualized within cooperative, collaborative, or social computing issues.

Key areas of interest include:

*   Social and crowd computing.
*   CSCW and social computing system development.
*   Methodologies and tools.
*   Critical, historical, ethnographic analyses.
*   Empirical investigations.
*   Domain-specific social, cooperative, and collaborative applications.
*   Ethics and policy implications.
*   CSCW and social computing systems based on emerging technologies.
*   Crossing boundaries.

## Submission Model

CSCW uses a two-cycle review process with the opportunity for major revisions. Accepted papers are published in the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACM HCI) Journal. CSCW 2025 follows a half-yearly submission model with submission deadlines in July 2024 and October 2024.

## Inclusions and Diversity in Writing

We value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and profession. Be mindful in your writing to avoid language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people. Reviewers will monitor and demand changes if such issues arise.

## Conflict of Interest (COI) Definition

An author X of an ICDE 2025 research paper has a COI with a PC member or Area Chair Y if any of the following conditions hold:
*   X is a co-author of another ICDE 2025 submission with Y.
*   X has co-authored publications with Y in the past three years.
*   X has co-authored 4 or more publications with Y in the last 10 years.
*   X has been a co-worker of Y in the same company or university within the past three years.

## Double and Concurrent Submissions

Technical papers must not substantially overlap with papers published or simultaneously submitted to other venues. Double submissions will lead to immediate rejection.

## Ethical Considerations

Authors may optionally include an ""Ethics Considerations"" section to discuss potential ethical risks and mitigation steps. If a paper involves human subjects, data derived from humans, or might pose risks, authors should discuss ethical and legal concerns, and whether an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval) was conducted. Responsible disclosure plans for high-impact vulnerabilities are encouraged.

## Anonymous Submissions

NDSS Symposium uses a **double-blind reviewing process**. Author names and affiliations must not appear in the paper. Authors should avoid revealing their identities in the text, figures, photos, links, or other data. Prior work must be referenced in the third person or blinded. Submissions violating anonymity will be rejected without review. Advertising results broadly is disallowed.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors and Program Committee members must declare any conflicts of interest (e.g., advisors/advisees, institutional relationships, recent collaborations). PC members with conflicts will be excluded from evaluating the relevant papers. ""Fake conflicts"" are disallowed.

## Use of Generative AI

Generative AI is permitted for paper preparation provided it does not plagiarize or misrepresent content, and authors accept responsibility for veracity. Disclosure is required, commensurate with usage. Specific tools, versions, and prompts should be documented for significant use.",Main link chính xác hơn: https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2026/,88.89,,

SPLASH 2025, co-located with ICFP/SPLASH 2025, will be held from **Sun 12 - Sat 18 October 2025** in **Singapore**.

## About Onward!

Onward! is a premier multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary and more open than other conferences to ideas that are well-argued but not yet proven. We welcome different ways of thinking about, approaching and reporting on programming language and software engineering research.

## The Character of Onward! Papers

Onward! Papers is looking for **grand visions and new paradigms** that could make a big difference in how we will one day build software. It is not looking for research-as-usual papers that require rigorous validation such as theorems or empirical experiments. Onward! papers must also supply some degree of validation because mere speculation is not a good basis for progress. However, Onward! accepts less rigorous methods of validation such as **compelling arguments, exploratory implementations, and substantial examples**. The use of worked-out examples to support new ideas is strongly encouraged.

## Selection Process

Onward! papers are peer-reviewed in a **double blind manner**. Accepted papers will appear in the Onward! Proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Submissions will be judged on the **potential impact of the ideas and the quality of the presentation**.

Onward! Papers follows a **two-phase review process**. At the end of the first phase, papers will be either: accepted normally; asked to perform certain required revisions; or rejected outright. Authors of papers asked to perform revisions will get one month to complete them. The program committee may assign a shepherd or provide concrete revision goals. The second phase is to elevate promising papers, not to require additional work on papers already deemed up-to-standard.

Authors of accepted papers are strongly encouraged to present their work in person at the conference, but remote participation is available.

The 22nd USENIX Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation (NSDI '25) will be held on **April 28–30, 2025**, in **Philadelphia, PA, USA**.

NSDI focuses on the design principles, implementation, and practical evaluation of networked and distributed systems. Our goal is to bring together researchers from across the networking and systems community to foster a broad approach to addressing overlapping research challenges. NSDI provides a high-quality forum for presenting results and discussing ideas that further the knowledge and understanding of the networked systems community as a whole, continue a significant research dialog, or push the architectural boundaries of network services.

## Topics

NSDI invites any innovative solution for a significant problem involving networked systems, including topics from within the following list:

*   Highly available and reliable networked systems
*   Security and privacy of networked systems
*   Distributed storage, caching, and query processing systems
*   Sustainable, low-energy, and low-carbon networked systems
*   Cloud/multi-tenant systems
*   Mobile and embedded/sensor applications and systems
*   Systems aspects of networking hardware and physical layer communication technologies*
*   Network and workload measurement systems
*   Self-organizing, autonomous, and federated networked systems
*   Managing, debugging, and diagnosing problems in networked systems
*   Virtualization and resource management for networked systems
*   Experience with deployed networked systems
*   Networked systems for big data
*   Testing and/or verification applied to networked systems
*   Networked systems for machine learning (ML) and ML for networked systems

*Physical and physical-sensing papers with no clear contributions to the design of systems or the networking stack will be considered out of scope.

The preceding list is not exhaustive. That said, the program committee can reject any papers that they consider to be not in scope and relevant to the NSDI community during the review process. Please contact the PC chairs if you have questions about whether your paper would be in scope.

## Important Dates

NSDI '25 offers authors the choice of two submission deadlines.

### Spring Deadline

*   Paper titles and abstracts due: **Tuesday, April 30, 2024**
*   Full paper submissions due: **Tuesday, May 7, 2024**
*   Notification to authors: **Wednesday, July 24, 2024**
*   Final paper files due: **Tuesday, October 15, 2024**

### Fall Deadline

*   Paper titles and abstracts due: **Thursday, September 12, 2024**
*   Full paper submissions due: **Thursday, September 19, 2024**
*   Notification to authors: **Tuesday, December 10, 2024**
*   Final paper files due: **Thursday, March 6, 2025**

## Submission Guidelines

### Anonymization

NSDI '25 is double-blind, meaning that authors should make a good faith effort to anonymize papers. Authors' names should be withheld, as usual. However, only non-destructive anonymization is required. For example, system names may be left de-anonymized if important for a reviewer to evaluate the work. Specific steps include:

*   Remove authors' names and affiliations from the title page.
*   Remove acknowledgment of identifying names and funding sources.
*   Do not provide links to your own online content; use the submission form for uploads or contact PC chairs.
*   Use care in naming files.
*   Reference past work in the third person, citing anonymously.
*   Reference other submissions as ""[24] Under submission. Details omitted for double-blind reviewing.""

*Note:* Operational track papers have different rules; content may be de-anonymized as appropriate for the paper.

### Length and Format

*   Submissions—as well as final papers—must be no longer than **12 pages**, including footnotes, figures, and tables. Additional pages are allowed for references and supplementary material.
*   Papers must be in two-column format, using 10-point type on 12-point leading, formatted for 8.5"" x 11"" paper.
*   Pages should be numbered, and figures and tables should be legible when printed without magnification. Color figures are allowed but should be readable in black and white.
*   A template for LaTeX is available on the href=""/conferences/author-resources/paper-templates"" - conference paper templates page .

Papers not meeting these criteria will be rejected without review.

### Submission Method

All papers must be submitted via the href=""https://nsdi25fall.usenix.hotcrp.com/"" - submission form . Do not email submissions.

### Generative AI

Authors must not submit papers generated entirely by generative AI. Authors must submit a statement attesting that their paper is not completely created by generative AI as part of the submission process in HotCRP.

## Review Process

### One-Shot Revision

Each paper may be accepted, rejected, or given the option of one-shot revision. A revision decision includes necessary changes for acceptance. Authors may resubmit a version addressing instructions during the subsequent deadline. This revised paper is reviewed to judge if instructions were met, and on its independent merits. Revised papers can only be accepted or rejected, not revised again. Failure to address revision instructions or introduction of new concerns may lead to rejection.

### Resubmissions

Papers rejected from one deadline cannot be submitted to the immediate next deadline. Papers with one-shot-revision decisions from a prior year can be submitted to the following year's conference, but must provide the previous paper ID. Papers submitted to arXiv or other online repositories must change their title and system name for review to prevent bias.

## Policies

*   **Simultaneous submissions:** Prohibited. Previously published work or plagiarism constitutes dishonesty.
*   **Extensions on workshop papers:** Allowed if the submission includes substantial new material, acknowledges previous work anonymously, and explains differences.
*   **Nondisclosure agreement:** Papers accompanied by NDAs will not be considered.

## Ethical Considerations

Papers describing experiments with users or user data must follow basic principles of ethical research (beneficence, minimal risk, voluntary consent, respect for privacy, limited deception). Authors are encouraged to include a subsection on ethical issues and must attest that their work complies with applicable ethical standards of their institutions.

## Processes for Accepted Papers

*   Invitation letters for visa applications are available upon request.
*   Accepted papers will be shepherded through an editorial review process.
*   At least one author must attend the conference to present the paper.
*   Awards will be given for the best paper(s) and a ""Community Award"" for papers with publicly available code and/or datasets.",Có link 2026: https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi26,,,Yes

Hosted by National Taiwan Normal University and Taipei ACM SIGGRAPH, the conference aims to promote visualization research and technologies, especially in the Asian-Pacific region. PacificVis 2025 accepts various scientific contributions, including full research papers, short papers, posters, and participation in workshops and contests.","# PacificVis 2025: Call for Papers

**IEEE PacificVis 2025** solicits novel research contributions and innovative applications in all areas of visualization. PacificVis is a unified visualization conference covering topics including visualization techniques and systems, interactions, analytics and decision support, theoretical contributions to visualization, empirical studies, and visualization applications in domains such as (but not limited to) biological sciences, education, machine learning, physical sciences, security, and social science.

**IEEE PacificVis 2025** will be held in **Taipei, Taiwan** on **April 22–25, 2025**. The conference accepts a range of scientific contributions ranging from full research papers, short papers, and posters. This year, PacificVis has a **TVCG journal paper track**, a **conference full paper track**, and a **short paper (VisNotes) track** with consecutive deadlines. These tracks have separate calls for papers:

*   Call for papers - [TVCG journal papers](TVCG-journal-papers.html)
*   Call for papers - [conference papers](Conference-papers.html)
*   Call for papers - [short papers (VisNotes)](Short-papers.html)
*   Call for papers - Posters

The deadlines for the tracks are arranged so that papers rejected from an earlier track can be resubmitted to a following track (with optional reviewer continuity). All submitted papers will go through a two-stage review process to guarantee the publication of high-quality papers. Accepted papers will be presented orally at the conference and will also be published by IEEE and included in the IEEE Digital Library. Papers accepted in the journal track will be published directly in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG).

## Important Dates

All below deadlines are at 11:59pm (23:59) AoE (Anywhere on Earth).

| Deadline                     | Dates              |

Track-specific dates for revisions and camera-ready deadlines are given in the respective CFPs.

## Submission Guidelines

*   **Abstract vs. full deadline:** All tracks except VisNotes have separate abstract (title, abstract, authors, keywords) and full paper deadlines (usually a week apart).
*   **Resubmissions encouraged:** Authors are encouraged to include reviews and responses for previously rejected papers in their submission.
*   **Optional single-blind:** Reviewers’ identities are not revealed. Authors may choose whether to anonymize their submission or not.
*   **Submission System:** IEEE PacificVis uses the Precision Conference System (PCS) to handle the submission and reviewing process. When submitting your manuscript, please make sure that you submit to the intended track.

## Formatting and Language Guidelines

*   **TVCG journal paper track:** TVCG journal format with 9 + 2 pages (with only acknowledgments and references on the last two pages).
*   **Conference paper track:** IEEE VGTC conference format with 9 + 2 pages (with only acknowledgments and references on the last two pages).
*   **VisNotes paper track:** IEEE VGTC conference format with up to 6 pages (including references).

Papers should include full-color figures throughout and we encourage authors to showcase their work with annotated, well described, large, and detailed graphics. We also encourage the placement of a teaser image at the top of the very first page to showcase your work visually. Reviewers appreciate high-quality submissions with correct English spelling and grammar: non-native English speakers may wish to enlist an English language editing service.

## Anonymization

IEEE PacificVis allows both double-blind (anonymized) and single-blind (not anonymized) submissions. Double-blind submissions are intended for those authors who want to submit their work anonymously. Double-blind submissions should NOT include author names or institutions on the cover page of the initial submission, and authors should make an effort to ensure that there is no identity-revealing information (or formulations) in the text. If it is not possible to anonymize without compromising scientific clarity, authors are free to reveal their identities upon submission.

## Originality & Reuse of Text

All submissions must be novel contributions by the authors. This means that they must be original work by the authors that has not been published previously in or submitted concurrently to any conference proceeding, magazine or journal, or the like, in any language, in any form, in whole or in part, by any combination of authors.

A paper is considered published if it has appeared in a peer-reviewed and archived journal, in conference proceedings, or the like, making it available to non-attendees in the form of archives (including digital).

Concurrent submissions (i.e., having the same or a similar paper concurrently under review at another conference or journal/magazine) are strictly forbidden. If it is determined that an identical or substantially similar manuscript is simultaneously under consideration at another publication venue or forum (e.g., conference, journal, edited book), the manuscript will be rejected at an early stage in the review process. Further consequences are possible as well.

Previously published text may not be reused verbatim in a paper submission. Although similarities may be inevitable in discussing background or previous work, the reuse of text can infringe copyright, and is therefore prohibited. Images from published work may only be reused if they are properly cited and the authors have obtained the rights to re-publish the images.

One exception to these prohibitions is non-published preprints (e.g., on arXiv), which do not require citation to preprints. Another exception is theses, which should be cited. The last exception is that preliminary work described in posters, contest entries, or workshops, if not archival, may be resubmitted provided the submission includes substantial additional new material and the previous work is cited.

## Plagiarism Policy

Plagiarism of the work of others is at all times unacceptable and will lead to the submission being removed from the review process. For more information, please see the IEEE Publication Services and Products Board Operations Manual.

All authors will therefore be required to certify on the submission form that the submitted work is the authors’ own work. All submissions are checked for plagiarism and potential cases inspected in detail by the paper chairs.

## Supplemental Material

We encourage the use of digital video to enhance a submission, particularly if part or all of the work addresses interactive techniques. Submission of code, data, evaluation protocols, empirical results, additional figures, or other supplemental material to improve the scientific review of the work is encouraged. Authors are urged to make available salient parameter settings of pertinent algorithms and ideally obtain results using open source data. If specific datasets are employed, we ask that a version of these be made available where possible. Information or pointers to information that can be changed after the submission deadline should not be used as supplemental material.

While most reviewers will take supplemental material into account when conducting their reviews, the authors should ensure that their submission will stand on its own even without this extra material.

## Resubmissions and Reviewer Continuity

Excellent work sometimes requires addressing issues that preclude acceptance within the scope of a single review cycle. For this reason, IEEE PacificVis welcomes revised, resubmitted papers. In particular, given the consecutive timeline of the three tracks, authors are encouraged to resubmit a revised version of a paper that was rejected to one track to the next track. In doing so, the authors can choose to maintain reviewer continuity if desired, in which case one or more of the original reviewers will be engaged for the new review process.

Authors who are submitting papers that have been rejected from earlier PacificVis cycles, or from other visualization conferences, are given the opportunity to include past reviews and a response letter as supplemental material when they submit the revised version. This is not required, but can add continuity and memory to the process so that authors can demonstrate improvement over time even if reviewers change from cycle to cycle.

Note that it is not acceptable to submit a previously rejected paper without addressing the previous review comments.

Reviewers are instructed to not penalize resubmitted papers for past rejections, but instead view the trajectory of a resubmission based on past reviews and author response. However, as with supplemental material, reviewers are not required to take past reviews and response letters into account when conducting their review. Resubmissions should be submitted with information pertaining to the original submission as supplemental material (PDF format):

*   Past submission - previous version of the paper.
*   Previous reviews - complete reviews from the last submission.
*   Cover letter - responses to past reviews (often as summary plus details).

Authors are responsible for the content of the response letter, but effective letters tend to summarize the main points of criticism in the past reviews and explain how the new version of the paper addresses these points.

## Accessibility

We highly encourage accessible final submissions so that your contribution is readable by broader audiences. There are several resources for how to achieve this:

*   [IEEE VIS 2024 - Making PDF submissions accessible](https://ieeevis.org/year/2024/info/call-participation/make-pdf-accessible)
*   [ACM SIGACCESS - Creating an accessible ACM submission using Microsoft Word](https://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/acm-submission-with-ms-word/)
*   [ACM SIGCHI - Guide to an Accessible Submission](https://sigchi.org/resources/guides-for-authors/accessibility/)
*   ACM SIGACCESS - Resources for Accessibility

## Generative AI Policy

You are permitted to use generative AI tools such as ChatGPT or Gemini in preparing your manuscript. However, AI tools cannot serve as authors and the human authors bear full responsibility for any writing produced by such tools. In particular, authors are responsible that there is no plagiarism, misrepresentation, or falsification arising from using these tools. Furthermore, the work itself should be a representation of the human authors' intellectual contributions and not the generative AI.

If you do use generative AI beyond merely editing or improving text or generating small passages, you should disclose its use in the paper (such as the acknowledgments or image captions).

## Open Access Policy

Visualization research is better communicated and acted on if it is freely accessible to the research community, practitioners, and the general public. Therefore, all paper authors are encouraged to share their accepted paper in an open access repository before the print deadline in accordance with IEEE copyright regulations. Additionally, funding agencies and research organizations may have specific rules such as Plan S compliance and it is the authors’ responsibility to check and comply with their respective organizational rules.

## Ethics Guidelines

IEEE PacificVis adheres to the IEEE VGTC ethics guidelines for reviewers. In all aspects of the paper handling process, any possible violation of these guidelines is taken seriously and may be reported to the paper chairs for further handling within the IEEE PacificVis organization. Special attention is paid to the identification and reporting of plagiarism; possibly unethical paper content is also monitored carefully in the review process. Investigation and processing of reported cases may lead to an escalation to IEEE.","Đúng link chính, không lấy được các loại ngày",,,Yes

The 13th Workshop on Programming Languages and Operating Systems (PLOS 2025) will be held on **October 13, 2025**, in **Seoul, Republic of Korea**, in conjunction with the **31st ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles (SOSP '25)**.

## Rationale

Historically, operating system (OS) development and programming language (PL) development went hand-in-hand, fostering cross-fertilization. Challenges in one area were often approached using ideas or techniques developed in the other, and advances in one enabled new capabilities in both. Today, although the systems community at large retains an iron grip on C, modern PL ideas continue to spark innovations in OS design and construction. Conversely, the systems field continues to provide a wealth of challenging problems and practical results that should spark advances in PLs, software designs, and idioms.

This workshop will bring together researchers and developers from the PL and OS domains to discuss recent work at the intersection of these fields.

## Overview

Welcome to the home page of the 46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI 2025)!

PLDI is the premier forum in the field of programming languages and programming systems research, covering the areas of design, implementation, theory, applications, and performance.

PLDI 2025 will be held in-person at the Westin Josun Seoul in Seoul, South Korea.

The main PLDI conference will be held **Wednesday, 18 June through Friday, 20 June**. Workshops and tutorials were held on **Monday, 16 June and Tuesday, 17 June**.

## Scope

PLDI is a premier forum for programming language research, broadly construed. Outstanding research that extends and/or applies programming-language concepts to advance the field of computing is welcome. Novel system designs, thorough empirical work, well-motivated theoretical results, and new application areas are all in scope for PLDI.

## Submission Process

### Deadlines

All deadlines are **Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12h)**:

*   **Submission Deadline:** **Thursday, November 14, 2024**
*   **Author Response Period:** **Tuesday, 18 - Saturday, 22 February 2025**
*   **Notification to Authors:** **Thursday, 6 March 2025**
*   **Camera-Ready Deadline:** **Thursday, 10 April 2025**

### Submission Site

The submission site will be at [https://pldi25.hotcrp.com/](https://pldi25.hotcrp.com/).

Authors can submit multiple times prior to the (firm!) deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no deadline for submitting abstracts. The submission site requires entering author names and affiliations, relevant topics, and potential conflicts. Addition or removal of authors after the submission deadline will need to be approved by the Associate Editor.

### Declaring Conflicts

When submitting a paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).

Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to subvert the normal peer-review process by excluding potential reviewers. Listing spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about whether or not a given relationship constitutes a conflict, please consult the Associate Editor.

## Formatting Requirements

### Page Limits and Layout

Each paper should have no more than **20 pages of text**, excluding bibliography, using the ACM Proceedings format. This format is chosen for compatibility with PACMPL. It is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins than recent PLDI page layouts. In this format, the main text block is 5.478 in (13.91 cm) wide and 7.884 in (20.03 cm) tall.

Use of a different format (e.g., smaller fonts or a larger text block) is grounds for summary rejection.

### Templates

PACMPL templates for Microsoft Word and LaTeX can be found at the [SIGPLAN author information page](https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/). Authors using LaTeX should use the `sample-acmsmall-conf.tex` file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the `acmsmall` option. We also strongly encourage use of the `review` and `screen` options as well, e.g.:

```latex
\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous,nonacm]{acmart}
```

### Citations

Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers may use either the author-year or numeric format for citations.

### File Format

Submissions should be in **PDF** and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Please take care to ensure that figures and tables are legible, even when the paper is printed in gray-scale.

### Late/Incorrect Submissions

Papers that exceed the length requirement, deviate from the expected format, or are submitted late will be rejected.

## Review Process

### Evaluation Criteria

Reviewers will evaluate submissions for accuracy, significance, originality, and clarity. Submissions should be organized to communicate clearly to a broad programming-language audience as well as experts on the paper’s topics. Papers should identify what has been accomplished and how it relates to previous work. Authors of empirical papers are encouraged to consider the seven categories of the SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Guidelines when preparing submissions.

### Double-Blind Reviewing

Author names and affiliations must be omitted from submissions. If a submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized. These are firm submission requirements. The Review Committee will only learn the identities of authors of accepted papers following the second round of reviewing.

The [FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/faq/FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing) clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Associate Editor than to risk summary rejection.

### Author Response

Authors will be given several days to compose a written response to the reviews received in the first round – e.g., to correct errors and clarify technical concerns. In the second round, authors of conditionally-accepted papers will be given an opportunity to improve specific aspects of the research and the paper, as identified by the reviewers.

### Artifact Evaluation

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Artifact Evaluation is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how well the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to make their artifacts publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as “source materials” in the ACM Digital Library.

## Supplementary Material

Authors are welcome to provide supplementary material if that material supports the claims in the paper. Such material may include proofs, experimental results, and/or data sets. This material should be uploaded at the same time as the submission. Reviewers are not required to examine the supplementary material but may refer to it if they would like to find further evidence supporting the claims in the paper.

Supplemental material cannot be included in the main submission text. All appendices must be submitted as supplemental material, not as part of the main submission PDF.

## Plagiarism and Concurrent Work

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere, as described by the SIGPLAN Republication Policy and ACM Policy on Plagiarism. Concurrent submissions to other conferences, workshops, journals, or similar venues of publication are disallowed. Prior work must, as always, be cited and referred to in the third person even if it is the authors’ own work, so as to preserve author anonymity.

## Open Access and Copyright

As a Gold Open Access journal, PACMPL is committed to making peer-reviewed scientific research free of restrictions on both access and (re-)use. Authors are strongly encouraged to support liberal open access by licensing their work with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY) license, which grants readers (re-)use rights.

Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide an ORCID for each co-author and choose one of the following publication rights: (1) Author licenses the work with a Creative Commons license, retains copyright, and grants ACM non-exclusive permission to publish (suggested choice); (2) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive permission to publish license; (3) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive permission to publish license; (4) Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.

While PACMPL may ask authors who have funding for open-access fees to voluntarily cover the article processing charge (currently, US$400), payment is not required for publication.

## Presentations and Awards

### Presentations

Authors of accepted papers will be invited to present their work at PLDI. Authors who need financial assistance for travel to the conferences should apply for a grant from the SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee (PAC) program. If authors are not able to obtain visas to travel to the conference despite making reasonable effort, we will make arrangements to facilitate remote participation or presentation by another attendee on behalf of the authors.

### Distinguished Paper Awards

Up to 10% of the accepted papers may be designated as Distinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the Review Committee believes should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance, originality, significance, and clarity.

## Code of Conduct

PLDI follows the ACM Policy Against Harassment at ACM Activities. Please familiarize yourself with the policy and guide for reporting unacceptable behavior.

If you witness or are subject to unacceptable behavior, please contact SIGPLAN’s Committee to Aid REporting (CARES) by contacting one of the listed persons, such as Steve Blackburn (steve.blackburn@anu.edu.au).

POPL 2025 seeks contributions on all aspects of programming languages and programming systems, both theoretical and practical.

## Scope

Principles of Programming Languages (POPL) is a forum for the discussion of all aspects of programming languages and programming systems. Both theoretical and experimental papers are welcome, on topics ranging from formal frameworks to experience reports. We seek submissions that make principled, enduring contributions to the theory, design, understanding, implementation, or application of programming languages.

## Evaluation Criteria

The Review Committee will evaluate the technical contribution of each submission as well as its accessibility to both experts and the general POPL audience. All papers will be judged on significance, originality, relevance, correctness, and clarity. Each paper must explain its scientific contribution in both general and technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

POPL 2025 will use a **full double-blind reviewing process**. This means that identities of authors will not be visible to reviewers until after conditional-acceptance decisions have been made. Authors must omit their names and institutions from their paper submissions and refer to their own prior work in the third person. Supplementary material must also be fully anonymized. Authors should not reveal their identity when responding to reviews.

## Submission Site Information

The submission site is [https://popl25.hotcrp.com/](https://popl25.hotcrp.com/). Authors can submit multiple times prior to the deadline. Only the last submission will be reviewed. There is no abstract deadline.

## Conflicts of Interest

Authors must properly declare all potential conflicts of interest for all authors when submitting. This includes marking PC conflicts as well as ""Other Conflicts (external)"". Conflicts include adviser-advisee relationships, co-author relationships, colleagues at the same institution, financial conflicts, and relationships with friends or relatives.

## Submission Guidelines

*   Each paper should have no more than **25 pages of text**, excluding bibliography.
*   Use the **PACMPL format** (acmart LaTeX class with acmsmall option). This is a single-column page layout with a 10 pt font, 12 pt line spacing, and wider margins.

The Principles of Database Systems (PODS) symposium series, held in conjunction with the SIGMOD conference series, provides a premier annual forum for the communication of new advances in the theoretical foundations of data management. The 2025 conference will be held in **Berlin, Germany**.

## Mission

The PODS community aims to:

*   Provide a solid scientific basis for methods, techniques, and solutions for data management challenges.
*   Develop new ways of advancing data management to reflect the rich landscape of data requirements in applications.
*   Develop solutions that ensure high levels of efficiency, scalability, usability, expressiveness, robustness, security, clarity, and privacy.
*   Foster an open space for researchers from various areas related to the principles of computer science to discuss, interact, and propose solutions to problems in data management.

## Scope

PODS seeks scientific articles that present principled contributions to modeling, application, and system building in the context of data management. Articles may be based on establishing theoretical results, developing new concepts and frameworks, providing experimental work that sheds light on the scientific foundations, or rigorous analysis of important industry artifacts. PODS pays special attention to papers that help integrate data management techniques within broader computer science.

*   A submission can be up to **15 pages**, not including references, plus unlimited space for references.
*   **Appendix:** Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, of unlimited length, that should be incorporated at submission time. However, an appendix will be read at the discretion of the program committee.
*   Papers that are longer than 15 pages or do not cohere with the required format style risk rejection without consideration of their merits.
*   The results of a submitted paper must be unpublished and not submitted elsewhere.
*   Authors of an accepted paper will be expected to sign copyright release forms, and accepted papers will be published in a PODS 2025 issue of the **PACMMOD** (https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmmod) journal.

## Double-anonymous reviewing

PODS 2025 will use a lightweight double-anonymous reviewing process. Submissions must adhere to the following:

*   Author names and institutions must be omitted.
*   References to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person.
*   Acknowledgements, grant numbers, and links to submitted papers in public repositories will not be allowed.

Authors are encouraged to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would.

## Merit-based acceptance

Paper selection will be merit-based, judged on originality, quality, clarity of presentation, relevance to the field, and technical depth. There is no a priori limit on the number of accepted papers.

## Research Track

SYSTOR accepts both full-length and short papers. A short paper is intended for an idea that can be described and evaluated in fewer pages; the goal of the short paper is not for preliminary work or workshop-style position papers.

A good SYSTOR paper should present a novel, compelling solution to a well-motivated problem. The evaluation should demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the solution in settings that are as realistic as possible, including test applications workloads, system parameters, and assumed constraints. Authors should clearly describe their contribution in the context of prior work, and draw meaningful conclusions from their work.

The program committee also encourages submissions that describe lessons learned from operational (especially large-scale) system deployments. Such submissions are expected to include sufficient details of the system, its design goals, and the methods used for evaluating whether these goals were met.

The program committee will value submissions accompanied by supplemental material such as traces and open-source code that can help reproduce the reported results, and advance additional research in the field.

A small set of outstanding papers will be forwarded to a suitable journal, such as ACM journal Transactions on Storage (TOS) or Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS), for a fast-tracked review process for an expanded version of the paper.

As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

## Posters Track

SYSTOR also welcomes academic and industrial posters. See “Call for Papers” above for focus and relevant areas.

A good poster submission will articulate and motivate an interesting problem and describe a new insight or approach to addressing this problem. It will clearly present the work in progress (or attained results), and the expected outcomes from future work. The poster should present these details in a manner that is clear and captivating.

Poster submissions should include a one-page extended abstract, and a draft of the poster. The extended abstracts of accepted posters will be included in the online conference proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. The program committee will review poster submissions in a single-blind manner.

As a published ACM author, you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM’s [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

Please follow the [poster formatting instructions](https://www.systor.org/2024/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/06/sample-systor2024-poster.pdf). The author kit, which contains the Latex style and template, is [available here](https://www.systor.org/2024/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/06/systor2024_poster_template.zip).

Accepted posters can opt-in for physical presentation at the Israeli Systems & AI Workshop in person.

## Submission Instructions

*   Research papers (full and short) should be submitted through: [https://systor25.hotcrp.com/](https://systor25.hotcrp.com/)
*   Posters should be submitted through: [https://systor25posters.hotcrp.com/](https://systor25posters.hotcrp.com/)
*   ISW-only posters (physical presence required) can be submitted by August 15. Send a title, abstract and name of presenter to Lior Shafir and Sarel Cohen.

## Review Process

The program committee will review submissions in a **double-blind manner**. All submissions should be properly anonymized, and all identifiable information should be removed whenever possible, including obvious self-references. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.

Any submissions accompanied by a non-disclosure agreement will be returned without review.

## Copyright and Originality of the Work

SYSTOR will enforce ACM’s plagiarism policy regarding copying and resubmitting prior work. Simultaneous submissions are not allowed: any work submitted to SYSTOR must not be under consideration for another workshop, conference, or journal.

Submissions must be printable PDF files. When creating your submission, you must use the sigplan proceedings template of ACM’s acmart Latex class, which is available on the official ACM site. Your main LaTeX file should have the following structure:

```latex
% use the base acmart.cls

% use the sigplan proceeding template with the default 10 pt fonts

% nonacm option removes ACM-related text in the submission. 
\documentclass[sigplan,nonacm]{acmart}

% enable page numbers
\settopmatter{printfolios=true}
\begin{document}

\title{…}

\begin{abstract}

…
\end{abstract}

\maketitle % should come after the abstract

% Add the paper content here

% use the ACM bibliography style
\bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
\bibliography{…}
\end{document}
```

Please ensure that your paper satisfies all the above requirements for content and formatting before submission; if you have a question about any of these issues, please email the program chairs.

Additional instructions regarding camera-ready versions of accepted papers will be sent directly to the corresponding authors and will appear here after the authors have been notified.

## Arxiv

A paper submitted to SYSTOR can be submitted simultaneously to Arxiv, with some changes. We would like the authors to make an honest effort to preserve anonymity. Please ensure the SYSTOR submission uses a different title and a different system name from the Arxiv version. It would be useful to let the chairs know if there is an Arxiv paper so that we can intervene if PC members find it accidentally and think the submission is plagiarizing the Arxiv paper.

## Open Source

The authors of a SYSTOR submission are encouraged to associate a source code repo with their submission, but this repo must be completely anonymized. It is alright if a named (= not anonymized) source code repo exists, so long as it isn’t associated/linked with the submission in any way. An anonymized repo can be a clone of the named repo, which is modified to be anonymous. Another way to do this is https://anonymous.4open.science/ .

## Camera-Ready Submission

Kindly review and finalize the title of your submission and the author list (including their order). Please use the “edit” version on the HotCRP submission site to make updates. Note the deadline for completing this action is prior to the Camera-ready date.

This information is needed to generate ACM copyright forms, which you need to sign *before* submitting your final camera-ready version. After completing the rights management form, you will be sent rights text and DOI info to add to the paper before the final PDF is generated and submitted.

Note that all accepted papers will be shepherded. Authors must address all reviewers’ comments and submit the final version. Following this, the shepherd will provide final approval for the camera-ready version within a week.

**Camera-Ready Submission Instructions**

These instructions apply to papers, short papers, and posters (extended abstracts). Contact proceeding publication chair Surbhi Palande for questions.

When authors submit their eRights forms to ACM, they receive confirmation messages that include the appropriate copyright text & DOI (document identifier) for their papers. Once complete, the camera-ready paper should be submitted through HotCRP.

Please follow these guidelines:

*   Make sure fonts are type 1 (scalable), NOT Type 3 (bit-mapped), and embedded within the document. More details can be found in General Instructions for Proceedings Volumes at www.acm.org/publications/gi-proceedings-current, item #8.
*   Authors must use the ACM classification system. For details see https://dl.acm.org/ccs and instructions in the paper template.
*   Please include paper keywords (specified with the \keywords command in (La)TeX).
*   Please include a short ABSTRACT section for posters. Do not put your entire extended abstract under this section.
*   Papers/posters must not include page numbers in the final manuscript and there is no need to include the “ACM Reference” (to remove these, you may need to use \settopmatter{printacmref=false,printfolios=false}.
*   Be sure that there are no bad page or column breaks, meaning no widows (last line of a paragraph at the top of a column). Section and subsection headings should remain with at least 2 lines of body text when near the end of a page or column.
*   Include the DOI in your paper that you received from ACM (use \acmDOI{####}) and update the ISBN data: \acmISBN{979-8-4007-1181-7}
*   The camera-ready version must include the updated copyright text you received from ACM. If you did not see an email referring to the ACM right management form, please check your SPAM folders. If this form is not received for a paper before the deadline, then that paper cannot be included in the proceedings.

Notes on adding copyright text:

*   Author(s) receive their copyright text upon completing the eRights form. This information is necessary and must be added to your publication.
*   Depending on this copyright text, the authors can take the following action:
    *   If authors use LaTeX they only need to set the correct option to \setcopyright (follow the eRights system option):
        *   `acmcopyright` ==> The authors transfer the copyright to the ACM (the “traditional” choice).
        *   `acmlicensed` ==>The authors retain the copyright but license the publication rights to ACM.
        *   `rightsretained` ==> The authors retain the copyright and publication rights to themselves or somebody else.
    *   If author(s) use Word they can copy the text they received (the full copyright text is included in the eRights reply)
*   Additionally note that the author can access the correct copyright under their paper edit submission link. At the top there is ‘Final version preparation’, which include the copyright text message. There is also a ‘Latex Instruction’ (collapsed) section with exact LaTeX instructions.
*   You should use the default class without font size and without the anonymous flag – `\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart,10pt}` – this would set 10pt font. Page count remains unchanged.
*   Alongside the camera-ready PDF, you will be required to *submit the source files* for your paper, including ALL files which were used to create the final output (PDF), be they Word, LaTeX, image files, etc. This is mandatory.

The following template contains the required settings: [Concise-Paper-Template.zip](https://www.systor.org/2024/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/08/SYSTOR-2024-Concise-Paper-Template.zip)

**Camera-Ready Submission Checks**

*   Verify all mandatory fields are filled in both HotCRP and the paper itself (title, authors, abstract, keywords, classification, refs)
*   Verify that the correct copyright text is inserted
*   Check formatting, margins, font sizes/types etc.
*   For additional information, refer to: ""www.acm.org/publications/gi-proceedings-current"".

TAP 2024 is the **18th International Conference on Tests and Proofs**, scheduled to take place on **September 9–10, 2024**, in **Milan, Italy**. The conference is part of **FM 2024**.

## Scope

TAP promotes research in verification and formal methods that targets the interplay of static and dynamic analysis techniques with the ultimate goal of improving software and system dependability. Research in verification has seen an increase in heterogeneous techniques and a synergy between the traditionally distinct areas of dynamic and static analysis. There is growing awareness that dynamic techniques such as testing and static techniques such as proving are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. Notable examples that provide evidence for the potential of a combination of static and dynamic analysis are counterexample generation based on symbolic execution, the integration of SAT/SMT-solving in model checking, or the combination of predicate abstraction with exhaustive enumeration. The verification of systems based on machine learning spurs novel combinations of dynamic and static analyses, e.g., property verification of surrogate models that are generated through testing.

TAP’s scope encompasses many aspects of verification technology, including foundational work, tool development, and empirical research. Topics of interest center around the combination of static techniques such as proving and dynamic techniques such as testing.

## Invited Speakers

*   **Rosemary Monahan** (Maynooth University, Ireland)
*   **Rüdiger Ehlers** (TU Clausthal, Germany)

## Topics of Interest

Papers are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:

*   Verification and analysis techniques combining proofs and tests,
*   Static analysis of programs with the aid of dynamic techniques,
*   Deductive techniques supporting the automated generation of test vectors and oracles,
*   Deductive techniques supporting (novel) definitions of coverage criteria,
*   Specification inference by deductive or dynamic methods,
*   Testing and runtime analysis of formal specifications,
*   Search-based techniques for proving and testing,
*   Testing and Verification of systems based on machine learning,
*   Verification of verification tools and environments,
*   Applications of test and proof techniques in new domains,
*   Combined approaches of test and proof in the context of formal certifications (Common Criteria, CENELEC, …),
*   Case studies, tool and framework descriptions, and experience reports

We invite paper submissions from a wide range of perspectives: technical, applied, empirical, theoretical, philosophical, conceptual, and artistic. We welcome contributions from fields including but not limited to: tangible interaction design, embodied interaction design, embedded computing, digital fabrication, hybrid craft, e-textiles, wearables, haptics, robotics, smart cities, smart materials, and sustainability.

## Theme: 'Tide + Tied'

As this year's theme is 'Tide + Tied', we invite submissions that explore interdisciplinary knowledge, bridging the physical and digital, technology and humanity, resurgence and convergence, and beyond. We expect submissions to be clearly framed within the rapidly developing tangible, embedded, and embodied interaction field. Works framed as research through design and more technical contributions are particularly welcome.

## Contribution Types

Authors are invited to submit high-quality papers that contribute to advancing this rapidly developing field. Accepted submissions of all contribution types will be included as papers in the conference proceedings, which will be available in the ACM Digital Library.

*   **Artifact:** Research artifacts that advance the state of the art in Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction.
*   **Method:** Tools, approaches and techniques that enable researchers, technologists, designers and practitioners to study, research and work in Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction.
*   **Theory:** Explorations, extensions, refutations, instantiations and other developments of and to the theories pertaining to Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction.
*   **Empirical:** Studies and data that add to our understanding of Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction.

## Paper Length

Authors are encouraged to submit a paper with a length proportional to its contribution. While there is no maximum or minimum length for papers, the length of typical submissions is expected to be approximately **7,000–8,000 words** excluding references, figure/table captions, and appendices. Papers should be succinct but thorough in presenting the work. Shorter, more focused papers are encouraged and will be reviewed like any other paper.

## Important Dates

*   **Abstract Deadline:** July 31, 2025, AoE
*   **Full Submission Deadline:** August 7, 2025, AoE

*   **TEI 2026 Conference:** March 8-11, 2025

## Submission Guidelines

*   **ACM Format Requirements:** TEI 2026 uses the new ACM workflow TAPS for submission templates and published papers. TAPS requires the use of a simplified one-column template for submission, while the final two-column paper will be rendered for publication after acceptance. We strongly recommend using the LaTeX templates rather than Word. Papers do not have a page limit. All relevant information, including submission templates in Word and LaTeX, can be found here: [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions)
*   **Authorship Policy:** Your submission must be original and cannot have been published or be under concurrent review elsewhere. Avoid using text generated by AI-tools; if used, disclose in the acknowledgements. Refer to the [ACM policy on authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship).
*   **Anonymization Policy:** All papers must be anonymized for review. Author and affiliation sections must be left blank. Remove identifying information from the document's metadata and the acknowledgements section. Citations to previous work should be left unanonymized, but authors are encouraged to cite their own work in the third person.
*   **Submission:** All abstracts and full papers must be submitted electronically via the Precision Conference (PCS) website before their respective deadlines. Authors must select their preferred presentation format (talk, demo, poster).

## Review Process

Each paper will be assigned a primary AC (1AC) and a secondary AC (2AC). The 1AC will find two external reviewers. Each paper will receive 3 detailed reviews. The 1AC will write a meta-review, and then present a recommendation to the Program Chairs. Program Chairs will make the final decision.

## After Acceptance

Authors of accepted papers must present their work at the conference. Accepted papers will be included in the Proceedings of TEI 2026 and available in the ACM Digital Library. Authors are responsible for obtaining permissions for licensed content and images, and must grant permission to record/stream their presentations.

## Policy on Use of Large Language Models

Text and images generated from a large-scale language model (LLM) must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author's own text. Disclose LLM use in the acknowledgements section. Submissions with undisclosed LLM use may be desk-rejected.

## Submission Site

We will use OpenReview to manage the submissions and reviewing.

All listed authors must have an up-to-date OpenReview profile, properly attributed with current and past institutional affiliation, homepage, Google Scholar, DBLP, ORCID, LinkedIn, Semantic Scholar (wherever applicable). The OpenReview profile will be used to handle conflict of interest and paper matching. Submissions will not be made public on OpenReview during the reviewing period.

Abstracts and papers can be submitted through the OpenReview link: [https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/TheWebConf/2024/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=ACM.org/TheWebConf/2024/Conference).

## Scope

The scope of the conference is the Web and how it has crucially enabled new research and applications. While the Web feeds on and is part of a broader interdisciplinary ecosystem, including technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and many others, it remains a distinct scholarly field, with its own research methods, tools, and challenges.

A typical Web Conference paper should have explicit focus on at least one of the following:

*   understanding, evaluating, and improving the Web as a technical infrastructure; including core Web technologies, standards, and platforms
*   understanding, evaluating, and improving the Web as a socio-economic system;
*   understanding better the impact of the Web and Web technologies;
*   democratizing access to Web content and technologies, making it more accessible, fair, inclusive, and accountable to a wide range of audiences.

> **Relevance Note:** Every submission must clearly state how the work is relevant to the Web and to the track in the first page. Submissions that merely use a Web artifact—e.g., a dataset or a Web Application Programmer Interface (API) or a social network—rather than answering a specific Web-related scientific research challenge, are out of scope and will be desk-rejected.

If more than 9 papers are submitted with the same person listed as an author, the additional papers submitted after the first 9 by submission id, will be desk-rejected.
    *   **Authorship Changes:** The full list of authors, including the ordering, must be finalized at the point of submission. There cannot be any addition, removal, or reordering of authors after submission time. The only changes allowed are the correction of spelling mistakes or new affiliation.
*   **Anonymity:** The review process will be **double-blind**. The submitted document should omit any author names, affiliations, or other identifying information. This may include, but is not restricted to acknowledgments, self-citations, references to prior work by the author(s), and so on. Please use the third-person to identify your own prior work. You may explicitly refer in the paper to organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions and tools.
*   **Formatting Requirements:** Submissions must be in English, in double-column format, and must adhere to the [ACM template and format](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) (also [available in Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/association-for-computing-machinery-acm-sig-proceedings-template/bmvfhcdnxfty)). Word users may use the Word Interim Template and the recommended setting for LaTeX is:
    ```latex
    \documentclass[sigconf, anonymous, review]{acmart}
    ```
    Submissions must be a single PDF file: **8 (eight) pages as main paper**, with unlimited pages for references and an optional Appendix (that can contain details on reproducibility, proofs, pseudo-code, etc). The first 8 pages should be self-contained, since reviewers are not required to read past that.
*   **Originality and Concurrent Submissions:** Submissions must present original work—this means that papers under review at or published/accepted to any peer-reviewed conference/journal with published proceedings cannot be submitted. Submissions that have been previously presented orally, as posters or abstracts-only, or in non-archival venues with no formal proceedings, including workshops or PhD symposia without proceedings, are allowed. Authors may submit anonymized work that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv or SSRN) without citing it. The ACM has a strict [policy against plagiarism, misrepresentation, and falsification](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism-overview) that applies to all publications.
*   **Ethical Use of Data and Informed Consent:** Authors are encouraged to include a section on the ethical use of data and/or informed consent of research subjects in their paper, when appropriate. Authors are subject to all [ACM Publications Policies](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/toc), including [ACM's Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects) (posted in 2021). Please ensure all authors are familiar with these policies. Consult institution regulations for IRB review. Program committee might raise additional concerns even if IRB approved.

> **Note:** Submissions that do not follow these guidelines or do not view or print properly, will be desk-rejected.

## Reviewing Process

*   **Reviewing:** Each paper is submitted to one of the tracks listed above. Papers that do not conform to the conference scope or submission guidelines will be desk-rejected by the track chair (aka Senior Area Chair, SAC). Each submission will receive at least three independent reviews within each track and the process overseen by an Area Chair (AC). Authors may be requested to serve as reviewers.
*   **Rebuttal:** Authors will have the chance to provide a response to the reviews during an author-reviewer discussion period. The ACs and SACs will consider the authors' responses to the points raised by the reviewers to inform acceptance decisions.
*   **Decision:** A range of factors including technical merit, originality, potential impact, quality of execution, quality of presentation, related work, reproducibility of results, and ethics, will be used by the ACs and SACs to make a recommendation. The PC Chairs will make the final decisions.
*   **Transparency:** By submitting paper(s) to The Web Conference 2024, the authors agree that the reviews, meta-reviews, and discussions will be made public in OpenReview for all accepted papers.

## Conflict of Interest (COI) Policy

All authors and reviewers must declare conflicts of interest in OpenReview. You must declare a domain conflict (entered in Education & Career History) for employment at the same institution or company, regardless of geography/location, currently or in the last 12 months. You must declare a personal conflict when the following associations exist:

*   candidate for employment at the same institution or company
*   co-author on book/paper or co-PI on a funded grant/research proposal in the last 24 months
*   active collaborator
*   family relationship or close personal relationship
*   graduate advisee/advisor relationship, regardless of time elapsed since graduation
*   deep personal animosity

In general, authors, PC, the organizing committee, and other volunteers are expected to adhere to [ACM's Conflict of Interest Policy](https://www.acm.org/special-interest-groups/volunteer-resources/acm-conflict-of-interest-policy) as well as the [ACM's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/about-acm/acm-code-of-ethics-and-professional-conduct).

## Publication and Presentation Policies

*   **Publication:** All accepted papers will be allowed the same maximum page length in the proceedings (**12 pages, of which 8 are content pages**), which will be published by ACM and will be accessible via the ACM Digital Library. Accepted papers will require a further revision to meet the requirements of the camera-ready format required by ACM. Camera-ready versions of accepted papers can and should include all information to identify authors, and should acknowledge any funding received that directly supported the presented research. In addition, all papers are required to submit a brief pre-recorded video, which will appear on ACM Digital Library, along with the PDF of the papers.
*   **Registration:** To be included in the proceedings, every accepted paper must be covered by a distinct conference registration, e.g., two papers require two registrations, even if they have overlapping authors. This registration must be Full Conference (5-day) or Main Conference (3-day) registration, at the standard (non-student) in-person rate, payment of which must be completed by the camera-ready deadline. This registration requirement applies universally, regardless of attendance or presentation mode.
*   **Presentation:** Every accepted paper must be presented at the conference. No-show papers may be withdrawn from the proceedings. There will be two forms of presentation:
    *   **Oral Presentation:** Among the accepted papers, a subset will be selected for oral presentation. Generally, oral presentations are expected to be in-person, but a few online presentations may be allowed for authors with significant travel difficulties.
    *   **Poster Presentation:** All papers will be asked to produce a poster on-site. An e-copy will appear on Whova. To facilitate authors in getting their hard-copy posters on-site, the conference offers a local poster printing service for a fee.
*   **Reproducibility:** Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available after the review process. The optional use of the ""Artifacts Available"" badge in ACM's Digital Library is encouraged. If you release any code, dataset, or similar artifact to accompany your paper, and host it in a publicly available, archival repository for research artifacts that provides a Document Object Identifier (DOI), you are welcome to apply for this badge. A special subcommittee will check the artifacts of all accepted papers for availability and relatedness to the paper after the acceptance notification.
