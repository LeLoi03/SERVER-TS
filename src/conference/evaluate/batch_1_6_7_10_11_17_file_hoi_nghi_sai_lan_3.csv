## SCOPE

The mission of ENASE (Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software Engineering) is to be a prime international forum to discuss and publish research findings and IT industry experiences with relation to novel approaches to software engineering. The conference acknowledges evolution in systems and software thinking due to contemporary shifts of computing paradigm to e-services, cloud computing, mobile connectivity, business processes, and societal participation. By publishing the latest research on novel approaches to software engineering and by evaluating them against systems and software quality criteria, ENASE conferences advance knowledge and research in software engineering, including and emphasizing service-oriented, business-process driven, and ubiquitous mobile computing. ENASE aims at identifying most hopeful trends and proposing new directions for consideration by researchers and practitioners involved in large-scale systems and software development, integration, deployment, delivery, maintenance and evolution.

## Tracks

We invite you to submit original contributions to IEEE ICDCS 2025. Papers can be submitted to one of the following tracks:

*   Cloud Computing
*   Distributed Algorithms
*   Big Data, Models & Systems
*   Distributed Fault Tolerance
*   Distributed OS and Middleware
*   Edge Computing
*   IoT + CPS
*   Mobile Computing
*   Security, Privacy and Trust
*   Blockchains/Databases
*   Distributed Systems for AI/ML
*   AI/ML for Distributed Systems
*   Deployed/Emergent Applications & Infrastructures

## Paper Submission

The Paper strand provides the opportunity for researchers to present their new state-of-the-art research in Distributed Computing Systems, which makes, or has the potential to make, a significant contribution to the field.

### Submission Guidelines

*   Papers must be original and unpublished and must not be submitted concurrently for publication elsewhere.
*   All paper submissions should follow the **IEEE 8.5″ x 11″ two-column format** using **10pt fonts** and the IEEE Conference template.
*   Each submission can have up to **eleven (11) pages** (including figures, tables, appendices, and references). Papers exceeding this page limit or with smaller fonts will be desk-rejected without review.
*   The paper review process is **double-blind**. Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submission must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent.
*   While authors can upload their paper to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk. If authors decide to upload their paper to a preprint site, they must make sure that the title and abstract of their submission to ICDCS are different from the title and abstract of the preprint version, so that it is not immediately obvious that the two versions are by the same authors and with the same content.
*   To encourage reproducibility, we encourage the authors, whenever it is possible, to include in their paper a link to an anonymised GitHub repository with all source code, scripts and data needed for the reproduction of their results.
*   For each accepted paper, at least one author is required to pay a **full author registration** and attend the conference **in-person to present their work on-site**. Any no-show papers will be reported to the publisher and removed from the conference proceedings. For authors with multiple papers accepted by the conference, a separate author registration is required for each paper.
*   Authors should adhere to ethics and professional standards of IEEE. Please refer to IEEE Code of Ethics and [IEEE Policy of AI-Generated Text](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/guidelines-and-policies/submission-and-peer-review-policies/#ai-generated-text).

## Publication Opportunity

A set of highly selected IEEE ICDCS 2025 papers will be considered for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems (TPDS). The selected papers will undergo an extension process, transforming them from their initial IEEE ICDCS conference format. These extended versions will then be subject to a review by an editor from IEEE TPDS.

    *   Edge AI and its implications for system latency, power, and complexity
    *   Human-machine interaction, including gesture recognition and voice-based systems
    *   IoT and CPS for sustainability, such as smart grids and energy management

8.  **Visions, Experiences, Tools, Datasets, and Benchmarks (Optional Short Paper Format)**
    *   Visions, grand challenges, or new directions
    *   Experiences, insights, challenges, and lessons learned from real-world deployments
    *   Benchmarks for evaluating systems, models, algorithms, or tools
    *   Tools, toolkits, or frameworks that advance research in embedded AI and sensing systems

### Category 8: Visions, Experiences, Tools, Datasets, and Benchmarks

Authors submitting papers in the 8th category may choose to submit either as a **full paper (12 pages)** or a **short paper (6 pages)**. Short papers will be evaluated based on the originality of their ideas, potential impact, and clarity of presentation, even without extensive evaluations. Similar to full papers, accepted short papers will be presented orally at the conference.

## Submission Guidelines

Submitted papers must be unpublished and must not be currently under review for any other publication.

*   **Page Limits:** At most **12 pages (full papers)** or **6 pages (short papers)**, single-spaced 8.5” x 11” with **10-pt font size** (override default font of 9-pt) in two-column format, including figures and tables. References may extend beyond these limits.
*   **Formatting:** Submissions must use the [LaTeX](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) (preferred) or [Word](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions) styles found here. LaTeX submissions should use the `acmart.cls` template (sigconf option), with the 10-pt font.
*   **Anonymization:** Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions. Although submission is double-blind, the existence or availability of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv or other preprint servers) will not lead to your paper being rejected. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest.
*   **Format:** All submissions must be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF).
*   **Ethical Considerations:** Papers describing experiments on human subjects or analyzing nonpublic human subject data should briefly describe how the research protocol addresses ethical considerations and whether their work was vetted by an ethics review (e.g., IRB approval). Authors are expected to follow the rules of their host institutions around data collection and experiments with human subjects.

## Camera-ready Manuscript Details

Please note that ACM uses **9-pt fonts** in all conference proceedings, and the style (both LaTeX and Word) implicitly defines the font size to be 9-pt. Authors should adhere, as much as possible, to the original **12 + reference pages** limits for full papers. Accepted papers will be available on the ACM digital library on the first day of the conference.

## Submission System

Please submit your contributions through the [ACM SenSys 2025 Conference Submission System](https://sensys25.hotcrp.com/).

In 2025, the IEEE Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training (CSEE&T) will replace ICSE’s traditional education track (SEET). CSEE&T 2025 will be co-located with ICSE 2025, taking place on **Monday, April 28 and Tuesday, April 29, 2025**, in **Ottawa, Ontario, Canada**. By joining forces, the goal is to bring together the two communities best placed to address the many challenges of educating the next generation of software engineers.

CSEE&T 2025 aims to solicit, review, and publish original high-quality contributions addressing challenges, innovations, and best practices in software engineering education and training. All types of software engineering education are of interest, including primary and secondary education, university education (undergraduate and graduate levels), coding clubs, hackathons, bootcamps, industrial training, informal study, and life-long learning.
