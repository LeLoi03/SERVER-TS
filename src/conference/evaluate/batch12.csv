The 20th International Symposium on Parameterized and Exact Computation (IPEC 2025) invites papers presenting original research in the area of parameterized and exact algorithms and complexity.

Papers can be submitted via Easychair: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ipec2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ipec2025) (please see submission and coi guidelines below).

## Topics

The topics include but are not limited to:

*   new techniques for the design and analysis of parameterized and exact algorithms;
*   fixed-parameter tractability and kernelization results;
*   parameterized complexity theory;
*   parameterized (in)approximability results;
*   relationships between parameterized complexity and traditional complexity classifications;
*   applications of parameterized and exact computation;
*   engineering and experimentation of exact, parameterized, and kernelization algorithms.

## Important Dates

*   Abstract submission / paper registration: **June 27th** (23:59 AoE)
*   Submission deadline: **June 30th** (23:59 AoE)
*   Notification: **August 7th**
*   IPEC dates: **Sept. 17—19** (Wed-Fri)
*   Camera-ready version: **October 10th** (23:59 AoE)
*   *AoE=Anywhere on Earth (UTC-12)*

## Submission Guidelines

*   Each submission is required to be in the `LIPIcs` format; no changes to font size, page margins, etc., are permitted. Line numbers must be activated.
*   We welcome submissions of the full version of the paper. Regardless, the first **12 pages** of the submission (excluding the title page) should be enough to assess the paper and contain a summary of the main results, their motivation and importance, and evidence of their correctness. In particular, PC members and potential subreviewers may treat the first 12 pages as the short version (the rest being read at their discretion).
*   Results previously published in conference proceedings or a journal (or scheduled for publication prior to IPEC) or under simultaneous submission will not be considered.
*   PC members (outside the PC chairs) are allowed to author or coauthor submissions.
*   **Double-blind reviewing:** As in previous years, IPEC 2025 employs a lightweight double-blind reviewing process. Submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. In particular, authors’ names, affiliations, and email addresses should not appear at the beginning or in the body of the submission. Authors should ensure that any references to their own related work is in the third person (e.g., not “We build on our previous work …” but rather “We build on the work of …”). The purpose of the double-blind reviewing is to help PC members and external reviewers come to an initial judgement about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For example, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web, submit them to arXiv, and give talks on their research ideas. In case there exist publicly available versions of the submission online, the authors might mention this in their submission (without providing references/links), and briefly explain the differences if any. Alternatively, they might communicate the details to the chairs, who will keep them confidential unless revealing them to the PC is needed for a fair judgement. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the PC chairs.

## Conflicts of Interest

IPEC takes conflicts of interest, both real and perceived, seriously. Authors are responsible for declaring conflicts of interest with any of the PC members.

You have a conflict of interest with:

*   family members and close friends;
*   Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoc or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past 5 years;
*   people with the same affiliation;
*   involved in an alleged incident of harassment (it is not required that the incident be reported);
*   reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter); and
*   frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.

## Conference and Paper Publication

Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the symposium, and to incorporate the comments from the program committee.

The conference proceedings will be published in the **Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs)** series after the conference (post-proceedings).

The final submission will be made in LIPIcs format, with a higher page limit of **15 pages** plus bibliography (no appendix). More details will follow from LIPIcs upon acceptance. The submissions will be published as post-proceedings.

## Awards

A **best paper award** and a **best student paper award** may be conferred. All submissions are eligible for the best paper award, except submissions co-authored by PC members. Submissions of which all authors are students at the time of submission are also eligible for the best student paper award. Papers meeting the requirement for the best student paper award should indicate this during submission.

Besides the best paper and best student paper award, during the IPEC conference, the [IPEC Nerode Prize](https://eatcs.org/index.php/nerode-prize) will be conferred. The winner(s) will be chosen by a separate award committee; please refer to the webpage for details.",sub: 2/3

## Review Process

The review process will have two cycles under a single submission deadline:

### Review Cycle I (Submission to Initial Notification)

Submissions will be assigned to two members of the ISMAR 2025 International Program Committee (IPC). Submissions that violate the submission guidelines will be desk rejected. Those that are not desk rejected will receive at least three full reviews.

Based on reviews and discussions, the Program Chairs will make one of the following initial recommendations:

*   **Revise and Resubmit:** These submissions will go through a second review cycle. A revise and resubmit recommendation does not guarantee acceptance.
*   **Reject:** Authors may resubmit rejected papers to the poster track.

### Review Cycle II (Revision with Rebuttal to Final Decision)

Authors will have time to revise their submissions and write a rebuttal. The revised submission and rebuttal will be reviewed, leading to a final recommendation by the committee.

## Update

**2025-03-06:** One week submission extension, submissions now due **2025-03-18 (AoE UTC-12h)**.

## Expanded Scope

Continuing from ISMM 2024, we are excited to announce the continued expanded scope of ISMM this year to encourage submissions and participation from related fields such as **computer architecture** and **computer systems** in addition to our core PL community!

## Solicitation

The 2025 ACM SIGPLAN International Symposium on Memory Management (ISMM 2025) is soliciting full-length submissions covering new work on all memory management related topics in both software and hardware (and their cooperation), as well as papers presenting confirmations or refutations of important prior results.

In addition to regular papers, traditionally submitted to ISMM, we also invite submissions of the following kinds:

*   **Surveys and comparative analyses** that shed new light on previously published techniques.
*   **Practitioner reports**, describing experience with memory management in production. Such papers are not expected to provide novel research contributions, but they should not have been previously published.
*   **Intellectual abstracts**, where researchers share designs, algorithms, or theory that may be interesting to the memory management community, but not yet evaluated.

Please indicate whether the paper is a regular paper, a survey, a practitioner report, or an intellectual abstract, by using a subtitle. For example, for a regular paper, include on of the following on the line below the title line:

`\subtitle{This submission is a regular paper},
\subtitle{This submission is a survey},
\subtitle{This submission is a practitioner report},
\subtitle{This submission is an intellectual abstract}.`

ISMM 2025 will be colocated with [PLDI 2025](https://pldi25.sigplan.org/).

## Areas of Interest

Areas of interest include but are not limited to (in no particular order):

*   Garbage collection algorithms and implementations
*   Memory allocation and de-allocation
*   Memory system design and analysis (both software and hardware)
*   Hardware support for memory management
*   Memory management for large-scale data-intensive systems
*   Memory management at datacenter and cloud scales
*   Formal analysis and verification of memory management algorithms
*   Compiler analyses to aid memory management
*   Tools to analyze memory usage and characteristics of programs
*   Empirical analysis of memory intensive programs
*   Formal analysis and verification of memory intensive programs
*   Memory management for machine learning systems
*   Programming and management of emerging or persistent memories
*   Caches, memory controllers, memory hierarchies and their management
*   Cache coherence and memory consistency
*   Processing in memory (including processing near and using memory)
*   Memory technology and architecture (SRAM, DRAM, flash, NVM, emerging technologies)
*   Security and privacy of memory systems
*   Robustness of memory systems
*   Low-latency and low-energy memory systems

The symposium welcomes industry practitioners presenting their recent practice and findings in memory management related to real-world deployments.

## Submission Link

[https://ismm25.hotcrp.com](https://ismm25.hotcrp.com)

## Formatting Instructions

*   All papers must be submitted on-line in **Portable Document Format (PDF)**.
*   Papers should be formatted according to the **two-column ACM proceedings format**. Each paper should have no more than **12 pages**, excluding bibliography, in **10pt font**.
*   There is no limit on the page count for references. Each reference must list all authors of the paper (do not use et al).
*   The citations should be in **numeric style**, e.g., `[52]`.
*   Submissions should be in PDF format and printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper.
*   Make sure that figures and tables are legible, even after the paper is printed in gray-scale.
*   Appendices should not be part of the paper, but should be submitted as supplementary material. Supplementary material should also be anonymized, as described below.
*   As explained in more detail at [http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author), authors should use the `sigplan` subformat of the `acmart` format. Please note the following:
    ```latex
    \documentclass[sigplan,10pt,review,anonymous]{acmart}
    \settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}
    ```
*   The default citation style is numeric.
*   Do not mess with the class file or settings to try to sneak in additional space.
*   Do not use the PACMPL files or format; ISMM is not using them.

Papers that exceed the length requirement or deviate from the expected format will be rejected.

## Double-Blind Reviewing

ISMM uses **double-blind reviewing**. This means that author names and affiliations must be omitted from the submission. Additionally, if the submission refers to prior work done by the authors, that reference should be made in third person. These are firm submission requirements. Any supplementary material must also be anonymized.

An earlier FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing clarifies the policy for the most common scenarios. But there are many gray areas and trade-offs – [FAQ on Double-Blind Reviewing](https://pldi23.sigplan.org/track/pldi-2023-pldi#FAQ-on-Double-Blind-Reviewing). If you have any doubts about how to interpret the double-blind rules, or any cases that are not fully covered by the FAQ, please contact the Program Chairs. In complex cases, it is better to get guidance from the Program Chairs than to risk summary rejection.

## Declaring Conflicts

When submitting the paper, you will need to declare potential conflicts. Conflicts should be declared between an adviser and an advisee (e.g., Ph.D., post-doc). Other conflicts include institutional conflicts, financial conflicts of interest, friends or relatives, or any recent co-authors on papers and proposals (last 2 years).

Please do not declare spurious conflicts: such incorrect conflicts are especially harmful if the aim is to exclude potential reviewers, so spurious conflicts can be grounds for rejection. If you are unsure about a conflict, please consult the Program Chair.

## Publication Date

AUTHORS TAKE NOTE: The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of your conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

## Author Response

The author response process will occur in **April 2025**, and will give the authors an opportunity to respond to factual errors in reviews before the Program Committee meets to make its decisions.

## Important Dates (AoE - UTC-12h)

*   **Paper submission:** Tue 18 Mar 2025
*   **Author response period:** Wed 23 - Fri 25 Apr 2025
*   **Author notification:** Sat 3 May 2025
*   **Camera-ready papers due:** Thu 15 May 2025

## Submission Instructions

Registration and submission should be done on the [ISPASS 2025 AE HotCRP site](https://ispass2025ae.hotcrp.com/).

An artifact submission consists of two parts:

1.  **Paper and a two-page appendix:** Prepare your appendix using the provided template. The appendix should include an abstract, metainformation, artifact access details, system requirements, experiment workflow, steps for evaluation, and results. This appendix does not count towards the regular page limit.
2.  **The artifact:** Ensure the artifact evaluation committee can access your artifact. For submission, providing code via convenient means like GitHub is sufficient. To earn the ""Available"" badge, you must upload your artifact to a public archival website.

## Badges

The availability of artifacts will be denoted by the following IEEE Reproducibility Badges:

*   **Available:** Reasonable and complete code and/or datasets, including data and documentation, provided by authors to support reproducibility.
*   **Reviewed:** Reasonable and complete code and/or datasets that run to produce described outputs and support reproducibility.
*   **Reproducible:** Computational results regenerated by an independent party using author-created research objects, methods, code, and analysis conditions. Assumes artifacts were also reviewed.

Artifacts can be **Code** or **Datasets**. A paper can have both.

## Earning the ""Available"" Badge

To earn the ""Available"" badge, artifacts must be uploaded to either [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) to ensure long-term archival storage and provide a persistent identifier (DOI).

## Artifact Evaluation Process

*   Artifacts will be evaluated by a dedicated Artifacts Evaluation (AE) committee through a **single-blind review process**.
*   Authors should be available to respond quickly during the evaluation period.
*   The evaluation is restricted to **accepted papers** at ISPASS 2025.
*   The committee may communicate with authors (anonymously through the submission platform) to provide feedback and allow authors to address issues.
*   Authors are recommended to document artifacts thoroughly to minimize interaction.
*   For artifacts requiring significant computation time, provide a shortcut or sampling mechanism.
*   For system requirements that cannot be met by a standard computer, authors are responsible for providing remote access (e.g., via SSH) with proper anonymization.

## Distinguished Artifact Award

All submitted artifacts will compete for a ""Distinguished Artifact Award"" based on reproducibility, ease of use, documentation, extensibility, and substantial support for the paper's claims.
