The 35th European Symposium on Programming (ESOP 2026) is an annual conference devoted to fundamental issues in the specification, design, analysis, and implementation of programming languages and systems. ESOP 2026 is part of the ETAPS 2026, taking place in **Turin, Italy, April 11–16, 2026**

## Scope

ESOP seeks contributions on all aspects of programming language research including, but not limited to, the following areas:

*   Programming paradigms and styles
*   Methods and tools to specify and reason about programs and languages
*   Programming language foundations
*   Methods and tools for implementation, concurrency and distribution
*   Applications and emerging topics

Contributions bridging the gap between theory and practice are particularly welcome.

## Important Dates

ESOP 2026 features a two-round submission scheme.

**Round 1:**

*   **Submission deadline:** June 3, 2025
*   **Rebuttal:** July 21-23, 2025
*   **Notification:** August 1, 2025

**Round 2:**

*   **Submission deadline:** October 16, 2025
*   **Rebuttal:** December 8-10, 2025
*   **Notification:** December 22, 2025

Please note that the deadlines are firm and will not be extended!

## Submission Categories

ESOP 2026 solicits three forms of contributions:

*   **Research Papers:** Articles that advance the state-of-the-art on the theory and practice of programming languages and systems. Submitted research papers may be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, ACM’s PACMPL, or ACM’s TOPLAS format. There is no page limit for submissions, but authors should be aware that reviewers are likely to balance the review time for all papers and that camera-ready papers may not exceed **25 pages** (excluding bibliography) and must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS.
*   **Experience Reports:** Articles reporting on systems and techniques developed in practice, such as artifacts, tools, mechanized proofs, and educational systems, both in academic and industrial settings. These articles must include a critical evaluation of the experience reported. Submitted and camera-ready experience report papers must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, not exceeding **15 pages** (excluding bibliography).
*   **Fresh Perspectives:** Articles that promote new insights on programming languages and systems in a particularly elegant way. These papers may offer new tutorial perspectives of known concepts, or they may introduce fresh new insights and ideas that could lead to relevant future developments. Submitted and camera-ready fresh perspective papers must be formatted in Springer’s LNCS, not exceeding **15 pages** (excluding bibliography).

The paper review process will be double-blind. Authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions, and they should not identify themselves either explicitly or by implication (e.g., through the references or acknowledgments).

Accepted papers will be published in Springer’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Springer’s formatting style files and other information can be found on the Springer website.

The papers can be submitted [here](https://esop26.hotcrp.com/).

## Paper Submission And Evaluation

We welcome paper submissions at both submission rounds. Submissions of each round will be reviewed by the PC and external reviewers for their technical soundness and originality.

Round 1 submissions will receive one of three outcomes: Accept, Reject, Revise. In the latter case, the PC will provide a concrete list of revision requests to be completed by the Round 2 submission deadline. Such revised submissions will be reviewed by the same set of reviewers and will either be accepted or rejected. Rejected Round 1 submissions may NOT be resubmitted to Round 2.

Papers submitted directly to Round 2 will either be accepted or rejected.

## Artifact Evaluation

ESOP 2026 will have a post-paper-acceptance voluntary artifact evaluation. Authors will be encouraged to submit artifacts for evaluation after paper notification. The outcome will not alter the paper acceptance decision.

Detailed information will be announced later.

## Journal-First Submissions

We welcome research papers submitted via a Journal-First channel at TOPLAS.

*   Authors submit their papers directly to TOPLAS before the Round 1 submission deadline, and in their cover letter indicate that they want their paper to be considered as an ESOP Journal-First paper.
*   Reviewing is handled exclusively by TOPLAS.
*   (Optionally, but highly recommended:) Authors notify the ESOP PC chair of their TOPLAS submission, so that the PC chair can follow up with the TOPLAS editor-in-chief about the status of these submissions.
*   If a TOPLAS Journal-First paper is accepted before the end of the Round 2 rebuttal period date, and the ESOP PC agrees, it may be presented at ETAPS.

## Journal-After Submissions

Revised and expanded versions of accepted ESOP research papers are eligible for the ESOP Journal-After TOPLAS channel. A call will open in January after the ESOP notification. More details will be provided at a later moment.",

The 17th ACM SIGCHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computing Systems

EICS 2025 is the seventeenth international ACM SIGCHI conference devoted to engineering interactive computing systems and their user interfaces, addressing one or more software quality factors, such as usability, user experience, reliability, security, etc.

### About EICS

EICS focuses on models, languages, notations, methods, techniques and tools that support designing, developing, validating and verifying interactive systems. The conference brings together people who study or practice the engineering of interactive systems, drawing from design, HCI, software engineering, requirements engineering, software development, modeling, and programming.

### Contributions

EICS Full Papers and Technical Notes are published as articles in the Journal Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction (PACM - EICS series). There are three submission deadlines per year, and authors can choose when to submit. Papers follow the traditional journal model of reviewing: papers may be accepted after submission and review, or may be recommended for revisions and re-submission to the next round to enable authors to refine papers based on reviewer recommendations.

Submissions for the journal of this venue should present original and mature research work within the scope of the conference. Note that accepted journal papers can be either regular research papers, or technical notes. Technical Notes are shorter, more focused contributions, that focus specifically on system contributions and technical work. Elucidating technical details of complex interactive systems, preferably ensuring the work can be reproduced or put to practice, is a primary objective of a Technical Note. Tech Notes require an illustrative example of the system, and they can, but do not need to, be validated by formal user evaluations or user studies. Validation can also be done through e.g. simulation, feasibility, or comparisons. Tech Notes will be judged on their technical merits and relevance to interactive systems concerns.

There are no length restrictions on Full Papers and Technical Notes, nor any limit to the number of references that may be included. We advise authors to ensure the length of their papers is in function of the contributions. Concise and clear is often to be preferred over lengthy and verbose.

### Topics

Submissions advance the state of the art of the engineering of interactive systems. Topics include, but are not limited to:

*   Modeling, specification and analysis of interaction and interactive systems
*   Requirements engineering for interactive systems
*   Methods, processes, principles and/or tools for building interactive systems (e.g., design, implementation, prototyping, evaluation, verification and validation, testing)
*   Software architectures for interactive systems
*   Formal methods within interactive systems engineering
*   Bridging the gap between engineering and design practices
*   Engineering design and evaluation tools
*   Computational techniques for designing and evaluating interactive systems
*   Interactive data-driven systems
*   Explore and/or employ of diverse interaction techniques and devices (e.g., adaptive, context-aware, tangible, haptic, touch and multitouch input, voice, gestures, recognition of physiological signals, multimodal input, mobile and wearable systems, virtual, augmented, mixed and extended reality)
*   Engineering hardware or software integration in interactive systems (e.g., fabrication and maker processes, physical computing, cyber-physical systems)
*   Engineering interactive systems for diverse user groups (e.g., children, elderly, people with disabilities,…)
*   Engineering collaborative multi-user interactive systems
*   Engineering interactive systems embedding AI-technologies
*   Engineering interaction-driven AI-technologies
*   Applying AI technologies in methods, processes and tools for building interactive systems in all stages of the engineering lifecycle

A newcomer’s guide to EICS is available in the paper by López Jaquero et al.

### Submission Information

Full Papers and Technical Notes should be written in the ACM format, see [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions)

Papers are submitted using [https://new.precisionconference.com](https://new.precisionconference.com)

### Anonymization Policy

The papers review process is based on reviewing where the identities of both the authors and reviewers are kept hidden (but ACs know these details). Authors are expected to remove author and institutional identities from the title and header areas of the paper, as noted in the submission instructions (Note: changing the text color of the author information is not sufficient). Also, please make sure that identifying information does not appear in the document’s meta-data (e.g., the ‘Authors’ field in your word processor’s ‘Save As’ dialog box). In addition, we require that the acknowledgments section be left blank as it could also easily identify the authors and/or their institution.

Further suppression of identity in the body of the paper is left to the authors’ discretion. We do expect that authors leave citations to their previous work unanonymized so that reviewers can ensure that all previous research has been taken into account by the authors. However, authors are required to cite their own work in the third person, e.g., avoid “As described in our previous work [10], ... ” and use instead “As described by [10], ...”

### Properly Formatting Citations

Authors are kindly requested to include references reporting the correct publication to facilitate the citation indexing, in particular for conferences publishing papers on journals such as PACM. For instance, a (fictional) full paper presented at EICS 2025 should be referenced as follows.

John Doe, Jane Smith. 2025. Enhancing User Experience in Interactive Systems. Proc. ACM Hum.-Comput. Interact. 7, EICS, Article 123 (jun 2025), 16 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/123456

Please do not refer to the paper as follows:

It aims to bring together researchers from CP, AI, and OR to present new techniques, applications, and theoretical insights, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative problem-solving.","# CPAIOR 2025: Call for Papers

The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research (CPAIOR) will be held in **Melbourne, Australia from November 10 to November 13, 2025.**

CPAIOR 2025 will be co-located with [ICAPS 2025](https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/home/).

The aim of the conference is to promote a space where researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Operations Research (OR) present innovative techniques, new applications, and original cutting-edge ideas, thereby encouraging researchers from one area to learn from the others.

Of particular interest to the conference are papers that integrate concepts and methodologies from these different fields, either proposing interesting new techniques for complex/practical problems or expanding our theoretical insights and cross-field understanding. However, high-quality original papers from a single area are welcome when also relevant to the other communities involved. The conference also strongly encourages regular papers or experience reports showcasing CP/AI/OR techniques on challenging real-world applications.

The program committee invites submissions that include, but are far from limited to, the following topics:

*   New methodologies in the interface between predictive and prescriptive pipelines, such as machine learning techniques applied to tackle optimization problems and, conversely, CP/OR techniques to address AI and machine learning tasks.
*   Novel relaxation and inference methods based on constraint propagation, polyhedral techniques/cutting planes, convex/second-order conic optimization, graph-based algorithms, dynamic programming, and decision diagrams for optimization.
*   New search perspectives involving enumeration/branch-and-bound strategies, innovative decomposition techniques (e.g., based on column generation/Benders), intelligent backtracking, incomplete search, and learning-based heuristics.
*   Advanced integrated methods that expose new model transformations, communication strategies across MIP/CP/SAT solvers, distributed solution techniques, and solver selection (e.g., portfolio approaches).
*   Innovative models and applications of CP/AI/OR techniques.
*   Implementation or evaluation of CP/AI/OR techniques and optimization systems.

## Submission Types

Submissions are of two types:

*   **Regular papers** (submitted for publication and presentation)
    *   Long papers (at most 15 pages plus references)
    *   Short papers (at most 8 pages plus references)
*   **Extended abstracts** (submitted for presentation only) (one or two pages in length)

Submissions to CPAIOR are single blind. In a single-blind review process, the author names are not hidden for the reviewers, but the reviewer names are hidden for the authors.

The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. All regular papers should be prepared in the format used for that series ([LNCS instructions](TBA)).

## Important Dates

All deadlines are the end of the day AoE (anywhere on Earth).

*   **Abstracts (Regular Papers):** December 8, 2024
*   **Full papers (Regular Papers):** December 15, 2024 (no extension possible)
*   **Rebuttal Phase:** January 26-29, 2025

*   **Master Class:** Monday, November 10, 2025
*   **Conference:** Tuesday, November 11–Thursday, November 13, 2025

Papers submitted to CPAIOR must not be under review at a different venue at the same time during the reviewing period. Abstracts can be submitted if the paper is still under review elsewhere, but the paper will have to be withdrawn by the full paper submission deadline from CPAIOR or the other venue.

The 21st European Conference on Modelling Foundations and Applications (**ECMFA**) will be held in **Koblenz, Germany, June 10-11, 2025**, as part of STAF 2025 (Software Technologies: Applications and Foundations).

ECMFA is dedicated to advancing the state of knowledge and fostering the application of all aspects of Model-Based Engineering (MBE).

## Aims and Scope

The focus is on engaging key figures from research and industry in a dialogue that will result in stronger and more effective practical application of MBE, producing more reliable software based on state-of-the-art research results.

We invite high-quality submissions of technical research papers describing original and unpublished results related to MBE.

## Submission Types

We are soliciting papers presenting original research on all aspects of model-based engineering. Two types of submissions are possible:

*   **Foundation Papers:** dealing with modeling foundations, such as metamodeling, model transformations, model validation, verification and testing, model engineering methods and tools, and related aspects.
*   **Application Papers:** dealing with the application of modeling techniques, including experience reports on the use of MBE methods and tools, industrial case studies, or successful applications of MBE practices in industry or in public administration, with significant modeling lessons learned. All applications must have been done in real contexts and at least one of the authors of the paper must be from the company or administration where the application took place.

## Submission Process

*   Submissions must conform to the JOT LaTeX template ([https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip](https://www.jot.fm/templates/jot.zip)) and must not exceed 14 pages (including figures, references, and appendices). Secondary studies may use 2 additional pages for references only.
*   No simultaneous submission to other publication outlets (either a conference or a journal) is allowed.
*   All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee.
*   All papers have to be submitted electronically in PDF format through Easychair (link to be published).

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   Foundations of MBE, including model transformations, domain-specific languages, verification and validation approaches, etc.
*   Novel paradigms, formalisms, applications, approaches, frameworks, or processes for model-based engineering such as low-code/no-code development, digital twins, etc.
*   Interplay between MBE with and for AI-based systems.
*   Application of MBE methods, tools, and techniques to specific domains, e.g., automotive, aerospace, cyber-physical systems, robotics, Artificial Intelligence or IoT.
*   Successful use of MBE in connection with other disciplines and approaches, such as Artificial Intelligence, DevOps, Open Source, or Safety Assurance.
*   Educational aspects of MBE.
*   Tools and initiatives for the successful adoption of MBE in industry.

## Review Criteria and Process

The program committee will assess all papers for novelty, significance, technical quality, rigor, and suitability for the conference.

Contributions can be submitted to any of the two submission periods. In both rounds, each submitted paper can be recommended by the Program Committee to be accepted-as-is, accepted with minor revisions, undergo major revisions, or rejected.

Papers accepted at any of the two rounds with major or minor revisions will be given a specified period of time to perform the revisions and re-submit. The same reviewers will assess how well the authors have addressed the revision requests and whether the final paper maintains or improves the level of contribution of the original submission.

## Artifacts

Artifacts are recommended but not required, for the initial submission. Reviewers may consider the existence of artifacts as a positive signal.

## Publication

All accepted papers will be published as platinum open-access journal publications in JOT. At least one author for each accepted paper must register before the early registration deadline and present the paper during the conference.

## Important Dates

All dates are AoE (UTC-12h).

A meta review will be provided based on the discussions about the paper.
*   Paper revisions will go through an additional round of reviews before a final decision is made to accept or reject the paper.
*   Revisions: Papers will be invited to submit a revised version of their paper if the PC believes the papers can reasonably be improved within the allocated revision time frame. Authors will have five weeks to prepare their revisions. The revision process is intended to be a constructive interaction between reviewers and authors.

## Inclusions and Diversity in Writing

We value Diversity and Inclusion in our community and profession. Be mindful in your writing of not using language or examples that further the marginalization, stereotyping, or erasure of any group of people, especially historically marginalized and/or under-represented groups (URGs) in computing.

## Conflict of Interest

During submission of a research paper, the submission site will request information about Conflicts of Interest (COI) of the paper’s authors with program committee (PC) members. It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify all (and only) PC members with potential COIs as per the definition provided here. Papers with incorrect or incomplete COI information as of the submission closing time are subject to immediate rejection.

### Definition of Conflict of Interest (COI):

An author X of an ICDE 2025 research paper has a COI with a PC member or Area Chair Y if and only if one or more of the following conditions hold:

*   X is a co-author of another ICDE 2025 submission together with Y.
*   X is a co-author of Y in a publication in the past three years.
*   X has been a co-author of Y for 4 (or more) publications in the last 10 years.
*   X has been a co-worker of Y in the same company or university within the past three years.
*   X has been a collaborator of Y within the past three years (e.g., held a joint grant).
*   X is or was Y’s primary thesis advisor or vice versa, no matter how long ago.
*   X is a relative or a close personal friend of Y (or vice versa).

The onus for correctly declaring COIs rests with the authors who must submit their complete set of COIs for a submission to be considered for review.",Chưa đúng link chính => https://ieee-icde.org/2025/ link 2026 rách

ICDT (International Conference on Database Theory) is a series of international scientific conferences on research of data management theory ([https://databasetheory.org/icdt-pages](https://databasetheory.org/icdt-pages)). Since 2009, it is annually and jointly held with EDBT (Extending DB Technology).

The 29th edition of ICDT, in 2026, is planned to take place in **Tampere, Finland**.

## Topics of Interest

We welcome research papers on every topic related to the principles and theory of data management, provided that there is a clear connection to foundational aspects. This includes, for example, articles on ""classical"" data management topics such as:

*   The theoretical investigation of various aspects of underlying data management systems (e.g., Indexes, Concurrency and recovery, Distributed and parallel databases, Cloud computing, Privacy and security, Graph databases, Data streams and sketching, Data-centric (business) process management and workflows, Data and knowledge integration and exchange, Data provenance, Views, Data warehouses, Domain-specific databases - multimedia, scientific, spatial, temporal, text data, ...),
*   The design and study of data models and query languages,
*   The development and analysis of algorithms for data management,

but also includes papers exploring existing or identifying new connections between data management and other areas, such as the areas of: knowledge representation, semantic web, web services, information retrieval and data mining, machine learning/AI, distributed computing, theoretical computer science.

In all of the above, a clear emphasis on foundational aspects is expected. You may want to check [https://dblp.org/db/conf/icdt/index.html](https://dblp.org/db/conf/icdt/index.html) to get an overview of previous editions of ICDT.

The Program Committee reserves the right to desk reject a submission when it is regarded to be out of scope.

## Submission Cycles and Dates

ICDT will have two submission cycles for 2026, with deadlines as follows:

All times are Anywhere on Earth (UTC + 12)

### ICDT Submission Cycle 1

*   **March 13, 2025:** Abstract submission
*   **March 20, 2025:** Paper submission
*   **June 1, 2025:** Notification

### ICDT Submission Cycle 2

*   **September 3, 2025:** Abstract submission
*   **September 10, 2025:** Paper submission
*   **December 1, 2025:** Notification

Papers rejected in the first submission cycle cannot be submitted to the second submission cycle unless explicitly requested by the reviewers.

## Tracks

1.  **Regular Research Papers** (15 pages, anonymized)

    The results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere, including the proceedings of other symposia or workshops. Papers must be at most 15 pages, excluding references. Additional details may be included in a clearly marked appendix, which, however, will be read at the discretion of the program committee (online appendices are not allowed). Papers not conforming to these requirements may be rejected without further consideration.

2.  **Database Theory in Action** (4 pages, non-anonymized)

    To broaden the scope of ICDT and showcase the impact of database theory, ICDT 2026 includes again a ""Database Theory in Action"" track that calls for short papers illustrating interesting applications of database theory in other domains or in solving real-world problems. These papers will be 4 pages + references, and can be based on a previously published paper at another venue. In particular, we invite papers that demonstrate novel and important connections between database theory and neighboring communities such as Database Systems, Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation, Distributed Computing, and Industry. At the discretion of the program committee, there may be invited papers to this track as well. The title of the papers submitted to this track must start with ""Database Theory in Action:"". These papers should also include clear pointers to all relevant previous publications, websites, tools, repositories, etc.

## Submission Instructions

All submissions will be electronic via EasyChair. Link: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icdt2026](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icdt2026)

Papers must be written in English and provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee to assess their merits. Papers must be submitted as PDF documents, using the LIPIcs style ([http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors](http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/publications/lipics/instructions-for-authors)).

The proceedings will appear in the Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) series, based at Schloss Dagstuhl. This guarantees that the proceedings will be available online and free of charge, while the authors retain the rights over their work.

At least one author of each accepted paper is expected to register at the conference and to present the paper.

## Anonymous Submission

From 2024, ICDT has adopted anonymous submission (only for regular track papers; submissions for the ""database theory in action"" track should not be anonymous), in line with other leading conferences in the database community such as SIGMOD and PODS. The intent of anonymous submission is to ensure that the identity of the authors is not presented to the reviewers during the review process.

Simultaneously, the authors may make their submissions available to the community via pre-print services such as ArXiv and through talks. We do require that work is not labeled as ""under submission at ICDT"" or indicates that it is under review, but otherwise place no restrictions on sharing results. This does not conflict with the anonymous submission requirement.

## Awards

An award will be given to the Best Paper. Also, an award will be given to the Best Newcomer Paper written by newcomers to the field of database theory. The latter award will preferentially be given to a paper written only by students; in that case the award will be called Best Student-Paper Award.

It addresses the need for data with known ground truth to develop, evaluate, and validate computerized image analytic tools and improve the generalizability of deep learning algorithms. The workshop includes topics such as deep learning methods, mechanistic models, and applications of synthetic images. SASHIMI 2025 will also host the SynthRAD2025 Challenge.","# SASHIMI: Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging - Call for Papers

The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) community requires data with known ground truth to develop, evaluate, and validate computerized image analytic tools, as well as to facilitate clinical training. Synthetic data are ideally suited for this purpose. Another motivation to generate synthetic data is to improve the generalizability of deep learning and machine learning algorithms that are affected by domain shift issues.

To generate synthetic data, a full range of models underpinning image simulation and synthesis, also referred to as image translation, cross-modality synthesis, image completion, domain adaptation, etc. have been developed over the years:

*   deep learning methods including fully-supervised, semi-supervised, self-supervised, unsupervised, transfer, and multi-task learning
*   deep learning model architectures including Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), Flows, Transformers, and etc
*   machine learning methods using hand-crafted features
*   detailed mechanistic models (top–down), which incorporate priors on the geometry and physics of image acquisition and formation processes
*   complex spatio-temporal computational models of anatomical variability, organ physiology, and morphological changes in tissues or disease progression
*   applications of synthetic images including improving image quality, segmentation, tracking, detection, registration, and etc.

The goal of the Simulation and Synthesis in Medical Imaging (SASHIMI) workshop is to bring together all those interested in such problems in order to engage in invigorating research, discuss current approaches, and stimulate new ideas and scientific directions in this field. The objectives are to:

*   bring together experts on image synthesis to raise the state of the art
*   hear from invited speakers outside of the MICCAI community, for example in the areas of transfer learning, generative adversarial networks, or variational autoencoders, to cross-fertilize these fields
*   identify challenges and opportunities for further research

We also want to identify the suitable approaches to evaluate the plausibility of synthetic data and to collect benchmark data that could help with the development of future algorithms.

SASHIMI 2025 will host the [SynthRAD2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025!](https://synthrad2025.grand-challenge.org/)

## Submission Guidelines

Submissions will be evaluated according to their relevance, correctness, significance, originality, and clarity. Each submission should explain its contributions in both general and technical terms, clearly identifying what has been accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work. The technical content should be accessible to a broad audience.

PACMPL issue ICFP 2025 also welcomes submissions in two separate categories — **Functional Pearls** and **Experience Reports** — that must be marked as such when submitted and that need not report original research results.

In an effort to achieve a balanced, diverse program, each author may be listed as a (co)author on a maximum of four submissions. Authors who require financial support to attend the conference can apply for PAC funding ([http://www.sigplan.org/PAC/](http://www.sigplan.org/PAC/)).

### Full Double-Blind Reviewing Process

ICFP 2025 will use a full double-blind reviewing process.

*   Authors must omit their names and institutions from their paper submissions.
*   References to authors’ own prior work should be in the third person.
*   Authors must fully anonymize any supplementary material.
*   Links to supplementary material on external websites are not permitted.
*   Authors should not say anything that reveals their identity in responding to reviews.

### Preparation of Submissions

*   **Deadline:** The deadline for submissions is **Thursday, 27 February, 2025**, Anywhere on Earth.
*   **Formatting:** Submissions must be in PDF format, printable in black and white on US Letter sized paper. All submissions must adhere to the “ACM Small” template available from [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions).
*   There is a limit of **25 pages** for a full paper or Functional Pearl and **12 pages** for an Experience Report; in either case, the bibliography and an optional clearly marked appendix will not be counted against these limits.
*   **Submission:** Submissions will be accepted at [https://icfp25.hotcrp.com/](https://icfp25.hotcrp.com/)
*   **Author Response Period:** Authors will have a 96-hour period, starting at 00:00 (midnight) AOE on Monday, 28 April, 2025, to read reviews and respond to them.
*   **Appendix and Supplementary Material:** Authors have the option to include a clearly marked appendix and/or to attach supplementary material to a submission, on the understanding that reviewers may choose not to look at such an appendix or supplementary material. All supplementary material must be anonymised.

### Review Process

ICFP 2025 will employ a two-stage review process. The first stage in the review process will assess submitted papers using the criteria stated above and will allow for feedback and input on initial reviews through the author response period mentioned previously. As a result of the review process, a set of papers will be conditionally accepted and all other papers will be rejected. Authors will be notified of these decisions on **23 May, 2025**.

Authors of conditionally accepted papers will be provided with committee reviews along with a set of mandatory revisions. By **12 June, 2025**, the authors should provide a second revised submission. The second and final reviewing phase assesses whether the mandatory revisions have been adequately addressed by the authors and thereby determines the final accept/reject status of the paper.

### Information for Authors of Accepted Papers

As a condition of acceptance, final versions of all papers must adhere to the ACM Small format. The page limit for the final versions of papers will be increased by two pages to help authors respond to reviewer comments and mandatory revisions: 27 pages plus bibliography for a regular paper or Functional Pearl, 14 pages plus bibliography for an Experience Report.
