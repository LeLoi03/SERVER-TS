The 38th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2025) will take place from **June 30 to July 4, 2025**, in **Lyon, France**.

COLT 2025 invites submissions of papers addressing theoretical aspects of machine learning, broadly defined as a subject at the intersection of computer science, statistics, and applied mathematics. The conference strongly supports an inclusive view of learning theory, including fundamental theoretical aspects of learnability in various contexts and theory that sheds light on empirical phenomena.

## Topics of Interest

The topics include, but are not limited to:

*   Design and analysis of learning algorithms
*   Statistical and computational complexity of learning
*   Optimization methods for learning, including online and stochastic optimization
*   Theory of artificial neural networks, including deep learning
*   Theoretical explanation of empirical phenomena in learning
*   Supervised learning
*   Unsupervised, semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation
*   Learning geometric and topological structures in data, manifold learning
*   Active and interactive learning
*   Reinforcement learning
*   Online learning and decision-making
*   Interactions of learning theory with other mathematical fields

*   Learning from complex data (e.g., networks, time series)
*   Learning in neuroscience, social science, economics, and other subjects

Submissions by authors who are new to COLT are encouraged.

While the primary focus of the conference is theoretical, authors are welcome to support their analysis with relevant experimental results.

## Publication

Accepted papers will be presented at the conference. At least one author of each accepted paper should present the work at the conference. Accepted papers will be published electronically in the Proceedings of Machine Learning Research (PMLR). Authors of accepted papers will have the option of opting out of the proceedings in favor of a 1-page extended abstract, which will point to an open access archival version of the full paper reviewed for COLT.

## Paper Awards

COLT will award both best paper and best student paper awards. To be eligible for the best student paper award, the primary contributor(s) must be full-time students at the time of submission. The program committee may decline to make these awards, or may split them among several papers.

## Dual Submissions Policy

*   **Conferences:** In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to other peer-reviewed conferences with proceedings may not be submitted to COLT.
*   **Journals:** In general, submissions that are substantially similar to papers that have been previously published, accepted for publication, or submitted in parallel to journals may not be submitted to COLT.

## Rebuttal Phase

As in previous years, there will be a rebuttal phase during the review process. Initial reviews will be sent to authors before final decisions have been made. Authors will have an opportunity to address the issues brought up in the reviews.

## Reviewing Philosophy

We strongly encourage constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work. The aim of the reviewing process is to assess whether the work is close to being ready for publication; as such, the interaction between authors and referees is meant to both figure this out and guide the paper into a publishable state.

## Important Dates (2025)

*   **Submission deadline:** February 6, 5:00 PM EST
*   **Reviews released:** March 28
*   **Initial author response due:** April 4
*   **Discussion period:** April 4–11
*   **Author notification:** May 2
*   **Conference dates:** June 30–July 4

## Submission Instructions

### Formatting and Anonymization

The conference focuses on coordination models and languages for modern information systems, addressing the complexity of concurrent, distributed, mobile, and adaptive components.","# Call for Papers: COORDINATION 2025

The **27th International Conference on Coordination Models and Languages (COORDINATION 2025)** is one of the three conferences of [DisCoTec 2025](https://www.discotec.org/2025/). It will be held from **June 16-20, 2025**.

Modern information systems rely increasingly on combining concurrent, distributed, mobile, adaptive, reconfigurable and heterogeneous components. New models, architectures, languages and verification techniques are necessary to cope with the complexity induced by the demands of today’s software development. Coordination languages have emerged as a successful approach, providing abstractions that cleanly separate behaviour from communication, thus increasing modularity, simplifying reasoning, and enhancing software development. This conference provides a well-established forum for researchers interested in models, languages, architectures, and implementation techniques for coordination.

## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest encompass all areas of coordination, including (but not limited to) coordination related aspects of:

*   Theoretical models and foundations for coordination: component composition, concurrency, distribution, mobility; dynamic, spatial and probabilistic aspects of coordination; logic, types, semantics.
*   Coordination of multi-agent and collective systems: models, languages, infrastructures, self-adaptation, self-organisation, distributed solving, collective intelligence and emerging behaviour.
*   Coordination and modern distributed computing: web services, microservices, peer-to-peer networks, grid computing, context-awareness, ubiquitous computing, mobile computing, reversible computing.
*   Session-based programming: models, languages, behavioural types, and tools.
*   Models, languages, verification techniques and tools for interacting smart contracts and (blockchain-based) decentralised applications.
*   Languages, methodologies and tools for secure coordination.
*   Cybersecurity aspects of coordinated systems, coordinated approaches to cybersecurity.
*   Nature- and bio-inspired approaches to coordination.
*   Specification, refinement, and analysis of architectures: patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties, including performance and security aspects.
*   Dynamic software architectures: distributed mobile code, configuration, reconfiguration, networked computing, parallel, high-performance and cloud computing.
*   Coordination platforms for infrastructures of emergent new application domains, like IoT, fog- and edge-computing.
*   Programming methodologies, languages, middleware, tools, and environments for the development and verification of coordinated applications, including DevOps approaches.
*   Coordination in business process management: coordination models for business process management, process mining techniques and tools for coordination models.
*   Industrial relevance of coordination and software architectures: programming in the large, domain-specific software architectures and coordination models, industry-driven efforts in coordination and case studies.
*   Interdisciplinary aspects of coordination.

## Submission Categories

*   **Regular papers** (12-18 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing thorough and complete research results and experience reports. Regular papers may be combined with an artefact submission. Companion artefacts to regular submissions will be reviewed by the Artefact Evaluation Committee, but the acceptance of the paper is decoupled from the acceptance of the artefact (does not depend on it). The acceptance of the artefact, however, is conditional to the acceptance of the paper.
*   **Survey papers** (16-25 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing important results and success stories related to the topics of COORDINATION.
*   **Tool papers** (4-15 pages, not counting references and appendices): describing technological artefacts in the scope of the research topics of COORDINATION. Tool papers should provide a clear account of the tool’s functionality, discuss the tool’s practical capabilities possibly with reference to the type and size of problems it can handle, and, when applicable, report on realistic case studies (possibly providing a rigorous experimental evaluation). Tool papers may also provide an account of the theoretical foundations, including relevant citations, and present design and implementation concerns, possibly including software architecture and core data structures. Papers that present extensions to existing tools should clearly describe the improvements or extensions with respect to previously published versions of the tool, possibly providing data on enhancements in terms of resources and capabilities. In addition, the tool artefact must be submitted separately for evaluation. Acceptance of the tool artefact is mandatory for tool papers to be accepted. The artefact will be evaluated by a dedicated committee. Papers may contain a link to a publicly downloadable MPEG-4 demo video of at most 10 minutes length.

## Artefact Submission Instructions

We invite you to also submit an associated artefact for evaluation (AE). Artefacts such as ancillary data, tools, and software will be assessed for availability, functionality, and reusability badges.

*   Instructions on how to upload artefacts can be found [here](https://www.discotec.org/2025/COORDINATION_Artefact_Evaluation_Guidelines.pdf).
*   Artefact submissions are mandatory for tool papers and optional for regular papers. Tool papers must submit an artefact that, at least, satisfies the requirements for the **Functional badge**. Papers not meeting this clause are rejected. Moreover, the acceptance of artefacts is conditional on the tool paper being accepted.
*   A selection of artefacts may be invited for submission to a special issue of Science of Computer Programming (SCP).

The 22nd International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research (CPAIOR 2025) will be held in **Melbourne, Australia**, from **November 10 to November 13, 2025**. The conference will be co-located with [ICAPS 2025](https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/) and [KR 2025](https://kr.org/KR2025/).

## Aim of the Conference

The aim of CPAIOR is to bring together researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Operations Research (OR) to present new techniques, applications, and theoretical & practical insights from a wide array of problems, fostering opportunities for experts in one area to learn about techniques from the others. Papers and presentations that actively combine, integrate, or contrast approaches from more than one of the areas are especially welcomed. High-quality papers from a single area, as well as applications showcasing CP/AI/OR on challenging practical problems, are also a focus.

## Topics of Interest

The program committee invites submissions that include, but are far from limited to, the following topics:

*   New methodologies in the interface between predictive and prescriptive pipelines, such as machine learning techniques applied to tackle optimization problems and, conversely, CP/OR techniques to address AI and machine learning tasks.
*   Novel relaxation and inference methods based on constraint propagation, polyhedral techniques/cutting planes, convex/second-order conic optimization, graph-based algorithms, dynamic programming, and decision diagrams for optimization.
*   New search perspectives involving enumeration/branch-and-bound strategies, innovative decomposition techniques (e.g., based on column generation/Benders), intelligent backtracking, incomplete search, and learning-based heuristics.
*   Advanced integrated methods that expose new model transformations, communication strategies across MIP/CP/SAT solvers, distributed solution techniques, and solver selection (e.g., portfolio approaches).
*   Innovative models and applications of CP/AI/OR techniques.
*   Implementation or evaluation of CP/AI/OR techniques and optimization systems.

## Submission Types

Submissions are of two types:

1.  **Regular Papers:** Submitted for publication and presentation.
    *   **Long papers:** At most 15 pages plus references.
    *   **Short papers:** At most 8 pages plus references.
    *   Both types undergo rigorous review, are subject to the same criteria of quality, and are eligible for the distinguished paper or student paper award.
    *   Short papers are particularly encouraged for interesting and novel work in progress.
2.  **Extended Abstracts:** Submitted for presentation only, and will not be formally published in the LNCS conference volume. A collection of accepted extended abstracts will be published on the conference website.
    *   Length: One or two pages.
    *   May present preliminary work or work already published in other outlets.

## Submission Process & Guidelines

*   **Review Process:** Single-blind review (author names are visible to reviewers, but reviewer names are hidden from authors).
*   **Format:** Prepare papers in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) format.
*   **Submission Platform:** Use [OpenReview.net](https://openreview.net/group?id=cpaior.org/CPAIOR/2025/Conference) for submissions.
*   **Originality:** Papers submitted to CPAIOR must not be under review at a different venue at the same time during the reviewing period. Abstracts can be submitted if the paper is still under review elsewhere, but the paper must be withdrawn from CPAIOR or the other venue by the full paper submission deadline.

## Ethics

> We expect authors to carefully consider and address the potential harms associated with carrying out the research, as well as the potential negative consequences that could stem from publishing their work. Failure to do so will result in summary rejection of a submission regardless of its quality and scientific value.
>
> Authors are expected to document how they have addressed and mitigated the risks, including considering the impact of their research on deployed systems, understanding costs and risks, safely collecting data, and following responsible disclosure. If the submitted research has the potential to cause harm, the paper should include a clear statement about why the benefit of the research outweighs the harms, and how the authors have taken measures to ensure safety and minimize harms.
>
> If the submitted research has potential to cause harm and authors have access to an Institutional Review Board (IRB), we expect that this IRB is consulted and its approval and recommendations are documented in the paper. IRB approval does not absolve researchers from considering ethical aspects of their work.
>
> We encourage authors to consult with existing documentation, e.g., ""Common Pitfalls in Writing about Security and Privacy Human Subjects Experiments, and How to Avoid Them"" or the Menlo Report and existing Safety consultation entities, e.g., the [Tor Safety Research Board](https://research.torproject.org/safetyboard/).

## Decisions and Revisions

*   The outcome of the review process can be accept, reject, or major revision.
*   Papers with a ""major revision"" decision must be re-submitted within the following two cycles, accompanied by a writeup explaining how the revision meets reviewers’ requirements. These papers may use 16 pages.
*   Rejected papers can be re-submitted at any time. If re-submitted within 11 months of the last deadline, previous reviews and an explanation must be submitted as supplementary material.

## Paper Submission Guidelines

*   **Language:** All paper submissions must be in **English**.
*   **Review Process:** All papers will undergo a **double-blind review** process by the Program Committee based on technical quality, relevance to DASFAA, originality, significance, and clarity.
*   **Electronic Submission:** All paper submissions will be handled electronically through the paper submission system: [https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DASFAA2025/Submission/Index](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DASFAA2025/Submission/Index).
    *   Please select the appropriate track during your submission.
*   **Formatting Requirements:**
    *   Submissions must include an abstract of up to **200 words**.
    *   Papers should be no longer than **16 pages** (including references, appendices, etc.) in **LNCS (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) format**.
    *   Accepted short research papers should be revised to a maximum of **10 pages** in the camera-ready version.
    *   Please use one of the following templates for the LNCS format: [https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).
    *   Any submitted paper violating the length, file type, or formatting requirements will be rejected without review.
*   **Originality:** Submitted papers must not have been previously published in a refereed journal or conference and must not be under consideration by any other conference or journal during the DASFAA review process.
*   **Citation:** Authors are encouraged to cite related work comprehensively. When citing conference papers, please also consider citing their extended journal versions if applicable.
*   **Presentation Requirement:** If a paper is accepted, at least one author must complete the **regular registration** and attend the conference to present the paper. Papers from no-show authors will not be included in the proceedings.
*   **Publication:** Accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings.

## Double-Blind Review Policy

DASFAA-2025 will employ a double-blind reviewing process, meaning that the PC members and referees will not know the identity of the authors.

To ensure anonymity, authors **must** prepare their manuscript as follows:

*   **Author Information:** Author's names and affiliations must not appear on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.
*   **Funding Sources:** Funding sources must not be acknowledged on the title page or elsewhere in the paper.
*   **Acknowledgments:** Research group members, or other colleagues or collaborators, must not be acknowledged anywhere in the paper.
*   **File Naming:** Source file naming must be done with care to avoid identifying the author's names in the paper's associated metadata (e.g., avoid `Jane-Smith.pdf`).
*   **Self-Citations:** Authors should refer to their prior work in the third person and include all relevant citations. Authors should make every effort to anonymize their work and, hence, **cannot cite their own arXiv work** (or other unrefereed pre-prints).
*   **Pre-prints:** Submissions having unrefereed pre-prints such as arXiv are allowed, but self-citation of such pre-prints is forbidden for anonymization.

> Submissions that do not follow the guidelines mentioned above, or otherwise potentially reveal the identity of the authors, are subject to immediate rejection.

> Because of the double-blind review policy, the submission of an extended version of a short paper that has been published elsewhere is **strongly discouraged** in DASFAA-2025.

## Conflicts of Interest (COI)

Authors are required to use CMT's conflict management system to flag conflicts with members of the Program Committee (reviewers, meta-reviewers, and PC chairs) prior to the submission deadline.

**A conflict of interest exists if any of the following applies to X (an author) and Y (a PC member):**

*   **Employment:** X and Y have worked in the same university or company in the past two years, or will be doing so in the next six months on account of an accepted job offer. (Different campuses within the same university system do not count as the same university for this purpose).
*   **Co-authorship:** X has been a co-author of a paper with Y in the last three years.
*   **Collaboration:** X has been a collaborator within the past two years, as evidenced in a joint publication, joint research project, or co-organizing events (e.g., co-chairs of conferences), or are collaborating now (including co-authorship on papers not yet resulted in final publication).
*   **Advisor/Advisee:** X is the master's/PhD thesis advisor of Y or vice versa, irrespective of how long ago this was.
*   **Personal Relationship:** X is a relative or close personal friend of Y.

> It is the full responsibility of all authors of a paper to identify and declare all COIs with members of the Program Committee prior to the submission deadline. Submissions with undeclared conflicts or spurious conflicts will be desk-rejected.

## Paper Acceptance

A paper can be accepted as either a **full research paper** or a **short research paper**.

*   **Full Research Papers:** Authors are given the opportunity to present their work in oral sessions, and they also have the option to present in poster sessions.
*   **Short Research Papers:** Authors exclusively present their work in poster sessions. Additionally, the accepted short research papers should be revised to a maximum of **10 pages** in the camera-ready version.

## Anti-harassment Policy

EACSL strives to provide a welcoming, safe, and productive environment for all who attend our events, regardless of their personal characteristics. We do not tolerate any form of intimidation, harassment, or disrespectful conduct at our events. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. The event organisers may take further action, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, contact an event organiser immediately.

## Accommodation Notes

⚠️ **Important Warning:** It appears that CSL 2025 authors are receiving emails from reservation@g-travelexperts.com regarding travel to Amsterdam. Please be aware that this is **spam**, and there are no arrangements with this organisation.

Hotel rooms in Amsterdam are scarce due to the CISCO Live 2025 event taking place in the same week as CSL 2025. There are no hotels in the close vicinity of the conference site.

Three possible suggestions for booking a hotel:

1.  Take a hotel in the city center, close to the central railway station. From there, take a train to Amsterdam Science Park railway station (4 times per hour, takes 9 minutes), which is within walking distance of the conference site.
2.  Take a hotel close to Amstel railway station or Muiderpoort railway station, and use bus 40, which stops right in front of the conference site.
3.  Act like the Dutch, and rent a bike.

A good website for public transport information is `ov9292`.
