### Industrial Experience Reports & Case Studies

*   **Page Limit:** 10 pages max, not counting references.
*   **Anonymity:** Not anonymized (single blind review process).

The Computer Algebra in Scientific Computing (CASC) 2025 conference will take place from **November 24 â 28, 2025**, in **Dubai, The United Arab Emirates**.

## Conference Information

The tools of Scientific Computing play an important role in the natural sciences and engineering. Computer Algebra Systems and the underlying algorithms for Symbolic Computation play an increasingly important role within Scientific Computation. The CASC workshop series has been running for over two decades to explore the interaction of these topics, their implementation, and their application.

## Scope

The topics addressed in the workshop cover:

1.  **The theory of symbolic computation and its implementation in computer algebra systems.**
    This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   new methods on exact computation;
    *   symbolic algorithms and their complexity;
    *   automated reasoning in algebra and geometry;
    *   parallel symbolic / symbolic-numeric computation;
    *   symbolic / symbolic-numeric methods for differential, differential-algebraic and difference equations;
    *   symbolic / symbolic-numeric methods for polynomial equations and inequalities;
    *   the embedding of computer algebra technology within different software and hardware environments;

2.  **All other areas of scientific computing in regards to their benefit from or use of computer algebra methods and software.**
    This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   the use of computer algebra in approximate computation;
    *   computer algebra methods in big data analytics;
    *   computer algebra methods for simulation and modeling;

3.  **Applications of the above throughout the natural sciences and engineering.**

We welcome papers on both fundamental research and implementation issues. We also accept survey papers but these MUST BE CLEARLY LABELLED as such in the title.

## Conference Participation Options

We encourage wide participation at the workshop. In light of this, and that the conference scope spans computer science and mathematics (with their different publication traditions), we offer a variety of participation options:

1.  **Participation with an accompanying paper in LNCS:**
    CASC has a long running relationship with the Springer book series Lecture Notes in Computer Science to publish conference proceedings. Work submitted here should contain an original research result. Submissions should be prepared in the LNCS style and not exceed **20 pages**. Survey papers may have up to **25 pages**.
    [List of CASC proceedings published by Springer](https://link.springer.com/conference/casc)

2.  **Participation with abstract only:**
    Participants may opt to submit an extended abstract instead. These should have at least **2 and at most 4 pages** in the LNCS style. They must contain the main results of the talk (without proofs). They will be lightly reviewed and distributed locally at the conference. We see three main audiences for this option:
    *   Those who wish to talk on previously published work (in which case that work should be clearly cited in the abstract).
    *   Those whose work is not yet ready for publication, but wish to receive feedback.
    *   Those who plan to submit a journal paper on the work shortly.

## Accompanying Topical Collection of Mathematics in Computer Science

CASC has formed a relationship with the Springer BirkhÃ¤user journal Mathematics in Computer Science (MCS) for an ongoing series of topical collections on topics presented at CASC workshops. Work submitted here must be of journal quality and will be reviewed to the usual standards of MCS. Submission will be opened after the conference for authors of extended abstracts presented at that years conference. There is no a priori page limit, but the length must be justified by the contents of the paper. At notification authors may be asked to revise their paper for a secondary deadline.

## Submission Link

All submissions should be done via EasyChair:

**SUBMIT:** [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=casc2025](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=casc2025)

In the EasyChair title field please prefix the paper title in the EasyChair metadata with either **LNCS** or **EA** to indicate which of the participation options is being used.

The 32nd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS) seeks submissions presenting novel contributions related to all real-world aspects of computer security and privacy.

CCS has **two review cycles** in 2025.

## Review Decisions

*   **Accept:** Papers will be accepted for publication and presentation, possibly after minor changes overseen by a shepherd.
*   **Minor revision:** Promising papers needing minor work (e.g., experiments, proofs) may be resubmitted with revisions for re-evaluation.
*   **Reject:** Papers declined for inclusion. Papers rejected from the first cycle may not be submitted to the second cycle.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper in-person, if possible.

## Paper Submission Information

*   Submissions must be received by 11:59 PM AoE (UTC-12) on the day of the corresponding deadline.
*   Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with papers published or accepted elsewhere, or currently under submission to another journal or conference.
*   All submissions must be properly **anonymized**. Avoid revealing authors' identities and cite previous work by yourself in the third person, or blind the reference itself. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   Authors may submit up to a maximum of 7 papers for Cycle B.
*   Papers will be evaluated based on their importance to practical aspects of computer and communications security and privacy, novelty, quality of execution, and presentation.
*   For papers raising ethical concerns, authors must convince reviewers that proper procedures have been followed.
*   Submissions may be rejected for being out of scope.
*   No modifications to the author list are allowed after submission.

## Mandatory Reviewing

Authors submitting 3 or more papers may be required to review other papers. Failure to provide requested information may lead to desk rejection.

## Withdrawing Policy

A paper can be withdrawn at any point before reviews are sent to authors. After reviews are sent, withdrawal is not permitted.

## Paper Format

*   Submissions must be a **PDF file** in double-column ACM format using the ""sigconf"" style.
*   Maximum length: **12 pages**, excluding bibliography, appendices, and supplementary material.
*   Reviewers are not required to read appendices or supplementary material.
*   Do not change the font or margins of the ACM format.

*   Submissions not following the required format may be rejected without review.

## Providing Artifacts at Submission Time

Submissions claiming contributions based on artifacts (code, models, data sets) should make them accessible to reviewers unless there are valid reasons not to. An anonymous web link is acceptable if the contents are also anonymized.

## Optional Artifact Evaluation (AE)

Authors of accepted papers are encouraged to submit artifacts for AE. A separate call for artifacts will follow.
