      "callForPaper": "# MSR 2025: Call for Papers\n\nThe Mining Software Repositories (MSR) conference is the premier venue for software analytics research, according to which software engineering data is analyzed using a mixture of data science, machine learning/artificial intelligence, and qualitative methodologies. The goal of the conference is to improve software engineering practices by uncovering interesting and actionable information about software systems and projects.\n\nThe 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories will be held on **April 28-29, 2025, in Ottawa, Canada**.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nWe invite both full (maximum ten pages, plus two additional pages of references) as well as short (four pages, plus references) papers to the Research Track. Full papers are expected to describe new techniques and/or novel research results, to have a high degree of technical rigor, and to be evaluated scientifically. Short papers are expected to discuss controversial issues in the field or present interesting or thought-provoking ideas that are not yet fully developed. Submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:\n\n*   **Soundness:** How well the paper’s contributions address the research questions posed and are backed by a thorough application of relevant research procedures.\n*   **Relevance:** The extent to which the paper successfully argues or illustrates that its contributions help bridge a significant knowledge gap or tackle a crucial practical issue within the field of software engineering.\n*   **Novelty:** How original the paper’s contributions are in comparison to existing knowledge or how significantly they contribute to the current body of knowledge. Note that this doesn’t discourage well-motivated replication studies.\n*   **Presentation:** How well-structured and clear the paper’s argumentation is, how clearly the contributions are articulated, the legibility of figures and tables, and the adequacy of English language usage. All papers should comply with the formatting instructions provided.\n*   **Replicability:** The extent to which the paper’s claims can be independently verified through available replication packages and/or sufficient information included in the paper to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how a proposed technique works.\n\n## Junior PC\n\nMSR 2025 will once again integrate junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!\n\nThe main goal is to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members.\n\n## Submission Process\n\nSubmissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template. Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the [submission site](https://msr2025-technical.hotcrp.com/) by the submission deadline. However, we encourage authors to submit at least the paper abstract and author details well in advance of the deadline, to leave enough time to properly enter conflicts of interest for anonymous reviewing.\n\n*   All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version. The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance).\n*   Submissions must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions.\n*   By submitting to MSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ.\n*   Papers submitted to MSR 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2025. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases.\n*   By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including [ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).\n*   Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID.\n*   The MSR 2025 Technical Track will employ a double-anonymous review process.\n*   By submitting to MSR 2025, authors acknowledge that they conform to the [authorship policy of the ACM](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship), and [the authorship policy of the IEEE](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/definition-of-authorship/).\n*   Submissions should also include a supporting statement on the data availability, per the Open Science policy below.\n*   Authors will have a chance to see the reviews and respond to reviewer comments before any decision about the submission is made.\n\n## Open Science Policy\n\nThe MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. We expect all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility, replicability, and/or recoverability of the studies, provided that there are no ethical, legal, technical, economic, or sensible barriers preventing the disclosure.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Deadline:** November 6, 2024 AoE\n*   **Paper Deadline:** November 9, 2024 AoE\n*   **Author Response Period:** December 12–15, 2024 AoE\n*   **Author Notification:** January 12, 2025 AoE\n*   **Camera Ready Deadline:** February 5, 2025 AoE",
