A small number of submissions will be invited to present a “lightning” talk at SIGCOMM’25 and a shorter version of the submission which will be included in the conference proceedings (up to two pages excluding references and appendices).

## New this year: One-shot Revision

A small number of submissions may be invited to a one-shot revision. This includes a summary of the paper's merits and a list of necessary changes that are required for the paper to be accepted at SIGCOMM. Authors will be given a deadline (approximately 1.5 months after the revision request is issued) to submit a version of their work addressing all revision instructions.

## Ethics and Policy

All papers must include, in the main body of the paper, a statement or subsection about ethical issues raised by the work. Papers that do not include an ethics statement may be rejected.

## Artifact Evaluation for Accepted Papers

The authors of accepted SIGCOMM 2025 papers will be invited to submit supporting materials to the Artifact Evaluation process. Participation in Artifact Evaluation is voluntary and has no influence on paper acceptance, but it is strongly encouraged.
