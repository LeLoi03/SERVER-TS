The goal of the conference is to improve software engineering practices by uncovering interesting and actionable information about software systems and projects.\n\nThe 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories will be held on **April 28-29, 2025, in Ottawa, Canada**.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\nWe invite both full (maximum ten pages, plus two additional pages of references) as well as short (four pages, plus references) papers to the Research Track. Full papers are expected to describe new techniques and/or novel research results, to have a high degree of technical rigor, and to be evaluated scientifically. Short papers are expected to discuss controversial issues in the field or present interesting or thought-provoking ideas that are not yet fully developed. Submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:\n\n*   **Soundness:** How well the paper’s contributions address the research questions posed and are backed by a thorough application of relevant research procedures.\n*   **Relevance:** The extent to which the paper successfully argues or illustrates that its contributions help bridge a significant knowledge gap or tackle a crucial practical issue within the field of software engineering.\n*   **Novelty:** How original the paper’s contributions are in comparison to existing knowledge or how significantly they contribute to the current body of knowledge. Note that this doesn’t discourage well-motivated replication studies.\n*   **Presentation:** How well-structured and clear the paper’s argumentation is, how clearly the contributions are articulated, the legibility of figures and tables, and the adequacy of English language usage. All papers should comply with the formatting instructions provided.\n*   **Replicability:** The extent to which the paper’s claims can be independently verified through available replication packages and/or sufficient information included in the paper to understand how data was obtained, analyzed, and interpreted, or how a proposed technique works.\n\n## Junior PC\n\nMSR 2025 will once again integrate junior reviewers into the Technical track program committee!\n\nThe main goal is to train the next generation of MSR (and, more broadly, SE) reviewers and program committee members.\n\n## Submission Process\n\nSubmissions must conform to the IEEE conference proceedings template. Submissions to the Technical Track can be made via the [submission site](https://msr2025-technical.hotcrp.com/) by the submission deadline. However, we encourage authors to submit at least the paper abstract and author details well in advance of the deadline, to leave enough time to properly enter conflicts of interest for anonymous reviewing.\n\n*   All submissions must not exceed 10 pages for the main text, inclusive of all figures, tables, appendices, etc. Two more pages containing only references are permitted. All submissions must be in PDF. Accepted papers will be allowed one extra page for the main text of the camera-ready version. The page limit is strict, and it will not be possible to purchase additional pages at any point in the process (including after acceptance).\n*   Submissions must strictly conform to the IEEE conference proceedings formatting instructions.\n*   By submitting to MSR, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the IEEE Plagiarism FAQ.\n*   Papers submitted to MSR 2025 must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere whilst under consideration for MSR 2025. Contravention of this concurrent submission policy will be deemed a serious breach of scientific ethics, and appropriate action will be taken in all such cases.\n*   By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including [ACM’s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).\n*   Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID.\n*   The MSR 2025 Technical Track will employ a double-anonymous review process.\n*   By submitting to MSR 2025, authors acknowledge that they conform to the [authorship policy of the ACM](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/new-acm-policy-on-authorship), and [the authorship policy of the IEEE](https://journals.ieeeauthorcenter.ieee.org/become-an-ieee-journal-author/publishing-ethics/definition-of-authorship/).\n*   Submissions should also include a supporting statement on the data availability, per the Open Science policy below.\n*   Authors will have a chance to see the reviews and respond to reviewer comments before any decision about the submission is made.\n\n## Open Science Policy\n\nThe MSR conference actively supports the adoption of open science principles. We expect all contributing authors to disclose (anonymized and curated) data to increase reproducibility, replicability, and/or recoverability of the studies, provided that there are no ethical, legal, technical, economic, or sensible barriers preventing the disclosure.\n\n## Important Dates\n\n*   **Abstract Deadline:** November 6, 2024 AoE\n*   **Paper Deadline:** November 9, 2024 AoE\n*   **Author Response Period:** December 12–15, 2024 AoE\n*   **Author Notification:** January 12, 2025 AoE\n*   **Camera Ready Deadline:** February 5, 2025 AoE",

The conference will be co-located with [ICAPS 2025](https://icaps25.icaps-conference.org/home/).\n\n## Conference Aim\n\nThe aim of the conference is to promote a space where researchers from Constraint Programming (CP), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Operations Research (OR) present innovative techniques, new applications, and original cutting-edge ideas, thereby encouraging researchers from one area to learn from the others. Of particular interest are papers that integrate concepts and methodologies from these different fields, either proposing interesting new techniques for complex/practical problems or expanding our theoretical insights and cross-field understanding. High-quality original papers from a single area are welcome when also relevant to the other communities involved. The conference also strongly encourages regular papers or experience reports showcasing CP/AI/OR techniques on challenging real-world applications.\n\n## Topics of Interest\n\nThe program committee invites submissions that include, but are far from limited to, the following topics:\n\n*   New methodologies in the interface between predictive and prescriptive pipelines\n*   Novel relaxation and inference methods\n*   New search perspectives\n*   Advanced integrated methods\n*   Innovative models and applications of CP/AI/OR techniques\n*   Implementation or evaluation of CP/AI/OR techniques and optimization systems\n\n## Submission Types\n\nSubmissions are of two types:\n\n*   Regular papers (submitted for publication and presentation)\n*   Extended abstracts (submitted for presentation only)\n\n## Instructions for Regular Papers\n\nRegular papers present original unpublished work and can be of two types:\n\n*   Long papers (at most 15 pages plus references)\n*   Short papers (at most 8 pages plus references)\n\nBoth long and short papers will undergo rigorous review and are subject to the same criteria of quality. Both types are also eligible for the distinguished paper or student paper award. Short papers are particularly encouraged for interesting and novel work in progress, for which the practical or theoretical relevance is not yet fully identified.\n\nSubmissions to CPAIOR are single blind. The conference proceedings will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. All regular papers should be prepared in the format used for that series (LNCS instructions).\n\n## Submission Schedule for Regular Papers\n\n*   **Abstracts:** December 8, 2024 (AoE: anywhere on Earth)\n*   **Full papers:** December 15, 2024 (AoE, no extension possible)\n*   **Rebuttal Phase:** January 26-29, 2025 (AoE)\n*   **Notification:** February 10, 2025\n*   **Camera ready:** TBA\n\n## Instructions for Extended Abstracts\n\nExtended abstracts should be one or two pages in length and may present preliminary work or work already published in other outlets. The extended abstracts are submitted for presentation only (if accepted), and will not be formally published in the LNCS conference volume. A collection of the accepted extended abstracts will be published on the conference website.\n\n## Submission Schedule for Extended Abstracts\n\n*   **Abstract:** August 2025 (TBA)\n*   **Notification:** September 2025 (TBA)\n\n## Submission Process\n\nWe will use OpenReview.net to manage the reviewing process. Please use the following link to submit your papers:\n\n[https://openreview.net/group?id=cpaior.org/CPAIOR/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=cpaior.org/CPAIOR/2025/Conference)\n\n## Contact\n\nFor any queries on the submission process, please contact the Program Chair Guido Tack at [cpaior2025@gmail.com](mailto:cpaior2025@gmail.com).",
