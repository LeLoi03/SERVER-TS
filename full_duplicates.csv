The 11th IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P) will be held in **Lisbon, Portugal, from July 6 - 10, 2026**.

Since 1980, the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy has been the premier forum for presenting developments in computer security and electronic privacy, and for bringing together researchers and practitioners in the field. Following this story of success, IEEE initiated the European Symposium on Security and Privacy (EuroS&P), which is organized every year in a European city.

The IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy (Euro S&P) is a premier forum for computer security and privacy research, presenting the latest developments and bringing together researchers and practitioners.

## Scope

We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in security or privacy, as well as Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers that systematize previous results. EuroS&P is interested in all aspects of applied computer security and privacy. We especially encourage papers that are far-reaching and risky, provided those papers show sufficient promise for creating interesting discussions and usefully questioning widely-held beliefs. Papers without a clear connection to security or privacy will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.

## Conference Expectations and Review Process

*   **Single-Track:** While historically single-track, the conference may adjust based on submission volume.
*   **Rigorous Review:** Aiming for a rigorous and thorough review process, accepting papers with scientific merit.
*   **Revision Option:** Papers with a potential path for acceptance after revision may be invited for revision within four weeks of notification. Revised papers will be re-reviewed.
*   **Per-Reviewer Responses (New in 2025):** Reviewers will provide specific questions for authors to focus on in their responses, improving communication and timely feedback.
*   **Meta Reviews (Returning from 2024):** Publicly available meta reviews will outline PC reasons for acceptance and identified limitations.

## Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) Papers

We solicit SoK papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge. Suitable papers provide new viewpoints, challenge beliefs with evidence, or present convincing taxonomies. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate. SoK papers should be prefixed with ""SoK:"" in the title and will be reviewed to the same standards as traditional research papers, with emphasis on community value.

## Paper Awards

Outstanding papers will be selected by the program committee and announced at the symposium.

## Important Dates

All deadlines are Anywhere on Earth (AoE = UTC-12h).

### Research Papers

*   **Registration deadline (incl. topics and abstracts):** 21 October 2024 (Monday)
*   **Submission deadline:** 24 October 2024 (Thursday)
*   **Early rejection notification:** 11 December 2024 (Wednesday)
*   **R1 Rebuttal period:** 12 December - 16 December 2024 (Monday)

*   **Revision Decisions:** 3 April 2025 (Thursday)
*   **Camera-ready deadline:** tentatively: 17 April 2025 (Thursday)

### Conference

*   **Venice, Italy:** 30 June - 4 July 2025

## Proactive Prevention of Harm

Authors must carefully consider and address potential harms associated with their research and its publication. Failure to adequately discuss such harms may result in rejection. This includes documenting how risks were addressed and mitigated, considering impacts on deployed systems, data collection safety, and responsible disclosure practices. Papers should include a clear statement on how the research benefit outweighs potential harms and the safety measures taken.

If IRB consultation is available, it is expected to be appropriately consulted and documented. IRB approval does not absolve researchers from considering ethical aspects or guarantee PC acceptance.

Consult resources like ""Common Pitfalls in Writing about Security and Privacy Human Subjects Experiments"" and the ""Menlo Report"" for guidance.

## Open Science Expectations

Researchers are expected to maximize the scientific and community value of their work by making it as open as possible. By default, all reproducible materials (code, data) must be released under an open source license. Exceptions apply for malware, protected human subject data, or proprietary data. All submissions must include a clear Data Availability statement explaining sharing plans or reasons for not sharing. Papers failing to meet commitments may be removed from the conference.

## Plagiarism and Duplicate Submission

All submissions must be original work. Plagiarism (of others or self) will be grounds for rejection. Overlap with previously published or simultaneously submitted papers must be clearly documented. Simultaneous submission of the same or substantially similar paper to another venue is not allowed and will be grounds for automatic rejection.

## Anonymous Submission

*   Papers must be submitted anonymously: no author names or affiliations on the title page, and authors must avoid revealing their identity in the text.
*   Refer to your previous work in the third person.
*   Blind references only if a third-person reference is infeasible.
*   Use anonymous services for hosting code/data (e.g., Anonymous Github, not Github or Google Drive).
*   Contact PC chairs with any questions. Papers not properly anonymized may be rejected without review.
*   Authors may post preprints to archives like arXiv.
*   Papers blatantly violating anonymity may be rejected by the Program Chairs.

## Reviews from Prior Submissions

Authors may optionally submit a separate, anonymized document of prior reviews (from another conference) along with a description of how those reviews were addressed. This supplementary material is visible to reviewers only after they submit their own initial review.

## Page Limit and Formatting

*   **Page Limit:** Maximum 13 pages of body text. Unlimited additional pages for references and appendices. Data Availability statement is part of the appendix.
*   **Formatting:** Must use LaTeX in A4 format with the provided `eurosp-template.zip`. Do not use other IEEE templates.
*   **Format:** Submissions must be in Portable Document Format (.pdf).
*   **Rendering:** Ensure documents render correctly in Adobe Reader XI and when printed in black and white. Unusual fonts, images, or figures may cause issues.
*   Failure to adhere to page limit and formatting requirements can lead to rejection without review.

## Conference Submission Server

Papers must be submitted at [https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org](https://hotcrp.eurosp2025.ieee-security.org) and can be updated until the deadline.

## Publication and Presentation

Authors are responsible for publication clearances. At least one author of an accepted paper must present at the conference. In-person attendance is expected. If travel is impossible, at least one author must register, but the presentation may be skipped or replaced by a linked video presentation if a replacement presenter cannot be found.",
